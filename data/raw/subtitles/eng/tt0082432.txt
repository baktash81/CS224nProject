1
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,674
Deeper.

2
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,549
Come on, deeper, deeper.

3
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,631
Come on, deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.

4
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:24,256
From here, boy, here!

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,150
That's it.

6
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,424
Now, loosen up.

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,632
Come on, loosen up.

8
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,841
Come on, boy, loosen 'em up.

9
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:43,733
That's it. Now, on the spot.
One, two! One, two! One, two!

10
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,192
- What are your legs?
- Springs. Steel springs.

11
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,942
- What are they going to do?
- Hurl me down the track.

12
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,483
- How fast can you run?
- As fast as a leopard.

13
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,983
- How fast will you run?
- As fast as a leopard.

14
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,008
Then let's see you do it.

15
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,300
Are you ready, leopard?

16
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,389
On your mark!

17
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,470
Get set!

18
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,391
Come on, boy.

19
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,059
Come on, boy.

20
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:53,967
- How'd it feel?
- All right.

21
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,556
Nine and five-eighths.

22
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,102
Whoa!

23
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,236
Rusty, you useless mutt!

24
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:26,403
Get after him, Perce. Where did you learn
to ride? On a rocking horse?

25
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,778
Les! Go and open the gate.

26
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:31,820
- Black can do that.
- I want you to do it.

27
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,935
- When I'm ready.
- Now!

28
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,612
Les, don't split 'em!

29
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,154
Bastard.

30
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,475
Billy, Zac, bring up the tail!

31
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,303
Get 'em up, get 'em up!

32
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,893
Whoo!

33
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:03,780
Whoo!

34
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,559
Ha! Hey! A wash, lovely, lovely.

35
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:13,322
Come on! Leave me alone, will ya?

36
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,905
Hey, Archy, him wash.

37
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,322
Prefer the company
of blacks, hey, Archy?

38
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,927
- Zac's my mate.
- We run together.

39
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,905
You fancy yourself as a runner, eh?

40
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,947
He's more than a runner.
He's top bloody athlete.

41
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,197
Girls run.

42
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,905
Men box.

43
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:33,905
Lay off him, Les.

44
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,198
He can run faster than you can ride!

45
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:40,771
Jeez! Is that a fact?

46
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:43,906
I'll beat you to the home gate.

47
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:46,281
Me on horseback, you on foot?!

48
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:49,598
I'll go cross-country,
you take the track.

49
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:53,489
That's a fair bet.
That track's five miles further.

50
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,182
Yeah, have a go, Les.

51
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,221
Ha! Ha, OK! You're on!

52
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,563
Barefoot.

53
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,848
You're on.

54
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:19,407
Ha, ha, ha!
Make your bets, boys. Whoo!

55
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,282
Steady. Whoo-hoo!

56
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,392
Bareback. Barefoot-bareback!

57
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:28,990
Les is gonna ride bareback.
That's a joke.

58
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,907
- You wanna lay money?
- Five bob on Les.

59
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,657
- You cover that, Archy?
- He just said he'd cover it.

60
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:38,449
- Two to one, right?
- I'm in for five bob.

61
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,658
Don't go on the rocks.

62
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:43,366
Don't go to the rocks,
go to the mountain.

63
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,283
My money's on Les.

64
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:49,228
- There's my dough.
- Got a good bet there.

65
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,908
Let's go, boys. You right, Archy?

66
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:54,491
Line 'em up.

67
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,408
Don't go on the rocks.

68
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,357
On your marks... get set.

69
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,533
Go!

70
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,225
Go, mare!

71
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,100
Ho! Pick it up! Ha!

72
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,265
Come on!

73
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,527
You lose, sonny boy! Enjoy the walk!

74
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,392
Yee-hee! Get up! Ha!

75
00:08:57,012 --> 00:09:00,478
Whoa, Abbie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

76
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,105
Whoa, boy.

77
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:20,612
Ha ha! Archy! You win! Archy!

78
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,538
Hooray, Archy! Les fell down!

79
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,288
Archy, Archy, Les...

80
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:31,871
Zac! What happened?

81
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,812
Les fell down! Les fell down!
Archy, my brother, you win!

82
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:47,038
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry, Uncle Jack.

83
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:50,664
You've got the God-given ability
to be amongst our greatest.

84
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:54,414
You could be up there with Lasalles.

85
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,622
- Uncle Jack...
- Greater than him.

86
00:09:56,722 --> 00:10:00,206
And three days before
your first big race, you do this.

87
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,414
- I'll still win.
- Yeah?

88
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,956
Running's not all there is to life.

89
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,774
Come on, kids, scram. Come on.

90
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,081
Peter Trevelyan joined up last week.

91
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,195
No more of that. You're underage.

92
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:27,644
- You ran away when you were younger.
- Not to a war.

93
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:30,540
Been all round the world
by the time you were 18.

94
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,248
- Barbary Coast... Spice Islands.
- I made those stories up.

95
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:37,623
You didn't. Dad said you were
nearly killed several times.

96
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,998
I judged the risks and took my chances.
War's different.

97
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,730
- How's it...
- It's just different.

98
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,873
There's no hope your parents
would let you go,

99
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,191
so what's the point
in talking about it?

100
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,485
I thought you might help me.

101
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:08,124
Careful with the plate, darling.

102
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,398
When's this race?

103
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,999
Saturday.

104
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:16,458
- How long are you going to be gone?
- Just over the weekend.

105
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:20,958
Fine time to go off in town-right
in the middle of the bloody muster.

106
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,459
Don't swear in front
of the girls, Wallace.

107
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,375
Put in your fair share of work
before you go.

108
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,317
Yes, Dad.

109
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:34,542
"The fire was burning furiously
at the end of the branch.

110
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:38,292
"Mowgli struck right and left
and the wolves ran howling

111
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,792
"with the sparks burning their fur.

112
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,917
"At last there were only
Akela, Bagheera,

113
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:48,241
"and perhaps ten wolves
that had taken Mowgli's part.

114
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,709
"Then something began
to hurt Mowgli inside him

115
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:55,793
"as he'd never been hurt
in his life before.

116
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:58,876
"And he caught his breath and sobbed.

117
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:01,565
"And the tears ran down his face.

118
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,241
"'What is it? What is it? ' he said.

119
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:13,543
"'I do not wish to leave the jungle,
and I do not know what this is.

120
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,817
"'Am I dying, Bagheera? '

121
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,148
"'No, little brother,' said Bagheera.

122
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:22,585
"'Those are only tears,
such as men use.

123
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:27,711
"'Now, I know thou art a man
and a man's cub no longer.

124
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:30,316
"'Let them fall, Mowgli.

125
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:33,068
"'They are only tears.'

126
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,752
"So Mowgli sat and cried
as though his heart would break,

127
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:41,733
"and he'd never cried
in all his life before.

128
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:45,068
"'Now... ', he said.

129
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,235
"'I will go to men."'

130
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:53,544
Go on. One more chapter.

131
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:55,961
Children, come on, inside.

132
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,878
Come on, kids.
Don't get Uncle into trouble.

133
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,878
Bedtime. Come on, inside,
out of the wind.

134
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:04,920
In to bed.

135
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,443
Hey! Stop that!

136
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:16,130
"London, 29th April,
the War Office announces...

137
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,755
"'Despite continual opposition,

138
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:23,339
"'our troops have established
themselves across... Galliple..."'

139
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,162
Gallipoli.

140
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:36,131
Listen to this.

141
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:40,756
"The Turkish defences included
wire entanglements on land and sea,

142
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:43,381
"and deep pits with spiked bottoms."

143
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,659
Bastards!

144
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,215
That's it.

145
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:52,370
I'm gonna join up.

146
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,614
Me, too.

147
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,965
What about you, Barney?

148
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,590
No.

149
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,716
Oh, be in it.
The girls go wild over a uniform.

150
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:06,841
Yeah?

151
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:11,049
In your case, I don't think
anything'd help. But you could try.

152
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,424
Hey, we could all join up together.

153
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:17,424
Count me in.
Come on, Frank, you gotta be in it.

154
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:22,007
No thanks, if you blokes
all want to go get yourselves shot,

155
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:23,216
go ahead.

156
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:26,424
Well, I'm not scared to die
for my country, Frank.

157
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:29,091
Good for you, Snowy, sign yourself on.

158
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:33,466
- Nothing's worse than this.
- Can't argue with that.

159
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,874
- Comin' to join, then?
- No. But I won't stay here either.

160
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:53,322
Dunne, Lewis, Wilkes!
Where the hell are you?!

161
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,741
There she is!

162
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,718
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?

163
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:17,593
Don't worry, boss.

164
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,551
You young bastards!

165
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:22,426
I'll have you shot! Do you hear me?

166
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:25,541
You'll never work
for the railways again!

167
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:30,286
It's on top of the cupboard.

168
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,040
Come on, lad.

169
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,135
Coming.

170
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:46,160
Come on.

171
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:54,552
- Give us those shoes, little man.
- Bye, Arch.

172
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:56,135
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

173
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,927
- Goodbye, Mum.
- Hey! It's only two days.

174
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:01,885
Come on, we've got a race to run.

175
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,957
Children!

176
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,885
Good luck, Son.

177
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,677
Bye, Archy. Come back with a medal.

178
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:12,545
Goodbye, Archy.

179
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,918
- Bye, kids.
- Bye!

180
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:22,702
You better win!

181
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,369
It's so beautiful!

182
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,721
Here we go!

183
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:51,429
- Get out of my car.
- Just having a look, boss.

184
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,160
- Go on, get out.
- Yeah, right-o, right-o.

185
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:01,887
...these bottled preserves
of the Ladies' Auxiliary.

186
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,929
All proceeds
to the Belgian Relief Fund.

187
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:08,929
♪ It's a long way to Tipperary

188
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:12,708
♪ It's a long way to go

189
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:17,430

190
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,711

191
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,056
...very exciting one-mile race.

192
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,764
- What about the handicap?
- I can't talk about that now.

193
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:03,973
- This where you enter for the Gift?
- Entries closed a week ago.

194
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,681
I've been outback.

195
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,389
- What's your name?
- Dunne.

196
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,348
- You registered?
- In Perth.

197
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,681
- When did you run your last race?
- Fremantle, about... six months ago.

198
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:16,713
I know you, the stand-up start.

199
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,890
- We got a scratch sheet?
- Give him a go.

200
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,182
- What's the prize money?
- Ten guineas... and the medal.

201
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:29,541
- Anyone take bets?
- No, it's against the law.

202
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,932
- How much was you wanting to lay?
- Twenty quid.

203
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,932
You're pretty confident.

204
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,206
Where's your twenty?

205
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,765
- Archy Hamilton's running.
- Who's he?

206
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:46,932
Fastest kid in West Australia,
if not the country.

207
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,475
- What's he run?
- Under ten.

208
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,957
Wouldn't want to take your money
without fair warning.

209
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:57,248
What's my mark?

210
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:00,582
Same as the local kid.

211
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,171
All right. You're on.

212
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,641
You can still pull out, lad.

213
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:18,975
Lasalles pulled out of the Barlow Cup
and nobody thought the worse of him.

214
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:21,250
Come on.

215
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,249
Push!

216
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:30,559
Now the big event, the one you've all
been waiting for! The Kimberley Gift!

217
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:32,833
There you go, boss.

218
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,142
Announcing a late entry.

219
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:38,184
F.C. Dunne of Perth,
starting off three yards,

220
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:42,129
the same mark as our own champion,
Archy Hamilton.

221
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:46,851
Right, start your breathing.

222
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,726
Come on, Archy, boy!

223
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:51,331
Come on! Deeper, from here!

224
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,791
Now, what are these?

225
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:57,310
- Come on!
- Steel springs.

226
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,060
- Again!
- Steel springs.

227
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,893
- What will they do?
- Hurl me down the track.

228
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,643
- How fast can you run?
- Fast as a leopard.

229
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,810
- How fast are you going to run?
- As fast as a leopard!

230
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,173
Right! Then let's see you do it.

231
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,685
This is the big one, Simmo!

232
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:29,091
Beat all those other people!
You can do it!

233
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,627
Runners! Dig in!

234
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:50,634
Set!

235
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,803
- Come on, champion!
- Go on!

236
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:48,337
Lads for the Light Horse, over here.

237
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:53,631
Come on, don't let your mates
over there do all the fighting.

238
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:57,188
Bring your beer.

239
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:01,632
If you're fit and you can ride,
get over here and find out how to join.

240
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:08,689
The Empire needs you. Your country
needs you and your mates need you.

241
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,337
So come and find out how to get into
the greatest game of all.

242
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:36,756
- That was bad luck, mate.
- Let's just forget it?

243
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,315
Nine and five-sixteenths,
you've equalled the great Harry Lasalles.

244
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:47,732
- Nothing's going to stop you...
- Jack!

245
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:49,804
I'm not coming home.

246
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,773
No, I didn't think you were, lad.

247
00:23:57,873 --> 00:24:00,047
Your bag weighed a ton.

248
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,806
- What have you got in it?
- Books, mostly.

249
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:07,483
What if they don't take you?
You don't look 21.

250
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,131
They won't ask questions
when they see me ride.

251
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:26,547
We've been through a lot of scrapes
together. Take care of it.

252
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:32,816
Let's get down there before
those other blokes drink the piss!

253
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,234
Come on, Arch!

254
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,508
I'll write.

255
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,466
God bless you, boy.

256
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:52,025
- Twenty-one?
- Yes, sir.

257
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,067
You don't look it.
Got a birth certificate?

258
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:58,150
I didn't know we were supposed
to bring one, sir.

259
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,234
Go on, mount up.

260
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,150
Excuse me, sir.

261
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,735
I know this lad and he's only eighteen.

262
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:07,693
His father would skin him
if he knew he was here.

263
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:13,226
We can turn a blind eye if it's just
six months, but not at 18. Come on.

264
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,776
Come back here! Come back!
Don't be such a bloody fool!

265
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,818
Hey, hey, pull him off!

266
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:25,068
- You show 'em, mate!
- You little beauty!

267
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:28,716
- Go, young Archy!
- Good on you, Arch!

268
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:41,859
Morning.

269
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,510
Three and six?

270
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:53,486
- "After months of hard training..."
- "Training"!

271
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,760
"...Australia's fighting..."

272
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:58,763
- G'day.
- G'day.

273
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:02,777
"...Australia's fighting force
faced it's baptism of fire

274
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:07,551
"on the rocky slopes of... Gallipoli,
and proved themselves heroes."

275
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:29,310
Sorry about yesterday, mate.
You run a great race. Frank Dunne.

276
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:31,403
Archy Hamilton.

277
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:35,487
It gave me a hell of a shock
to be beaten out here.

278
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:38,153
I won everything
there was to win in Perth.

279
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:39,278
I was just lucky.

280
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:44,029
Anyone who runs under nine and a half
with crook feet isn't just lucky.

281
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:47,988
- You joinin' up?
- No, I missed out. I'm underage.

282
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,571
You want something to eat?

283
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,738
You mean, would I like to order.

284
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:55,696
- Are you from the city?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

285
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,196
Well, we don't put on the dog here.

286
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:01,613
- What do you want?
- If that's your attitude, nothing.

287
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:05,758
- Suit yourself.
- He's not finished. Are you, mate?

288
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,489
Thank you.

289
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,386
- You better have something.
- I'm not hungry.

290
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,989
- Don't you want it?
- No.

291
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,891
Well, I can't see good food wasted.

292
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,239
Gonna try again?

293
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:29,739
I can't. They know I'm underage.

294
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,976
Not here, in Perth.

295
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,311
Now!

296
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,687
You bastard!

297
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:09,888
Come on! Come on!

298
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,741
Whoo!

299
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:19,407
- Nearly lost me, mate.
- You sure it's headed for Perth?

300
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:23,553
Course it bloody is.
Nowhere else for it to go.

301
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,602
Hey! Come on, mate, we're here.

302
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:05,099
Perth?

303
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:08,440
Er... No, mate, not quite.

304
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:14,399
Morning.

305
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:17,264
We seem to have... lost our train.

306
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,518
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks! Bugger it!

307
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:31,016
Unless you're game enough
to cross the lake.

308
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:38,730
Hey, Arch, two weeks,
that's not too long...

309
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,618
- Hey, Arch, hang on!
- Better take this.

310
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:47,515
Hey, Archy, will ya... Arch!

311
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:53,119
Archy, we'll fry like eggs out there.
Let's give this a little thought, eh?

312
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,393
You'll never make it!

313
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:59,285
- Archy, wait!
- There's fifty mile o' that!

314
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,943
Oi!

315
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,189
If the snakes don't get you,
the black fellas will!

316
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,983
Wait!

317
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,785
You're mad. We should have waited.

318
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:16,910
It's quicker this way.

319
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,025
That's what Burke and Wills thought!

320
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:24,745
How do you know
we're not going in circles?

321
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:27,019
The sun.

322
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:31,161
- What if we run out of water?
- We find it.

323
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,995
- How do you find it?
- Cockatoos.

324
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,861
Sunset, they lead you straight to it.

325
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,357
Oh, that's lovely! We put our lives
in the hands of a mob of parrots.

326
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,664
What's all this watch business?

327
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,498
When you point twelve o'clock
to the sun,

328
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:04,063
north is halfway
between the hour hand and twelve.

329
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:09,039
- Can you ride, Frank?
- Yeah, why?

330
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:12,581
Just wondered why
you didn't try for the Light Horse.

331
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,164
Didn't want to.

332
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:17,248
- What then, infantry?
- I'm not joining anything.

333
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:21,373
- But you gotta be in it!
- Not if you don't want to.

334
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,647
You gotta be.

335
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:28,312
No, I don't. It's a free country,
or haven't you heard?

336
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,999
I'd be ashamed if I didn't fight.

337
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:35,499
That only proves one thing...
that you and I are different.

338
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,985
Let's drop it, eh?

339
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:43,040
You of all people should be going.

340
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,165
Why me of all people?

341
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,249
Cos you're an athlete.

342
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,832
What's that got to do with it?

343
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,124
I've mates who'd be lucky
to run the hundred in twelve

344
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:56,082
and they're going,
so why shouldn't you?

345
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,415
Because it's not our bloody war!

346
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,708
What do you mean, not our war?

347
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:03,916
It's an English war,
it's nothing to do with us.

348
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:08,027
You know what you are,
you're a bloody coward.

349
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:13,708
There's only one reason
I haven't knocked you down, mate.

350
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:14,938
What?

351
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,083
Cos I don't feel like carrying you.

352
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:24,526
Now shut up and don't open
your yap about the war again!

353
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:19,859
Where's your sun now?

354
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:29,195
Frank!

355
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,235
Stop!

356
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,702
Hey!

357
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,577
Hey!

358
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:09,071
Stop!

359
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:19,529
This would have to be your lucky day.

360
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:24,756
We were told there's a property
due south.

361
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:27,756
Old Dan's place.
You got about ten more miles.

362
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:29,881
He'd give you a ride to Wallaby.

363
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,214
- Where you headed?
- Perth.

364
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:37,006
I nearly went there once. Thought I should
see one big city before I die.

365
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,589
You looking for work?

366
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:41,715
- No, I'm off to the war.
- What war?

367
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,989
The war against Germany.

368
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:46,994
I knew a German once.

369
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,340
- How did it start?
- Don't start him.

370
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,715
Don't know exactly,
but it was the Germans' fault.

371
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:57,965
- The Australians fighting already?
- Yeah, in Turkey.

372
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:00,757
Turkey?! Why's that?

373
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:04,090
- Ask him.
- Cos Turkey's a German ally.

374
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,407
Well, you learn something every day.

375
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,549
Still, can't see
what it's got to do with us.

376
00:37:11,649 --> 00:37:14,913
We don't stop them there,
they could end up here.

377
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,740
And they're welcome to it.

378
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:32,161
We made it, you bastard!

379
00:37:42,274 --> 00:37:43,702
Whoo!

380
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,967
- G'day.
- G'day.

381
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,991
Don't wear out the leather
on them boots, will ya?

382
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:35,385
The truth is there was no choice.

383
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:36,593
Mary.

384
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:40,135
You're very brave
to set off without a compass.

385
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:45,834
Not really. With a watch and the sun
you can find your way anywhere.

386
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:50,344
Why are you boys going to Perth?

387
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:53,661
- I'm going to join the Light Horse.
- Good.

388
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,511
You too, Frank?

389
00:38:55,611 --> 00:38:58,386
No, business interests to attend to.

390
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:02,844
While the Germans are crucifying kittens
on church doors in Belgium.

391
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:06,011
- Yes, yes...
- I love their uniforms.

392
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,302
Most of the boys around here joined.

393
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:11,177
If I'd had a son, he'd have joined too.

394
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:15,011
Let's drink a toast to our brave
young friend. The Light Horse.

395
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:16,677
The Light Horse.

396
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:21,831
- The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.

397
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:39,762
What did you mean
about business interests?

398
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:42,595
Business interests, you know, finance.

399
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:47,553
- You told me you were broke.
- Hell, I am, thanks to you.

400
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:51,096
What would you have done
with the money if you'd won?

401
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:53,582
I was gonna start a bike shop.

402
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:03,263
They only take toffs
and farmers' sons in the Light Horse?

403
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:05,304
You thinking of joining?

404
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,513
Well, there's no way
you'd get me near the infantry.

405
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:11,638
But the Light Horse,
now that's got a bit of class.

406
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:14,291
Whoo-hoo!
We could join together.

407
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:18,054
There's only one problem, mate.

408
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,221
What?

409
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:22,089
You know I told you I could ride...

410
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,704
Come here.

411
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:29,918
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in his shoulder, up.

412
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,680
Knee in his shoulder.

413
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,097
No, no. Foot in the stirrup first.
Swing up.

414
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:36,930
Swing up.

415
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,264
Bloody thing won't stand still.

416
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:40,861
Get on him!

417
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,956
What name?

418
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,391
What do you mean?

419
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,750
What do you want to call yourself?
Can't use your own name.

420
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:44,123
Lasalles.

421
00:41:45,991 --> 00:41:49,042
Archibald... Lasalles.

422
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,624
By the time I'm finished with you,
you'll look the other side of 40.

423
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:13,914
Where Mother Nature fails...
Frank Dunne succeeds.

424
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,767
Oh, no!

425
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,253
- Hang on.
- No, Frank.

426
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:21,183
It looks good.

427
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:24,298
- Oh, no... look...
- Hang on.

428
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,267
- A little glue, some hair.
- Oh, no.

429
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:30,715
- I've done it before, pal.
- Bugger off, Frank.

430
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:33,934
Have another drink.

431
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:38,726
- Whisky doesn't make you look old.
- Doesn't it? Have you seen my dad?

432
00:42:38,826 --> 00:42:42,872
I know he looks like a wreck,
but he's really only 35.

433
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,167
Jesus.

434
00:42:47,993 --> 00:42:49,559
How's he look, Dad?

435
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:53,809
Fine. But what the hell
do you want to join up for?

436
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:58,309
The English killed your grandfather.
Hung him with his own belt...

437
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,810
five miles from Dublin.

438
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,727
I'm not going to fight
for the British Empire.

439
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:05,852
I'm gonna keep my head down.

440
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:10,176
Learn a trick or two, and...
come back an officer.

441
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,299
Maybe.

442
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:16,019
I don't want to be
pushed around forever.

443
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,462
Right.

444
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,004
Right.

445
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,134
Lasalles!

446
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:39,177
Lasalles!

447
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:48,061
Lasalles?

448
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:51,278
Any relation to Harry Lasalles,
the famous runner?

449
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,135
No, sir.

450
00:43:57,786 --> 00:44:00,228
All right, Lasalles, up to the dock.

451
00:44:00,328 --> 00:44:02,503
Thank you, sir.

452
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:07,979
- Dunne.
- Sir.

453
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,771
Any military experience?

454
00:44:09,871 --> 00:44:12,354
Five years
in the Melbourne Horse Cadets.

455
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:14,437
Never heard of them.

456
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:18,133
They never received as much
recognition as they deserved.

457
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:24,178
Thank you, sir.

458
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,594
Come on, move it along.

459
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:34,792
Present arms!

460
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:38,980
OK, Lasalles, you're in.
Report to that group.

461
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,605
Dunne, mount up.

462
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:43,980
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in his shoulder and relax.

463
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,254
Thanks, mate.

464
00:44:47,038 --> 00:44:50,272
Foot in the stirrup,
knee in the shoulder...

465
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:51,730
Thank you.

466
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,671
G'day, pal. I'm your uncle Frank.
Tough but fair, so no nonsense?

467
00:45:03,997 --> 00:45:06,764
Hurry up, Dunne,
or the war will be over.

468
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,481
Ha!

469
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,755
Kick him!

470
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,213
Kick him!

471
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,213
Give him a rocking horse!

472
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:34,300
All right, Dunne.
Thank you very much.

473
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,607
All right, pick up your bags, fellas.

474
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:57,591
Right turn! Quick march!

475
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:12,483
Right! All you blokes
from the Tenth Reinforcements

476
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,930
know you're not supposed
to be in here-out now!

477
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,588
That means you too, Lasalles.

478
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,380
- See you when I see you.
- Yeah.

479
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,925
Not if I see you first.

480
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:55,255
- See you later, mate.
- All the best, Bill.

481
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,975
I wish I was goin' with you.

482
00:47:53,211 --> 00:47:55,385
Look after yourself!

483
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:02,304
Four pairs of socks, plenty of singlets
and Eno's for your stomach.

484
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:04,653
And this...

485
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:07,306
to drink on our anniversary.

486
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:11,223
Please come home.

495
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,614
Now, come on, Jim, you're not stupid!

496
00:49:37,714 --> 00:49:41,239
That was three years ago!
We're in the middle of a drought!

497
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,864
That's my whole point, you stupid galah!

498
00:49:51,965 --> 00:49:55,448
- What are you blokes doing here?
- It's our last night.

499
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:58,990
If you're not going to fight,
at least buy us a beer.

500
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,303
Make it four, Perce!

501
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:15,600
I've got me horse outside, mate.

502
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,148
Next!

503
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:28,491
Arms up.

504
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,158
- Hat off!
- Sorry.

505
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:34,199
Come on, another quarter of an inch.
Come on, come on.

506
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,616
Teeth aren't all that good.

507
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:39,533
You're supposed to shoot the enemy,
not bite him.

508
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:42,647
We don't take anyone with bad teeth.

509
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,972
If you don't pass him,
you've lost all four of us.

510
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:51,015
Over there.

511
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:53,105
Next.

512
00:50:56,384 --> 00:50:57,941
Open.

513
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,104
Atten-tion!

514
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:44,264
Something's gotta be done
about that lofty bastard.

515
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:48,734
- Crikey, they're big.
- Yeah, so's that bloody Victorian.

516
00:51:49,218 --> 00:51:51,618
Hello, Australia, welcome.
Antiques...

517
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:52,701
No, no, no.

518
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:56,285
I reckon it took 100,000 blokes
20 years to build that.

519
00:51:56,385 --> 00:51:59,661
Must've been a lot of blokes around
with crook backs.

520
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:04,786
- It's not just a monument, you know.
- It's a bloody great pile of rubble.

521
00:52:04,886 --> 00:52:06,744
The Pharaoh, mate...

522
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:10,327
his wife and everything
they had were buried in there.

523
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:14,568
Yeah... That's man's first attempt
to beat death.

524
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,077
Thanks, professor, can you get
your mind back on the game?

525
00:52:22,177 --> 00:52:25,369
Let's think about
the West Australians' first attempt

526
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:27,643
to beat the bloody Vics.

527
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:32,561
Something's gotta be done about
that long, thin streak of pelican shit.

528
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:40,267
Yeah, get him, Bill.
Sort the bastard right out.

529
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:13,151
All right, men. You are shortly to be
let loose on the local inhabitants...

530
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:18,022
who, you will be surprised to find,
don't look at all like you.

531
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:22,524
A fact of which they are,
no doubt, eternally grateful.

532
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:27,079
First up, beware of the local eggs,

533
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,413
which can be distinguished
only by their antiquity,

534
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:33,481
the local liquor, which is poisonous,

535
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:39,205
and for those of you contemplating
some horizontal refreshment...

536
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:43,188
Just be warned.

537
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:47,205
Because those proverbial
few moments of pleasure...

538
00:53:47,305 --> 00:53:53,402
are very likely to leave you
with a legacy which is horribly painful...

539
00:53:53,972 --> 00:53:56,872
difficult to cure
and may get you sent home

540
00:53:56,972 --> 00:54:02,497
to face embarrassing questions
from girlfriend and or... wife.

541
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:07,248
However, I know nothing I say
is going to discourage some of you,

542
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:10,665
so I'm going to hand you over
to Doc Morgan

543
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:13,248
who has had it all and cured it all.

544
00:54:14,473 --> 00:54:18,732
He will show you how to minimise
the risk, so pay attention.

545
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:22,020
Company... atten-tion!

546
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,123
Quiet!

547
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:43,777
Hey! Hey, come back here, gippo!
Come back here!

548
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,417
Hey, how much for one mule? How much?

549
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:13,833
- Hang on, how much is he charging?
- Five, that's what he wants.

550
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:15,250
- Nah.
- Four, four.

551
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,792
- Nah, the official price is two.
- No, no, five piasters.

552
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:21,417
- Two.
- Give him a bit more.

553
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:25,657
There is a correct price-we pay more,
we encourage dishonesty.

554
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:31,197
Yah, or we could
join Dickie and the chaps at seven.

555
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:37,042
Do you mind shifting those animals
out of the way?

556
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:39,115
Sorry, sir.

557
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,876
Hey, those four there.
Ten piasters. OK.

558
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:59,084
- The correct price is two piasters.
- It'll be worth it, Snow!

559
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:02,614
Are you going
to the Governor General's ball?

560
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:08,398
I say, Carruthers, there's Dickie
and the chaps up there.

561
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:12,571
I say, good morning, chaps!
How are we?

562
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:15,294
Tally-ho! After the fox.

563
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:19,752
You Australians are crude
and the most ill-mannered soldiers ever.

564
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:21,877
Wait till you see the New Zealanders!

565
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:23,252
Rabble!

566
00:56:23,352 --> 00:56:26,419

00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:46,130
Now, how can they do that, Frank?

578
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:50,463
Life is cheap here, Snow, and the women
have no respect for themselves.

579
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,047
It's the same in most foreign places.

580
00:57:53,147 --> 00:57:54,797
Barney!

581
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,713
Insolent!

582
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:07,693
Have a look at this, fellas.

583
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:10,325
Over a thousand years old.

584
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:15,946
- How much did you pay for it?
- I beat him down to two quid.

585
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:21,839
Bastard! How much did you pay?

586
00:58:21,939 --> 00:58:24,113
Five bob.

587
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:29,673
See, what did I tell you?
These gippoes are a pack of thieves.

588
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,947
Me take picture.

589
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,238
That one, I think.

590
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:43,828
Ready?

591
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,995
Let's go.

592
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:57,882
Oi!

593
00:59:01,065 --> 00:59:03,882
- Shalom, shalom.
- What can I do for you, gentlemen?

594
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:07,049
We Australians
come to your country as guests.

595
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:09,674
You are an old civilisation,
we are a new...

596
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:14,215
Bill, don't give him the geography lesson,
tell him to cough up.

597
00:59:14,315 --> 00:59:18,340
Listen, we are not just soldiers,
we are diplomats for our country.

598
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,008
Give my mate his money
or I'll flatten you.

599
00:59:21,108 --> 00:59:23,966
- No.
- But Frank, they're bloody thieves.

600
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:26,675
They've got a different way
of seeing things.

601
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,591
You see, our problem is
I bought this from another shop

602
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:33,050
and paid five shillings for it.

603
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,216
Whereas my friend, Mr Wilson,
bought this... from you...

604
00:59:37,316 --> 00:59:42,369
which you can see is exactly
the same-and paid two pound,

605
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:46,300
which in my country
would seem to be pretty unfair.

606
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,550
Too right.

607
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,051
So, we were wondering
if you wouldn't mind taking it back

608
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,426
and giving us the two pound.

609
00:59:53,526 --> 00:59:57,051
No, no, no, this is not mine.
This is yours.

610
00:59:57,151 --> 00:59:59,384
If you tried that where we come from,

611
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:03,791
you'd last about as long as
a snowflake in summer, now cough up.

612
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:08,009
- This is not mine!
- I'm gonna get really angry here.

613
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,884
Snow! Now listen, mate.

614
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:12,801
I know how you feel.

615
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,075
But while a sale is a sale...

616
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:20,290
- Now, what I was saying...
- Careful, Frank!

617
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,534
OK, OK, OK!

618
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,409
Take your money and go!

619
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:31,368
You're dealing with Australians here.

620
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,927
Hey, fellas...

621
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:45,302
That wasn't the shop.
This is it, here.

622
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:48,583
Hey, fellas,
it was the wrong shop. Hey!

623
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:01,077
Hey, fellas, this way!

624
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:15,124
We clean, no dirty, we very clean.

625
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:25,244
Come on, come on.

626
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:41,574
Hello, honey bunny,
you want to come with me?

627
01:01:44,529 --> 01:01:45,887
Nah.

628
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,666
I don't believe it. Frank, Frank.

629
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:54,661
I don't believe...

630
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:56,786
Sink your bo peepers on that.

631
01:01:59,113 --> 01:02:01,287
I...

632
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:06,096
I wonder if it'd be too much trouble
to ask... how much?

633
01:02:06,196 --> 01:02:07,555
Twenty piasters.

634
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:11,305
- Cripes, that's only four bob!
- Barney, cut it out!

635
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:15,263
Snow, this is wartime and...
in a month we might be dead.

636
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:18,875
Billy, they're common, they're cheap.

637
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,930
- Relatively.
- Beats antiques, I'm game.

638
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,846
Wait here, Snow,
we'll be back in a few minutes.

639
01:02:24,946 --> 01:02:28,495
Don't give 'em a penny
till it's all over.

640
01:02:29,406 --> 01:02:32,373
You know what? I'm disgusted.

641
01:02:33,156 --> 01:02:36,764
What are you going to say
to your wives on your wedding night?

642
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:41,097
Calm down, you don't win
a medal for finishing third.

643
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,722
Hello, my friend.
Welcome, Australia.

644
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:45,764
Bugger off.

645
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:56,369
Hello, Australia!
Hello, hello! Hello, Australia.

646
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,711
Welcome to my country.

647
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,015
You buy from me, my name is Yosef.

648
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:09,289
Company! Halt!

649
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:11,932
Rest easy.

650
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:15,848
Put that canteen away, that man!

651
01:03:15,948 --> 01:03:18,122
You buy?

652
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,745
All right, let's have some quiet.

653
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:26,581
As you all know...

654
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:33,921
this morning's exercise involves
a frontal assault on an enemy trench,

655
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:39,917
the enemy being some gentlemen
from the Light Horse.

656
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:43,058
Now, these gentlemen,

657
01:03:43,158 --> 01:03:47,832
presumably because their arses
are higher from the ground than ours...

658
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:53,683
tend to assume airs of superiority.

659
01:03:55,574 --> 01:03:58,933
But they won't have their horses
with them today.

660
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:03,183
So I want you to go out there
this morning,

661
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:05,642
and short of actually killing them...

662
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:09,290
show them the stuff
the infantry is made of!

663
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:30,839
Load!

664
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:35,750
Keep calm and keep steady.

665
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:46,000
Aim high!

666
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:48,626
Fire at will!

667
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:51,215
Fire!

668
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:13,256
Yosef! Me, Yosef!

669
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,686
Hello! Hello!

670
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:57,770
- How are you, Frank?
- You bugger!

671
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,770
- What do you men think you're doing?
- We're mates, sir.

672
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:05,544
- This is supposed to be warfare.
- Break this up over here.

673
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,961
Jolly enthusiastic.

674
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,251
Someone's taken my bloody oranges!

675
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,604
Right, survivors, dress the wounded
and carry them back to the A-post.

676
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:44,253
Lie down, Arch, come on.

677
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:49,230
Well, you can't all be bloody wounded!

678
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:53,755
Those of you not designated
to be dead, on your feet now!

679
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:01,834
Beat it, mate, we're dead.
We're dead, mate, piss off!

680
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:05,922
- Three!
- Five piasters.

681
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,940
See you there. Tuesday at seven.
Don't forget!

682
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,214
Bye, boys.

683
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:19,356
Bye!

684
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,023
Hey, you know what your problem is?

685
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:25,190
- What?
- The way you start.

686
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,273
You're wrong, Arch.

687
01:07:27,373 --> 01:07:31,273
No, crouching makes all the difference.
Lasalles proved that.

688
01:07:31,373 --> 01:07:35,273
You're wrong. If you crouch down,
you've got further to go to get up.

689
01:07:35,373 --> 01:07:37,398
Try it.

690
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:39,672
First to the pyramids.

691
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:42,845
OK, you're on.

692
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:44,844
Ready?

693
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:46,649
Set.

694
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:48,010
Go!

695
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:31,632
We... We're both...

696
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,382
We're both mad!

697
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:21,194
Whoo-ee!

698
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,184
No.

699
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:33,610
Maybe if you were brothers.

700
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,277
- But, sir, we...
- I said no.

701
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:42,551
Sir, we're not taking our horses,
so he wouldn't have to ride at all.

702
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:48,652
Now, look. Your own blokes
are going across very soon.

703
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,819
Why do you want a transfer, Dunne?

704
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,403
We're mates, sir.

705
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:55,518
- That's not good enough.
- We train together, sir.

706
01:09:56,586 --> 01:09:58,528
- You runners?
- Yes, sir.

707
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,361
- Sprinters?
- Yes, sir.

708
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:04,111
- What's your best time for the 100?
- We both run under ten.

709
01:10:04,211 --> 01:10:08,684
That's a coincidence.
Young Lasalles runs under ten.

710
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:16,638
Well, a fast pair of legs
is never a drawback in any troop.

711
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:20,477
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.

712
01:10:32,171 --> 01:10:34,345
Buy antique.

713
01:10:37,754 --> 01:10:39,654
Antique?

714
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:42,769
- Antique?
- No, no.

715
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:46,971
Billy.

716
01:10:47,587 --> 01:10:49,761
Morning, ladies.

717
01:10:52,462 --> 01:10:54,637
Ha, ha!

718
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,894
What do you think?

719
01:11:02,547 --> 01:11:04,721
It's all right.

720
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:11,352
- What's the matter with you blokes?
- Nothing.

721
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:14,155
Look, I always wanted
to join the Light Horse.

722
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:16,843
Infantry not good enough
for you... mate?

723
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:26,021
Well, if that's how you're gonna be,
I'll see you when I see you.

724
01:11:33,214 --> 01:11:34,558
Morning, ladies.

725
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:39,739
Come off the boil, Snow.
You know Frank.

726
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:43,448
Sell his grandmother for tuppence...
still talk his way to heaven.

727
01:11:43,548 --> 01:11:47,593
Aw, it's just bad luck
for mates to split up.

728
01:12:01,965 --> 01:12:04,615
Monsieur Picard.
Telegram, Monsieur Picard.

729
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,782
Oui, par ici!

730
01:12:06,882 --> 01:12:09,649
- Monsieur Picard?
- Oui. Merci.

731
01:12:15,132 --> 01:12:17,436
Message for Major Barton.

732
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:21,865
Thank you, sir.

733
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,782
Message for Major Barton.

734
01:12:28,882 --> 01:12:31,139
Can you see him? Thank you, sir.

735
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:34,700
He's just over there.

736
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,658
- Where?
- Just over there.

737
01:12:36,758 --> 01:12:40,603
Run over and give it to him yourself.
Good evening, sir.

738
01:13:06,217 --> 01:13:09,034
Message for Major Hamilton.
I see him.

739
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,557
Hey, you... Evening, sir.

740
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:24,018
Would you mind telling Dunne
that this is a dance for officers only?

741
01:13:32,593 --> 01:13:34,483
Lasalles.

742
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:38,285
Have one or two drinks before you go.

743
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:40,143
Sir.

744
01:13:47,968 --> 01:13:50,023
Cheers.

745
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,833
Over there!

746
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:48,999
'...north of bay 700. Douse it.'

747
01:16:49,099 --> 01:16:50,458
All right, douse it!

748
01:16:50,558 --> 01:16:52,198
Douse it.

749
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,584
Come on, mate, you'll be all right.

750
01:17:51,268 --> 01:17:53,856
No smoking, no talking, pass it on.

751
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,282
G'day.

752
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:19,336
The thing I can't stand
about you, mate,

753
01:18:19,436 --> 01:18:22,294
is you're always so bloody cheerful.

754
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:25,611
Hey, have you got any firewood?

755
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:31,627
Don't they ever let up?

756
01:18:31,727 --> 01:18:35,419
...O'Reilly and Duggan, get over here!

757
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,044
What's for breakfast?

758
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:39,961
Brown biscuit porridge
and fried bully beef.

759
01:18:40,061 --> 01:18:42,961
If you'd got the bacon
like you promised.

760
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:45,252
I can't work miracles.

761
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:47,961
You were saying there's bacon around.

762
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,741
There is. You just gotta
give me time to learn the ropes.

763
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,420
Winner take all.

764
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,545
- What do you mean?
- Insurance.

765
01:18:59,645 --> 01:19:02,412
Covers everything except sharks.

766
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,370
- Here she comes, look out!
- Down, boys!

767
01:19:57,522 --> 01:19:59,908
My arm! I'm hit.

768
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:10,797
- Payment in full.
- Good on you.

769
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:14,130
Now you're flush,
you couldn't lend me five bob?

770
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,130
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

771
01:20:22,105 --> 01:20:24,090
You got a match?

772
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,743
Eleven o'clock. Go!

773
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:30,405
Did you get him?

774
01:20:32,815 --> 01:20:34,952
Have a look for yourself.

775
01:20:37,815 --> 01:20:41,743
Hello, Australia!
Good good. Come closer.

776
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:47,155
New blokes, are you?

777
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:51,590
- Here you go.
- No, thanks.

778
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,881
We were all right when we landed,

779
01:20:53,981 --> 01:20:57,132
but the Turks have had us
pinned down here ever since.

780
01:20:57,232 --> 01:21:00,507
You blokes have been brought over
for a big push.

781
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,882
Good, I haven't seen a Turk yet.

782
01:21:02,982 --> 01:21:04,507
I'm in no hurry.

783
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:06,781
Dead set, mate, I tell you.

784
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:10,549
Water bottles!
Water bottles! Bottles!

785
01:21:10,649 --> 01:21:12,823
Give us a smile.

786
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:17,824
Morning, Abdul!

787
01:21:21,232 --> 01:21:22,424
Bottles.

788
01:21:22,524 --> 01:21:24,382
Hey, mate, hey! Got a smoke?

789
01:21:24,482 --> 01:21:26,132
Yeah.

790
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:28,407
Keep your head down!

791
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:31,675
Here, have two. Got any bacon?

792
01:21:31,775 --> 01:21:34,577
Yeah, but we're a bit short
on champagne.

793
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,925
Good on you, mate.

794
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,659
Pleased to meet you.

795
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:52,238
- Yeah, it is shorter.
- Yeah.

796
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:55,300
Hey, where do you think you're going?

797
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,676
It's a short cut to the beach, isn't it?

798
01:21:58,776 --> 01:22:01,744
Short cut to the bloody cemetery.

799
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:09,198
There you go. What do you reckon?

800
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:12,718
- Thanks, mate.
- Yeah, right-o, pal.

801
01:22:12,818 --> 01:22:14,114
Keep down.

802
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:20,246
Righty-ho, all the way.

803
01:22:24,651 --> 01:22:27,240
We need some more supplies over here.

804
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,344
Come on, don't dawdle!

805
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,326
You gotta be joking.

806
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:41,951
You two mongrels!

807
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,034
Strewth!

808
01:22:52,985 --> 01:22:55,787
Sneddy, give us a hand with this, mate?

809
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:01,761
He doesn't look too fierce to me.

810
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:04,303
He's the midget of the family.

811
01:23:04,403 --> 01:23:06,992
Get an eyeful of that.

812
01:23:09,028 --> 01:23:11,202
Crikey!

813
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:14,761
- Here, take 'em.
- Sorry, mate, no sale.

814
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:17,345
- I'll throw that in.
- Sorry, no deal.

815
01:23:17,445 --> 01:23:21,345
- What's it worth to you, mate?
- The bacon and the flask.

816
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:25,636
- Bit rough.
- Take it or leave it, I've gotta go.

817
01:23:25,736 --> 01:23:27,910
Yeah, I suppose.

818
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:41,330
...that means you, Private Wilson!

819
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:45,262
Straight out of the boats!

820
01:23:45,362 --> 01:23:47,536
Hey, Barn!

821
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:51,453
Bill? Snowy!

822
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,679
We're bound to lose for sure now!

823
01:23:58,529 --> 01:24:00,637
You pack of bastards!

824
01:24:00,737 --> 01:24:04,180
- Good to see you, mate!
- We're all together again!

825
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,847
Hey, Arch! Come here, mate,
I've got some blokes for you to meet!

826
01:24:08,947 --> 01:24:13,388
How's your donger, you bugger?
You look like a bloody pirate!

827
01:24:13,488 --> 01:24:16,972
Fellas, I'd like you to meet
a mate of mine. This is Archy.

828
01:24:17,072 --> 01:24:19,013
This here's Barney.

829
01:24:19,113 --> 01:24:21,097
- Billy.
- How's it going?

830
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:24,680
- This little bloke here is Snowy.
- G'day. Where are you from?

831
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,954
Out in the bush.

832
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:29,430
Nice to meet you all.

833
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:32,430
- Has he been talking about us?
- You know Frank.

834
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,722
He likes the sound of his own voice.

835
01:24:34,822 --> 01:24:36,306
I know more about you
than your mothers.

836
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:37,703
I should hope so!

837
01:24:40,364 --> 01:24:43,723
What you're telling me, sir,
correct me if I'm wrong,

838
01:24:43,823 --> 01:24:47,806
is the infantry attack and our attack
on the Nek are just diversions.

839
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:52,331
Not just diversions, Major,
vitally important diversions.

840
01:24:53,698 --> 01:24:57,743
Tonight, 25,000 British troops
will land here at Suvla Bay.

841
01:24:58,823 --> 01:25:02,963
Our attacks are to draw the Turks
on us so the British can get ashore.

842
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:07,474
Sorry I didn't tell you
this before, secrecy is vital.

843
01:25:07,574 --> 01:25:09,515
But, sir, the Nek is a fortress,

844
01:25:09,615 --> 01:25:12,557
with five machine guns
at point blank range.

845
01:25:12,657 --> 01:25:14,057
We've considered that.

846
01:25:14,157 --> 01:25:17,432
We'll hit them with the heaviest barrage
of the campaign

847
01:25:17,532 --> 01:25:20,749
just before your men go over the top.

848
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,724
By the time we've finished,
there won't be a Turk within miles.

849
01:25:24,824 --> 01:25:28,599
The Turks can keep us pinned down
at Anzac forever.

850
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:31,807
This new British landing
is our only hope.

851
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:35,349
We must do what we can
to make it succeed.

852
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:40,141
Because if it does succeed,
we'll have Constantinople in a week...

853
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:43,266
and knock Turkey out of the war.

854
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:47,308
- So, everything's ready?
- All the guns are in position.

855
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:51,100
We start the bombardment at dawn
and stop at 0430, sharp.

856
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,459
That's... just over
twelve hours from now.

857
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:05,225
"Your name has been selected
at random by the Ladies' Auxiliary."

858
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:10,711
Da-da-da..."We hope this parcel
does its bit to keep up morale."

859
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:13,416
Look at this.

860
01:26:13,576 --> 01:26:16,851
Crikey, they chose
the measurements at random, too.

861
01:26:16,951 --> 01:26:20,214
Some soap, ointment, lavender water...

862
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:22,892
talcum powder, Eno's...

863
01:26:22,992 --> 01:26:25,476
The old ducks have sent
half a chemists'.

864
01:26:25,576 --> 01:26:28,684
A cook book?!
What do they think it is, a picnic?

865
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:32,726
- It's the thought that counts.
- It'd count more if they'd think.

866
01:26:32,826 --> 01:26:34,726
Oh! That does it.

867
01:26:34,826 --> 01:26:40,128
The bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago
sent me a bill for seven and six!

868
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:44,547
How's the time?

869
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:46,917
Half past four.

870
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:52,133
- When are you going over?
- Half past five.

871
01:26:54,452 --> 01:26:58,018
- You going for the ridge?
- No. What's it called?

872
01:26:58,118 --> 01:27:00,292
Lone Pine.

873
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,185
- What are you blokes doing?
- We're going for the Nek tomorrow.

874
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:09,018
The Nek? Turks got machine guns
everywhere up there.

875
01:27:09,118 --> 01:27:13,046
Ships' guns gonna knock 'em out
before we go over.

876
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:16,936
Like a drink?

877
01:27:17,036 --> 01:27:22,311
Go on, Snow. The Lord won't mind,
he turns a blind eye before a battle.

878
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:24,585
He's right.

879
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:29,882
Hey, you beauty, Snowy.

880
01:27:36,203 --> 01:27:38,459
When are they going?

881
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:42,936
Right about now.

882
01:28:17,288 --> 01:28:19,711
Serious cases to the tent.

883
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:23,969
Slightly wounded over here.

884
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:34,335
Put him aside.
Down to the tent with that one.

885
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:42,396
Morphine! We need some more
morphine over here!

886
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,670
All right, mate.

887
01:28:46,996 --> 01:28:51,305
You'll be all right, mate...
be back in Adelaide in no time.

888
01:28:51,956 --> 01:28:56,564
Anyone seen Billy Lewis?
Barney Wilson? Snow?

889
01:28:58,664 --> 01:29:01,466
Hey, mate, you seen Billy Lewis?

890
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,175
Bill? You... you all right?

891
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:10,511
Barney's dead.

892
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:18,679
He was runnin' alongside of me and...

893
01:29:19,581 --> 01:29:21,886
I thought he just tripped.

894
01:29:25,582 --> 01:29:27,968
You know how clumsy he is.

895
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:33,175
Snow?

896
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:40,815
They won't give me any food
or anything to drink.

897
01:29:40,915 --> 01:29:45,648
- Why do you reckon that is?
- They know what they're doing, Snow.

898
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:49,107
We got there, but, Frank.
We took their bloody trenches.

899
01:29:49,207 --> 01:29:53,253
Yeah, Billy said you were a real hero.

900
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,715
Just give me diary to Mum
and Dad, will ya?

901
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,968
I just want them to know what I did.

902
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:25,424
Another bleeder for ya.

903
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:42,141
Hey.

904
01:30:43,542 --> 01:30:45,183
Oi!

905
01:30:54,167 --> 01:30:58,760
Come on, no Turk in his right mind's
gonna waste a bullet on you.

906
01:31:09,293 --> 01:31:13,008
- Get some sleep, mate.
- Yeah.

907
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,465
That's you, mate.

908
01:31:27,794 --> 01:31:29,968
Here's one. You hungry?

909
01:31:37,752 --> 01:31:40,175
Sharp enough for you, sir?

910
01:31:42,877 --> 01:31:45,300
Nine and five sixteenths, eh?

911
01:31:46,294 --> 01:31:50,361
Kimberley Gift.
You're Archy Hamilton, aren't you?

912
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,717
Excuse me, sir.

913
01:31:53,544 --> 01:31:58,017
Don't worry, I'm not going to turn you in.
I'm proud to have you.

914
01:31:58,212 --> 01:31:59,278
Thank you, sir.

915
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:02,678
Matter of fact,
I want you as a runner tomorrow.

916
01:32:02,962 --> 01:32:04,987
But, sir... l'd rather fight.

917
01:32:05,087 --> 01:32:08,820
A few extra yards of speed
could save the lives of hundreds of men.

918
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,070
I've come a long way,
I can't miss out.

919
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:15,362
I need a runner. Communications
won't last once the shelling starts.

920
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:20,070
You could use Frank. He's just
as fast and I got him into this.

921
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,054
He wanted to start a bike shop.

922
01:32:23,962 --> 01:32:26,301
- Is he scared?
- No, sir.

923
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,393
Well, just a bit.

924
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:34,553
Who isn't, son?

925
01:33:54,256 --> 01:33:56,430
Do you mind?

926
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:02,865
- Dunne, report to Major Barton.
- What the hell for?

927
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:07,190
You're off the hook.
He needs a runner. Go on, hop to it.

928
01:34:10,966 --> 01:34:15,106
Can I have your luck? Malish, fate.

929
01:34:20,632 --> 01:34:23,979
Well... see you when I see you.

930
01:34:28,632 --> 01:34:30,853
Not if I see you first.

931
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:39,767
Fix bayonets.

932
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,266
Fix bayonets, first wave.

933
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,186
First wave, fix bayonets.

934
01:34:49,508 --> 01:34:51,682
First wave, fix bayonets.

935
01:34:52,967 --> 01:34:55,141
Fix your bayonets.

936
01:34:55,842 --> 01:34:57,814
Dunne.

937
01:34:58,883 --> 01:35:01,057
Keep your heads down!

938
01:35:03,383 --> 01:35:05,059
Fire!

939
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:25,784
"I know you haven't forgiven
me for running off,

940
01:35:25,884 --> 01:35:30,368
"but I'm sure in my own mind I was right.
So would you if you were here.

941
01:35:30,468 --> 01:35:34,284
"We're getting ready for an all-out
assault on Johnny Turk,

942
01:35:34,384 --> 01:35:38,284
"and we know we're going to give
a good account of our country.

943
01:35:38,384 --> 01:35:40,535
"Everyone is terribly excited.

944
01:35:40,635 --> 01:35:45,642
"There's a feeling we're all in
an adventure that's larger than life."

945
01:35:48,969 --> 01:35:51,143
Cease-fire!

946
01:35:51,385 --> 01:35:53,310
Cease-fire!

947
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:01,270
Jesus!

948
01:36:01,677 --> 01:36:05,369
Shouldn't have stopped yet, sir.
There's still seven minutes.

949
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:07,660
Maybe they're luring the Turks back.

950
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,523
Dunne, get on to headquarters,
find out what's happening.

951
01:36:14,345 --> 01:36:17,411
- What's happened?
- Damned if I know.

952
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:21,036
If the Turks get back in the trenches
we'll be cut to pieces.

953
01:36:21,136 --> 01:36:25,728
- They'll make another final burst.
- They're going back in the trenches.

954
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:32,745
Colonel Robinson.

955
01:36:32,845 --> 01:36:36,078
- Barton, sir.
- I don't care what your watches say.

956
01:36:36,178 --> 01:36:38,911
They should have gone
three minutes ago.

957
01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:43,287
- Sir, they're back in the trenches.
- I know. I still say you must go.

958
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:45,810
Look to your front, boys.

959
01:36:47,012 --> 01:36:48,902
Yes, sir.

960
01:36:50,929 --> 01:36:52,829
It's too late now.

961
01:36:52,929 --> 01:36:54,954
We go ahead, as planned.

962
01:36:55,054 --> 01:36:59,662
Come on, lads. Unload your rifles.
We're going in with the bayonets.

963
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:04,371
No bullets. Nothing up the spout.
We're going in with the bayonets.

964
01:37:06,387 --> 01:37:08,608
Steady, lads. Wait for it!

965
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,104
Come on, lads!

966
01:37:39,138 --> 01:37:44,191
Get ready, second wave!
Leave the wounded and get up to the wall!

967
01:37:56,098 --> 01:37:57,276
Les?

968
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:00,317
Stick with me, mate.

969
01:38:05,473 --> 01:38:07,498
Second wave, get ready.

970
01:38:07,598 --> 01:38:12,402
- Keep moving! Get up to the wall.
- Close to the wall, men!

971
01:38:16,889 --> 01:38:19,657
Come on, boys, face to the wall!

972
01:38:21,557 --> 01:38:24,165
OK, lads, look to your front.

973
01:38:52,475 --> 01:38:54,916
Third wave, take positions.

974
01:38:55,016 --> 01:38:57,458
I'm not sending
any more men out into that.

975
01:38:57,558 --> 01:39:02,529
Come on, boys.
Third wave, get up to the wall.

976
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:08,375
What's happening, Lieutenant?

977
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:10,625
It's all pretty confusing, sir.

978
01:39:10,725 --> 01:39:14,625
- Has it been a success, or not?
- Well, it's hard to say, sir.

979
01:39:14,725 --> 01:39:18,000
One of our marker flags
was seen in the enemy trench.

980
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,084
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello, sir?

981
01:39:23,184 --> 01:39:25,772
Hello? Hello!

982
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:30,209
Damn! Dunne.

983
01:39:30,309 --> 01:39:32,959
Third wave, take up your positions.

984
01:39:33,059 --> 01:39:36,334
Stretcher-bearers,
get me some stretcher-bearers.

985
01:39:36,434 --> 01:39:39,449
- Line cut?
- Yes, sir.

986
01:39:39,934 --> 01:39:41,959
Take that to the Colonel.

987
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:45,690
I've said it once before,
now face the wall!

988
01:39:46,517 --> 01:39:49,188
Gangway! Urgent message
for Colonel Robinson.

989
01:39:52,602 --> 01:39:55,085
Two more men here, quickly.

990
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:03,793
Third wave, fix your bayonets!

991
01:40:03,893 --> 01:40:07,572
No bullets! Bayonets only.

992
01:40:16,018 --> 01:40:19,002
Tell Major Barton
the attack must proceed.

993
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:21,877
Sir, I don't think you got the picture.

994
01:40:21,977 --> 01:40:24,669
They're being cut down
within five yards.

995
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:29,461
Bloody line. Our marker flags
have been seen in the Turkish trenches.

996
01:40:29,561 --> 01:40:32,836
The attack must continue at all costs.

997
01:40:32,936 --> 01:40:35,987
I repeat, the attack must proceed.

998
01:41:05,812 --> 01:41:07,986
Steady, lads.

999
01:41:24,354 --> 01:41:27,213
Who told him there were marker flags?

1000
01:41:27,313 --> 01:41:29,838
I heard someone say
they'd seen one, sir.

1001
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:32,963
- Who? Who?!
- I'm not sure, sir.

1002
01:41:33,063 --> 01:41:36,921
Gray, you bloody idiot.
Nobody got further than ten yards.

1003
01:41:37,021 --> 01:41:40,238
Why don't you go above
Robinson's head, sir?

1004
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:46,505
General Gardner. Go like the wind.

1005
01:41:46,605 --> 01:41:52,204
Message for GHQ! Message for GHQ!
Urgent message! Urgent message!

1006
01:42:06,022 --> 01:42:07,615
Jesus!

1007
01:42:57,065 --> 01:43:00,090
It does sound pointless.
On the other hand...

1008
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,799
Sir, the British are at Suvla.

1009
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:05,716
- Are they meeting heavy opposition?
- None, sir.

1010
01:43:05,816 --> 01:43:10,216
Apparently the officers are sitting
on the beach drinking cups of tea.

1011
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:13,331
Tell Major Barton the attack is...

1012
01:43:14,066 --> 01:43:17,117
Just tell him I'm reconsidering
the situation.

1013
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,284
Yes, sir.

1014
01:44:25,693 --> 01:44:28,551
They're not going to make us go,
are they?

1015
01:44:28,651 --> 01:44:30,825
No, there's no point.

1016
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:42,594
They should have gone, Barton.
Flags have been seen.

1017
01:44:42,694 --> 01:44:46,302
Not by me, sir. I've asked for
confirmation from General Gardner.

1018
01:44:46,402 --> 01:44:48,636
Your orders are to attack.

1019
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:51,844
The British must be allowed ashore.
Is that clear?

1020
01:44:51,944 --> 01:44:54,677
- You are to push on.
- It's cold-blooded murder.

1021
01:44:54,777 --> 01:44:56,702
I said push on.

1022
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:01,333
Right, sir.

1023
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:06,867
Can't ask the men to do
what I wouldn't do myself.

1024
01:45:11,903 --> 01:45:13,928
All right, men...

1025
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:16,202
We're going.

1026
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:21,085
I want you all to remember who you are.

1027
01:45:22,153 --> 01:45:26,413
You're the Tenth Light Horse!
Men from Western Australia.

1028
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,970
Don't forget it.

1029
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:31,012
Good luck.

1030
01:45:31,112 --> 01:45:34,458
- Good luck, sir.
- You too.

1031
01:46:21,905 --> 01:46:25,180
...though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1032
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,347
I shall fear no evil,
for God art with me.

1033
01:46:28,447 --> 01:46:31,514
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

1034
01:46:31,614 --> 01:46:33,788
My cup runneth...

1035
01:46:49,781 --> 01:46:54,788
What are your legs?
Springs. Steel springs.

1036
01:46:56,740 --> 01:47:01,710
What are they going to do?
They're going to hurl me down the track.

1037
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:04,164
How fast can you run?

1038
01:47:05,156 --> 01:47:07,330
As fast as a leopard.

1039
01:47:07,656 --> 01:47:10,056
How fast are you going to run?

1040
01:47:10,156 --> 01:47:12,348
As fast as a leopard!

1041
01:47:12,448 --> 01:47:15,002
Then let's see you do it!

1042
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:24,460
Gangway! Gangway!
Gangway! Urgent message!
