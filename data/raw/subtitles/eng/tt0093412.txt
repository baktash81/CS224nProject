1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,480
Sit down and start undressing

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,960
There's no hurry

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,000
Like that

4
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,760
Keep your pants on for now

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,360
Don't look at me

6
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Don't look at me!

7
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Remember, you're alone

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,120
There's a mirror on your left

9
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
See it?

10
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,320
Stand up and get near it

11
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,000
Watch yourself in the mirror

12
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Kiss your own lips

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,160
Go on

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Again

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,960
Think it's me you're kissing
and you like it

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,560
Rub your cock against the glass

17
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
More

18
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
You love it... that's right

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Now go back to the bed

20
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Caress yourself with your fingertips,
wherever you like

21
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Take your cock and caress it
over your pants

22
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
Do it for real

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,840
You should be getting randy

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Take your pants off

25
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
Take them off

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,320
Turn round

27
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,200
Support yourself on your knees

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Touch your buttocks

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Not your legs,
between your buttocks

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
That's it

31
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,920
You're getting randy

32
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,920
Now... ask me to fuck you

33
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,160
Don't look at me.
I'm not over here

34
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm next to you and you want me to
fuck you. Come on, ask me to

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,520
- But didn't we...?
- Just ask me

36
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
Come on, don't be afraid

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
Just say it

38
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
Fuck me

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Fuck me

40
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,560
I want you to feel me inside you

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
I want you to enjoy it

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
Go on, don't stop

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
Tell me when you're going
to come

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
Do you feel me inside you?

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,160
Yes...

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,840
- I think I'm coming
- Me too

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,600
You did well. You may leave
after you shower

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
Freeze the image and "The End"

49
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,760
THE LAW OF DESIRE

50
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Hear the applause?

51
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,760
It's a great film. Fantastic

52
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,120
Fuck me

53
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
I'll stay if you want me to

54
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,160
It's hot. Go to the seaside
and help your sister

55
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,920
- Will you visit me?
- I don't know

56
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,280
I must start rehearsals
straight away

57
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,800
- Take a week's rest
- I don't need to rest

58
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,640
This line is for you

59
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,440
Will you direct 'The Human Voice'
for the stage?

60
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,600
What other plans do you have?

61
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Right now, to get drunk...

62
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,240
...and get high

63
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
And you, Tina?

64
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,560
I have theatre, film and TV offers,
and even a soap

65
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,000
But I can't talk till
the contracts are signed

66
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
Hey, Tina!

67
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Don't take my double chin

68
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
Is it true you've become
a lesbian?

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,840
With men like you, even I
would be a lesbian

70
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,200
- And so would you, I guess
- We already are

71
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,960
- Why can't they leave us alone?
- Forget it

72
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,840
- What happened?
- Nothing

73
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
Must go. I left the girl alone

74
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,600
- Any news from her mother?
- She's still in Tokyo

75
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm very proud of you

76
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
- 'Bye
- Want a ride?

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,360
No, you stay and enjoy
the party

78
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,920
I've seen all your films

79
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,240
Today I saw all three showings of
'The Mussel's Paradigm'

80
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
You liked it?

81
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,960
The second time I did, but less than
the first time I saw 'Remake'

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,840
And the fifth time you saw
'Shitface'?

83
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,000
Less than the third time
I saw 'Halitosis'

84
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,480
Which is your own favourite?

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,400
I like making films,
not watching them

86
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,760
- What did you talk about?
- Cinema

87
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,480
- And what did he tell you?
- Things

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
- Where are you going?
- Home

89
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,480
- Can I come with you?
- OK. Can you drive?

90
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
Yes. Where's your car?

91
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,080
- I'd like to steal this
- A Vespino? What for?

92
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,920
Belongs to a friend who's leaving
tomorrow. I'd like it as a fetish

93
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Got some coke?

94
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,080
See if there's any left.
Come in.

95
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm a model, but I'd much rather
be in films

96
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,160
Excuse me, I'm going to throw up

97
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,640
<i>The Human Voice</i>

98
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
They should ban premieres

99
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,440
They should ban premieres

100
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,640
- What's your next play?
- 'The Human Voice'

101
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,680
- Is there a role for me?
- It's a female monologue

102
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Can't a guy do it?

103
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,240
No. Look, just go.
Sorry, I'm very tired

104
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,680
- Don't you want me to stay?
- No, not tonight

105
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,920
You didn't say goodbye
and it's my last night

106
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,520
I thought you had scored
with that girl

107
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
I would have told you

108
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
We can't get it together, Pablo

109
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
It's not your fault if
you don't love me

110
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,680
And it's not my fault
if I love you

111
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,680
That's why I'm glad you're leaving.
I'll get over it sooner

112
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't want you to get over it

113
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,080
Let's not talk about it.
It's late, let's go to bed

114
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Promise you'll come and see me

115
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,920
There's a beautiful beach and    '
a lighthouse to die for

116
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,680
- Still haven't fixed this?
- I will one day

117
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,640
I bet. I'll come back in September
and it still won't be fixed

118
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,320
That'll give you an excuse
to come back

119
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
Mind if we don't make love?

120
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,880
Don't worry, we won't do anything

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,600
- And if you can't sleep?
- I'll take a pill

122
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,800
You take one, too.
I'll take a couple

123
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,240
- Is it OK with beer?
- After all you've taken tonight?

124
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,880
- Very nice
- Like it, don't you?

125
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Try it on

126
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,200
Amazing, it's your size.
You should buy it

127
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,520
- I've no money
- Pay me tomorrow

128
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm going on holiday

129
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,720
Take it. When you come back,
bring me what you have

130
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,480
- Thanks. See you
- God bless

131
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,960
What would you ask from
the loved one?

132
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,640
Not to accompany me to parties,
wait at home for the gossip

133
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Let me type in peace

134
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,840
Read the same books,
know about medicine...

135
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>...law, plumbing, electricity...</i>

136
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,600
In short, to adore me

137
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
Not to nag me, and...
to accept I'm useless

138
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Anyone would do that for you

139
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Don't be so sure

140
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,920
- Bet they would
- Don't be so sure

141
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,080
Tell me, what do you most
love and hate in love?

142
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,200
Same thing

143
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,040
<i>Love absorbs you</i>
<i>24 hours a day</i>

144
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,640
<i>You can't concentrate</i>

145
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,960
That's what I most love
and hate

146
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,720
Really?

147
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,680
<i>Dear Pablo, this is the lighthouse.</i>
<i>It'd make a wonderful location</i>

148
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
<i>I come here at dawn</i>

149
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,320
<i>How are you? Write to me</i>

150
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,640
<i>Big kiss, Juan</i>

151
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,240
<i>Dear Juan, I got your letter</i>

152
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,520
<i>It's nice, but not what I expected.</i>
<i>I'll send you a typed letter</i>

153
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,600
<i>Please sign it and</i>
<i>send it back</i>

154
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,640
<i>I long for you as ever. Pablo</i>

155
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,000
How did the interview go?

156
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,720
Terrible. Know what they offered
me? A porno movie... with her

157
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,600
I kept my cool. Said I was too old
to show my arse. Bastards!

158
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,000
- Nothing wrong with your arse
- I use it less than you, that's why

159
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,520
- You can be so crude, darling
- Sorry, Pablo. I'm sick of it all

160
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,000
- What would you like to drink?
- Coca-Cola

161
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,880
Come outside

162
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Be patient, Ada. She can be rude,
but she doesn't mean it

163
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,960
She got a letter from my mum

164
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Didn't let me read it, but I think
Mum's staying longer in Tokyo

165
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,880
Slagging me off?
The sink's full of dishes

166
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,360
The cleaner comes tomorrow

167
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,280
This looks like a junkie's house

168
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,240
- What's a junkie?
- Nothing, nosey!

169
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,720
- What's a junkie?
- A sportsman

170
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,960
- Never heard of ice junkie?
- That's hockey

171
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,120
Well, a junkie is...
a very messy person

172
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,320
Then I'm a bit of a junkie, too

173
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,640
Silly! Let me talk to Tina

174
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,360
Her mother is staying in Tokyo
with some photographer

175
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,880
What are you going to do?

176
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,880
Cry till I run out of tears

177
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,600
<i>I'll send you a typed letter.</i>
<i>Please sign it and send it back</i>

178
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,280
<i>I long for you as ever. Pablo</i>

179
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
<i>Sado-masochist comic book</i>

180
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,640
What will you do with Ada?

181
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,960
First she must finish school

182
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
And then...

183
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,960
...I'll have to keep her.
She hates her grandparents

184
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,960
- Want me to do the ironing?
- No, let the cleaner do it

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,600
- What's this, Ada?
- A comic. Can I have it?

186
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,320
No, you've got to study.
Her grades are appalling

187
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,680
You like the harmonica? You can
have that, but promise you'll study

188
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
- I can't concentrate
- Why's that?

189
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
She's in love with you

190
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,560
It's a loan

191
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,640
- You promised not to tell
- Shut up

192
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,200
We're off, you've a lot to do

193
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,360
- You've two more mouths to feed
- Three

194
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,600
If you get bored, give me a call.
'Bye now

195
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,440
Thank you, darling

196
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,440
<i>I didn't leave to forget you</i>

197
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,600
<i>If I ever did, as you said I should,</i>
<i>I'd end up empty inside</i>

198
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,960
<i>Tell me what you're up to.</i>
<i>What books you're reading</i>

199
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,320
<i>What films you've seen. What records</i>
<i>you've bought. Have you got a cold?</i>

200
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,360
<i>I want to share everything</i>
<i>with you</i>

201
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,840
<i>Except if you've met someone</i>
<i>you fancy. I couldn't share that</i>

202
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,040
<i>I want to see you. You decide when.</i>
<i>I adore you</i>

203
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
- Pablo is in love
- With you?

204
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,160
I doubt it

205
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,000
- He could be your father
- If only!

206
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Forget it, he's very selfish

207
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,880
Selfish? He gave us a cheque
and a harmonica

208
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,680
I don't mean that

209
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,520
Look, Ada!
Ramiro de Maeztu School

210
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,640
127, Serrano Street

211
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,720
I studied here as a child

212
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,600
Want to go inside the chapel?

213
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,040
They still haven't fixed the gap

214
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,160
The times I must have
jerked off in here

215
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,360
<i>O Lady, more pure than a lily</i>
<i>and a rose</i>

216
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,600
<i>O Mother, more beautiful</i>
<i>than the glowing sun</i>

217
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,680
<i>Attend to my prayer,</i>
<i>listen to my song</i>

218
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,880
<i>Wipe away my tears</i>
<i>of bitter pain</i>

219
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,360
<i>Attend to my prayer,</i>
<i>listen to my song</i>

220
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,920
<i>Wipe away my tears</i>
<i>of bitter pain</i>

221
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,040
I was a soloist when I was young

222
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,240
It's the only thing I miss
from that time

223
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,680
You remind me of an old pupil.
He used to sing in the choir, too

224
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Father Constantino, it's me

225
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,400
You? It can't be

226
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes, it can

227
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,720
You've changed so much

228
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,840
Not really. I'm still the same
deep down

229
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,800
- And that girl?
- She's... my daughter

230
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,520
Are you married?

231
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,120
No, I'm condemned to solitude

232
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,200
You can never say that

233
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,040
I can. There have been
only two men in my life

234
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
One was you...

235
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,160
...my spiritual mentor.
The other was my father

236
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,840
Both abandoned me

237
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
I don't trust any other

238
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,360
Put your trust in God.
He'll never abandon you

239
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,880
Maybe you're right

240
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,640
I'd like to sing in
the choir again

241
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
- Not here, please
- Why not?

242
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,360
If it's God you're after,
go to any church

243
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,160
He's in all of them

244
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,840
But my memories are here

245
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,000
Banish them, as I have done

246
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,560
My memories are all I have left

247
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,000
What's that?

248
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,720
The May Cross. It gives us solace,
remember?

249
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
Get a man, it's more hygienic

250
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,240
No men, or women. Let's not talk
about it, not in front of her

251
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,680
Need any help? What's wrong?
Are you angry with me?

252
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,200
No, she's taken a vow of obedience,
chastity and silence

253
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
Well, not obedience

254
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,280
And the silence is driving me mad

255
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,560
"Chas...

256
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,720
"...ti...

257
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,720
"...ty...

258
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,080
"No!"

259
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,400
That's a relief!

260
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,480
She's taking First Communion

261
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,640
Are you? I'll get you a dress
worthy of a saint

262
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm starting to rehearse
'The Human Voice'

263
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,200
- And who's the lucky girl?
- You, I hope

264
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,760
It worked!

265
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,720
We asked the Virgin for work.
I'll take another vow

266
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,240
Don't be greedy. Sit down, love

267
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,960
You serious? You're not
taking pity on me?

268
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,440
Can I be in it?
I asked for work too

269
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,680
We'll see. But it'll be
hard for you

270
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,120
Why?

271
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
The show will bring you
painful memories

272
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,360
Better than showing my arse
in a nightclub

273
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,880
Much better

274
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,760
- Is it because I'm your sister?
- No way!

275
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,440
Or because I'm broke?

276
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,160
Eat up, love. I'll never
eat again

277
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,240
A face-lift!

278
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,160
I can't do it, Pablo

279
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,680
I won't spoil the show for you.
My skin is awful for that role

280
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
What's so funny, sweetie?

281
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,520
<i>When her lover left her,</i>
<i>Laura ran after him</i>

282
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
<i>She fell and broke her ankle</i>

283
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,080
<i>Then cut her leg off saying she had</i>
<i>gangrene, to make him feel guilty</i>

284
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,680
<i>But her thirst for revenge</i>
<i>remained unquenched</i>

285
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,680
<i>Dear Pablo, I didn't leave</i>
<i>to forget you</i>

286
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,200
<i>If I ever did, as you said I should,</i>.
<i>I'd end up empty inside</i>

287
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,360
<i>Tell me what you're up to.</i>
<i>What books you're reading</i>

288
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,800
<i>Have you got a cold?</i>
<i>Given up snow?</i>

289
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,280
<i>I want to share everything</i>
<i>with you</i>

290
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,600
Got an extra ticket for the show?

291
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,240
- Got any spare tickets?
- No, sorry

292
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,160
Excuse me, sir. Got any
spare tickets?

293
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,440
I don't suppose you've got
a ticket?

294
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,840
I'm off, it's too hot in here

295
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,560
We're staying, it's been
a tough night

296
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,240
OK, but don't get drunk

297
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,600
See you tomorrow

298
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,560
You're Pablo Quintero, aren't you?

299
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
- I really wanted to talk to you
- Well, here I am

300
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm going home.
Want to come with me?

301
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,640
I don't sleep with men

302
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,640
'Bye, then. Nice to meet you

303
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
You win

304
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,960
- I'm going with you
- This isn't a contest

305
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,280
It is, and I've just lost.
But I don't care, come on

306
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,840
I couldn't get a ticket

307
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
I'll leave one at the box office
tomorrow

308
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,760
- Leave that. Want a beer?
- OK

309
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,120
Don't touch anything

310
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
Laura P

311
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
Who is Laura P?

312
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,440
The lead in my next film.
Don't touch, they're just notes

313
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
Is it true your sister
is a transsexual?

314
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,960
What's it to you?

315
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll help you tidy up

316
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,760
- You do this often?
- All the time

317
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,840
It's a miracle the place
hasn't caught fire yet

318
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,000
Cool it, OK?

319
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,440
You don't kiss as if you're
unblocking the sink

320
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,960
- Then you teach me how
- With pleasure

321
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,560
How was that?

322
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,760
Listen, you don't have any
venereal diseases?

323
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,080
Why do you ask me that now?

324
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,480
You're so promiscuous...

325
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,960
No. Don't worry

326
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,560
I've never had anything,
not even crabs

327
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,520
I hate that kind of disease

328
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,400
Look, why don't we just
forget it?

329
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,880
- You want to?
- If you keep asking questions, yes

330
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,160
I won't ask anything else,
I promise

331
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,400
Listen... one last question.
Last one

332
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,760
Only one, OK?

333
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,880
You want to fuck me, don't you?

334
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,160
Ever since I saw you
at the disco

335
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,080
I've never done it before

336
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,280
<i>Dear Pablo</i>

337
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,080
<i>Tell me what you're up to.</i>
<i>What books you're reading</i>

338
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,040
<i>What films you've seen.</i>
<i>Given up snow?</i>

339
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,360
<i>I want to share everything</i>
<i>with you</i>

340
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,400
<i>Except if you've met someone</i>
<i>you fancy. I coudn't share that</i>

341
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,240
<i>I adore you. Juan</i>

342
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,760
Shit!

343
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,160
You're a pig

344
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,960
If I were 16, I'd report you
for being a child molester

345
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,920
- Who is it?
- Antonio

346
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,640
What a surprise!

347
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,960
Come in, don't be shy

348
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,040
I wanted to see you
before I go

349
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,720
You shouldn't provoke
a child molester

350
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
Let's go to bed

351
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,360
- Good morning! About time
- Don't shout

352
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,120
- I fixed the switch in the hall
- So I see. Thanks

353
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,000
You're hopeless. Someone
should take care of you

354
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
I've heard that one before

355
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,760
When this dries, one coat of paint
and it'll be as good as new

356
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,920
You've done enough for today.
Don't worry about it

357
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,960
<i>Antonio, darling. You may think so,</i>
<i>but I'm not in love with you</i>

358
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,200
<i>I'm touched by your tenderness.</i>
<i>But don't fall in love with me</i>

359
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>I'm too selfish, I coudn't share</i>
<i>my life. Thank you and good luck</i>

360
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
- Pablo, wake up
- What time is your train?

361
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,840
- In two hours
- Then let me sleep a bit more

362
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,240
- A massage will wake you
- Stop it, I'm getting up

363
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,200
You need a shower.
Get into the bathroom

364
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't want you going out
with other guys

365
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,560
And stop taking coke

366
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,440
When I tell you, you'll come and
see me. We'll go sailing together

367
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,760
You need a healthier life

368
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,560
Aren't you a bit reactionary?

369
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,160
And quite right, too

370
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,760
Who is the boy in the letter?
That Juan?

371
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,240
You've read it?

372
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,920
How dare you?

373
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,680
I can't help it. I want to know
everything about you

374
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,080
Don't do it again

375
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,200
He seems very much in love
with you

376
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,280
He isn't. That letter is a joke

377
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Love is never a joke. I hope
you're not in love with him

378
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,480
Let's drop it, OK?

379
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,760
Don't lie to me, Pablo.
Don't cheat on me

380
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Hold on! I never promised anything.
I told you not to trust me

381
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,560
Stop pretending.
I'm not a press

382
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,480
You love me, I can tell.
But you play at being frivolous

383
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
I <i>am</i> frivolous

384
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,640
- You're screaming for affection
- Mayby. But not at any price

385
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
You're better than you think

386
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,000
But you don't lead a healthy life.
I'll take care of that

387
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,680
Since I can't get you to listen,
I've written you a letter

388
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,600
Ah, yes, the letter.
I tore it up

389
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,600
I did read it

390
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,680
But you shoudn't have written it

391
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,120
But that's in the past.
Breakfast?

392
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,880
I'll write when I get there

393
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,360
- Promise, you'll write back
- All right

394
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,320
I don't want anyone to know
about us

395
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
Listen, if you've been spying
on me...

396
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,040
...which seems likely, you'll know
I never talk about my private life

397
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,880
I'm thinking of my family. They don't
read my letters, but best be cautious

398
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,240
Write under a girl's name

399
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,120
So my mother doesn't know
you're a guy. Get it?

400
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,400
Come off it, man

401
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,600
- I'm sure she won't read them
- She won't read what?

402
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,080
- The letters
- What letters?

403
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Yours

404
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,960
Just in case. My mother is German
and likes being a spy

405
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,000
Take care, and have a good trip

406
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
Hurry, you'll miss your train

407
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Hello?

408
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Mum, you're back!

409
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,000
Ada, my darling

410
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
I've missed you so much

411
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,840
Mind my make-up.
I'm on at the end

412
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,040
Aren't you glad to see me?

413
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,680
Yes, you look lovely

414
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,160
- What's this?
- My First Communion dress

415
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,240
I told you not to, Ada.
You and I are atheists

416
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
Have you forgotten?

417
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,600
You may be an atheist, but Tina
and I are great believers

418
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
We have a May Cross at home

419
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
But it's June!

420
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,560
We've found a Virgin
who works miracles

421
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,800
You two are bonkers

422
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,560
Have you seen Tina? She's
a great actress, ans so am I

423
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,280
- Come here, we need to talk
- We are talking

424
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
Don't be stubborn. Sit down

425
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,800
Look at these filthy hands

426
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,640
I've come for you.
I live in Milan now

427
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,400
It's a beautiful industrial city.
You'll love it

428
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,760
I don't speak Italian, and
I don't care about industry

429
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,360
Anyway, you'll go off. I'm staying
with Tina, she won't leave me

430
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,240
- How do you know?
- She doesn't like men like you do

431
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,000
Ada, this time I've found
what I was looking for

432
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't want to go with you

433
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,920
This girl drives me crazy

434
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,440
I've broken two nails

435
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,560
Yes, my love. I know I shoudn't
get my hopes up

436
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,280
But until now, whenever
we've had problems...

437
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,600
...we've always talked things
through

438
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,360
And made up with a simple glance

439
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,040
But it's not the same on the phone.
On the phone it's final

440
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,000
Wait!

441
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,200
Me? Why would I think
you want to hang up?

442
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,880
That would be too cruel

443
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,840
And you... have never been cruel

444
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
How silly of me

445
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,480
I was about to say, until now

446
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,160
Yes, it'd be better
if you hang up

447
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,480
Goodbye, my love

448
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,320
Yes, I'll be brave. I will!

449
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,240
Now hurry and hang up.
Please, hung up

450
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,480
I love you more than my own life

451
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
More than my own life

452
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,680
Aren't you hungry?

453
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
It's disgusting

454
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,120
God, it's hot! How can you
stand that jacket?

455
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,560
Go on, don't by shy.
Hose me down!

456
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,000
It's so hot!

457
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,160
I can't take the heat tonight

458
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,240
Come on, no more hydrotherapy

459
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,880
That was amazing! I've always
dreamt of doing that

460
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I didn't thing it'd be so powerful,
but it was great

461
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,160
Let's get drunk

462
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,520
You two were great tonight

463
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,920
You were bloody awful,
especially you

464
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,040
You really overacted

465
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,360
- Sorry, I'm not a machine
- Neither am I

466
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,040
I'm a drug addict too, you know

467
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,440
Don't ever say I overacted
in front of other people

468
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
It's the truth

469
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,480
- But no one needs to know
- You're right, I'm sorry

470
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,280
So you don't like my acting?

471
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,720
Don't be a drag. I like you and the
public likes you, can't you tell?

472
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,120
- Yes, but...
- But waht? You should be happy

473
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,880
I am, but the show gets me down
sometimes

474
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,200
I warned you

475
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,040
I love all the drama

476
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,520
All the crying and talking
on the phone

477
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
What I hate is having to
dress like a slob

478
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,080
I shouldn't have said that.
You'll never give me work again

479
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,320
You're wrong. You're the lead
in my next film

480
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
More cock!

481
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,880
With your paranoia, I'd better
warn you before you read it

482
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,760
- So you don't get cross
- Why? What's the film about?

483
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,720
See? You're pissed off already

484
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,960
- Tell me, or I really will be
- Tomorrow

485
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,600
Look, it's not that the role
is inspired by you

486
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,680
But it has... a certain affinity.
I need another line

487
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,920
How much of an affinity?

488
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,640
Regarding your problems with men

489
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,600
I don't have any problems with men.
They mean nothing to me any more

490
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,000
And that's not a problem?

491
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,800
- You think I'm a freak, too?
- I didn't say that

492
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,280
Talk about your own problems
and leave me alone

493
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,000
Will you listen?

494
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,720
Leave my life out of it. I may be
ridiculous, but I have my self-respect

495
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,160
- Who says you're ridiculous?
- I know I am

496
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,720
- Will you listen to me?
- OK, I will

497
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,880
My problems with men mean more
than a storyline

498
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,640
No one's going to play with them.
Get out of here!

499
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,480
- No one's playing with them
- They're mine, you hear?

500
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,920
You keep them, if it
makes you happy

501
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,680
It doesn't, you bastard.
But I've paid for my failures

502
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,880
And now they're all I've got

503
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,600
Your milk

504
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,840
Will I have tits like yours
one day?

505
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,560
Of course you will. At your age,
I was as flat as a board

506
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,520
Does Pablo like tits?

507
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't know. Some men
don't appreciate them

508
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,880
No more questions.
Drink your milk

509
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,560
She took everything, didn't she?

510
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,480
Good. We'll have more room now

511
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,840
I'll never leave you, Tina. I told
her that and she slapped me

512
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,200
Bitch! But never forget
she's your mother

513
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,680
- I love you
- How much?

514
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,760
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Of course, sweetheart

515
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,240
Can I ask the Virgin
something first?

516
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,360
At this hour? The poor Virgin
must be sick of it. Go on, then

517
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,320
- Morocco
- Finished

518
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,000
What did you ask?

519
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,400
That Pablo never leaves us
like Mum did

520
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,880
Let's go to bed, sweetheart

521
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,720
Thank you, Virgin

522
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
God, it's hot!

523
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,120
- Here
- What is it?

524
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,280
Photos of when we were kids

525
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,000
I thought I had them all

526
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,840
When you asked for them,
Mum and I kept these

527
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,560
Do what you like with them

528
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,440
I want you to trust me, Tina

529
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,560
I promised not to ask questions, and
I've kept my bargain over the years

530
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,240
But your past is part of mine

531
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,360
Don't take it out on me, Pablo

532
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,320
I'm very vulnerable,
and very imperfect

533
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,800
Hi, Pablo. It's Juan

534
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,960
Hello, Juan. How are you?

535
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,800
Terrible. Why don't you
answer my letters?

536
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,360
Because...

537
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,760
...I'm trying to forget you. And
when you do that, you can't write

538
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,600
I'll give you what you want,
but you must teach me how

539
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,400
You can't teach that

540
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,680
Give me another chance. Come to
see me so I can try

541
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,920
OK. I'll come and check
that lighthouse

542
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,040
You'll love it. Write to me,
I miss you so much

543
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,920
OK, I'll write to you now

544
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,800
I love you

545
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,080
<i>Pablo, are you there?</i>

546
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,720
<i>- Pick up the phone, I'm sick of this</i>
- Yes, I'm here

547
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,560
I've been calling for days

548
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,280
I've been out. Did you get
my letters?

549
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,480
Yes, and I don't like them.
I'm sick of Laura P

550
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,320
It was your idea to use
a girl's name

551
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,000
Well, I was wrong. You must
come and see me, Pablo

552
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,760
- Are you avoiding me?
- I've told you...

553
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,320
Must go. If you don't come,
I'll come to see you

554
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,120
<i>Antonio, I don't love you</i>

555
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,360
<i>I'm still in love with Juan</i>

556
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,440
<i>I won't come to see you.</i>
<i>I'm going to see Juan</i>

557
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,280
<i>Forget me. Dont fool yourself.</i>
<i>I never lied to you, Laura P</i>

558
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,800
- Nearly done?
- Not quite

559
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,120
- You go, I'll clear up here
- Thanks!

560
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,600
But tomorrow it's your turn

561
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,160
It's closed

562
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,080
- But if you want something...
- A bottle of whisky

563
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,560
- What brand?
- This one

564
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,160
- You must be Juan, right?
- Yes, and who are you?

565
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,920
I'm Pablo's friend

566
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,920
- Pablo is coming tomorrow
- Not any more

567
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,640
He sent me to tell you

568
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,960
- Why doesn't he tell me himself?
- He doesn't want to see you

569
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,440
- That's his shirt, isn't it?
- Yes, he gave it to me

570
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,720
You still love him?

571
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,240
In my own way. But Pablo needs
more, and I was willing to give it

572
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,040
Don't bother. He's found what
he wanted in me

573
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,840
I wanted to show him
the lighthouse

574
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,720
I'll tell him all about it

575
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,920
Stop playing with the torch

576
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,840
Here, drink

577
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,640
I often come here to watch
the dawn

578
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,160
What are you doing?

579
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,480
- You'd kiss him, wouldn't you?
- What's it to you?

580
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,760
Leave me alone!

581
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,440
- What the hell do you want?
- To possess you

582
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,000
You're crazy

583
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,320
I love Pablo. I want everything
that is his

584
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,520
I belong to no one. No one

585
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,000
Sorry, I'm a bit drunk.
I didn't mean to

586
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,560
I don't understand you.
I don't know what's going on

587
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,480
Let go of me!

588
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,760
Are you Pablo Quintero?

589
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,400
What's happened?

590
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,120
He fell, or was pushed
over the cliff

591
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,320
Near the Trafalgar lighthouse?

592
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,040
- You know the place?
- Juan sent me a photo

593
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,240
- Where were you last night?
- In the theatre with my sister

594
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,840
I left Madrid around 8
this morning

595
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,200
I suppose we can check it out

596
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,200
How well did you know Juan?

597
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,440
We were good friends

598
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,800
- How good?
- We weren't lovers

599
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,760
- Is that clear?
- No, it isn't

600
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,200
- Juan loved you
- How do you know?

601
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,120
We grew up together.
He told me everything

602
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,200
Stay the night. You're in
no shape to travel

603
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,040
No, thanks. That's kind of you

604
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,440
I'm going to Jerez
to see a friend

605
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,120
Let's go to the cliffs

606
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,320
<i>Dear Juan</i>

607
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,200
<i>The more generous you are</i>
<i>with me...</i>

608
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,960
<i>...the more I realise I've made you</i>
<i>do things against your will</i>

609
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,760
<i>I won't touch you again,</i>
<i>even if you ask me to</i>

610
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,240
<i>I want you to desire me,</i>
<i>even if you don't love me</i>

611
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,560
<i>But you can't force things</i>

612
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,360
<i>I want you to show me</i>
<i>the lighthouse at dawn...</i>

613
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,040
<i>...and hear the waves</i>
<i>against the cliffs</i>

614
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,160
<i>I love you more than ever.</i>
<i>I can't help it, Pablo</i>

615
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,480
It's like the shirt
he was wearing

616
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,480
Did you see if a pocket
was missing?

617
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,000
Let's go after him

618
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,160
The pocket

619
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,440
What a mess!

620
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,960
- Antonio?
- I'm in the bathroom

621
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,240
I'm practising for the
grape harvest

622
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,640
- Come with me?
- You go alone

623
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,360
Is something burning?
I can smell smoke

624
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,120
- It's a cigarette
- But you don't smoke

625
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,680
It's not a joint, is it?
Open the door

626
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,160
What are you doing?

627
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,880
Where were you last night?

628
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,040
Nowhere. Stop shouting,
everyone can hear you

629
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,520
Let them, I'm in my own house

630
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
What do you want?

631
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:54,440
- Sorry, I rang the bell
- The maid's out

632
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,080
- Who are you?
- I'm Pablo

633
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,320
A friend of Laura's

634
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,640
Can't that woman leave us alone?

635
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,080
Don't worry. She won't
bother you again

636
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,280
Remember me?

637
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,560
Laura introduced us

638
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,320
Of course I remember.
You're the film director

639
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,520
You'll be late, Mum

640
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,800
I'll open the side door for you

641
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,720
- Where were you last night?
- I did't go out

642
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,200
- I heard the bike
- Mum, you've got to help me

643
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,080
How can I? You don't tell me
anything. It's that slag's fault

644
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,640
- She was here last night
- I knew something was wrong

645
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,600
And him? He's got a shirt
like yours

646
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,080
I never had a shirt like that, OK?

647
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,320
I'm worried about you, son

648
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,720
Between your father and his politics
and you... it'll be the death of me

649
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,360
Let's go to the roof,
we'll be alone

650
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,720
What's wrong? Aren't you
happy to see me?

651
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,480
Juan has been found dead near
the Trafalgar lighthouse

652
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,960
Can't say I'm sorry

653
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,200
He really hurt me

654
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,720
I can still remember his letter
word for word

655
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,800
What did you do last night?

656
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,080
Why did you ask your mother
to lie?

657
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,360
You know very well where I was
and what I did

658
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,800
- I did it for us
- Don't touch me, murderer!

659
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,320
It was your fault

660
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,040
You lied when you said
the letter was a joke

661
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,040
And when you said Juan and you
weren't lovers

662
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,840
I told you not to lie,
but you would't listen

663
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,480
Anyway, it doesn't matter now

664
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,520
This death will unite us for ever

665
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,160
What's happened?

666
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,840
Did he do that?

667
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,600
Let's go inside, I'm naked

668
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,320
How did it happen?

669
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,320
He came asking after a girl.
I said she wasn't here

670
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,360
He got angry and bit me

671
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,840
Is he a friend?

672
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,320
No way. This girl Laura
introduced us. I was seeing her

673
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:13,040
She wrote to say she was coming,
but she changed her mind

674
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,280
He thought she was here.
What's going on?

675
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,680
- Nothing
- Is Laura OK?

676
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,840
- What have they done to you, son?
- Nothing

677
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,600
- What do you mean?
- It's just a bite

678
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,000
Who was it? That film director?

679
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,400
Can I talk to you or your husband?

680
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,680
My husband is at one of those
parliament sessions

681
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,120
Go and disinfect that wound.
Cannibal!

682
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,600
- I hope you're on the case
- Don't worry, we'll get him

683
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,720
He's a very bad driver

684
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,960
Please sit down and tell me
what happened

685
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,200
A young man's been murdered
near the lighthouse

686
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,440
He was a friend of Pablo Quintero,
who came to see your son

687
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,280
My son's not involved with that
pervert. What's the victim's name?

688
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,400
Juan. He worked at a beach bar
near the lighthouse

689
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,600
Your son says Pablo Quintero
came here...

690
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,960
...looking for a mutual friend - a girl
called Laura. Do you know her?

691
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,840
I've heard the name. I fear my son
might be in love with her

692
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,800
Here's proof

693
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,840
I don't want anyone to hear of this,
especially not my husband

694
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,560
He's got enought to worry about

695
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,040
Being a politician's wife
is like being a widow

696
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,600
- You do understand, don't you?
- Of course, I do

697
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,360
Have you discovered something?

698
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,880
- Where was your son last night?
- He stayed at home

699
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,920
- Don't tell me he's a suspect
- No, we suspect the girl

700
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,880
Good heavens!

701
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,360
- Let us know if she gets in touch
- Certainly. You too

702
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,400
Will he pull through?

703
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,840
He's badly bruised and has broken
a leg. But the worst is his head

704
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,800
But he'll recover

705
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,320
- Can I see him?
- Not yet

706
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,480
I advise you to go to your brother's
place and check it out

707
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,720
Why?

708
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,200
The police will search his place

709
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,560
- He was here during the murder
- No matter, they'll hassle him

710
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,400
Thanks. I'll be back tomorrow

711
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,760
Remove anything suspicious -
photos, postcards, drugs, notes...

712
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,920
- You know what I mean
- Yeah, I do

713
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:26,560
Same typeface. The two letters and
the script were typed on this

714
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,720
Here he refers to Laura P
as "Bitter Heel"

715
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,640
Look what I've found.
A quarter of coke

716
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,280
Not enough for a conviction

717
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,600
But enough for two lines.
How about it?

718
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,120
That's your loss

719
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,320
This bitch is a knockout

720
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,280
- Wouldn't you like to lay her?
- Me? No

721
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,800
And you?

722
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,360
Right here on this table

723
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,760
At my age, if it weren't for
these little vices...

724
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,280
...you wouldn't survive the job.
I hope you find out sooner than I did.

725
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:09,520
At your age I'll be Chief Inspector,
not a detective like you

726
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,920
I don't know why you became a cop

727
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,680
With your look, you should be
a model. You'd make more

728
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,560
- Look who's here!
- What are you doing here?

729
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,040
Searching

730
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,080
Not me, he was. I was reading

731
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Put that script down

732
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,400
This isn't a public library

733
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,040
Seems interesting

734
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,600
He can read!

735
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Do you know Laura P?

736
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,480
- Who is she?
- "Expressive eyes...

737
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,000
"...honey-coloured. Average height,
but attractive

738
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,360
"With a lovely smile

739
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,920
"Laura is around 40

740
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,920
"And dreams of having a face-lift

741
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,160
"She has a wooden leg and
lives in a lighthouse

742
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,800
"She retired there to
seek revenge

743
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,760
"But doesn't realise that she's
the victim of that revenge"

744
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,600
Are you going to read it all?

745
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,680
It's your brother's description
of Laura P

746
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,200
- She doesn't exist
- The lighthouse does

747
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,120
Then get your information
from it

748
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,200
We've got information

749
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,120
These two letters were typed
on this machine

750
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,400
One signed by your brother,
the other by her

751
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,600
This is absurd. Laura is a fictitious
character invented by my brother

752
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,280
Who wrote that letter, then?

753
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,560
What colour are your eyes?

754
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,960
"Expressive eyes, honey-coloured"

755
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,480
- You're of average height
- "But attractive

756
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,480
And I bet you have
a lovely smile

757
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,520
- Why don't you smile for us?
- Laura P

758
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,320
Get your fucking mother
to smile for you

759
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,760
- People like you should be dead
- Hands off!

760
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,320
People like you shouldn't hit
a defenceless woman

761
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,400
You're not a woman

762
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,000
Bet you'll charge me with
hitting a cop

763
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,080
Your mother wasn't worth
fighting for

764
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,880
Queers! You'll pay for this

765
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,000
They must be on holiday

766
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,240
Let's go

767
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,160
- At last!
- Where am I?

768
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,680
You've had an accident

769
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,040
An accident?

770
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,160
- I don't remember anything
- Nothing at all?

771
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,360
Touch anything in his home, and I'll
report you. I've called a lawyer...

772
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,680
He's awake, doctor.
But he's lost his memory

773
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,040
- We'll come with you
- No, you won't

774
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,720
- We'll help him recover his memory
- We've got other methods

775
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,760
Careful. A cover-up is
also a crime

776
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,040
And torturing a patient
is an act of charity?

777
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:48,040
We'll wait outside. You're not
a Chief Inspector yet

778
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,120
- Leave us alone
- Yes. Excuse me

779
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,320
So you don't remember anything?

780
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,960
Who am I?
Why are those men there?

781
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,520
They're police. Your name's Pablo.
A friend of yours was murdered

782
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,480
<i>Mysterious death in</i>
<i>the lighthouse</i>

783
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,120
Did I kill him?

784
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,360
No. They suspect a friend of yours.
Laura

785
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,600
So they want to question you

786
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,520
I've called a lawyer

787
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,240
Remember him?

788
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,080
Rest. You need to recover

789
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,920
- What used I to do?
- Films

790
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,000
- How were they?
- Marvellous

791
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,920
Get better soon so
you can do more

792
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,240
Amnesia will buy us a month,
at most

793
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,480
And if he gets cataleptic?

794
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,720
That's different. If he can't talk,
they can't question him

795
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,000
Hello, Tina

796
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,920
- Guzmán Morales, Pablo's lawyer
- Nice to meet you

797
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,600
- We'll talk later
- OK, thanks. How is he?

798
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,360
He's awake

799
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,840
- But...
- But what?

800
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,640
- He's lost his memory
- I must see him

801
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,200
She looks like a real woman

802
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,200
- Who are you?
- Your sister, Tina Quintero

803
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,800
My God, you don't remember
anything

804
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,640
I'll have to fill you in

805
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,320
- The doctor's told me a few things
- Did he tell you about me?

806
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,000
- Mum?
- Yes

807
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,960
- Will she come to see me?
- No, we're orphans

808
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,840
Our father's is alive,
but he's in New York

809
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,440
He hasn't written for years

810
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,640
Our parents separated...

811
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,920
...when we were very young

812
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,680
You stayed with Mum here
in Madrid. This is Madrid

813
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,160
I went with Dad to Morocco

814
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,320
He's a painter, and he had
a studio there

815
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,440
There are things we've
never talked about

816
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,560
It was my fault our parents
separated

817
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,480
I was involved with Dad

818
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,520
One day...

819
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,760
...Mum caught us out

820
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,200
And... well, you can imagine

821
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,160
So you went to Morocco

822
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,560
We lived there a few years
and we were happy

823
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,600
Until he left me...
for another woman

824
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,480
I never forgave him

825
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,520
He hurt me so much, I haven't
been with another man since

826
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,240
- Did I know about it?
- You really don't remember?

827
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,160
Your amnesia leaves me
without a past

828
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:13,640
I'll go mad if you don't recover
your memory. Look, the two of us

829
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,480
That's you, and that one is me

830
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,600
What do you mean?

831
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,560
At first I was a boy

832
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,360
But when I arrived in Morocco
with Dad, I changed my sex

833
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,640
We had decided before leaving

834
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,080
- Did you decide, or did he?
- What does it matter?

835
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,640
He liked the idea

836
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,080
And I was crazy about him

837
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,360
- Would you have done it anyway?
- Probably

838
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:53,320
- Don't judge me now, you never did
- I won't. But I need to know

839
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,200
He's my father too, I suppose

840
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,240
I don't regret it. I'd have given
my life for him if he'd asked me

841
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,800
I understand

842
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,880
What happened then?

843
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,600
After he left me, I got
a false passport...

844
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,760
...and I went to Paris

845
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,440
I couldn't face you or Mum

846
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,960
I only came back for
her funeral

847
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,760
That's when you and I
were reunited

848
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,480
We were both so lonely

849
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,320
And we still loved each other
after so many years

850
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,800
You didn't hold a grudge
against me, and that...

851
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,360
I could never thank you enough

852
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,080
That's why I stayed with you

853
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,880
You're all I've got

854
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,160
Come here. Give me a hug

855
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,840
I can't

856
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,440
I'm glad you're my sister

857
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:30,000
So that nothing happens to Pablo
and he's protected from the police

858
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,480
The Sorrowful Mysteries

859
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,040
First Mystery: Jesus praying
in the Garden

860
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,240
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

861
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,640
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

862
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,280
After three weeks
he's still the same

863
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,960
Leave this case to me, father

864
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,040
Want to pension me off?
I've still got two months to go

865
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,040
Look who's here

866
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,120
I don't want you to go
on a downer

867
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,760
Leave the dirty work to me.
You're too scrupulous

868
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,640
And you're too clumsy.
You'll go far

869
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,840
I feel great today. Here,
split it between yourselves

870
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,200
- And the cocaine?
- Naughty boy. Tomorrow

871
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,320
- And the bag?
- That's for my brother. 'Bye now

872
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,080
You make me so happy.
Watch those two

873
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,720
There's nothing like charity

874
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,600
What's the typewriter for?

875
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,040
Leave her alone.
She knows nothing

876
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,720
Go for the brother.
He knows everything

877
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,800
I'll make him talk today.
I'll show you who's clumsy

878
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,880
Don't take me seriously, son

879
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,640
To be a good cop, being
unscrupulous is not enough

880
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,680
You need a sense of humour, too

881
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,680
I thought I wasn't going to make it.
I've brought you all sorts of stuff

882
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,560
- Here
- What are we celebrating?

883
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,240
Something marvellous.
I've got a boyfriend

884
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,480
I met him when I was picking up
your mail. We screwed in your bed

885
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,160
I didn't dare take him home.
I hope you don't mind

886
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,280
Of course not

887
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,360
I wanted to be sure before I told you.
Are you happy?

888
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,280
You don't look it

889
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,960
- I've something to tell you too
- What is it?

890
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,760
- I've recovered my memory
- Really?

891
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,520
- Just wait till I tell Ada
- Don't. I don't want anyone to know

892
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,280
- Why not?
- I'm happy here

893
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,960
The police won't leave us alone
until you talk

894
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,440
- They think I'm Laura P
- That woman doesn't exist

895
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,320
- And the letters?
- Keep out of this, Tina

896
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,720
All right

897
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,000
Up to you. I've brought
your typewriter

898
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,600
- In case you feel like writing
- No, take it away

899
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,160
What's going on?

900
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,520
Don't look like that. Main thing is
you're in love, and happy

901
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:24,360
I won't be happy until you're back
at work. But if you don't talk...

902
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,720
I'll talk in a few days.
I'm not strong enough yet

903
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,800
I have enough strength
for the two of us

904
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,480
That's how I like it

905
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:39,760
- Want me here for the questioning?
- No, I'll get the doctor to call you

906
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,560
I'm so happy for you, Tina

907
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:47,320
This time will be different.
I can feel it

908
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,000
- Isn't that a bit heavy for you?
- Don't worry, I'm very strong

909
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,200
So I see. Don't lose it, OK?
We might want to confiscate it

910
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:09,600
- Aren't you hot in that jacket?
- Yes, but I feel good in it

911
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,240
How's your brother?

912
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,160
The same, or worse.
Don't question him yet

913
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,320
A man has been murdered and it's
our job to find the murderer

914
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,680
How many murderers
have you caught?

915
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,760
Don't be unfair. The boy's
just starting

916
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,560
Why don't you leave us alone?

917
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,320
- The lawyer isn't here
- We just want to talk about Laura

918
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,080
No one with that name
has come to see me

919
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:51,120
Think she's out there?
On the roof maybe?

920
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,720
Could be a pseudonym

921
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,600
You seem to know her
better than I do

922
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,840
Does Antonio Benítez ring a bell?

923
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,560
- They both know you
- I seem to be famous

924
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,080
And that means you don't
have to talk?

925
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:11,560
If a murder's been committed,
you should find the murderer

926
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,680
Not a poor amnesiac

927
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,360
The letters

928
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:20,760
Both written on your typewriter.
How do you explain that?

929
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,840
You tell me

930
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,640
These letters are not
the only proof

931
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,800
- You're late
- I went to the boutique

932
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,880
It's closed

933
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,640
It opened today. A shirt like Pablo's
was sold to Antonio Benítez

934
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
- He and his mother deny it
- And you believe them

935
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,760
We've got the boy
under surveillance

936
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,880
He's going out with his sister

937
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,280
What?

938
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,400
He's been comforting your sister.
Didn't she tell you?

939
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,400
I should have guessed

940
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,280
Why didn't I? I need a phone.
She's not working today

941
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,000
Let's go to my office

942
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,520
Go on without me

943
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,280
The Glorious Mysteries.
First Mystery: The Resurrection

944
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,520
<i>Say yes or no and don't mention</i>
<i>my name. Are you alone?</i>

945
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,920
- What's wrong?
<i>- Is Antonio Benítez with you?</i>

946
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,760
- How do you know his name?
<i>- Listen to me</i>

947
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,000
He murdered Juan

948
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,680
<i>He's not a bad guy,</i>
<i>but he's crazy</i>

949
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,400
It can't be

950
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,880
<i>There's a cop outside. Don't look.</i>
<i>Don't let Antonio see him</i>

951
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,560
<i>Just keep calm</i>

952
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,640
<i>We'll be there in</i>
<i>a few minutes</i>

953
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,480
It was too good to be true

954
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,520
- Forget that now
- And think about what?

955
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,160
<i>You're in danger,</i>
<i>don't you understand?</i>

956
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:53,000
<i>Act normal. Bet he's looking at you.</i>
<i>Find an excuse to leave the house</i>

957
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,440
<i>Say you've got to testify.</i>
<i>And bring the girl with you</i>

958
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,360
<i>- All right?</i>
- All right

959
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,360
- The hospital? What did they say?
- Pablo is dead

960
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,040
He jumped out of the window while
he was being questioned

961
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,280
You must bring him back to life

962
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,360
He's mine! Pablo is mine

963
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,360
- He wanted to save me
- What do you mean?

964
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,560
Nothing

965
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,760
We must go to the hospital.
You wait here

966
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,000
Wait

967
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,640
- I'm going with you
- No need

968
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,240
How can you be so calm knowing
your brother is dead?

969
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,560
And why are you so concerned?
You don't even know him

970
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,480
Why is that policeman
out there?

971
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,480
Let us go

972
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,440
Who phoned you? How could your
brother jump with a leg in plaster?

973
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,400
Maybe the police pushed him.
Let us go

974
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,440
Run, Ada, run

975
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,960
You go, Ada! Don't touch me,
you scum!

976
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,920
- Go up. He wants to kill Tina
- Who?

977
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,680
- A man
- Come down

978
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,480
Up there. Please help her

979
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,240
- Where's Tina?
- She fought with Antonio

980
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,440
- Did you see a policeman?
- He was down here

981
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,560
- Where's he?
- He went up

982
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,760
- And he hasn't come down?
- Antonio might be armed

983
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,480
- Don't move
- Let go of me

984
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,800
- Give yourself up
- He's got a gun

985
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,040
- Turn the spotlight off!
- Antonio, come out with Tina

986
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,080
- Turn the spotlight off!
- Turn it off

987
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,720
Anyone moves, and I'll shoot her

988
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,640
- Is our colleague there?
- Yes, he's up here

989
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:51,080
Stay calm. Let them go and
nothing will happen to you

990
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,240
Think I'm stupid?
I want to negotiate first

991
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,240
There's nothing to negotiate

992
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,240
Put that gun down!
What do you want?

993
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,320
I want Pablo to come up.
I'll only talk to him

994
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,600
- Will you let Tina go if I do?
- And the policeman?

995
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,040
I will if you come up

996
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,200
I'll throw you the keys.
Where are they?

997
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,000
- What do you want?
- I wanted to see you

998
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,800
Here I am. Untie her

999
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,360
I can't. Do you mind?

1000
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,280
- Is he dead?
- No, I just hit him

1001
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,160
- Try to bring him round
- I will

1002
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,320
- You didn't need to come up
- Shut up

1003
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,000
- Take him away, Tina
- No

1004
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,400
Go! I created this situation
and I have to deal with it

1005
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,800
You've been fooling me, you two.
I hate you

1006
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,920
Go now. Go!

1007
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,160
I'll be back in a second

1008
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,960
Bloody typewriter!

1009
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,160
Get away from there

1010
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,800
Wait a minute

1011
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,120
No one shoot. I'm coming out
to talk

1012
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,320
- Give me the gun
- Learn to use it first

1013
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,400
But you never let me use it

1014
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,160
What a waste of taxpayers' money!

1015
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,640
No one come near the door

1016
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,400
Wait there, in the middle
of the road

1017
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,560
Come on, move away

1018
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,480
- And Pablo?
- He's fine

1019
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,480
Listen to me. I want an hour...

1020
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,880
...to negotiate with Pablo

1021
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,160
Any interruptions...

1022
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,760
...and I kill everyone.
I'm crazy enough

1023
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,400
OK, you've got an hour

1024
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,800
One hour

1025
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,200
I needed to see you at any price

1026
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,960
<i>I doubt you'll ever love me...</i>

1027
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,040
<i>...the way I love you</i>

1028
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,080
<i>I doubt you'll ever find</i>
<i>as pure a love...</i>

1029
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:53,040
<i>...as the one you'll find in me</i>

1030
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:00,960
<i>You'll have a thousand adventures</i>
<i>without love</i>

1031
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,040
<i>But at the end of it all...</i>

1032
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,920
<i>...you'll find only pain</i>

1033
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,960
<i>You'll be ecstatic with pleasure</i>

1034
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,440
<i>But you will never find</i>
<i>as pure an illusion...</i>

1035
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,680
<i>...as the one I made you feel</i>

1036
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,760
Loving you this way is a crime

1037
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,040
But I'm willing to pay the price

1038
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,880
I knew it when I picked you up
at the disco

1039
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,880
I knew it'd be a very high price

1040
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,080
But I have no regrets

1041
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,120
I don't care what happens
in a hour

1042
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,760
And you shouldn't think
about it either

1043
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,080
How am I doing?

1044
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,960
You taught me how

1045
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,040
Thank you

1046
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,640
Cover up, it's cold

1047
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,360
I'll get your crutch
and help you dress

1048
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,480
- Antonio!
- Stay there

1049
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:17,120
<i>Who will wipe from your life</i>
<i>the memory of me...</i>

1050
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,400
<i>...and make you forget</i>
<i>my love?</i>

1051
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:26,480
<i>Poor love, made of</i>
<i>blood and pain</i>

1052
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,280
<i>This love, that saw</i>
<i>both of us crying...</i>

1053
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,000
<i>...also made us dream and live</i>

1054
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,360
<i>How did it cease to exist?</i>
