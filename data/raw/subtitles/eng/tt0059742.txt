What was that about, Sister Margaretta?

1523
01:51:56,835 --> 01:52:00,505
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.
They want to see Maria.

1524
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,550
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?

1525
01:52:04,635 --> 01:52:08,137
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1526

Poor child.

1527
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:13,226
It’s strange. She seems happy to be back here...

1528

and yet- and yet she's unhappy too.

1529
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:20,900
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1530
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:23,903
I think you'd better bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

Yes, Reverend Mother.

You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

Why did they send you back to us?

1539
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:06,195
They didn't send me back, Mother. I left.

1540

Sit down, Maria. Tell me what happened.

1541
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:19,041
Well, I- I was frightened.

1542
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:22,295
Frightened? Were they unkind to you?

1543
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:26,132
Oh, no. No, I was- I was confused.

1545

I've never felt that way before. I couldn't stay.

1546
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,600
I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1547
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:39,645
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.

1548
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,689
What is it you can't face?

1549

- I can't face him again.

- I don't know!

She- She said that he was in love with me...

1555

but I didn't want to believe it.

Oh, there were times
when we would look at each other...

1557

oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe.

1558
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,778
- Did you let him see how you felt?
- If I did, I didn't know it.

1559
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:31,697
That's what's been torturing me.
I was there on God's errand.

1560
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,075
To have asked for his love would have been wrong.

1561

You have a great capacity to love.

What you must find out
is how God wants you to spend your love.

But I've pledged my life to God.
I- I've pledged my life to his service.

1568
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:03,563

it doesn't mean you love God less.

You must go back.

Please let me stay. I beg of you.
