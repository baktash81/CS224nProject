1
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,046
Well, it's been

2
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,674
Building up inside of me for

3
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:51,845
Oh, I don't know how long

4
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,847
I don't know why

5
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,016
But I keep thinking something's bound

6
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,644
To go wrong

7
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:03,148
But she looks in my eyes

8
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,401
And makes me realize

9
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,819
When she says

10
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:13,199
Don't worry, baby

11
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,618
Everything will turn out all right

12
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:22,751
Don't worry, baby

13
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,423
I guess I should've
kept my mouth shut

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,386
When I started
to brag about my car

15
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,014
But I can't back down now

16
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:41,186
Because I pushed
the other guys too far

17
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:45,231
She makes me come alive

18
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:49,194
And makes me wanna drive,
when she says

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,158
Don't worry, baby

20
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,702
Everything will turn out all right

21
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,999
Don't worry, baby

22
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:07,462
Everything will turn out all right...

23
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,172
What is all that crap
on the windshield?

24
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,466
It's ash from the fire.

25
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,011
This is where you're bringing me?

26
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,180
It's rent-free.

27
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,516
Before or after it burns down?

28
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,059
There's nothing to worry about.

29
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,936
The fire's way
on the other side of the lake.

30
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,397
I need a drink.

31
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,566
That's Al Kaiser.

32
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:30,902
There's Don Burke.

33
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,822
He lives here full-time.

34
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,116
Could use a little more lift
in that jump shot.

35
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,785
Girls, go in the house.

36
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:40,870
Fill up all the pots with water
and bring it on the front porch.

37
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,622
We're on it!

38
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,124
It's essential we remain
calm in a crisis.

39
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,544
I'd hardly call it a crisis, Mother.

40
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,838
This house has been
in my family for 83 years,

41
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,131
and it's not gonna burn up on my watch.

42
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,133
It can burn up on my watch.

43
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,681
Hey, it's not that often that you see
a beautiful woman on the roof.

44
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,976
Not nearly enough.

45
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:06,646
Mom loves this stuff.

46
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,231
So do I.

47
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,358
You're both crazy.

48
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,069
Mother!

49
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,863
If my phone's ruined, you're dead!

50
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,284
Mama!
Finny throwed water on Willow.

51
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,744
Girls, I don't want you
to play with the water.

52
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,006
All right.

53
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,591
This is it.

54
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,051
Does it have indoor plumbing?

55
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,178
It's a nice place.

56
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,930
Dog Dave wanted to sell it,

57
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,974
but I convinced him
to wait a couple months.

58
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,267
"Dog

59
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,603
Yeah, he used to have four dogs.

60
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,439
There's only one left,
but the name stuck.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,943
Anyway, he said you could stay here
for the summer.

62
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,945
My good fortune.

63
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,697
Come on, Uncle Monte.

64
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,407
It'll be good for you.

65
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:03,077
You can spend
the whole summer relaxing,

66
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,579
taking in the beauty.

67
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,916
Nothing to do except
for look after the dog.

68
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,631
Make that nothing to do.

69
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:17,175
Well, he'll come back
when he's hungry.

70
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,885
Hopefully not.

71
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,220
My mother has the blazing
inferno under control.

72
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,847
It's okay to stand down, Mrs. O'Neil.

73
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,432
The fire's been contained.

74
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,434
Thanks for your cooperation, as always.

75
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:27,727
Thank you, Captain.

76
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,854
Finnegan throwed water on Willow.

77
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,482
Well, I'm sure she'll be
a good firefighter someday.

78
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,025
Just leave it there.

79
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,986
I can do it myself.

80
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,988
Don't need any help.

81
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,158
Nice to see
you're keeping your spirits up.

82
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,125
Here's your donut.
Is that all right?

83
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,127
Yeah, I got it.

84
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:00,176
Girls. It's not polite to stare.

85
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,520
Why don't we go in
and have some lunch, okay? Come on.

86
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,868
You wanna try it out?

87
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,496
I need a drink.

88
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,498
I'll get the typewriter.

89
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,833
Toss it in the garbage.

90
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,419
This might be
a good place to write.

91
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,921
She's a black-hearted whore,
and I'm done with her.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,572
Aaah!

93
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,699
What's he yelling at?

94
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,035
Life.

95
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,499
All righty.

96
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,175
Just in case.

97
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,012
You want me to write?
I'll write.

98
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,744
Well, it's a start.

99
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,912
Here.

100
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,543
What, does this establishment
not provide its patrons with a proper glass?

101
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,253
Why bother?

102
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:04,634
If I start drinking straight out of the bottle,
young Henry,

103
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,346
I will have most assuredly surrendered
the last vestige of propriety

104
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,389
remaining in my life.

105
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:15,228
And I shall, by all accounts,
consider myself a lost cause.

106
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,106
Well, God knows we don't want that.

107
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,109
I stocked the pantry for the summer,

108
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,903
and there's plenty of Hungry-Man dinners
in the freezer.

109
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,947
Here.
You can use this if you need to.

110
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,992
Dog Dave left a note on the fridge

111
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,702
about when
you're supposed to feed Ringo.

112
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,579
And who is Ringo?

113
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,164
That's the dog.

114
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,208
What kind of name is that for a dog?

115
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,836
Well, it was John, Paul,
George, and Ringo.

116
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:40,837
Oh, clever.

117
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:45,591
Don't expect me to take messages
along with all the rest of my duties.

118
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,176
Hi, it's Dave.

119
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,594
That's me on drums.
Leave a message.

120
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,097
Monte, if you're there, pick up.

121
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,808
It's Joe Viola. We need to talk.

122
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:58,104
All right. I confess.
I gave Joe the number.

123
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,188
Hey, I got some interesting news.

124
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,023
So call me back, all right?

125
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,235
I think you should
hear what he has to say.

126
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,613
And what might be the topic
of that conversation?

127
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,158
Nobody cares
about a writer nobody reads.

128
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,369
Nobody reads you
because you don't write.

129
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,998
Drinking is
a very demanding profession.

130
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,667
And I can't hold down
two jobs at once.

131
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,044
You have always been
your own worst enemy.

132
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,094
What the hell did you
bring that for?

133
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,096
Well...

134
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,891
I wanna remember how proud Mary
was when they gave it to you.

135
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,475
And how you brought it
to the hospital

136
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,810
and hung it on the wall
for her to see

137
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,103
when she opened her eyes.

138
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,272
She was always there for you.

139
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,274
Till she wasn't.

140
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,402
Uncle Monte, she didn't leave you.
She had cancer.

141
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,737
She left me!

142
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:50,907
Well, there's more to life
than the way you're living it.

143
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,160
Stuff your ideas in the suggestion box
on your way out.

144
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,787
I'll be by to check on you.

145
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,874
And when you do, you'll
find me dead by my own hand,

146
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,752
a smoking Navy Colt Revolver
by my side,

147
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,963
and a note of farewell,
to no one in particular.

148
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,548
Sounds like a plan.

149
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,303
He screams a lot
'cause he's crazy.

150
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,348
I seen him swallow a rat
and then puke it up.

151
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,141
He likes to puke.

152
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,060
He sounds bulimic.

153
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,520
Stay outta my story.

154
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,398
He likes to chew
on spiders and cockroaches,

155
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,235
so he can puke his guts out
all over the floor.

156
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,695
But his favorite...

157
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,406
is big, fat, juicy worms.

158
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,492
Finn, don't scare her.

159
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,161
Shut up, Willow Tree.
I'm looking out for my family.

160
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,914
- Whatever.
- Now...

161
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,332
if he even looks at you,

162
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,835
you just make the sign of the cross,
just like with vampires.

163
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,420
Perfect.

164
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,256
You know what he likes
to do late at night?

165
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,966
What?

166
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,760
He looks for an open window,
sneaks in,

167
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,304
crawls right up
to where you're sleeping,

168
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,349
sticks out his long, slimy tongue,

169
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,434
and licks your feet.

170
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,019
Finn, stop it!

171
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,273
If you catch him licking
your feet, do not,

172
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,567
I repeat
do not open your eyes.

173
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,569
If he sees that you're awake,

174
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,197
he'll bite off a toe
and swallow it whole!

175
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,615
Dinner's ready.

176
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,243
Mother, Finn's scaring Flora again.

177
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,245
She keeps making up stuff
about the man at Dog Dave's,

178
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,538
says he eats worms.

179
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,498
Well, maybe he was hungry.

180
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,461
Poor Don.

181
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,339
Yeah, with all that basketball,
he was in such good shape.

182
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:36,554
That is why I always refrain
from any form of exercise.

183
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,916
You'll get to see him again.

184
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,918
He'll visit soon.

185
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,754
What's going on?

186
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,714
Flora misses Daddy.

187
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,053
Oh...I know, sweetie.

188
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,016
This has been hard on all of us.

189
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,393
But you know he's gonna visit soon.

190
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,563
Why can't you and Daddy
get married again?

191
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:32,068
Oh... I wish we could.

192
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,778
You know,
sometimes mommies and daddies

193
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,863
just can't be happy together.

194
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,950
I tried to explain that to her, but...

195
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,703
Are you happy now?

196
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,248
Oh...

197
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:50,503
I have my three girls...

198
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,505
and that's all I ever want.

199
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:12,191
Aaaah!

200
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,111
Mmm...

201
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,071
kindred spirit.

202
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,993
Ahh...

203
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,249
Ah, you must be the dog.

204
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,625
Be seated.

205
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,585
We have some things to discuss.

206
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:37,341
Dog Dave has left you
in my care for the summer.

207
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,136
Right off,
we're gonna change your name.

208
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,765
You are not some
rock 'n' roll icon from Liverpool.

209
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,726
You're a dog,
and you shall be named appropriately.

210
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,772
You will take pride in this name,

211
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,150
and one day, thank me.

212
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,320
I shall call you...

213
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,322
Spot

214
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,824
It's a good name...

215
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,869
even though you don't have spots.

216
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,328
It's not about spots,

217
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,581
as you will come to understand.

218
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,836
Now, I expect to witness
the finer side of your character.

219
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,256
If one of the local bitches is in heat,

220
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,799
she will remain so,

221
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,720
without any assistance on your part
to alleviate her condition.

222
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,393
That's generally
a good way to handle it.

223
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Oh.

224
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,315
One more thing: no farting.

225
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,533
Peace and love.

226
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,660
Not now, Carl.
I've got work to do.

227
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,204
Me, too.

228
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,884
I hope you're ready for me,
Belle Isle,

229
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,261
'cause I'm coming for you.

230
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,665
Is this the Dollar Ride?

231
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,793
Good.

232
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,172
Does your transportation services
accommodate the handicapped?

233
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,592
Excellent, sir,

234
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,346
because if you did not
accommodate the handicapped,

235
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,808
I would sue
your unaccommodating ass.

236
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,578
Buenas dias, seÃ±oritas.

237
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,580
I don't know about you,

238
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,291
but this music makes me
feel like dancing.

239
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,847
Two Ding Dongs...

240
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,392
Bag of Cheetos...

241
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:42,109
And a box
of gluten-free Fruity Pebbles.

242
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,197
Will that be all?

243
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:51,327
Uh, I'll have another bottle
of your finest sour mash whiskey.

244
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,005
That will be $37.42.

245
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,798
Take it out of that.

246
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,760
So, it's Mahmoud, is it?

247
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,428
Yes, sir.

248
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,181
Here is your change.

249
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:15,142
- Uh-oh.
- What?

250
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,395
Classic check-out stand blunder.

251
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,938
What is?

252
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,316
In a word, Slim Jims.

253
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,611
Isn't that... two words?

254
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,448
You're taking
your eye off the ball, Mahmoud.

255
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,949
What ball?

256
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,288
I realize that it is considered
by many

257
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,416
to be an on-the-way-out kind
of item,

258
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,671
but I believe that
to be a rural myth.

259
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,214
Don't get me wrong.

260
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,840
If you have a hankering
for Slim Jims,

261
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,258
you'll hunt the store over,

262
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,972
but if not, a desperate display
like this improves no one's life.

263
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,517
What do you suggest?

264
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,060
Sunflower seeds.

265
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,062
Just a thought.

266
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,023
- Good day.
- Good day.

267
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,195
Come on.

268
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,155
You're such a good boy.

269
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,991
Hi.

270
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,828
We haven't formally met.

271
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,496
I'm Charlotte O'Neil.

272
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:21,542
Pleasure, Mrs. O'Neil.
Monte Wildhorn.

273
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,793
I should explain.

274
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,087
I have a rather long-standing
arrangement with Dave,

275
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,423
since he's away
a lot with his band.

276
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,884
And, while he's gone,
I take care of Ringo.

277
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,971
You're not, by any chance,
referring to Spot, are you?

278
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,223
Oh, a new name?

279
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,435
Well, I've known him
since he was a pup.

280
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,355
Well, there's a lot to be said
for enduring associations, Mrs. O'Neil,

281
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,982
but in the future,

282
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,735
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't walk my dog.

283
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,236
He's Dave's dog.

284
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,072
I'm not claiming to be
his biological father.

285
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,700
Oh... um...

286
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,411
This is Flora, my youngest.

287
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,332
Well, as long as you think
you can manage, Mr. Wildhorn.

288
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,502
And why wouldn't I be able
to manage, Mrs. O'Neil?

289
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,546
No reason.

290
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,382
Come here.

291
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,136
Oh, um, just so you know.

292
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,054
Uh, Ringo-

293
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,641
Um, sorry, Spot.

294
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,727
He tends to get stiff
in his hindquarters.

295
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,937
He needs daily exercise.

296
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,689
I'll take it under advisement.

297
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,780
Now, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

298
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,783
You miss Dave. I understand that.

299
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:40,037
But your friend Mrs. O'Neil
had no right to take you for a walk

300
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,914
without asking me first.

301
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,960
In the future, you will politely decline
all such invitations.

302
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,128
Is that clear?

303
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,927
Now that cannot be the response
to every admonishment.

304
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,097
Al Kaiser!

305
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,390
I'm just down the road.

306
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,684
Got the old outboard
in the driveway.

307
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,937
Where are my manners?

308
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,022
Do come in, Mr. Kaiser.

309
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,483
Can I offer you a Ding Dong?

310
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,859
Uh, sorry. I can't stay.

311
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,529
I'm having a memorial for Don
at my house.

312
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,823
Ah, the basketball aficionado.

313
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,449
Yes. It was quite a shock.

314
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,326
Yeah, well, not to me.

315
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,787
Well, I hope you can make it.

316
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,580
Uh, I didn't know the man.

317
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,123
Everybody's bringing something.

318
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,292
You know, potluck.
See you around 5:00.

319
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,169
I didn't know the man.

320
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,587
See you then!

321
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,717
Did I miss Daddy's call?

322
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,971
Daddy will call you
as soon as he has time, Willow Tree.

323
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,306
Daddy promised
to help me finish my raft.

324
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm going to the island this summer.

325
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,686
What's so important
about that stupid island, anyway?

326
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,105
That's where the magic is.

327
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,606
You're delusional.

328
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,774
Willow.

329
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,861
I just don't understand
why I couldn't have stayed with Dad.

330
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,613
I'd like the two of you
to take the salad

331
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,865
down the block to Don's memorial.

332
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm busy.

333
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,535
I'll go, Mama.

334
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,120
Thank you, Finn.

335
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,997
What do I do?

336
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,250
You offer our family's condolences,

337
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,127
and then you leave the salad
and come straight home.

338
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,837
What's condolences?

339
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:15,757
You say, "We're very sorry
that Don has passed,

340
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,301
but now he's with all of us."

341
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,094
He is?

342
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,597
Just drop off the salad
and look sad.

343
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,558
Ah, I'm so glad you made it.

344
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,685
I brought you Cheetos.

345
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,645
Nice touch. Welcome.

346
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,607
Uh, thanks.

347
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,401
There's plenty to eat,
and the beer is on ice,

348
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,361
just the way Don
would have wanted.

349
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,531
A lot of nice people here.

350
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,158
I think you'll like everybody.

351
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:47,039
I must say,
I'm a big admirer of your work.

352
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,874
Thank you.

353
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,709
I haven't been
a dog-sitter for very long.

354
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,587
No, I'm talking about
those Western novels you write.

355
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,382
I've got a copy of "Showdown
at Red Rock" around somewhere.

356
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,551
It's been out of print for years.

357
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,553
Uh, you mentioned beer?

358
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,055
Beer. Indeed I did.

359
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,266
Hi, Finn.

360
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,102
Sorry Don died. Here's a salad.

361
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,646
Don would've appreciated that.

362
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,397
And thank your mother for me.

363
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,274
You can add the salad to that table,

364
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,069
and be an angel
and drop that off, too.

365
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,696
One of the O'Neil girls.

366
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,323
Sweet kids.

367
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,953
Monte Wildhorn, may I present
Miss Finnegan O'Neil of Belle Isle.

368
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,747
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

369
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,457
Can I get more beer?

370
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,084
Ah.

371
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,044
Mr. Wildhorn
writes about cowboys

372
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,337
in the Wild West.

373
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,589
Boy, I'll say one thing.

374
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,926
That Jubal McLaws
sure is quick on the draw.

375
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:44,137
Many cross his path.
Few live to tell about it.

376
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,639
Now, that's right,

377
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,140
like when Jubal had that shootout

378
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,726
with Deadshot Jim Watson
of Albuquerque.

379
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,269
Whoo!

380
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,188
Say, if I could find my copy

381
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,357
of "Showdown at Red Rock,"
would you sign it for me?

382
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,359
I would not, Mr. Kaiser.

383
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:01,446
I've always resisted becoming
part of the cult of celebrity.

384
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,740
However...

385
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,117
I will accept another beer.

386
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,286
Ah! All right. I respect that.

387
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,007
I'm not really from Belle Isle.

388
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,426
We only come here for the summers.

389
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,761
Is that so?

390
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:26,972
I live in Manhattan.

391
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,809
At least, I used to.

392
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,227
My dad and mom are
getting divorced,

393
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,896
so now my mom says
we have to live here all the time.

394
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,064
Hmm...

395
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,068
How come your mom let you
come to an event like this

396
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,611
all by your lonesome?

397
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,655
'Cause I'm 91/2 years old.

398
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,742
- Hmm, that's pretty old.
- I know.

399
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,077
My mom even lets me have
my own pocket knife.

400
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,288
You don't have no pocket knife.

401
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,957
- I do so.
- Do not.

402
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,464
My! my'

403
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,301
Look at that.

404
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:08,430
That must be about the finest
pocket knife I have ever seen.

405
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,476
You know, you can tell
a lot about a person's character

406
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,436
by the condition
of their pocket knife.

407
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,522
I'd say you were fearless.

408
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,784
What's his problem?

409
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,703
Oh, he's just being Carl Loop.

410
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,539
Willow says he's retarded,
but Mom says he's special.

411
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:38,543
Hmm. Well, whatever he is,
he's a fine dancer.

412
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,797
You write stories?

413
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,634
I used to.

414
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,762
My favorite story is
about aliens from outer space.

415
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,140
Mm. Extraterrestrials
have their place,

416
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,518
and I've met a few,

417
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,854
but you don't have to leave this planet
to tell a good story.

418
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,441
How...

419
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,484
How do you make 'em up?

420
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,402
Imagination.

421
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:08,198
The most powerful force
ever made available to humankind.

422
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:11,493
Here you go.

423
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,289
Hey, Monte, I'm no professional,

424
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,292
but I wrote this speech for Don,

425
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,795
but I'll never be able
to get through it.

426
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,380
I was gonna ask you
to read it out loud.

427
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,298
I've always had a disdain

428
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,301
for public displays
of sentimentality, Mr. Kaiser.

429
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,054
Hey, who doesn't?
Don would be so pleased.

430
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,347
Didn't know the man.

431
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:36,143
Monte has something
he wants to read to us about Don.

432
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,354
So, if you would, just step outside
as quickly as you can.

433
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,232
Thank you so much.
He's very excited about this.

434
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,317
Hi, nice to see you.
I didn't get a chance to say hello.

435
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,778
Oh, I didn't know you were here.
Hi. Welcome.

436
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,322
All right, people,
this is a sad and happy occasion.

437
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,824
Thanks for coming here.

438
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,536
Everybody please say hello
to Monte Wildhorn.

439
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,720
"'Jesus H. Christ."'

440
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,516
"According to our friend Karen Loop,

441
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,518
"that's how most people
around the lake reacted

442
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,521
"when they heard the news
of Don's passing.

443
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,316
"That's not such a bad obit.

444
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,819
"Concise. Even rather eloquent.

445
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,363
"Don would've approved.

446
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,366
"There are people in life you avoid,

447
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,328
"and others you go
out of your way to bump into.

448
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,706
"Don had that bump-into quality
about him,

449
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:44,127
"which is why nobody ever ducked
when they saw Don coming.

450
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,756
"He took beer very seriously.

451
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,467
"It had to be Pabst Blue Ribbon.

452
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,261
"If it couldn't be Pabst,

453
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,846
"it at least had to be cold.

454
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,682
"As good as Don was,

455
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:02,270
"I think he only got better
once he found the Belle.

456
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:05,565
"There just might be something special
about this place.

457
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,069
"It don't happen too often,
but sometimes

458
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:12,864
"we do bring out
the best in each other.

459
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,492
"We'll miss you, Don.

460
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,161
Watch over us."

461
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,335
Don't change a word.

462
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,880
The man at Dog Dave's writes stories
about cowboys in the Wild West.

463
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,674
He does?

464
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,884
Yeah... not about space aliens.

465
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,344
No aliens?

466
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,221
Mm-mm.

467
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,973
You know, you don't have
to go off this planet

468
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,432
to tell a good story.

469
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,687
Mama, when we get home,
can I work on my raft?

470
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,856
No, you promised
you'd clean your room.

471
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,192
Well, Jesus H. Christ!

472
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,569
Ms. O'Neil.

473
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,198
That is a most unbecoming
use of language.

474
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,200
Mr. Kaiser wrote it about Don.

475
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,244
You're not Mr. Kaiser.

476
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,413
Am I in trouble?

477
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,248
You most certainly are,

478
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,167
and your punishment
is to memorize three new words

479
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,962
and define them for me
by dinner Friday.

480
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,964
And I expect to be impressed.

481
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,799
You will be. I promise.

482
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,677
Hmm.

483
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,937
Who does your taxes?

484
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:29,357
I am currently
without an accountant, Mrs. Loop.

485
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:31,151
Karen.

486
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:35,363
I have aspired for years
to someday attain the poverty level.

487
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,949
Having recently achieved my goal,

488
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:41,202
I'm not in need
of such services just now.

489
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,080
I always get my clients a big refund.

490
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,710
You have a positive outlook
on life, Karen.

491
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,587
This is our place.

492
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,756
Thanks for walking us home.

493
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,800
You and the boy
on your own out here?

494
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,511
My old man took off
after Carl was born.

495
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,555
I'm sorry to hear that.

496
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,892
It's no great loss.

497
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,103
Well, if there's anything I can do.

498
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,398
Carl never gets any phone calls.

499
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,985
It would be nice for him
to get a phone call.

500
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,612
Here's my business card.

501
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,533
It's got our home number on it.

502
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,620
Telephone's a damn nuisance.

503
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,581
Ain't got no use for it.

504
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:30,043
And them people on cell phones
oughta be shot dead in the street.

505
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,136
Hey, Carl.

506
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,272
How'd you like to be
my faithful sidekick, Diego Santana?

507
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:55,026
Wanted for train robbery
in three territories.

508
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,194
I am?

509
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,323
Railroad Pinkertons
are hot on our trail, amigo.

510
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,576
How do I be Diego?

511
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:07,122
Well, for starters,
lose the bunny hop.

512
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah, I'm touched by your concern.

513
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,362
Thank God I'm still drinking.

514
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:41,823
Saves me the humiliation
of falling off the wagon.

515
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,950
I need three words.

516
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,744
Have we met?

517
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,626
Did I extend an invitation?

518
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,170
No.

519
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,380
I didn't think so.

520
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,676
You know a lot of good words
'cause you write stories.

521
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,887
I need three good ones
for my mom.

522
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,431
I lost all my good words
a long time ago.

523
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,184
What about imagination?

524
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,727
Should I use that one?

525
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,605
Last time I checked,
it was still available.

526
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,357
Can you teach me
to write stories?

527
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,028
You are awfully demanding.

528
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,698
All right, Spot.

529
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,075
Time for our morning dose.

530
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,501
There you go.

531
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,420
That's a good boy.

532
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:39,631
How come you give him aspirin?

533
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:42,926
Uh, it seems Spot has developed
some stiffness in his hindquarters.

534
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:45,803
And aspirin helps that.

535
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,224
I'm not exactly sure,

536
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,269
but long as he thinks it does,
that's half the battle, isn't it?

537
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,151
How come you don't
write on a computer?

538
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,033
I'm gonna answer your question
in return for blessed silence.

539
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,249
Look at that machine.

540
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,337
I like that you have to write
a bit slower on a manual.

541
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,548
I like the way it sounds.

542
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:26,886
I like the way the letters
bite into the paper.

543
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,932
I like that you can feel
there's a genuine human being

544
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,850
doing the work- Hands off.

545
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,648
What's that?

546
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,694
Buckaroo. What's a Buckaroo?

547
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,738
It's an award for literary excellence.

548
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,617
"Western Authors Academy.
Best Western novel.

549
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,119
"'The Saga of Jubal McLaws.'

550
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:54,414
Presented to Monte Wildhorn. 1975."

551
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,375
Cool. Did you give
a speech when you won?

552
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,711
Yes, ma'am, I did.

553
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,713
Who'd you thank?

554
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,090
My one true love
and three bartenders.

555
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:08,970
How come you can't walk?

556
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,932
Who says I can't?

557
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,812
Why are you in a wheelchair?

558
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:20,690
Can you keep a secret?

559
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,653
Even if they torture me.

560
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,699
I'm attempting to defraud

561
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,909
the Liberty Mutual
insurance conglomerate

562
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,494
out of a million dollars.

563
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,122
What's defraud?

564
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,834
Cheat, snooker, fleece, bamboozle.

565
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,795
So you can walk?

566
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,881
I can run.

567
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,508
But I have to be careful.

568
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,885
If those Liberty Mutual boys
catch me

569
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:52,555
while I'm out for a quick jog,
it's all over.

570
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,557
I can kiss that million bucks
good-bye

571
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,476
and say hello
to Yuma State Prison.

572
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,394
You could go to jail?

573
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,063
Oh, yeah.

574
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,856
But what's jail?

575
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,569
As John Milton once said,
"The mind is its own place."

576
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,496
So what do those, uh,
Liberty Mutual boys look like?

577
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,666
Suits.

578
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,958
Suits, huh?

579
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,628
I'll make you a deal.

580
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,299
You teach me about imagination,

581
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,176
and I'll keep a lookout.

582
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,389
That might be asking too much.

583
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,685
I can pay you,
$34 and 18 cents in cash.

584
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,353
I saved it up.

585
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:44,565
And what exactly would
you want for your money?

586
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,068
I wanna know
where stories come from.

587
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:49,696
Ah...

588
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:50,905
you want a mentor.

589
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,783
A what?

590
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,954
You absolutely sure you want to set foot
into such a mysterious realm?

591
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,288
I'm sure.

592
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,540
You may get lost in there

593
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,333
and not be able to find
your way back.

594
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,044
You said I'm fearless.

595
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,171
That I did.

596
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,134
- So, we got a deal?
- My word is my bond.

597
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,761
Great.
So, when's my first lesson?

598
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,138
You just had it.

599
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,684
Huh?

600
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,436
I can't walk.

601
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,314
What do you mean?

602
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:29,026
I mean, I can't walk.
I just made up a story.

603
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,528
Really?

604
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:31,904
Really.

605
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,490
You're kind of a jerk.

606
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,701
Did you picture me running?

607
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,455
Yeah.

608
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,499
Did you see those men
in suits coming after me?

609
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:45,877
Yeah.

610
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,296
So did I.

611
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:49,839
That's imagination.

612
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,303
- But you-
- Class dismissed.

613
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,222
We'll have
another lesson tomorrow.

614
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:00,683
Okay.

615
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,773
I still think you're a jerk.

616
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,734
Fair enough.

617
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,129
"Jubal McLaws."

618
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,926
You got my last Wildhorn there.

619
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,886
It's gonna run you 35 cents.

620
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,305
It's discounted because
it's missing the last page.

621
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:42,058
Somebody tore it
right out of the book.

622
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,768
That's okay. I'll take it.

623
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:52,652
What would you say if we extend
a dinner invitation this evening

624
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,153
to our local author?

625
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,322
- Yes, Mama, please!
- Oh, God.

626
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,950
But he only eats worms, Mama.

627
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,786
Flora, Finn was just teasing you.

628
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:03,246
I think it would be good
for you ladies

629
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,831
to experience a literary man.

630
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,332
How do you expect that to happen?

631
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,500
He needs a ramp.

632
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,043
We're not exactly handicap-friendly.

633
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,253
I'll build it.

634
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,672
Thank you, Finn.
Let me know if I can help.

635
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,216
It's Dad.

636
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,009
Maybe he'd like
to come to dinner tonight.

637
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,970
I wanna talk.

638
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,930
After me. Hi, Dad.

639
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,808
When am I gonna see you?

640
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,560
Dad's coming the weekend
of Flora's birthday.

641
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:26,978
Tell Dad he has to finish my raft.

642
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,271
When's the weekend
of my birthday, Mama?

643
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:29,605
It's in August, baby.

644
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,607
- When's that?
- Soon.

645
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,109
Tell your father I'll call him back.

646
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,986
No, he wants to talk to you now.

647
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,113
Not while I'm driving.

648
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,200
Today, I will introduce
our summer athletic program.

649
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,245
The traditional game of fetch,

650
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:47,206
which I'm sure
you are familiar with.

651
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:51,043
I hold in my hand
a Major League baseball.

652
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,629
You might be interested to know, sir,

653
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,716
that before I lost
the use of my left arm,

654
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,927
I was known to possess
a mean cut fast ball.

655
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:03,264
Therefore, my affinity
for this wondrous sphere

656
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,474
should come as no surprise.

657
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,728
Fetch.

658
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:14,400
I see the concept
of fetch eludes you.

659
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,612
I blame Dave for that.

660
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:21,240
For the record,
this will be the last time

661
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,367
I fetch the ball.

662
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,621
When do we start?

663
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,043
Start what?

664
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,336
My imagination.

665
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,630
$34 and 18 cents. It's all there.

666
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,465
Uh, yeah.

667
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,011
Well, no time like the present.

668
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,681
What do you see up this street?

669
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,561
Nothing. Just a street.

670
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,107
Okay, try telling me
what you don't see.

671
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Huh?

672
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,570
What don't you see?

673
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,655
I just told you.

674
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,949
Work with me.

675
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,575
See with your mind's eye.

676
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,290
Well, I sure don't see
no cowboy riding a horse.

677
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,667
Well, if you're
looking for Jubal,

678
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,918
you'll never see him.

679
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:15,252
Why not?

680
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,129
Gotta look for your own things.

681
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,756
How do I do that?

682
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,467
Keep lookin'.

683
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,974
I Paid you.

684
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,352
There's a mystery
to making things up, kiddo,

685
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,688
and life offers no guarantees.

686
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,773
You got till the end of the summer,

687
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,233
or I want my money back.

688
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:41,737
Well, I've always done my best
when working under a deadline.

689
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,538
You're invited over for dinner tonight,
precisely at seven.

690
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,085
Oh, dear.

691
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,634
Hey, Finn.

692
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,802
Oh, hi, Carl.

693
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,265
I'm not Carl.

694
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,267
I'm Diego Santana...

695
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,603
train robber and faithful sidekick.

696
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,147
Whose sidekick?

697
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,940
The man at Dog Dave's.

698
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,651
What are you doing?

699
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,111
Building a ramp for Monte.

700
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,529
Who's Monte?

701
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,072
The man at Dog Dave's.

702
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,782
I'm his sidekick.

703
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,201
Good, then you can
help me build this.

704
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,703
I can do that.

705
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,915
Hey, Uncle Monte. It's Henry.

706
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,001
Just calling to see
how that whole killing yourself thing

707
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,461
is working out for you.

708
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,467
It's temporarily postponed.

709
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,844
Oh. Well, the summer's young.

710
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:50,598
An invitation has been
extended for dinner.

711
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,433
Next door.

712
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,602
I've accepted.

713
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,353
What, the beautiful woman
from the roof?

714
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,023
- The very same.
- Well, that's great!

715
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,066
You know what to do?

716
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,192
Eat?

717
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,902
Just bring her something nice.

718
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:03,903
Pick some flowers.

719
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,404
Too conventional.

720
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,281
Well, you'll figure it out.

721
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:10,117
I'm guessing you didn't
call Joe Viola back.

722
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,535
Correct.

723
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,370
Why don't you just listen
to what he has to say?

724
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,914
Not interested.

725
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,624
You take care of yourself,
Uncle Monte.

726
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,375
Not interested.

727
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,127
Okay, bye, Uncle Monte.

728
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,797
Bye, young Hen")!-

729
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,709
Oh.

730
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,879
As I recall,
it's improper to arrive empty-handed.

731
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,256
A mirror?

732
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,967
I figure a house full of ladies
could always use another one.

733
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,428
Well, thank you.
This is quite a unique gift.

734
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:14,640
Do come in, Mr. Wildhorn.

735
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:15,933
Thank you.

736
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,186
I didn't think you'd mind
if Spot came along.

737
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:20,563
He's always welcome.

738
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,315
May I take your hat,
Mr. Wildhorn?

739
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,817
Why, thank you, Flora.

740
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,529
Ladies, please see
Mr. Wildhorn to the table.

741
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,072
I hope you like chicken.

742
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,199
Never had a chicken
do me wrong.

743
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,201
Finn tells me you write books.

744
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:36,203
It's been a while.

745
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,747
No texting at the table,
okay, Willow?

746
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,584
I always felt like a book is...

747
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,253
a friend that does
what no friend can do.

748
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,589
Stay quiet when you wanna think.

749
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,302
Would you care
for some wine, Mr. Wildhorn?

750
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:54,263
Ordinarily, I don't indulge,
Mrs. O'Neil,

751
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,474
but since I may
work my way up to a toast,

752
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,061
I think maybe a glass of wine
might be in order, just this once.

753
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,564
You'll have to excuse me
if I don't get up.

754
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,567
I started reading
"The Saga of Jubal McLaws."

755
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:08,861
It's really cool.

756
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,280
Oh, one of my kinder reviews.

757
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,865
I got it cheap 'cause
it didn't have the last page.

758
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,242
Oh, you're not missing much.

759
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,661
I always meant to rewrite
that page anyway.

760
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,496
Are all your books about the West?

761
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,290
Pretty much.

762
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,543
I love horses.
I used to ride when I was a child.

763
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:26,587
Can you pass the gravy, please?

764
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,339
Good horse is half the dream.

765
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,258
What's the other half?

766
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,552
Your knight in shining armor.

767
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:37,598
Do you know any stories
about elephants?

768
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,767
Flora loves elephants.

769
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:44,146
I'm afraid I'm not a reliable source
when it comes to pachyderms.

770
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,358
How did Jubal come to be
the man who rides alone?

771
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,319
He didn't have much choice.

772
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,531
The end of the Civil War,

773
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,952
Jubal rode home to Texas
to be reunited with his family.

774
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,663
It took a good many years
before he could bring himself

775
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,831
to mention the ghastly sight
that awaited him

776
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,708
when he arrived back
at the old homestead.

777
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,085
What happened?

778
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:10,047
Comanche raiding party.

779
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:11,924
His papa's horse
had been gut shot,

780
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,718
pin-cushioned with arrows
and left to suffer.

781
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,304
He found his beloved mother

782
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:20,266
outside the cabin,
her head nearly severed,

783
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,226
her stomach ripped open.

784
00:43:22,393 --> 00:43:24,019
Remember, girls, it's just a story.

785
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:25,479
Just a story?

786
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,107
I only meant
that it didn't really happen.

787
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,360
It happened to Jubal.

788
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,657
Mashed potatoes, Mr. Wildhorn?

789
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:42,496
Sweet old place
you've got here, Mrs. O'Neil.

790
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:46,166
Belonged to my grandparents,
then my mom.

791
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,626
I spent my summers here
growing up.

792
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,670
Well, I prefer growing up in the city,

793
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:51,880
but instead,
I'm being held prisoner here.

794
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,468
Are you ready
for my three words, Mama?

795
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:58,846
If you're prepared.

796
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:00,764
Can I be excused?

797
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,225
You may not. Go ahead, Finn.

798
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,020
One, imagination:

799
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,022
the process of forming
a mental image of something

800
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:11,358
never before perceived
by the imaginer in reality.

801
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,153
Besides being
the most powerful force

802
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,572
ever made available for humankind.

803
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:18,324
Two,

804
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,326
bamboozle:

805
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,786
to deceive or get the better
of somebody by trickery.

806
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:25,456
Cheat, fleece, or snooker.

807
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,625
And your third word?

808
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,045
Mentor:

809
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:35,174
a trusted counselor
or guide, tutor or coach.

810
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,427
Interesting choices.

811
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,680
I'm gonna be seven this summer.

812
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:42,973
You can come to my party.

813
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,767
Flora, he doesn't want to.

814
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,227
Finnegan. It's August 15th.

815
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:48,645
And you're under no obligation.

816
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,231
To the contrary.

817
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:55,486
I greatly appreciate being included
in your celebratory plans

818
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:59,031
and I will be sure to mark
that special day on my calendar.

819
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,494
Who plays the piano?

820
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,372
I've been trying to teach
these three, to no avail.

821
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,624
Do you appreciate music,
Mr. Wildhorn?

822
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,460
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

823
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:15,339
In my younger days, I was
often complimented for my voice.

824
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:17,466
Would you like to sing for us?

825
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:20,511
It's the least I can do.

826
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,970
Now may I be excused?

827
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,391
No. Mr. Wildhorn's
going to favor us with a song.

828
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:29,395
Oh, a captain born in Halifax

829
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,397
Who dwelt in country quarters

830
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,273
Seduced a maid
who hanged herself

831
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,900
Next morning in her garters

832
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,235
I don't think I know that one.

833
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:39,655
Well, okay...
play something you do know.

834
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:44,868
Um, well...

835
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,870
it's not a song, exactly.

836
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:50,165
But... here goes.

837
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:31,540
Mmm, I would leave
all my windows open

838
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,709
to hear that kind of playing.

839
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:38,088
That would be
one of my kinder reviews.

840
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,302
He's telling me
I've outstayed my welcome.

841
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,472
All right, girls.
Let's say good night to Mr. Wildhorn.

842
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,100
Good night, Monte.

843
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,435
Oh, good night, Flora.

844
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,105
I'll be ready first thing
in the morning.

845
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:57,441
For what?

846
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:59,985
- You know.
- Oh, oh, oh. All right.

847
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,945
Yeah, thanks for the reminder.

848
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:05,866
Girls, you can clear the table.
You too, Willow.

849
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:10,829
Mrs. O'Neil,

850
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,707
I want to thank you
for a very lovely evening.

851
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,375
I don't believe I have ever

852
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:19,254
heard Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata
played with such affection.

853
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,006
You know the piece.

854
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,675
Well, when I was writing,

855
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,844
I listened to all kinds of music.

856
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:31,892
Mr. Wild horn.

857
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,898
Why did you stop writing?

858
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,861
Same reason I gave up religion.

859
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,491
God confided in me
that he's an atheist.

860
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,454
Did your Jubal McLaws
ever love a woman?

861
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,583
Well, Jubal always got the girl,

862
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,878
but he only fell in love once.

863
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,048
That's more than some.

864
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,467
Did they live happily ever after?

865
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:07,261
No.

866
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:11,723
He lost her to the influenza
in "Cattle Wars."

867
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,768
And he never fell in love after that?

868
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,313
How could he?

869
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:26,071
I think Jubal has
quite a hold on you.

870
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:31,285
Well, all the things I couldn't do
in the real world,

871
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:34,830
Jubal let me do on the page.

872
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,751
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

873
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,962
Thanks for the chicken dinner.

874
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,428
You owe me a toast, Mr. Wildhorn.

875
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:51,597
I'm good for it.

876
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:00,731
Your behavior tonight
was exemplary.

877
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:03,900
As a result, I'm going
to lift the ban on farting.

878
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:08,739
A captain born in Halifax

879
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,116
Who dwelt in country quarters

880
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,534
Seduced a maid
who hanged herself

881
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,329
One morning in her garters

882
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,206
Fetch.

883
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:24,046
Maybe it's the word "fetch"
that doesn't resonate.

884
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:29,676
Perhaps "retrieve" will stimulate
some long-dormant instinct.

885
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:32,346
Retrieve.

886
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,848
Retrieve.

887
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:41,521
It still just looks like a street.

888
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:46,526
You're holding back.

889
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:48,195
I'm not.

890
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:50,656
I can't do this.

891
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,574
It's not what I hear.

892
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:55,744
What?

893
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:59,206
Well, word about town
is that I'm known

894
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:02,668
to consider earthworm
something of a delicacy.

895
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:05,962
Where did-?

896
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,589
I have my sources.

897
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:10,384
But I didn't know you then.
You know, I was just-

898
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,302
Using your imagination.

899
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:13,530
Hello?

900
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:15,532
Hi. This is Monte Wildhorn.

901
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,325
Oh, hi, Monte?

902
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,410
Is your boy there?

903
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:19,953
The boy?

904
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,664
Oh. Oh. Hold on. Hold on.

905
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,666
Carl! It's the phone.

906
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,668
- The phone!
- What is it, Mom?

907
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,670
It's a phone call, for you.

908
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,547
It is? Who is it?

909
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:31,965
Well, find out.

910
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:34,342
This is Carl Loop.

911
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,137
Oh. I must have the wrong number.

912
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,306
I was looking for Diego Santana.

913
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,642
I'm Diego Santana.

914
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:43,935
All right, then.

915
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:47,481
Saddle up, amigo.
We're riding into town.

916
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,567
Mom, we're riding into town.

917
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,866
Do you always wear a white hat?

918
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,745
I wear a white hat, Diego,

919
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:03,997
so the folks can tell the good guys

920
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,625
from the bad guys
in case of gun play.

921
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:10,587
What's with the goggles?

922
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,422
Then no one knows I'm Carl.

923
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:15,383
Good thinking.

924
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:23,183
Now if you'll be kind enough

925
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,436
to slide the case of spirits
on to my lap,

926
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,563
this business will be concluded,

927
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,775
and we can catch up
on each other's personal lives.

928
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:33,944
I would be looking forward to it.

929
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,658
What happened to the Slim Jims?

930
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,162
What's your income
this year, Monte?

931
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:48,875
I estimate my gross income
at $34 and 18 cents.

932
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:52,170
A good portion of which
I've invested with Mahmoud.

933
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,674
Sometimes
I wanna pull my pants down.

934
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:57,843
Join the club.

935
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:11,481
You gonna drink all that?

936
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:16,027
I have every intention of doing so.

937
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,320
Why?

938
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,200
'Cause I'm a drunk,
and that's what we do.

939
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:29,124
Get drunk enough,
you'll cry over anything.

940
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:34,212
Real tears are a useful way
of getting to a place.

941
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:37,132
What place?

942
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,134
Anywhere you need to go.

943
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:42,762
Now look out there and tell me
what's not there,

944
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,472
and make me interested.

945
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,103
I see...

946
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:53,857
I see...

947
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:59,070
a girl walking by the lake.

948
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,447
How old is she?

949
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:01,990
What does she look like?
What is she wearing?

950
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:05,744
She's ten years old,
and she's got a ponytail.

951
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:07,704
What's she doing?

952
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,415
She's looking behind her.

953
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,834
Why?

954
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:15,712
'Cause there's a man following her.

955
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,381
So what does she do?

956
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,175
She starts running.

957
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:21,885
He chases her.

958
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,054
Does he catch her?

959
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,306
No. She gets away.

960
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,642
How?

961
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,560
She runs to her neighbor,
Al Kaiser's house

962
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:31,603
and disappears around the back.

963
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,355
When the bad guy gets there,

964
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,523
all he sees is one
of her sneakers lying in front

965
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,525
of an open door that leads
down to the cellar.

966
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,861
When the bad guys goes down
the stairs to grab her,

967
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,571
she jumps out
from behind the big oak tree

968
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:44,532
where she's been hiding and lifts
that heavy door off the ground

969
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:45,784
and closes it on top of him,

970
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:47,243
and before he can escape,

971
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,412
she grabs the rake
Al Kaiser keeps by the door

972
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:51,998
and slides it through the handles,
which traps the bad guy

973
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,833
until the cops come
to take him away.

974
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,880
Congratulations.

975
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:00,966
You just made up your first story.

976
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:02,884
I know, 'cause Carl Loop and me,

977
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,220
we always used to hide there
when we didn't want our mothers

978
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:06,429
to know where we were.

979
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:09,516
Good instincts.

980
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,267
You draw
from your own experiences.

981
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:13,144
Now what?

982
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:16,606
You work me too hard.

983
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:17,857
Class dismissed.

984
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,111
Okay. See ya.

985
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,740
Hey, Mom, Mom!
I wrote a story!

986
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,325
I wrote a story!

987
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:32,205
I'm one hell of a mentor.

988
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:49,199
Monte, you know
that dancehall gal, Miss Gussy?

989
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,451
The one that runs
the saloon in all your books?

990
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:53,244
I do.

991
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,873
I'm surprised she and Jubal
never got together.

992
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,461
Tell you the truth,
I was surprised too.

993
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:05,882
But then, who among us
truly knows the ways of love?

994
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,219
You got that right, sir.

995
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,596
- Mama.
- Yes?

996
00:57:11,763 --> 00:57:13,348
I don't wanna paint anymore.

997
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:15,433
Okay, birthday girl.
What do you wanna do?

998
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,726
I wanna go jump

999
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:18,269
Go jump

1000
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:22,357
However, we cannot leave
Mr. Wildhorn half done.

1001
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:23,525
Thank you.

1002
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,401
Listen, lady, I gotta be
outta here by 3:00.

1003
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,737
It was my understanding
I had you for the entire day.

1004
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,615
Yeah, well, I got a 4:00
on the other side of the lake.

1005
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,206
Mama, look what I made for Flora.

1006
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,499
I'm testing it for her.

1007
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,501
Oh, okay. Take it easy with that.

1008
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:42,836
Be careful with that, Finn, okay?

1009
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,295
I don't wanna see
any one-eyed daughters.

1010
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:45,713
Okay.

1011
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,676
Oh, excuse me.

1012
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:54,180
Jack, where are you?
It started over an hour ago.

1013
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:01,396
All right, hang on.

1014
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:04,983
Hey, Flora. Hey, honey.
It's Daddy for you.

1015
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,526
Yay.

1016
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:15,910
He's not coming.

1017
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:21,332
I don't know why I'm always surprised.

1018
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,711
I just...

1019
00:58:24,878 --> 00:58:27,255
I guess I keep hoping
for the sake of the girls.

1020
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,303
Daddy's not coming.

1021
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,224
Oh, hey, baby girl, let's go jump.

1022
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,685
I don't wanna jump.

1023
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,772
Dad said it would be okay
if I came up to stay with him.

1024
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,774
Willow,
we are not doing this again.

1025
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,318
There's nothing for me to do here.

1026
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,444
All my friends are in the city.

1027
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:51,154
You know,
he can't even show up

1028
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:52,530
for his own daughter's birthday party.

1029
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,949
Maybe he just didn't
want to see you.

1030
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:56,492
That's enough.

1031
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:11,591
Why don't I just go and talk
to Flora for a minute?

1032
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,801
Okay.

1033
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,890
I'm looking for the birthday girl.

1034
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:20,767
You know where I can find her?

1035
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:23,394
I'm the birthday girl.

1036
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,396
Oh, good.

1037
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,565
'Cause I got something for you.

1038
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,651
What is it?

1039
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,027
It's your birthday present.

1040
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,987
I think it's here. Where'd I put it?

1041
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,198
Ah, there it is.

1042
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:36,616
Happy birthday.

1043
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,618
What is it?

1044
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:39,619
It's a story.

1045
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,162
About what?

1046
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:43,665
About an elephant named Tony.

1047
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:46,125
Well, he said he was a friend of yours,

1048
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,420
and he asked me
to write it down for him.

1049
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,089
Is Tony a real elephant?

1050
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:52,715
Yes, ma'am, he sure is.

1051
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:55,051
Thank you so much!

1052
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:57,387
Mom! Look what I got!

1053
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:07,981
Man, that is one hot lady.

1054
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,609
If she was my woman,
I'd never let her leave the bed.

1055
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,987
You know what I'm talking about.

1056
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:18,700
Time to go to work.

1057
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,702
Hey, you like magic tricks?
I'll do one for ya.

1058
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:23,037
Can you make yourself
disappear, Mr. Clown?

1059
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:26,374
Don't call me "Mr. Clown."

1060
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:27,834
I happen to be The Amazing Ted.

1061
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:29,919
Whatever you say, Mr. Clown.

1062
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:32,297
Asshole.

1063
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,965
You got my name right.

1064
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,633
It's magic time!

1065
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,137
Hey! Come on, kids.
Gather 'round.

1066
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:41,055
Magic time!

1067
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:44,309
Pay close attention,

1068
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:48,146
because at no point
do my hands ever leave my arms.

1069
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:50,315
Huh?

1070
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:53,484
Now who here likes rabbits?

1071
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,320
I do!

1072
01:00:58,823 --> 01:00:59,657
It slipped.

1073
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,659
Son of a bitch!

1074
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,662
Hey! Hey!
You spoiled little brat!

1075
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,914
Hey! That castle's
how I make my living.

1076
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,417
- Jesus Christ!
- Help, Mom!

1077
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:12,253
Everybody get away from there
before you make it worse!

1078
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,505
Somebody get
that fat kid outta there!

1079
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,883
What the hell's he doing
in there in the first place?

1080
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,886
It's for little kids.
He weighs, like, 900 pounds!

1081
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:21,471
Let me tell you something.

1082
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:22,513
You haven't heard the last of this.

1083
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,765
I got stuck.

1084
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,558
You don't think
clowns have lawyers?

1085
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:27,143
You better think again,

1086
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,936
'cause you're about to be
hearing from my lawyer.

1087
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:37,653
Reach for the sky, you mud-sucking
yellow sidewinder.

1088
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,863
All right, Jesus.

1089
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,573
Easy, man. Shit, don't shoot.

1090
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,575
I'm so gonna hear
from the parents on this one.

1091
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,494
The Amazing Ted,

1092
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,496
or Mr. Clown?

1093
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,874
Which do you prefer
on your tombstone?

1094
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,377
Oh, tombstones?
Why's he talking about tombstones?

1095
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:55,004
If you wanna continue
your useless existence,

1096
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:58,549
I strongly urge a sincere apology
to Miss Finnegan O'Neil.

1097
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,177
Okay. Okay.

1098
01:02:01,344 --> 01:02:03,888
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

1099
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:05,890
apology accepted.

1100
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:07,600
Now, git!

1101
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:10,019
Oh!

1102
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:12,980
Well, birthday cake, anyone?

1103
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,149
Me!

1104
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:20,113
Did you have fun today?

1105
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,490
I liked it
when Monte shot my clown.

1106
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,450
Oh, well, baby,

1107
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,828
Mr. Wildhorn didn't
really shoot your clown.

1108
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:30,289
He just, well,
wanted to get his attention.

1109
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,333
Can you read me
the elephant story?

1110
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,211
I don't see why not. You ready?

1111
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:36,254
Ready.

1112
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:37,672
Okay.

1113
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:40,383
"Once upon a time,

1114
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:45,179
"inside a finely-tuned piano
in an old house

1115
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:48,141
"there lived a family of mice.

1116
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:51,978
"They had everything mice
could possibly want in the world

1117
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:55,440
"because this mouse family
had wisely invested

1118
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,526
in The Cheesecake Factory."

1119
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:05,032
"Mrs. Mouse made sure their home
was always filled with music

1120
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,661
"by jumping up and down
on the keyboard.

1121
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:12,081
"The only problem they had

1122
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:16,043
was the cat that lived
in the house with them."

1123
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,713
Is the cat gonna eat the mouses?

1124
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,301
Oh, well, let's hope Mr. Wildhorn
isn't taking the story in that direction.

1125
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:25,970
Oh, well, bless you, sweetheart.

1126
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,513
Thank you.

1127
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,350
"One day, on the brightest
of summer mornings,

1128
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:34,770
the littlest mouse heard
a knock at the front door."

1129
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,981
Who's there?

1130
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:38,274
"She opened the door,

1131
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:42,570
"and there standing before her
was the grandest elephant

1132
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:45,156
"ever seen by a little mouse,

1133
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:47,241
"or any mouse for that matter.

1134
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:51,287
"'I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Tony.

1135
01:03:51,454 --> 01:03:52,914
"'I heard the beautiful music

1136
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,583
and wanted to see where
it was coming from."'

1137
01:04:04,592 --> 01:04:06,969
"Tony, a traveling magician by day

1138
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,305
"and an opera singer by night,

1139
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:10,848
"cast a magic spell

1140
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,851
"so the mice would be
invisible to the cat.

1141
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,896
"This made
the mouse family feel very safe

1142
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:19,690
"and everyone was very happy.

1143
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,108
"Mrs. Mouse was so happy

1144
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:24,320
"that when it was time
for Tony to leave,

1145
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:27,323
"she scampered
all the way up his trunk

1146
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,117
"and gave him
a kiss on the cheek.

1147
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:33,287
Tony promptly fainted."

1148
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,626
I think this elephant likes me.

1149
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:55,851
Well, I suppose I could smear
the ball with peanut butter,

1150
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:59,313
but that would be
beneath your dignity...

1151
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,648
and mine.

1152
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:15,955
Well, this isn't
your first raft, Mrs. O'Neil.

1153
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:20,668
Finn did most of the work,
with a little help from Diego Santana.

1154
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:22,128
Ah.

1155
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:25,881
Where is everybody?

1156
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:28,676
Karen took them into town
for some ice cream.

1157
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:30,469
You didn't get to go?

1158
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:32,763
It was a plot.

1159
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,266
So I could finish the raft.

1160
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:39,770
She's had her heart set
on sailing to the island this summer...

1161
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:42,440
and school starts in three weeks.

1162
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:45,735
I see.

1163
01:05:47,445 --> 01:05:51,115
Flora greatly appreciated
"The Elephant Who Stays Forever."

1164
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:53,826
I was hoping she'd like it.

1165
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,455
She made me read it to her
several times,

1166
01:05:57,622 --> 01:06:02,960
and she asked me
if you would write more Tony stories.

1167
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:10,009
Well... I wouldn't
want to disappoint her.

1168
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,859
Hi, it's Dave.

1169
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:28,903
That's me on drums.
Leave a message.

1170
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:31,614
Monte, it's Joe again.

1171
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:33,991
It's really important
you call me back.

1172
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:39,372
Important for who?

1173
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:52,760
- Willow...
- No, thanks.

1174
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:55,930
Come on, Willow. This is gonna
be the adventure of a lifetime.

1175
01:06:56,097 --> 01:06:57,098
Of a lifetime.

1176
01:06:57,264 --> 01:07:00,559
Finnegan is not going to that island
without her big sister.

1177
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:02,687
Fine.

1178
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:42,727
A swing.

1179
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:45,104
Will you push me, Willow?

1180
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,064
Sure, Carl. Hop on.

1181
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:52,445
Whee-hee!

1182
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:54,905
Whoo!

1183
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,074
Higher. Whee-hee.

1184
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,493
Hang on!

1185
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,870
Push harder.

1186
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,621
- Fun?
- Yeah!

1187
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:04,749
Oh!

1188
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:09,420
I think I'm drowning!

1189
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:13,174
Carl! Carl, it's shallow.
Just stand up.

1190
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,508
Help me!

1191
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,219
Carl, it's shallow.

1192
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:19,930
You're not drowning.

1193
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,103
That was close.

1194
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:53,964
Whoa.

1195
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,635
What is it, Finn?

1196
01:08:57,802 --> 01:09:00,679
It's a lunchbox.
I found it on the island.

1197
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:01,972
What's inside?

1198
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:02,973
I haven't opened it yet.

1199
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,558
Why not?

1200
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:06,018
Because there might
not be anything good in it.

1201
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:08,354
This way, I can think there's
something good even if there's not.

1202
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:10,314
Do you know how stupid
that sounds?

1203
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:13,484
No. It's like what Monte says,
seeing what's not there.

1204
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:16,028
I'll open it.
I wanna see what is there.

1205
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:17,863
Maybe it's money.

1206
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,866
Might be a chopped off hand,
Willow Tree.

1207
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:22,034
Don't open it!

1208
01:09:25,871 --> 01:09:27,373
Wow... Look at all this stuff.

1209
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,999
Look, it's a diary.

1210
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:32,127
"Property of Charlotte Reilly,
Seventh Grade."

1211
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:34,755
- Who's that?
- That's Mama!

1212
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,257
Probably everything
we wanna know about her

1213
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,217
when she was a kid is in here.

1214
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,094
What do we wanna know about her?

1215
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:41,679
We should probably
give it back to her.

1216
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:43,180
I think she'd want it back.

1217
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,057
We should make her a sandwich.

1218
01:10:20,509 --> 01:10:21,677
Lovely day, Mr. Wildhorn.

1219
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:25,222
Yes, ma'am. It's shaping up to be
a considerably lovely day.

1220
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,979
More Tony?

1221
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:33,647
Yes, ma'am.

1222
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,357
I'm sure Flora will be delighted,

1223
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:37,526
and I will read this to her
tonight at bedtime.

1224
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:38,736
Good.

1225
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,698
Thank you.

1226
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:50,664
Spot, that lady has a way
of making me sit taller in the saddle.

1227
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,712
Flora, look
what Mr. Wildhorn gave me.

1228
01:10:56,879 --> 01:10:58,589
Tony the Elephant?

1229
01:10:58,756 --> 01:10:59,757
Who's Tony the Elephant?

1230
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:02,426
Mr. Wildhorn wrote a story
for Flora's birthday.

1231
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:04,428
He did what?

1232
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:06,764
Read Tony, Mommy.

1233
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:09,808
- Let me see that!
- No, no. We'll read it tonight.

1234
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:14,229
Today, I want all of you girls to go outside
and play in the fresh air.

1235
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:16,607
Come on.
We can ride into town.

1236
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,486
Monte! Monte!

1237
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:23,989
Monte! I'm calling you out!

1238
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,743
You gave up Jubal McLaws
for an elephant?

1239
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,536
You told me Jubal saved your life!

1240
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,038
Then you shoot him in the back!

1241
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:33,624
Oh, now, hold on.

1242
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,502
I don't call writing about an elephant
shooting Jubal in the back.

1243
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:39,254
Jubal hasn't come calling in years.

1244
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:41,256
I can't write what's not there.

1245
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:43,258
You tell me to see what's not there.

1246
01:11:43,425 --> 01:11:45,552
Why can't you write what's not there?

1247
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,848
You're a no-good drunk and a liar!

1248
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,850
Finnegan!

1249
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:53,852
He's a damn bamboozler, Willow!

1250
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:02,611
Mr. Wild horn?

1251
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:05,656
My sister believes
you're something special.

1252
01:12:05,823 --> 01:12:07,658
Are you something special?

1253
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:11,412
Can't say that I ever
thought of myself like that.

1254
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,664
Well, you'd better be.

1255
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:15,290
'Cause otherwise,
you don't deserve Finnegan.

1256
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,168
I really hope you two make up,

1257
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:21,463
because I'd hate to see you
lose a friend like her.

1258
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:38,480
"Sometimes,
talking to people wasn't easy for Tony.

1259
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:41,316
"So he kept writing letters
to Mrs. Mouse,

1260
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:44,820
"faithfully delivered
by the tree toad.

1261
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:49,074
"Then a really amazing elephant
thing happened.

1262
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:52,119
"When elephants find
they're too nervous to speak,

1263
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:54,496
"they begin to dance.

1264
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,707
"Tony loved to waltz.

1265
01:12:56,874 --> 01:12:59,501
"And before he even realized it,

1266
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:03,213
"he found himself waltzing
with Mrs. Mouse

1267
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,799
under the warm moonlight."

1268
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:19,813
"'8 Open!

1269
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,700
Hello, Joe. Been expecting you.

1270
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:34,995
You might want to return a phone call
every once in a while,

1271
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,414
especially to someone
you've known so long.

1272
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,584
How's the book business, Joe?

1273
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:44,671
Nobody reads unless
they can download.

1274
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,382
Why wouldn't you
want to hold a book?

1275
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:49,718
You've got a dog!

1276
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:53,013
Yeah, I'm dog-sitting
for the summer.

1277
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,348
You seem different.

1278
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,727
You're not, uh... yourself.

1279
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:00,604
Sober, you mean?

1280
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:04,149
Well, I've stopped before.

1281
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,401
And I'll probably start up again.

1282
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,695
But right now, I'm seeing things
with a clear eye.

1283
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:11,198
And quite frankly, I like the view.

1284
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:12,491
What can I do for you, Joe?

1285
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:15,536
I've come here today
to change your life.

1286
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,081
You'll collect
your usual commission for that?

1287
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:20,415
I certainly do.

1288
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,167
I brought Luke Ford with me.

1289
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:23,418
He's waiting outside.

1290
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:24,753
The Luke Ford?

1291
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,880
The Luke Ford.

1292
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,132
You mind if I invite him in?

1293
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,466
Be impolite not to.

1294
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:32,052
That's what I was thinking. Luke?

1295
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:33,887
Luke, why don't you join us?

1296
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:38,433
Come meet
the great Monte Wildhorn.

1297
01:14:40,978 --> 01:14:42,646
Sorry, for just showing up like this,

1298
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:44,690
but Joe said it was the only way
I might get to meet you.

1299
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:45,732
I'm Luke Ford.

1300
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:48,277
You certainly are.

1301
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:50,654
I'm really pleased
to make your acquaintance.

1302
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:53,949
Have a seat.

1303
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,164
Luke is the reason
that I've been trying

1304
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,791
to get a hold of you all summer.

1305
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:06,545
I know you wanted your space,
but he's been rather insistent

1306
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:08,964
on acquiring the rights
to Jubal McLaws.

1307
01:15:10,883 --> 01:15:12,634
- Is that right?
- How about that, huh?

1308
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:15,053
Well, Jubal's not for sale.

1309
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,515
Oh, come on now. Hear him out.

1310
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:21,810
He is just trying to make you
a rich son of a bitch.

1311
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:22,978
I'm already a son of a bitch.

1312
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:26,899
And I don't care to be rich,
but thanks for thinking of me.

1313
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,692
This could be
a real fresh start for you.

1314
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:30,736
Granted, you'll have to take
a sabbatical from the dog-sitting.

1315
01:15:30,903 --> 01:15:33,071
I like dog-sitting.

1316
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:34,907
Monte, I'm a huge fan
of the old Westerns,

1317
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:37,659
and I'm convinced that
there's still some life left in the genre.

1318
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:43,165
"The Saga of Jubal McLaws"
is the best Western novel I ever read.

1319
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,958
If you allow me,

1320
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:47,169
I'd be honored to be the one
to bring Jubal to life.

1321
01:15:47,336 --> 01:15:49,504
All due respect, Mr. Ford,

1322
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:53,550
but my late wife has already
pulled off that miracle.

1323
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:56,511
Then consider your readership-
this movie gets produced,

1324
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:58,889
they'll increase a thousand fold.

1325
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,515
Isn't that what you always wanted?

1326
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,142
I thought it was.

1327
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:09,024
Mr. Ford, I appreciate your taking
the time to come out here, I really do.

1328
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:12,527
If ever there was a man
to play Jubal, you'd be him.

1329
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:16,114
But right now,
I'm in a pretty good...

1330
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:24,289
Most times, real life doesn't measure up
to what's in our heads,

1331
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:27,876
but every now and then,
it comes pretty close.

1332
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:32,381
You happened to catch me in one
of those rarefied moments.

1333
01:16:32,547 --> 01:16:34,925
So if it's all the same to you,

1334
01:16:35,092 --> 01:16:37,636
I'll stick with real life for a spell.

1335
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:41,473
You're making a big mistake,
and I gotta tell you,

1336
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,891
this could be your last chance.

1337
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:45,269
I don't believe in last chances, Joe.

1338
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,270
I've had too many of them.

1339
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:47,980
- Monte!
- Joe...

1340
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,439
meeting's over.

1341
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:56,655
It's real nice meeting you.

1342
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:02,452
That's pretty.

1343
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:05,831
It's Mrs. O'Neil, next door.

1344
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:07,582
Real fine lady.

1345
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:12,379
Right now, she's talking to me.

1346
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:15,048
And if you don't mind,
it's a personal conversation.

1347
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,094
Mr. Wild horn,

1348
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,722
it's a pleasure
not doing business with you.

1349
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:31,440
How much longer are you here?

1350
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:32,649
Couple of weeks.

1351
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:35,652
Fixed all right for cash?

1352
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:37,321
Same as always.

1353
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:38,322
That's what I thought.

1354
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:39,948
No, thanks, Joe.

1355
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,454
You take care.

1356
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,954
I believe you owe me
a toast, Mr. Wildhorn.

1357
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:32,751
Here's to you,
Mrs. O'Neil, and a face

1358
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:36,296
that gives the moonlight
something worth shining on.

1359
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,014
What do you want
out of life, Mr. Wildhorn?

1360
01:18:47,474 --> 01:18:49,684
I'd settle for more nights like this.

1361
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:54,773
I told my girls
that one of the great pleasures

1362
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,609
life has to offer is
their own search after the heart.

1363
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:00,529
Yes, ma'am.

1364
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,575
What would the woman
who captures your heart be like?

1365
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:08,745
She'd have your way
of walking into a room.

1366
01:19:11,957 --> 01:19:13,041
How do I do that?

1367
01:19:16,378 --> 01:19:20,132
It's sunny outside.
There's a light rainfall.

1368
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:25,220
You know how it feels
when a warm breeze comes with the rain?

1369
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,309
That's how you walk into a room.

1370
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:37,065
That's some kind of walking
I'd have to do

1371
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:39,484
to be worthy of such lovely words.

1372
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:41,945
And I'd like her to have your ears.

1373
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:45,782
My ears?

1374
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:49,202
If you don't mind me
saying so, Mrs. O'Neil,

1375
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:53,081
your ears look like
they can handle the soft whisper.

1376
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,878
And if you don't mind my inquiring,
Mr. Wildhorn,

1377
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,255
what would the whisper be?

1378
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:02,883
Well, it would be different every night.

1379
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:08,430
Maybe you could whisper
it in my ear while we dance.

1380
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:12,934
I have it on good authority
that you love to waltz.

1381
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:15,979
And so I do.

1382
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:57,437
Mr. Wildhorn?

1383
01:20:58,605 --> 01:20:59,981
Uh, I'll be right there!

1384
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:03,193
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1385
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,486
I'll be right there.

1386
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:06,655
If it's too early, I can come back.

1387
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:07,697
Oh, no, no, no.

1388
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,450
Not at all. Not at all.

1389
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:16,873
Ah, Mrs. O'Neil.
What a pleasant surprise.

1390
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,375
What can I do for you?

1391
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,210
I have something
of a favor to ask you

1392
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:22,254
if it wouldn't be too much
of an imposition.

1393
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,715
After the way you played the piano
last night, no favor is too big.

1394
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:27,384
Thank you.

1395
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:30,762
It's just that I have to go into the city
for the day to meet with the lawyers.

1396
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:33,431
Jack and I have a few final things
to work out.

1397
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:37,978
I was wondering if you might
stay with the girls until I get back.

1398
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:40,355
It shouldn't be too late.

1399
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:44,818
You want me to baby-sit?

1400
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:47,195
If you wouldn't mind.

1401
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,826
No, no.

1402
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:54,744
No, I accept the challenge.

1403
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:58,164
Wonderful.
Thank you, Mr. Wildhorn.

1404
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:04,504
There's a casserole
in the fridge for dinner.

1405
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:08,216
And if you need to reach me,
the girls have my cell number.

1406
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:10,093
Okay, now, I should be home
before you go to bed,

1407
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,138
but Mr. Wildhorn
agreed to stay with you.

1408
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:15,223
It's okay, Mom.
I can take care of everything.

1409
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,350
Yeah, Mom.
We don't need any help.

1410
01:22:17,517 --> 01:22:18,518
Willow can watch us.

1411
01:22:18,685 --> 01:22:20,270
I know, this is just in case.

1412
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:25,233
And I expect you to behave
like ladies while I'm gone.

1413
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,776
Oh, good luck.

1414
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,111
Oh, don't worry about us.

1415
01:22:28,278 --> 01:22:29,571
You go and fight your battles.

1416
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:30,905
We'll protect the homestead.

1417
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,367
Okay!

1418
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:49,633
Who's up for some high-stakes poker?

1419
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:52,802
Five-card draw.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks wild?

1420
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:02,896
I'll play

1421
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:05,065
How much you got?

1422
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:07,567
Mom! Mom, wait!

1423
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:16,076
Is Dad gonna be there?

1424
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,371
Or is it just the lawyers?

1425
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:21,706
Dad will be there.

1426
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:25,335
Will you say hello for me?

1427
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:27,712
Of course.

1428
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,301
I love you, Mom.

1429
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:38,139
I love you, too.

1430
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:57,909
Come on, Flora! Jump.

1431
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:03,498
Whoo!

1432
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,058
That's quite an arm you got there.

1433
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:28,857
You ever play any ball?

1434
01:24:37,073 --> 01:24:39,117
When I was 17 years old,

1435
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:42,203
I could throw a baseball
90 miles an hour.

1436
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,956
Had a real live arm.

1437
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:51,463
Got me a minor league contract
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

1438
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:53,882
I played eight years
with the Memphis Chickasaws

1439
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:56,259
and the Portland Beavers.

1440
01:24:56,426 --> 01:24:59,721
Double A, Triple A.

1441
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:03,683
Even worked my way up to the bigs
at the end of a couple of seasons.

1442
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:09,522
One summer day,
we were playing a doubleheader.

1443
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:12,901
I was pitching the opener.

1444
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:18,364
First batter steps into the box.

1445
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:21,117
I leaned in to get the sign,

1446
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,244
and out of the corner of my eye,

1447
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:27,999
I saw the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen in my life.

1448
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:33,922
She takes a seat right
behind the catcher,

1449
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:37,300
and I can't take my eyes off her.

1450
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:40,094
I was knocked out in the first inning.

1451
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,890
But it was worth it.

1452
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:46,935
Her name was Mary,

1453
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:49,604
and we were married
eight months later.

1454
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:54,776
She wanted to have a lot of kids.

1455
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:56,277
I was all right with that.

1456
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:00,532
Two days before my 25th birthday,

1457
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:02,951
I got a call from the Cardinals.

1458
01:26:03,117 --> 01:26:04,327
They needed a new starter.

1459
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,332
I was on my way home
from the ballpark

1460
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:11,000
to tell Mary the good news...

1461
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:14,170
when a drunk driver ran a red light...

1462
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:18,633
I ended up in this chair.

1463
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:26,391
I was sure Mary would leave me.

1464
01:26:26,558 --> 01:26:28,935
There were times
when I almost wished she would.

1465
01:26:31,563 --> 01:26:33,773
But she never gave up on me.

1466
01:26:35,817 --> 01:26:37,443
She used to tell me,

1467
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,238
one door closes,
another one opens.

1468
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,617
I didn't buy into it
until one day I looked up

1469
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:47,412
and there was Jubal McLaws,

1470
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:52,083
a half smile on his face,
staring right back at me.

1471
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:59,215
Jubal and Mary
gave me my life back.

1472
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,930
Six years ago, Mary died...

1473
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,226
and Jubal went with her.

1474
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:14,314
All doors closed,

1475
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,690
bolted shut.

1476
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:21,154
Until one day,

1477
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:23,990
a nine year-old girl
named Finnegan O'Neil

1478
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:29,621
showed up at my door
and gave me back my legs.

1479
01:27:36,586 --> 01:27:37,837
How did I do that?

1480
01:27:40,465 --> 01:27:41,883
By believing with me.

1481
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:46,304
That's how I was able
to dance in the moonlight.

1482
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:50,016
You danced?

1483
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:53,478
In my mind, I sure did.

1484
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:01,819
Can't they fix you?

1485
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:04,864
No, Finn, they can't.

1486
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,288
Maybe you'll get a miracle.

1487
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:18,920
The way I see it,
I already got my miracle.

1488
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:27,762
Okay, so first you go to "contacts."

1489
01:28:27,929 --> 01:28:29,180
What's "contacts"?

1490
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:30,932
It's the thing that looks like a book.

1491
01:28:31,099 --> 01:28:32,308
I see a clock.

1492
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:33,643
It's next to the clock, see?

1493
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,436
All right. How do I get there?

1494
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:37,480
- See the little ball in the middle?
- Yeah.

1495
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:39,482
- Roll it.
- Roll it.

1496
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:40,566
With your thumb.

1497
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:43,027
With my thumb, okay.

1498
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:45,363
Oh! There it is. Now what?

1499
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:47,365
Press it.

1500
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:51,285
Now it's showing me the time.

1501
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:53,538
That's because you rolled it
while pressing it. Go back one.

1502
01:28:53,705 --> 01:28:55,957
Ah, I don't believe I will.

1503
01:28:56,124 --> 01:28:59,002
Like I stated at the outset,
it's not for me.

1504
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:02,088
Now, who can I interest
in a Mr. Pibb?

1505
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:03,673
Me.

1506
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,341
Come on.

1507
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:13,850
Uh... you let me know
if I'm doing something wrong.

1508
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:17,186
I never put kids to bed before.

1509
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,396
We'll help you, Monte.

1510
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:20,565
Oh...

1511
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:23,026
Shouldn't Mama be home now?

1512
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:24,360
She just texted me.

1513
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:25,778
She'll be home in a couple of hours.

1514
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:32,160
Well, now.

1515
01:29:37,498 --> 01:29:39,375
All right, then...

1516
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:43,379
get some shuteye.

1517
01:30:01,189 --> 01:30:03,399
We're in Dog Dave's bed.

1518
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:17,371
I couldn't agree more.

1519
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:20,374
A night like this
certainly puts you in the mood.

1520
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,836
Good evening, Mr. Wildhorn.

1521
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:25,505
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1522
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:26,923
Oh, that's all right.

1523
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:29,759
I didn't know what to do,

1524
01:30:29,926 --> 01:30:32,386
so I put the little ones
in Dog Dave's bed.

1525
01:30:33,888 --> 01:30:36,474
That'll be all they remember
about this summer.

1526
01:30:38,309 --> 01:30:39,560
Willow fell asleep on the couch.

1527
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:40,853
I hope they weren't too much trouble.

1528
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,772
Oh, just the opposite.

1529
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:49,403
Well, I guess I better
take 'em off your hands.

1530
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,865
I don't mind
if you wanna leave 'em for the night.

1531
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:54,450
Are you sure?

1532
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:56,494
It'd be a shame
to wake 'em at this hour.

1533
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:59,831
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

1534
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,379
Well, uh...

1535
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:08,297
I better be getting back.

1536
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:11,509
If you don't feel too tired,
you might wanna sit a spell.

1537
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:14,846
Okay.

1538
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:25,022
I'm gonna miss this place.

1539
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:27,900
Where will you go?

1540
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:31,821
Not quite sure.

1541
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:34,740
I have some cat-sitting
prospects in Mexico.

1542
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,580
I thought I'd try Nueva Rosita.

1543
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:43,082
It's a little town I wrote about

1544
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:45,459
when Jubal was holed up
down in those parts

1545
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,962
hiding out from a posse.

1546
01:31:48,129 --> 01:31:50,173
Figured it'd be
a good place to write.

1547
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:53,926
I'm glad you're writing again.

1548
01:31:55,344 --> 01:31:58,973
Flora just loves the Tony stories.

1549
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:02,977
So you said. What about you?

1550
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,486
I'm greatly fond of them as well.

1551
01:32:20,161 --> 01:32:22,163
This has been a wonderful summer.

1552
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:29,962
There's only one thing
that I know I'll wish I had done.

1553
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:32,965
What's that?

1554
01:32:35,218 --> 01:32:37,803
Had our waltz in the moonlight.

1555
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:47,688
I know what you mean.

1556
01:32:55,613 --> 01:32:56,989
Sure you don't want me
to take the girls?

1557
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:58,783
I mean,
where are you gonna sleep?

1558
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:02,203
Ah, sleeping under the stars
has never been a hardship.

1559
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:05,539
Well...

1560
01:33:08,209 --> 01:33:10,628
I guess I'll just come back
and get them in the morning.

1561
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:14,340
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

1562
01:33:24,934 --> 01:33:26,435
Good night, Mr. Wildhorn.

1563
01:33:49,709 --> 01:33:51,711
He's sleeping.

1564
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:04,473
Sorry, Monte.
We were sneaking out.

1565
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,267
We want to surprise Mama.

1566
01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:10,021
Well, your sneaking skills
could use a little work.

1567
01:34:18,696 --> 01:34:20,656
Should we wake her up?

1568
01:34:20,823 --> 01:34:22,533
No, I think we should let her sleep.

1569
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,995
When do you think she'll wake up?

1570
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:28,372
Oh, good, you're up.

1571
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:32,793
Oh, good morning, girls.

1572
01:34:35,338 --> 01:34:38,007
To what do I owe this lovely intrusion?

1573
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:41,344
Here. This is for you.

1574
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:44,680
Oh, wow!

1575
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,647
My goodness. Where...?

1576
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,524
I found it on the island.

1577
01:34:57,193 --> 01:34:59,278
Oh...

1578
01:34:59,445 --> 01:35:00,613
Eat the sandwich.

1579
01:35:02,365 --> 01:35:04,325
I haven't seen this since-

1580
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:06,369
Eat the sandwich.

1581
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:07,620
Okay.

1582
01:35:10,456 --> 01:35:12,083
Mmm...

1583
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,417
Do you like it?

1584
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:14,710
I love it.

1585
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17,088
Come here. Come here, you three.

1586
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:27,556
Was the alcohol defective?

1587
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:29,975
Changing my ways, Mahmoud.

1588
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:32,353
Uh, two Slim Jims, please.

1589
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:44,073
You know,
I'm leaving tomorrow, Carl.

1590
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,241
Okay.

1591
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:51,038
Does that mean
I can't be Diego anymore?

1592
01:35:51,205 --> 01:35:53,749
No, you can be anybody
you want to be.

1593
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:57,711
But I gotta tell you,
I kind of miss that Carl fella.

1594
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:59,088
He's very special.

1595
01:36:01,048 --> 01:36:03,050
I'm Carl.

1596
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:06,303
Danged if you're not.

1597
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,098
I wanted to give you something
to remember me by.

1598
01:36:15,312 --> 01:36:16,939
Fits good.

1599
01:36:17,106 --> 01:36:19,066
A little sweaty.

1600
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:21,902
So long, partner.

1601
01:36:37,543 --> 01:36:38,836
What are you planting?

1602
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:41,046
Pumpkins.

1603
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,716
Thought it'd be nice if we grow
our own for Halloween.

1604
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:45,468
Need some help?

1605
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:46,677
Sure.

1606
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:55,060
What do you do?

1607
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:56,395
Well, it's easy.

1608
01:36:56,562 --> 01:37:00,441
You just dig a little hole
and drop one in.

1609
01:37:00,608 --> 01:37:02,610
I think I can handle that.

1610
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:07,990
How is Dad?

1611
01:37:09,867 --> 01:37:10,951
He's okay.

1612
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:13,913
How are you doing?

1613
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:16,916
I'm okay.

1614
01:37:18,209 --> 01:37:19,627
What about you?

1615
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,795
What's going on with you,
Willow Tree?

1616
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:26,842
I never thought
about your parents getting divorced.

1617
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:32,056
I read your diary.

1618
01:37:35,809 --> 01:37:37,102
I kind of figured.

1619
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:43,609
It's weird, Mom,
but the fact that you felt so bad...

1620
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:46,445
kind of made me feel better.

1621
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:49,740
Is that wrong?

1622
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:52,701
No.

1623
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:56,830
I'm glad you read it.

1624
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:05,965
All right, big guy,
Last Chance Saloon.

1625
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:09,885
Fetch.

1626
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:17,434
I respect consistency.

1627
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:39,665
Well, just the person I wanted to see.

1628
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:41,917
Come on in.
I got a couple of things for you.

1629
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:47,631
There you go.

1630
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:49,633
$34.

1631
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,511
I'm afraid I'll have
to owe you the 18 cents.

1632
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:55,306
But you taught me
what you said you would.

1633
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:58,809
Yeah, but I wasn't counting
on you teaching me a whole lot.

1634
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:00,769
Go on, take it.

1635
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:04,857
Thanks.

1636
01:39:05,024 --> 01:39:06,859
Wait. I ain't done.

1637
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:15,534
What's this?

1638
01:39:15,701 --> 01:39:19,413
I don't like it
when my fans get short-changed.

1639
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:22,166
You said you were
missing the last page of the saga.

1640
01:39:22,333 --> 01:39:25,794
That's what I meant to write
in the first place.

1641
01:39:27,379 --> 01:39:29,340
Wow...

1642
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:31,717
Now you have
to promise me something.

1643
01:39:31,884 --> 01:39:33,594
Okay.

1644
01:39:33,761 --> 01:39:38,182
Never stop looking
for what's not there.

1645
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:42,227
I promise.

1646
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:43,937
Good.

1647
01:39:46,398 --> 01:39:48,233
I'm leaving early in the morning,

1648
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:53,364
so we'd best say
our proper good-byes here and now.

1649
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:57,076
Do you have to go?

1650
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:02,539
If I ever had me a little girl...

1651
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:06,043
I guess I'd want her to be you.

1652
01:40:54,675 --> 01:40:56,510
Well, I'll be damned.

1653
01:41:21,869 --> 01:41:23,287
Be careful with that.

1654
01:41:26,999 --> 01:41:29,877
You sure you'll
be all right with Spot?

1655
01:41:30,043 --> 01:41:32,296
He'll be well taken care of,
Mr. Wildhorn.

1656
01:41:32,463 --> 01:41:37,468
Ah... I think it's about time
we dispensed with the formalities.

1657
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:39,261
Call me Monte.

1658
01:41:41,013 --> 01:41:41,847
Monte.

1659
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:43,807
Charlotte.

1660
01:41:45,768 --> 01:41:48,187
It's nice to be
on a first-name basis.

1661
01:41:52,274 --> 01:41:53,400
Well, I think that's everything.

1662
01:41:53,567 --> 01:41:55,194
But I'll give it one last look.

1663
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,820
Okay.

1664
01:41:56,987 --> 01:41:58,447
Wait! Wait!

1665
01:41:58,614 --> 01:42:00,616
Wait a second!

1666
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:06,538
Here. This is for you.

1667
01:42:06,705 --> 01:42:08,707
Do you like it?

1668
01:42:08,874 --> 01:42:12,127
Oh... it's a surprisingly
accurate rendering,

1669
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:14,171
and I shall cherish it.

1670
01:42:14,338 --> 01:42:15,380
Thank you.

1671
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:18,008
Remember, you owe me 18 cents.

1672
01:42:18,175 --> 01:42:21,220
The debt weighs heavily.

1673
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:55,504
Hi, Mom.

1674
01:42:55,671 --> 01:42:57,381
Hey, how was school?

1675
01:42:57,548 --> 01:42:58,590
Good.

1676
01:42:58,757 --> 01:42:59,758
What did you do?

1677
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:01,468
Nothing.

1678
01:43:01,635 --> 01:43:03,720
Uh-huh.

1679
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,514
Do we have any more Gushers?

1680
01:43:05,681 --> 01:43:08,016
- You'll have to check.
- Okay.

1681
01:43:08,183 --> 01:43:09,309
Melanie is such a freak.

1682
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:10,894
I'm dropping her
as a friend off Facebook.

1683
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:14,690
Uh-huh... And what's going on
with you and Kyle?

1684
01:43:14,857 --> 01:43:18,402
Nothing. Ava says he likes me,
but he's too shy.

1685
01:43:18,569 --> 01:43:20,612
Well, why don't you just
go up and talk to him?

1686
01:43:20,779 --> 01:43:23,031
Mom, you don't know anything.

1687
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:26,034
Apparently not.

1688
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:36,753
Charlotte,
sorry I haven't been in touch,

1689
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:42,301
but it's taken me a while
to master this e-mail texting thing.

1690
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:44,469
I hope the girls are all doing well,

1691
01:43:44,636 --> 01:43:47,556
and I hope you're keeping up
with your piano playing.

1692
01:43:47,723 --> 01:43:49,600
I've been pretty busy lately.

1693
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:53,270
I'm happy to report that I've found
the perfect place to write.

1694
01:43:53,437 --> 01:43:56,440
I liked it so much,
I went ahead and bought it.

1695
01:43:56,607 --> 01:43:58,775
Oh, I should say Jubal bought it.

1696
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:00,819
I sold the movie rights.

1697
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:02,696
I'm pretty sure you'd approve.

1698
01:44:21,757 --> 01:44:24,092
Dog Dave drove a hard bargain.

1699
01:44:24,259 --> 01:44:26,970
Said he would only sell
if I agreed to take Spot.

1700
01:44:29,306 --> 01:44:30,974
What happened to-?

1701
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:33,560
Mexico?

1702
01:44:33,727 --> 01:44:36,063
Never quite made it.

1703
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:37,773
A writer needs inspiration.

1704
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:40,776
And I thought the odds
of seeing you down there.

1705
01:44:40,943 --> 01:44:43,111
Well...

1706
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:47,157
Monte! Monte's here!
Monte's here!

1707
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:49,785
Willow, Flora! Monte's here!

1708
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:53,246
Monte!

1709
01:44:58,085 --> 01:44:59,795
You come to visit us, Monte?

1710
01:44:59,962 --> 01:45:01,213
Well, if it's
all the same to you ladies,

1711
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:04,216
I thought I'd stay a while.

1712
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:07,094
Looking forward to having
you as a neighbor, Mr. Wildhorn.

1713
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,929
Just keep the noise down,
Mrs. O'Neil.
