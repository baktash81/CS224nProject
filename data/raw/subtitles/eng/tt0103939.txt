1
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,522
Come on, Charlie. Stop messing
about. We really have to get down to it now.

2
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,651
I just hope our friendship
survives the day, that's all.

3
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,029
Oh, George,
don't be so melodramatic.

4
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,782
Well, it's
your autobiography, Charlie.

5
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:07,246
And as your editor, I have to tell you
that parts of the manuscript

6
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,416
are pretty vague, to say the least.
I mean, for instance, your mother.

7
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,586
Now, when did she first lose control?

8
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,089
We need to know those facts.

9
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,757
It's hard to say.

10
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,679
She could be so wonderful
on her good days.

11
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,018
Can't hear you, love!

12
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,020
- Come on, get on with it!
- Get off!

13
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,147
Silly woman! Get off, you silly cow!

14
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,361
Come on, Mum!

15
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,738
We want our money back!

16
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,407
- Come on!
- What's the matter with you?

17
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,575
Get off!

18
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,126
Off! Off! Quick, lady, off!

19
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,337
Listen, listen. Come on. Cut it out!

20
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,089
Off!

21
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,133
You're out of it. Finished.

22
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,138
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen!

23
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,515
Ladies and gentlemen,
retaining your special attention...

24
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,310
Come on! Play the game! Play fair, lads.

25
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,687
Play the game! Come on, lads!

26
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,607
- Stop! Please, sir!
- Get off the stage!

27
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,359
Get off the bloody stage!

28
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,402
- Isn't he cute?
- We got another lovely act for you...

29
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,946
- What?
- Mister, I know it. I can do the song.

30
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,324
Says he knows it, let him do it!
- Let him have a go!

31
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,409
Give the boy a chance, then!

32
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,787
What's your name, son?

33
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,663
- Charles.
- Charles, Charles what?

34
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,457
- Charles Chaplin.
- Charles Chaplin.

35
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,710
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
at very short notice and at great expense,

36
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:24,132
for your special pleasure, we're delighted
to present Master Charles Chaplin.

37
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,844
Half a mo!

38
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,807
Ready?

39
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,238
Your mother never sang again?
No. Never.

40
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,659
I'm warning you, Mrs. Chaplin,
if I don't get me rent, I'll report you!

41
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,036
Them two little mites ain't fed proper!

42
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,920
If I don't get me rent today, I'll report you!

43
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,174
You're two months behind!

44
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,344
The rent? Rent?

45
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,888
What on Earth is that?

46
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,640
Oh, shut up, you ghastly woman!

47
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,269
Go on, Mum.

48
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,736
Sorry it's only fish heads again, darlings.

49
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,703
I'll get you a plum cake one day.

50
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,706
When my ship comes in.

51
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,260
Mum? Someone's coming!

52
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,269
Mrs. Chaplin?

53
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,567
These are your children, I take it?

54
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,489
Not the workhouse.

55
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,282
For their own good.

56
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,535
Stop! Come back here!

57
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,036
Stop him!

58
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,289
Stop, you little...

59
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,292
Come here! We've got...

60
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,461
Come here, you little...

61
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,549
We've got him!

62
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,480
Syd!

63
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,774
Syd!

64
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,777
Now, then. Up you go.

65
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,112
Syd!

66
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,450
Get off! Put me down! Let me go!
Let go of me.

67
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,785
You were beaten?

68
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,870
With a cane as thick
as a man's thumb.

69
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,455
And Syd?

70
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,000
Sent to a training ship.
Then to sea.

71
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,671
You don't tell us how long you
spent in the workhouse, or how you got out.

72
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,507
I don't? That's a mistake.
I was there for a year.

73
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,385
Um, my mother started taking in piecework.

74
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,804
Sewing gloves.

75
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,558
So, while you were growing up,
it was just the two of you.

76
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,395
- Your father?
What about my father?

77
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,732
Well, he died during that period,
didn't he? When you were 12.

78
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,234
- You don't write very much about him.
I don't know very much about him.

79
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,695
He left just after I was born,
he sang on the stage, he died of drink.

80
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,655
What else should I say?

81
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,199
Well, this is your book
we're talking about, Charlie.

82
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,535
It's your life. It's up to you.

83
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,752
Hold your horse, gov.
Hold your horse, gov.

84
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,588
What's up, Rummy?
All the booze gone down to your feet?

85
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,506
- Don't you give me that lip, Charlie.
Come on.

86
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,593
All right, clear off out of here!
Go on, go on. Now!

87
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,053
Didn't mean no harm.

88
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,475
Watch you, Lil.

89
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,768
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,852
Hello, love.

91
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,569
Hi, Charlie. Know what?
Your mum's gone mad again!

92
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,571
Get off!

93
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,746
Mum?

94
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,459
Thank God you got here, Charlie!

95
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,463
I got you that plum cake, just like I said.

96
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,344
Thanks, Mum.

97
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,490
Make your mark, son,
if you can't sign.

98
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,827
The parish doctor said to bring her here.

99
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,497
Well, she'll be better off.

100
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,877
- What about you, son?
- I'll be fine.

101
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,338
- What do you mean, "fine"?
- I'll stay with me aunty.

102
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,175
You watch your feet, mister!
Shoes cost money!

103
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,053
Sometimes she thinks
the floor is the River Jordan.

104
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,517
- We won't get wet, Mum.
- Yes, we'll do our best.

105
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,063
Why don't you say goodbye
to her now, sonny?

106
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,109
- Charlie!
- Wasn't thinking, Mum.

107
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,210
- Mum, I love you so much.
- I know, I know.

108
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,423
If only you'd given me a cup of tea,
I'd have been all right.

109
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,258
They'll take better care of you
than I can, Mum.

110
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,596
One cup of tea!
You must have wanted to get rid of me bad.

111
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,932
I didn't, Mum. I really didn't.

112
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,520
- Come along, dear.
- You're a lying little runt.

113
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,024
You're gonna end up just like your father.

114
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,243
Charlie? Don't do this to me.

115
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,956
I love you, Charlie.
Don't let them take me away from you!

116
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,708
No, you can't
let them do this to me!

117
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,212
Don't let them do this to me, Charlie!

118
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,509
Don't let them take me away from you!
Charlie!

119
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,554
Why are you doing this?

120
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,128
Was you scared, Syd?
First time you met this Karno geezer?

121
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,799
Every bugger's scared. And it's
Mr. Karno to the likes of you, remember.

122
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,342
If you wanna be in vaudeville,

123
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,720
you don't work for him,
you don't work for nobody. Got it?

124
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,804
Yes.

125
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:55,768
Now, look, if you get this job,
and with what I'm bringing in,

126
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,564
we can move Mum somewhere better.

127
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,569
- Don't let me down.
- I'll be great, Syd.

128
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,656
You don't have to be great.
Just shut up and be funny.

129
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,453
- Morning, Mr. Karno.
- Hello, Sydney. Come on over.

130
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,914
- All right.
- We've got summat to eat.

131
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,998
Ta.

132
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:22,086
Now, then,
what about this young brother of yours?

133
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,423
Well, you know,
he's been legit up to now, Mr. Karno.

134
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,134
But he sings and he dances a treat.

135
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,845
Sydney, Sydney.

136
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,808
I've got song and dance men like you
coming out of me ears.

137
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,226
I need comics.

138
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,772
Yeah, well, his slapstick is fantastic.

139
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,858
You know, he's got the knack. Watch him.

140
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,929
He can do more, you know. More stuff.

141
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,225
I hope so.

142
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,910
Bloody hell!

143
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,502
- You all right, kid?
- Yes.

144
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,170
Need the job that bad, eh?

145
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,422
Yes, sir.

146
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,090
You know what comedy is?

147
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,592
Knowing who you are
and where you come from.

148
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,721
- And it's got to be perfection.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,641
- Can I come out now?
- You may.

150
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,155
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been
a great evening so far, hasn't it?

151
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,493
Well, I promise you,
you are going to love the next act.

152
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,622
Everybody loves elephants.

153
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,002
And, right here on our stage,

154
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:31,174
you will see 20 of the largest,
most graceful specimens.

155
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,302
These are straight from the jungle.

156
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,263
Do you mind, sir?

157
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,557
I'm trying to introduce
our dancing elephants.

158
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,935
Do please take your seat, sir.

159
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,855
Sit down, sir!

160
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,495
Take your feet down, sir!

161
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,163
Show a little respect!

162
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:06,709
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a very big round of applause

163
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,003
for our next act!

164
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,966
Captain Boytom
and his pulchritudinous pachyderms!

165
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,809
Oh, no, really, sir! This is too much.

166
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,817
Kindly remember, sir,
this is a place of entertainment,

167
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:37,532
not a four-ale bar
or a rest home for inebriates!

168
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,289
Now, sit down and behave yourself.

169
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,518
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Charles Chaplin!

170
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,366
Good evening.

171
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,327
Ladies and gentlemen,
for your continuing enjoyment...

172
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,666
- How do, cookie?
- All right, dearie?

173
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,627
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Laurie love.

174
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,004
- Hear your governor's in tonight.
- Yeah, I saw him.

175
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,970
Hello, love.

176
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,556
Hey, Charlie, come and do me up,
will you, love?

177
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,016
I'm that late!

178
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,813
I'm never going to make it.

179
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,196
So, when did it start?

180
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,491
This afternoon. He's only four.

181
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,327
I thought he'd cough his little heart out.

182
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,163
It could be the croup.
You should call a doctor.

183
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,831
I can't afford no doctor!

184
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,792
Yankee Doodles,
five minutes, please!

185
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,877
Just give him a bit
and say you'll pay the rest later.

186
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,004
Come on, girls, you'll be off.
Get a move on!

187
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,839
Can't get this blasted thing
to close.

188
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,344
Here, Charlie, my Harry was in last night.
He thought you were hysterical!

189
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,682
- Charlie, now, how do I look?
- Fine. Yeah, fine.

190
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,559
You're a good boy, Charlie.
Saved my bacon.

191
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,978
Stupid...

192
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,864
What are you doing in here?

193
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,951
The others don't mind.

194
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,869
Well, I do!

195
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,789
You must be new.

196
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,334
I'm going to complain. I'll tell Mr. Karno.

197
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,715
- Dirty, little good-for-nothing.
- Lips.

198
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,258
What?

199
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,719
Lips.

200
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,596
Oh, no.

201
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,393
Here.

202
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,897
I'm still going to complain.

203
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,739
Ta.

204
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,283
Well, thanks, I suppose.

205
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,660
Last again?

206
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,925
Good evening, my lady.

207
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,219
- Evening, my Lord.
Evening, Joe.

208
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,437
Here, give us your coat.

209
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,314
- Thank you.
- Coat, sir?

210
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,232
- Thank you, madam.
- Thank you.

211
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,902
And your hat, sir.

212
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,487
Go! Look the other way.

213
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Oi!

214
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,327
Hello, hello, who's out on the town, then?

215
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,872
- Evening, Governor.
- And in my tails, at that!

216
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,956
Mrs. Karno.

217
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,793
Don't go spilling nothing down your front,
my lad.

218
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,753
Cost me good money, did that suit.

219
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,966
Ah, Fred, you are a one.

220
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,968
You want to watch him, darling.

221
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,304
This time tomorrow, be on the high seas.

222
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,683
Don't say I didn't warn you.

223
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,315
Cor blimey.

224
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,151
Good evening. I booked a table.

225
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,529
Name of Chaplin.

226
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,163
I booked it a week ago.

227
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,500
There's nothing here, sir.

228
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,004
We're fully booked.

229
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,675
There must be some error.

230
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,690
I really did book that table. You know?

231
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,024
I know.

232
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,237
You know,
it's 'cause that geezer's seen us with Karno.

233
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,657
And they won't have theatricals
in them fancy places.

234
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,536
You wait. Someday they'll beg.

235
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah, we'll walk in there, you and me.

236
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:25,379
You in a fur, dripping jewels,
me in me own whistle.

237
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,466
- Whistle?
- Yeah, whistle and flute. Suit.

238
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,050
Oh. I see.

239
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,396
Will you marry me?

240
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,277
No.

241
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,572
I mean, where would I get
the jewels, anyway?

242
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,073
From me, you know.

243
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,619
Engagement rings, wedding tiaras, rubies,
diamonds, pearls, emeralds...

244
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,455
Charlie, I can't marry you.

245
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,252
I can't think of any reason why not.

246
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,133
Well, I'm only 16.

247
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,929
Yeah, well, you know, you get older.
Why else?

248
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,014
Well, we hardly know each other.

249
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,809
This is the first time we spent
more than a couple of minutes together.

250
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,938
All right, well, when I get back from America,
we'll spend more time together.

251
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,231
Why else?

252
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,107
Charlie, are you serious?

253
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,444
Well, were you, Charlie?

254
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,240
'Cause you say you were.

255
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,451
I just want to make sure you got down
exactly what you meant. That's all.

256
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,996
- It's on page 40-something.
-33.

257
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,749
Yes.

258
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,794
I mean, you never even kissed her.

259
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,422
You think I don't know that?

260
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,971
Okay, I'll just backtrack for a moment. Um...

261
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,891
After you had your mother committed
to the asylum,

262
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,643
it all gets a bit vague.

263
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,812
- Don't you think?
- Yes, it does.

264
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,647
Why is that?

265
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,233
Because I don't wish to remember it.

266
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,069
All right, fair enough.

267
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,282
But if you'll allow me to say so, Charlie,

268
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,952
I don't think, and I know
this will sound very American,

269
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,123
but you shouldn't be afraid to let the readers
share your emotions or your feelings.

270
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,375
Know what I mean?

271
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,587
You'll break me heart
if you don't marry me, Hetty.

272
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,257
I mean, or at least say you'll wait for me.

273
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,509
I'll wait for you.

274
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,178
Charlie, how long are you going to be
in America?

275
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,180
Well, I don't know. Do I? I mean, exactly.

276
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,683
You know, we'll be on tour.

277
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,184
Depends if they like the drunk act.

278
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,645
You know, if they start throwing things,
I won't be gone long.

279
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,689
They're not gonna throw things
at you, Charlie.

280
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,816
They're gonna think you're wonderful.
I mean, I...

281
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,198
I think you're wonderful.

282
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,749
But you know what the funny thing is?

283
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,172
You never mentioned love.

284
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, I don't have to, do I?

285
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,261
Number nine, pulling in from Chicago.

286
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,263
Let's get them steer loaded up, boys.

287
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,289
Nickel.

288
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,811
Sit down.

289
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,564
Sorry.

290
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,423
Uh... Have you seen
that English bloke? There he is.

291
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,676
Watch this, Stanley.

292
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,595
I've told you. I've seen it before.

293
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,514
Here look, there's a telegram come for you.

294
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,852
Show it again.

295
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,146
But you've already seen everything twice.

296
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,023
The one with the fire engine.

297
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,983
You'll love this one, Stanley.

298
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,195
If any of them could really act,
they'd be on stage.

299
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,156
Charlie, look. You must listen.
It's a telegram.

300
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,867
That can only mean somebody's died.

301
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,049
Some bloke offering me a job in California.

302
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,051
In the flickers.

303
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,595
It's not legit in the flickers.

304
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,222
$150 a week.

305
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,060
At $150 a week!

306
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,998
Watch your step.

307
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,084
Bye, sir.

308
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,040
Hit him harder, Fred!

309
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,876
Harder!

310
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,380
Put some effort in to it, boys!
This ain't no Sunday school picnic!

311
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,925
That's right. Good! Again!

312
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,012
Good, Fred.

313
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,058
Ready when you are, Mr. Sennett.

314
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,148
Everyone set? Okay. Begin!

315
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,495
- There's someone in the shot.
- Keep cranking. Still cranking!

316
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,459
Cut. Cut it! Jesus Christ!

317
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,630
Were we good till the dummies come out?

318
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,674
Excuse me, miss? Can you tell me
where I could find Mr. Mack Sennett?

319
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,469
What the hell do you think you're doing?

320
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,722
I'm afraid you just found him.

321
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,475
How do you do, sir. I'm Charlie Chaplin.

322
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,604
Chaplin. You sent me a telegram.

323
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,940
Butte, Montana.

324
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,400
You've hired me for a year, Mr. Sennett.

325
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,069
You can't be Chaplin.

326
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,154
The guy I hired did
the best comedy drunk I ever saw.

327
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,781
But he was old.

328
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,532
I don't pay $100 a week to juveniles.

329
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,910
Another one, boss?
No, we'll move on.

330
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,620
Mr. Sennett?

331
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,809
Okay.

332
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,354
You might be Chaplin after all.

333
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,610
Oh. It was $150, Mr. Sennett.

334
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,243
Plum in the middle of the shot.
See?

335
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,788
You really screwed it up,
didn't you, Chaplin?

336
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,417
Fix it, will you, Rollie?

337
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,255
We don't print till we cut it.

338
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,216
That was negative, kid.

339
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,095
Now, I know this is all new to you.
But remember something, we're all new.

340
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,805
This is not an ancient industry.

341
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,891
This whole place here is built around speed.

342
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,893
Start the story, start the chase.

343
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,144
I get bored easy, is why.

344
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,813
How much do you reckon, Mack?
A couple of yards of Mabel?

345
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,859
Yeah. No, make it three.
But don't go thinking we sacrifice quality.

346
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,278
I never make more than
two motion pictures a week.

347
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,823
But I'll spend up to $1, 000 on each of them
if I have to.

348
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,992
How we doing there, Rollie?

349
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,869
In a moment, boss.

350
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,872
"Waste not, want not. "
That's my motto, son.

351
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,002
When Rollie's done, no one will ever know
you were on that dirt road at all.

352
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,504
Just rewinding.

353
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,383
You're on the cutting room floor, Chaplin.
Not the place to be.

354
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,676
Got it.

355
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,847
Go ahead, kid.

356
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,352
Just forget everything you ever learned.
You're not in the theater anymore.

357
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,203
Yeah, that did it.

358
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,040
Thanks, Rollie.
If you need me, I'll be with Mabel.

359
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,626
- Good night, sir.
Good night, boss.

360
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,652
Nothing quite like it.

361
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,321
The feeling of film.

362
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,117
But have I made it clear
how much the movies terrified me?

363
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,743
No, not really. Why?

364
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,912
Oh, well, you've got to help me get that right.

365
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,416
Nevertheless, I was right to be frightened.
I was dreadful at the beginning.

366
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,295
Sennett wished he'd never hired me.
It was all I could do to keep control.

367
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,088
Mario, grazie.

368
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:20,510
The truth is I'd have been a total disaster
if I hadn't invented The Tramp.

369
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,930
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about
the way you've written that.

370
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,934
I mean, the words just poured out.
It practically wrote itself.

371
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,438
Remember, I'd only been with Sennett
for a month.

372
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,485
Oh, that magical moment as I walked through
the wardrobe door.

373
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,782
I felt possessed.

374
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,954
I could feel him calling out to me.

375
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,124
The Tramp.

376
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,301
Bullshit. And you know it.

377
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,803
But the truth was
so boring, George.

378
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,863
Jesus.

379
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,490
You told him to get changed, remember?

380
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,243
What's he putting on? A suit of armor?

381
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,844
Chaplin! Chaplin!

382
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,889
Get your ass on to the stage, right now!

383
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,211
Forget the little limey.
Get cranking, Rollie.

384
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,714
Okay! Begin!

385
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,634
Very formal, everybody.

386
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,933
What the hell?

387
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,643
He's gone crazy.

388
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,773
What do I do? What do I do?

389
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,735
Cut it. No, wait, wait. Hold it. Keep it going.

390
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,863
Maybe he's not so crazy after all.
Photographer!

391
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,240
Henry, chase him around the camera!

392
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,830
Okay, put him in line.
Big reaction! Big reaction! Who is this?

393
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,501
Stay down, Henry. Stay down!

394
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,879
Groom! Look jealous! Jealous!

395
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,464
You can do better than that, can't you?

396
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,009
Bride. Mabel, give the tramp the eye.
That's right.

397
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:12,098
Matron, you're real hoity-toity.
Who is this bum? Good. Very good!

399
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,435
Groom, get mad.
He's trying to spoon your lovely bride!

400
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,898
Matron, take a swing at him!

401
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,109
All right! Domino fall! Domino fall!

402
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,779
Into the chase! Into the chase!

403
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,621
Bunched up! Keep it bunched up!

404
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,622
Good! Good! Terrific!

405
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,464
Look at the camera.

406
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,800
Henry, snap it.

407
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,010
Watch the birdie.

408
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,680
That's enough. Cut.

409
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,558
God damn you, Chaplin!
What are you trying to do to me?

410
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,145
I knew I was right to hire that kid.

411
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,858
Listen.

412
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,862
Charlie, you do what I say
or I'll report you to Mack.

413
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,783
You stand up right now, pick up this hose

414
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,536
and when I say, "Begin,"
you sprinkle the road.

415
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,122
I could do a lot more with that hose
than sprinkle the road.

416
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,498
I could be funny.

417
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,918
Two months and you think
you know everything.

418
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,045
Look, Charlie, I'm the director.

419
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,257
And this is not a picture about
being funny with a hose.

420
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,886
You're right. But it could be.

421
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,391
Chaplin!

422
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,102
All right, everyone.

423
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,480
Everyone in wardrobe.

424
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,773
Head back to the stage.

425
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,901
We need to hurry, please.

426
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,071
Let's keep moving.

427
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,907
Mabel, he's on his way.

428
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,452
I'm not insisting that you fire him
but if you want to, that's fine with me.

429
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,579
I love you, honey,
and I'd love to ax the little limey,

430
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,915
- but they called me from New York.
- And?

431
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,416
It seems he's an asset to the company.

432
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,001
But now, don't you worry.
I'll scare him good.

433
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:48,713
You're a great director
and I'll make damn sure he knows that.

434
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,051
Would you hurry, please?

435
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,262
Is Mack ever waiting for you.

436
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,099
All right, everyone! We don't have all day!

437
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,607
Come in!

438
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,778
Charlie, come in. Please come in.

439
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,614
You got to help me with Mabel.
She actually thinks she can direct.

440
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,241
Have a seat. Have a seat.

441
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,285
Oh. You're not mad, then?

442
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,622
I've been sitting here waiting for
an actor with the guts to stand up to her.

443
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,249
How could I be mad?

444
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,628
I really like you, Charlie.

445
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,964
I really like you, too, Mack.

446
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,633
And I bet you've been talking to New York.

447
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,929
Let me direct the next one.

448
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,556
What makes you think you can do it?

449
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,808
- I couldn't do any worse.
- Says you.

450
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,062
Says I, "What if nobody wants it?
What if it stinks? Who'll pay?"

451
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,189
I've never seen you pick up a check.

452
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,235
I'll pay.

453
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,698
This is my work.

454
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,952
Did you ever have to pay up?

455
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,788
No. But, boy, did I work.

456
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,458
I directed more than 20 films
before the year was out.

457
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,669
Well, why on Earth
didn't you send for Hetty, then?

458
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,422
I did write. Never got a reply.

459
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,508
Thought maybe she was away on tour.

460
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,511
So I asked Syd to track her down for me.
See how she felt.

461
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,309
Oh, my God! Look at him!

462
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,575
This is Minnie.

463
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,994
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello.

464
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,204
Nice to meet you.

465
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,289
- You, too.
I'll take that.

466
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,000
Give us a hand, then, Chas, come on.

467
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,252
What did you pick him for?

468
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,046
Oh, he's not so bad.

469
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,089
- Yeah, our Syd's all right.
- Mmm-hmm.

470
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,884
I don't know, Chas.

471
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,428
I don't see anybody staring at you.

472
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,766
Nice little flivver, Chas.
How long you had it?

473
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,892
A couple of weeks.

474
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,852
How soon do I get to see Mr. Sennett?

475
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,480
Got something to show you first.

476
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,943
Get a load of that!

477
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,404
I don't believe it!

478
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,074
It's happened so quick, Chas.

479
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,660
Twelve months ago,
you were still in vaudeville.

480
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,828
I'm top of the bill, Syd.

481
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,290
Yeah? Well, I still haven't seen
anybody staring at you.

482
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,626
Yeah, that's 'cause I don't look like me.

483
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,420
- Syd?
- What?

484
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,882
- What news?
- Mum?

485
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,968
Mum is fine.

486
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,431
Well, no.
Not fine but there are lots of good days.

487
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,685
Well, not lots of, but some.

488
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,605
And Hetty. Does she know?

489
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,401
The whole world knows about you, Charlie.

490
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,570
She gave me this for you.

491
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,324
Fancy Hetty writing.

492
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,617
Yeah.

493
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,581
Syd!

494
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,417
Look at this.

495
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,506
She got married.

496
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,216
I know.

497
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,468
I'm not surprised. A girl like Hetty.

498
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,764
I wish her lots of happiness.

499
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,310
Well, not lots. But some.

500
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,855
Chin up, kid.

501
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:40,319
See, I was right.
He's the most famous man in the world.

502
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,705
Value for money is all we're after,
Mr. Sennett.

503
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,752
Charlie, take this guy back to the asylum.

504
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,965
Look, Syd's me manager now.

505
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,301
He's given up his acting career
to handle me full time.

506
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:08,055
Oh, woe is me!
The theater will never be the same.

507
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,309
What career?
1, 000 a week is more than I get.

508
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:16,230
Charlie's name is bigger, Mr. Sennett.
If you'll pardon me for saying so.

509
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:21,027
Charlie, Charlie, I've been so rotten to you!

510
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,780
I don't know if you can forgive me.

511
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,783
I forced you to leave Butte, Montana.

512
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,786
I made you accept $150 per.

513
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,499
You mentioned directing
and I stuffed that down your throat, too.

514
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,960
Now, tell me how else
Uncle Mack can make it up to you!

515
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,091
I want to run me own show, Mack.
I want control.

516
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,681
Dream on, kid. I know this business.
And you're not that big.

517
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,228
First time I've seen you miss, Mack.

518
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,026
But, Charlie, Mack Sennett
was the absolute king of comedy.

519
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,779
He gave you your start.

520
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,406
And how could you
just walk out and leave him flat?

521
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,409
The reasons were
purely intellectual. Money.

522
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,915
So, you joined up with
"Bronco Billy" Anderson,

523
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,750
a puffed-up cowboy star.

524
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,754
Not one of the high points of my career.

525
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,840
But I knew I wanted my own studio.

526
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,926
Even then,
I was putting money aside to build one.

527
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,721
Excuse me, miss.

528
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,765
Do you always eat alone?

529
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,685
Only when I'm trying
to make a new acquaintance.

530
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,272
Actually, I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

531
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,775
Actually, I'm a motion picture director.

532
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,112
And I'm forming a new company
with Bronco Billy over there.

533
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,409
And you're looking for a new leading lady.

534
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,869
Lucky me.

535
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,121
Obviously, you are an actress, Miss...

536
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,916
Purviance. Sorry, just a secretary.

537
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,796
Don't be sorry. I'm auditioning for
actresses who aren't actresses.

538
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:09,802
Well, if you're on the lookout for untalented
actresses who aren't actresses,

539
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,805
then you couldn't do better than me.
Worse than me.

540
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,316
Don't you want to know who I am?

541
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,319
I have no interest whatsoever
in who you are,

542
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,989
Mr. Chaplin.

543
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,210
Cut! Not great. Uh...

544
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,422
We'll do another.

545
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,426
Charlie, if I eat one more bean,
I'm going to be sick.

546
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,428
You almost had it.

547
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:56,807
But this time not quite so daintily.
You're starving.

548
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,018
I know.

549
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,521
But it's hard to be hungry after 46 takes.

550
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,774
Of course it is.
No else one could do it this well.

551
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,108
We both know it.

552
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,695
- I'll do my best.
- Right.

553
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,823
How about dinner tonight? Chili con carne.

554
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,327
I'll kill you, Charlie.

555
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,745
More beans.

556
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,121
More beans!

557
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,706
Camera!

558
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,043
Action!

559
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,267
That's all for today, folks.

560
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:29,108
Good to know I can always
count on my nearest and dearest.

561
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,944
Don't come it with me, son.

562
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:37,491
"Arrival in the land of liberty"?
Sticking in the statue like that?

563
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,410
What are you playing at?

564
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,747
Nobody else seemed to mind.

565
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,458
Answer me!

566
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,127
Kicking an immigration officer
up the backside.

567
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,754
Do you think that's funny?

568
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:54,133
Well, for those of us with
a sense of humor, very.

569
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:55,926
Charlie.

570
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,639
Charlie, it was supposed to be a comedy.

571
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,477
Now, you've turned it
into a bloody political tract.

572
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,686
We're guests here!

573
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,647
And you can't go around criticizing
the way it's run.

574
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,818
Syd, I love this country. I owe it everything.

575
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,862
That's precisely why I can criticize it.

576
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,197
- Don't forget...
- Why I must.

577
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,990
...where we're from.

578
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,659
There's a war on, remember?

579
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,665
Now, you make a million a year
while British boys are dying in France.

580
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,920
The London papers are already after you.
Do you want the same thing to happen here?

581
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,672
I registered for the draft,
and they never called me.

582
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,093
- Oh, for Christ's sake...
- It isn't as if I'm hard to find.

583
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,306
Look, I'm on your side, kid.

584
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,351
First one on board, remember?

585
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,312
Be careful, Chas.

586
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,898
Just watch it.

587
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,237
That's all I'm saying.

588
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,458
There.

589
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,776
You always said
you detested studio parties.

590
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,570
Oh! The worst,

591
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,281
but not where
Doug Fairbanks was concerned.

592
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,616
Life was fun when Doug was around.

593
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,580
As you know, I don't think anyone today
remembers what a huge star he was.

594
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,667
I mean, back in the silent days, he was huge.

595
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,627
Men liked him,

596
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,130
women adored him.

597
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,717
He was royalty.

598
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,764
Charles!

599
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,351
Look out below!

600
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,615
Sire, you are most truly welcome.

601
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,327
What a great party, Doug.

602
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,370
- Isn’t it fabulous?
- Wonderful.

603
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,123
- Thank you.
May I take your coat, sir?

604
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,920
First class. Bet I hate it more than you do.

605
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,046
I doubt it.

606
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,425
Of course
everything changed when

607
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,844
America's sweetheart came on the scene.

608
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,430
You mean Mary Pickford?

609
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:50,517
Yes, I always found her to be
something of an undersized bitch,

610
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,604
but Doug fell for her like a ton of bricks.

611
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,399
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Mary.

612
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,651
- Hi, Doug.
- Hello.

613
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,777
Thanks for inviting me.

614
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,905
Mary, it's a pleasure.

615
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,953
Duty calls. Excuse me.

616
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,042
He's a really lovely person, Charlie.

617
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,169
Yes. Hungry?

618
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,009
Hello, Charlie.

619
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,321
Her name is Mildred Harris.

620
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,698
An actress?

621
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,034
Oh, yeah. A child actress.

622
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,371
You ever hear the word "jailbait," Charlie?

623
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,708
That's the definition.
I'd watch it if I was you.

624
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,668
I value that, Mary.

625
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,258
Coming from you.

626
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:08,262
When America's own sweetheart
gives you advice, you'd better listen.

627
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,348
"Better listen?" Thanks, Charlie.

628
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,184
Especially since you're married
and Doug's married,

629
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,229
and the two of you are rutting
with each other every afternoon

630
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,398
- all the time pretending you've just met.
- Miss Pickford,

631
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,066
Mr. Chaplin, please?

632
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,068
Lecture me more about morality.

633
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,992
Better. Better. Better.

634
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,911
Bitch. Better.

635
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,597
I washed my face.

636
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,683
Come here.

637
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,454
Charlie, what is it?

638
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,752
I just need some...
You just need some lip rouge.

639
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,631
I've got some in my purse.

640
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,802
It's in the drawer, over there. It's top right.

641
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,699
Look at me.

642
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,995
Is this what you want?

643
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,499
Yeah. Just put it on.

644
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,926
My God, Charlie!
You weren't even 30.

645
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,720
You were the most famous man in the world.

646
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:59,266
You had your own studio, named after you.
I mean, couldn't you just enjoy?

647
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,560
Mmm. I can, now.

648
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,605
But I couldn't then. It meant too much.

649
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,738
Morning.

650
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,416
Mr. Chaplin, welcome.

651
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,599
Welcome, Charlie!

652
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,272
Take your picture, Charlie?

653
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,274
Chaplin.

654
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,468
Cut!
All right. Hold it.

655
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,762
I think, perhaps,
we should try a little less next time.

656
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,431
Hold it.
Hold the smoke.

657
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:06,184
The dirt, I mean. For God's sake,
somebody get me out of this thing.

658
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,148
Looks great, Charlie.

659
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,985
But I thought I better keep the boys here
under control till you got out of costume.

660
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,696
- You are an ass!
- Thank you.

661
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,781
That wasn't bad, Charlie. One more?

662
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,658
Check it.
- How's the light, Rollie?

663
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,245
- I know. It's better down at Barney's Bar.
It's better down at Barney's Bar.

664
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,663
Call it a day.

665
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,877
- I don't feel funny anymore.
- Come on, Charlie, let's go.

666
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,129
Not cheating are you, Fairbanks?

667
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,549
You are a truly strange fellow, Charles.

668
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,594
- Nonsense.
- Facts indicate otherwise.

669
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,638
Close, but out.

670
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,225
And these facts show a young man,
of what, 29?

671
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,604
Not perhaps conventionally handsome,
but certainly not repellent.

672
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,983
Flatteringly put.

673
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,236
Double fault. Lucky me.

674
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,034
Yes, an unrepellant fellow of some fame
and fortune, not totally without talent.

675
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,077
Ready?

676
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,079
If only you'd put one in play.

677
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,581
Call this one out.

678
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,291
Don't have to, I'm winning.

679
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,628
Damn.

680
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,755
And who is this fellow escorting?

681
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,548
Why, Mildred Harris?

682
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,593
That intellectual giant of 16
who still sucks her thumb.

683
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:23,762
That's very funny.

684
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,722
Then why aren't you laughing?

685
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,267
Perhaps because I'm marrying her.

686
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,322
She's really not that bad.

687
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,199
"Really not that bad"?

688
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,994
Spoken like a man desperately in love.

689
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:51,123
You're madder even than I thought, Charles.

690
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:55,836
You sure it's yours?

691
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,296
I can only hope.

692
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,551
There are ways of getting out of this.
You know, all it takes is money.

693
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,138
Where I come from, that's not an option.

694
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,017
Besides, I want a family and...

695
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,812
I predict you're going to have one
before you know it.

696
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,023
May I be the first to congratulate you?

697
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,109
You may not!

698
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:21,903
Good!

699
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,872
You didn't suspect about Mildred?

700
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,166
Not for a moment.

701
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,169
Well, why don't you add that?
Put that in?

702
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,923
I'll never forget the night
Mary told me the truth.

703
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,676
We were celebrating the end
of the First World War.

704
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,846
And I met J. Edgar Hoover for the first time.

705
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,264
Then I think
you should make it clear

706
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,100
that this was before
he became head of the FBI.

707
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,269
If I may continue, Mr. Hearst.

708
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,687
We're too generous.

709
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,106
We're too open.

710
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,649
Now, if we don't watch out,

711
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:04,905
if we don't take steps now to impose
some new discipline, some decency,

712
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,533
then we're in trouble. Deep trouble.

713
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,953
I know it's not fashionable to say this.

714
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,706
We're celebrating. Everyone thinks it's over.

715
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,043
- But democracy carries a price tag.
Hear, hear.

716
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,296
And I just happen to think
that one of the most

717
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,049
misguided promises we ever made

718
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,552
was inscribed on the base
of the Statue of Liberty.

719
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,765
One that I predict will lead this country
into all kinds of trouble.

720
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:36,061
"Give us your poor, your huddled masses. "

721
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,064
Now, we have to stop this
before it goes too far.

722
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,984
Our conception of America
does not include,

723
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,403
was never meant to include,
this kind of scum.

724
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:51,827
You will have to forgive our famous,
young friends, the artistic temperament.

725
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,038
But what you're saying is important,
very important.

726
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:09,261
Right now we are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world.

727
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,264
All kinds of left-wing intellectuals

728
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,724
who'd like nothing more
than to bring us down.

729
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,519
Don't you think you're overstating?

730
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,937
No, sir. I do not.

731
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,399
And I sometimes wonder if you people
realize the responsibility you carry.

732
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,110
To my way of thinking,

733
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,404
motion pictures are, potentially,

734
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,156
the most influential form of communication
ever invented.

735
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,450
And there's no control over them.

736
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,245
Your message reaches
everyone, everywhere.

737
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:36,830
Message?

738
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,456
Of course.

739
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,460
Mr. Chaplin here reaches millions
who only have to see.

740
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,631
And when they see a mockery being made
of our immigration services,

741
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,050
I call that a message.

742
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,176
Yes. Well,

743
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,974
as you've already said, Mr. Hoover,
motion pictures are for the people.

744
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:00,145
Most of the people work for a living
and they don't make much money doing it.

745
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,315
It gives them pleasure to see officialdom
and the upper classes

746
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,567
getting a kick up the backside.

747
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:08,153
Always has and it always will.

748
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:12,032
And if that can change things,
so much the better.

749
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,327
Better.

750
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,622
He's improving.

751
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,832
But motion pictures have made you rich,
Mr. Chaplin.

752
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,835
They sure have.

753
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,423
What about your own
motion picture career, Mrs. Chaplin?

754
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,176
- I think you've handled it all wonderfully.
- What?

755
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,886
Mildred.

756
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,347
The pregnancy?

757
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,976
Everyone knows
you've been conned, Charlie.

758
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,357
Mildred.

759
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,863
Please excuse us, Mr. Hearst.
I have to be up very early.

760
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,532
- Yes, of course.
- Come along, my dear.

761
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,373
It's been a pleasure.

762
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,793
Good night.

763
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,511
You made an enemy there, Charlie.

764
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,889
Was it personal, do you think?

765
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,058
Personal? Maybe.

766
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,395
But I'm sure he really did believe
I was a communist.

767
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,731
I wasn't, of course. I was simply a humanist.

768
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:29,109
He also believed you were a Jew.

769
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:33,697
Something I've rarely troubled
to deny, mainly because of Syd.

770
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,993
He's half-Jewish, as you know.
Same mother, different fathers.

771
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,998
I suppose the false pregnancy
was the beginning of the end with Mildred.

772
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:59,180
You're awful late again, Charlie.
I'd almost given up on you.

773
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,348
Funny.

774
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,435
Sometimes I feel I'm so close
to getting it right,

775
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,187
it slips away.

776
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,149
You've been editing that film for months.

777
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,527
Will be for months, more than likely.

778
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,072
Not like the old days.

779
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,074
The good times.

780
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,080
The good times? Are they over?

781
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,668
Do you want me to leave?

782
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,463
No.

783
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,675
I'll leave.

784
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,438
Why aren't you
more bitter towards her?

785
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,940
Stealing my movie wasn't her idea.

786
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:55,653
Oh! Poor child was so stupid, I'm not sure
she could even spell the word "idea. "

787
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,696
Charlie?

788
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,492
Charlie, wake up!

789
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,537
- Charlie!
- What?

790
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,498
Wake up. Quick.

791
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,749
- They're trying to seize the film.
- Who?

792
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,626
Just go and wash your face
and wake up, will you?

793
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,920
That sweet child bride of yours,

794
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:15,006
well, her divorce lawyers have informed her
it's an asset.

795
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,966
- An asset?
- Yes.

796
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,803
So, I've got Rollie, the wife

797
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,430
- and 40 cans of film in the car. Come on.
- Okay.

798
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,890
Once we're over the state line,

799
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,518
we keep you under wraps
till we finish cutting the film.

800
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,062
Charlie, you've got your pants on
back to front.

801
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,830
Yeah, yeah. It's good.

802
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,585
It moves now.

803
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,760
I really do love that kid.

804
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,707
We're still waiting for that other shot, Syd.

805
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,127
- Have a look in 102, Rollie.
- Sure I put it on there.

806
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,004
Wait. No, Chas, I've got it here.

807
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,926
Minnie, answer the door. Hurry up.

808
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,429
Charlie.

809
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,691
- Here's your tea, ma'am.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

810
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,944
Thank you.

811
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,406
He's on to us, boys.

812
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,637
They're...
They're here, boss.

813
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,768
I've dreamed of this moment for years.

814
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,608
This is America, Mum.
This is where your dreams come true.

815
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:54,660
Charlie's bought you a lovely house, Mum.

816
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,080
It's not too big.

817
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,165
Great view of the ocean.

818
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,803
You always wanted
to live by the seaside, didn't you?

819
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,310
Don't stop, Syd. You're right. I have.

820
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,148
I think I shall love watching the waves.

821
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,614
I'm sure I will. You boys, you spoil me so.

822
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,675
More tea, dear?

823
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,343
No.

824
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,303
Mum. Mum.

825
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,682
The mark on my arm, Charles?

826
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,393
They gave me that at the asylum.

827
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,192
If only I'd been able to feed you proper,
I'd never have gone there.

828
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:15,533
Now, if they ever come back for me,
I'll have enough food for us all.

829
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,503
I never could deal with my mother.

830
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,214
I only ever threw money at her.

831
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,884
Come on, Charlie,
you've got to explain

832
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,303
why you chose that particular time
to go to London.

833
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:40,266
Now, I don't have to explain a damn
thing, I was tired. I had a movie opening.

834
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,477
I wanted to see old friends.

835
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:50,526
Straight into the water, arse over tit!

836
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,113
He needed the job that bad!

837
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:59,577
But I was worried, Charlie.
I was prepared for the absolute worst.

838
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:04,874
I've seen it happen in the profession,
oh, so many times.

839
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,877
Mmm, I'm sure you have, Mr. Karno.

840
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:12,089
His head size.
That is the only true measure of a man.

841
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,885
I sent this lad to America.

842
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,971
Look what's come back to me.

843
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:24,393
My head never swelled,
not with all my successes.

844
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:28,272
I was worried about you, though, Charlie.

845
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,859
And that other night at the Troc, remember?

846
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:36,489
Well, you took a tail-suit
out of the wardrobe, tried to be a gent.

847
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,618
Trying to impress that young dancer, Hetty.

848
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:41,994
Wasn't that her name?

849
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,120
Hetty Kelly.

850
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,122
I could see in your eyes you fancied her.

851
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,251
Sad.

852
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,880
Yes, I know all about it, Fred.
She got married.

853
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,632
Sent me a lovely note.

854
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,426
Brought it with me.
Somewhere in my baggage.

855
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:02,431
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.

856
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,476
Charlie, don't you know?

857
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,146
Has nobody told you?

858
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,648
She's gone!

859
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,193
The flu epidemic after the war
carried her away.

860
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,658
Well, I thought someone must have told you.

861
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,869
Must have written.

862
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,122
Didn't nobody?

863
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,761
Charlie!

864
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,139
Hey, hey, hey. Charlie!

865
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,294
What do we do, Charlie?

866
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,135
Smile.

867
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,974
Give me my hat.

868
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,590
- Evening, sir.
- Good evening.

869
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,318
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

870
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,988
Hey! That's Charlie Chaplin!

871
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,450
Now, what can I get you?

872
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:11,662
- Light ale, please.
That'll be tuppence, sir.

873
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,834
Well, here's someone who's had a good war!

874
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,919
Yeah, you didn't see him
in the bleeding army.

875
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,214
Come to stare at the animals, Charlie?

876
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,676
Oh, go and sit down, Ted,
and give your mouth a rest.

877
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,261
I just came in for a quiet drink.

878
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,180
Great to see you back, Charlie.

879
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:30,222
Here, have one on me.

880
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:32,683
You have one on me.

881
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,437
Mr. Charlie fucking Chaplin!

882
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,689
Ted.
Bleeding commie bastard!

883
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,066
Go, lads, sit down.
Come, sit down. Come.

884
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:44,445
Don't worry about him, Charlie.
He's always been a miserable old sod.

885
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,113
Get him off the premises.

886
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,325
Charlie Chaplin.

887
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:53,037
Well, bugger Mr. Charlie bleeding Chaplin.

888
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,164
Good luck, Charlie!

889
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,333
- Good luck, Charlie!
- I've seen all your pictures!

890
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,461
That's him. Charlie Chaplin!

891
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:04,590
The back way's through there, sir.

892
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,300
Oh. You're very kind.

893
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,220
Good old Charlie.

894
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,265
See him coming in here,
Charlie Chaplin.

895
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,832
Welcome home, Charlie.

896
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:46,257
I knew then that I had no home.
So I decided to put down roots in America.

897
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:03,274
Whoa, whoa.

898
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,113
A man came to see me the other day.

899
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:14,034
A corset salesman? I sent him.
Your paunch is in need of help.

900
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,454
He was the FBI, old darling.

901
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,791
Said he knew what a loyal American I was.

902
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,544
He wondered if everyone else
felt the same way.

903
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:27,882
I just sat there and let him work his way
around to you,

904
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,174
which he did.

905
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,844
He asked were you a member
of the Communist Party.

906
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:36,015
I said that was an absolute impossibility.

907
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:37,224
Because I love America.

908
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:39,643
Because you're too cheap to pay the dues.

909
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:45,065
Remarkable. Your timing in work is flawless.
In life, it's the reverse.

910
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:48,319
You're a miserable pain in the ass, Charles.

911
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,446
But I'm worried about you.

912
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:56,243
You worry about your family jewels,
old darling.

913
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,579
I'm serious.

914
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:00,456
Watch out.

915
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,336
What am I supposed to watch?

916
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:09,965
Charles, you're a foreigner.
You're still an outsider.

917
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,468
You've never understood this country.

918
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,178
It's a good country underneath, Doug.

919
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:18,265
No. It's a good country on top.

920
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:23,020
Underneath, that's what starts showing
when we're scared.

921
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,692
But you don't care about politics.
What is this?

922
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,236
- Why are you so worried?
- Me?

923
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,156
I haven't a care in the world.

924
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,660
I'm the oldest action star in the business
and talkies are coming.

925
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,663
What the hell
have I got to be worried about?

926
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,458
That's talkies, Charles.

927
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,170
Talkies! Talkies!

928
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,839
Can you imagine The Tramp talking?

929
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,008
It's the future, Charlie.

930
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,593
Not in my lifetime.

931
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,220
Talkies!

932
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,307
It'll never catch on.

933
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,226
Talkies!

934
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,770
Talkies!

935
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,900
Talkies! Talkies!

936
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,749
This is it, sir. We've enlarged it for you.

937
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,755
I still can't make him out.

938
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,676
Have you got a positive identification?

939
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,637
Oh, yes. No doubt, sir. It is Hawkins, sir.
The red labor leader.

940
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,265
Visiting him at the studios.

941
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:44,143
How can we make them realize the danger?

942
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:50,190
I told him that once, face to face,
"You can damage this country. "

943
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,067
He didn't get it.

944
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,613
How old is this one?

945
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:00,117
Well, sir, she's underage is all that matters.

946
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,287
When the baby's born,
we can go after him for statutory rape.

947
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:04,830
A scandal like that would destroy him.

948
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,750
I appreciate your zeal, Mr. Seeley,

949
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,462
but Chaplin and Miss Grey
were married in Mexico yesterday.

950
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:18,802
If only he'd just sleep with them.
Everything would be so much easier.

951
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:22,765
Still, we must do what we can.

952
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:29,104
Lita was your second wife, okay?

953
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:31,565
She gave you two sons, whom you adored.

954
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:34,568
This book is over 500 pages long.

955
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:37,696
Yet, you only devote five lines to her. Why?

956
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,448
I hated the bitch.

957
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,700
Oh, come on,
she was hardly more than a child.

958
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,578
It can't all have been her fault, surely.

959
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:48,165
George, she was
a profoundly flawed human being.

960
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,501
Well, we've got to deal
with the problem, Charlie.

961
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,171
You married her. All your life,
you've bedded down with the babies.

962
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,256
Your readers will want to understand.

963
01:24:56,341 --> 01:25:00,511
Where were you when she gave birth
to those two boys less than a year apart?

964
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:02,346
You know where I was.

965
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:05,349
I happened to be making a little film
called The Gold Rush.

966
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:15,192
You're a flawed human being, Charles,
just like the rest of us.

967
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,070
Only, you have to address it. That's all.

968
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:20,781
I mean, why are we here?

969
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:24,868
Why are we talking in Switzerland
and not in Southern California? Hmm?

970
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,790
It wasn't just
the parlor pink business, Charlie,

971
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:33,335
or the speeches or the donations
that finally did you that

972
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:36,255
turned you into an exile,
you know what I mean?

973
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,381
Nah.

974
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:42,719
- You know what it was, don't you?
- What?

975
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:44,763
Sex.

976
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,350
Sex.

977
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,561
Yes. Sex.

978
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,275
It's odd, you know, but I don't think
I've ever looked at a woman

979
01:25:56,359 --> 01:26:00,362
without measuring
that possibility between us.

980
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,576
At the same time, I'm not all that interested.

981
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,161
Never during work.

982
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,290
I suppose it was only
when I wasn't working, that I was

983
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:14,835
vulnerable.

984
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,298
Well, why don't you write
about that vulnerability?

985
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,801
If you want to understand me,

986
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:25,888
watch my movies.

987
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,521
All right, sonny boy,

988
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,773
tell your poor little brother today's problem.

989
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:39,902
Same as yesterday and the day before that
and the day before that.

990
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,738
And the day before that,
and the day before that.

991
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,365
All right. You be creative for a change!

992
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,328
The Tramp buys a flower from the girl.

993
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:53,207
In order for the plot to work,
she has to think he's rich.

994
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,917
That's all.

995
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,252
Except, as you're aware,
the flower girl is blind.

996
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:03,383
I don't know how to make a blind girl
mistake The Tramp for a millionaire.

997
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:05,510
Easy.

998
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,805
We'll do what everyone else is doing.

999
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:10,891
Joe!

1000
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,479
We'll have the actors talk.

1001
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,359
Joseph Curb, Vitaphone.

1002
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,320
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, hello, Joe.

1003
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:30,994
It's not your fault, son.
You're in the middle of a family feud.

1004
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:37,292
Now, you decide who's right.
The Tramp can't talk.

1005
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,170
The minute he talks, he's dead.

1006
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,256
Tell me I'm right.

1007
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,217
He can't, because you're wrong.

1008
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,511
Who the hell is gonna pay to see you,

1009
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,388
when everybody else
has gone over to sound?

1010
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:51,348
Who? I'll tell you who.

1011
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,767
The Japanese, for one thing,
and the Russkies for another.

1012
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,478
And anyone else
who doesn't happen to speak English.

1013
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,691
Or have you forgotten
about the other nine-tenths of the globe?

1014
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:03,652
All right, I guess I'll have to show you.

1015
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,529
Who's the most famous ballet dancer
in the world?

1016
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:06,571
Pardon?

1017
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,824
The most famous ballet dancer in the world!

1018
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,784
Nijinsky.

1019
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:15,789
Fine. So let's say that
he was doing Swan Lake today

1020
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,417
and we all went to see it.

1021
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,879
And he came down to the footlights.

1022
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,299
And the orchestra stopped.

1023
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:28,719
And he said, "Hi folks, I'm Vaslav Nijinsky. "

1024
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,637
No, he'd have a Russian accent.

1025
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:34,057
"Hi, folksies. Call me
Vaslav Nijinsky. Sky, sky, sky.

1026
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,185
"Oh, just call me Vas.
It doesn't matter. It's okay by me.

1027
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,479
"Everything is wonderful in California.

1028
01:28:39,772 --> 01:28:41,690
"Okay, today I'm going to jump
up and down for you

1029
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,233
"like nothing what you've ever seen before.

1030
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,821
"Hope you for to like me. Bye. "

1031
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:49,865
You know what would happen
when he danced?

1032
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,742
It would be awful.

1033
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:53,577
Because the magic is gone.

1034
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:55,662
Just as it would be with The Tramp.

1035
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,292
Tell me I'm right.

1036
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,257
I'm in the word business, Mr. Chaplin,
so I have to say that you're wrong.

1037
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,509
But I'm sure as hell glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1038
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,891
See you.
- Enjoyed the dancing.

1039
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,769
Yeah. And the talking.

1040
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,945
Take Mr. Curb back to his office.
Will you, Rollie?

1041
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,875
Rollie! Get them all back.
Syd, we're in business!

1042
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:45,962
How does a blind girl
mistake The Tramp for a millionaire?

1043
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:49,257
When she hears the door slam
on a rich man's car.

1044
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,510
She thinks The Tramp's the owner.

1045
01:29:53,012 --> 01:29:54,596
Easy.

1046
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,932
When you know how.

1047
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,731
Charlie! Sydney! Over here! Throw it to Dad.

1048
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,236
Boys!

1049
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:23,166
Boys! I'm taking your ball
down to the cellar.

1050
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:27,879
I don't see any stairs.

1051
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,521
Mum's here. Off you go now!

1052
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,150
Your mummy's here. Ready?

1053
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:55,782
I'll see you next weekend, okay?
Come on, off you go!

1054
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,785
Off you go! Hey, boys!

1055
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:23,226
It can't be as bad as all that, Mr. Chaplin.

1056
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:30,066
Do I know you? And why don't I?

1057
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,777
I'm Paulette Levy.

1058
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,906
Would you like a drink, Miss Levy?

1059
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:38,992
I already have one.

1060
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:40,911
How about a fur coat?

1061
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,663
Well...

1062
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,373
No, seriously. You look hungry.

1063
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:48,502
Thank you.

1064
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:54,966
Actress?

1065
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:59,179
If you watch the B-movies and don't blink.

1066
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:03,350
- Don't get any ideas, though.
- You're taken, then.

1067
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:06,269
No, but I'm 21.

1068
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,313
Way too old for you.

1069
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,484
You're very pretty, Miss Levy.

1070
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:17,239
I'd better be. I didn't get out here
thanks to my Shakespeare reviews.

1071
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:21,034
And may I say something?
You'd be even prettier as a brunette.

1072
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:24,621
Well, you'd be devastating
if you were six inches taller.

1073
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,209
Punch? Two, please.

1074
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,630
Well, at least you can do something
about your hair.

1075
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,466
Never! I was born this way.

1076
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,677
Oh, thank you.

1077
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,099
Hello.
- Nice to see you again, sir.

1078
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,907
Evening, Mr. Chaplin.

1079
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:03,410
Sorry, miss. I'm waiting for a natural blonde.

1080
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:08,915
Hi.

1081
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:11,835
You look beautiful.

1082
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:15,880
- My usual table.
- Of course, Mr. Chaplin, come right this way.

1083
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:27,309
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Charlie.

1084
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:32,856
You've come a long way, Charlie.
Yes. My own suit.

1085
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:37,235
No need to book a table.
I lived in the lap of luxury. But I was blind.

1086
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:38,528
Blind?

1087
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:41,156
Yes. That's fatal, for a storyteller.

1088
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,868
Did I ever tell you that I sold
all my stocks and shares

1089
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,661
the year before the Wall Street crash?

1090
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,330
That was clever.

1091
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:53,752
It was deeply cruel, the Depression.

1092
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:59,841
Can I have an autograph, Mr. Chaplin?

1093
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,469
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Sign mine?

1094
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:03,595
Yes.

1095
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,312
I wish they'd wanted my money.

1096
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,482
- You know what?
- Hmm?

1097
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:17,567
I've always had that gift.

1098
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:25,408
After a man makes love to me,
he just goes wild from happiness.

1099
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,411
I am happy.

1100
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:34,209
Then tell me when you get sad,
because I don't want to be around.

1101
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:43,051
Terrible things have been
happening out there since the crash.

1102
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,846
Millions of decent Americans have been
robbed of their right to work.

1103
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,599
Machinery is replacing manpower.

1104
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,979
And I've said nothing.

1105
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,236
Shame on me.

1106
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,573
Shame on me.

1107
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:35,395
You're right, Charlie, you're right.
About three seconds too short.

1108
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:39,899
Okay, Johnny! We'll do a two-bar repeat
of the xylophone. Yes?

1109
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,276
Sure.

1110
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,236
Honey?

1111
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,405
Oh, sorry, darling.

1112
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:48,825
I'm taking the boys out on the boat today.
Why don't you come on out for some air?

1113
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:50,326
Hmm.

1114
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,996
Tomorrow, darling. Definitely tomorrow.

1115
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:55,373
All right.

1116
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,170
Put that in straight away.

1117
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,756
- What do you want to do?
- Take it out of the minor key.

1118
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,633
Fine. Let me hear it.

1119
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,809
No. I'll tell you why.

1120
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:30,033
Charlie, you were supposed to meet us
at the fight.

1121
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,203
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Who was fighting?

1122
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,622
Mostly Mary and Doug, as it turned out.

1123
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:38,333
- You're wonderful, Miss Goddard.
- Thanks!

1124
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,678
Well, that didn't work either, did it?

1125
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,580
Well, the Fairbanks are getting a divorce.

1126
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:21,251
And Mussolini has invaded Abyssinia.

1127
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,588
You really need a break, Charlie.

1128
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:28,091
We should take a trip.

1129
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,217
That's a good idea.

1130
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,345
What? What's a good idea?

1131
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,640
Around the world, I thought.

1132
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,021
I'm not going to make it.

1133
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:44,816
Charlie!

1134
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:54,200
Did you lose your other wives this way?

1135
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,996
I think so.

1136
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,749
But you'd have to ask them.

1137
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:12,093
Paulette. She was wonderful.

1138
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,971
Her personality, you mean?
No.

1139
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:18,516
You mean in bed?
No. Well, that was good.

1140
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,227
No, she's the only one
who didn't take me for a fortune.

1141
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,688
Here, let me help you. Come on.

1142
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,319
Okay?

1143
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,949
I know you so well, Charlie.

1144
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:38,453
I even know what you're thinking.
You're thinking of Doug, aren't you?

1145
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:42,081
I was the only one who knew.

1146
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,924
Don't say Daddy doesn't look after you.

1147
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,592
- Paulette!
- Doug?

1148
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:01,851
Mr. Chaplin. Always a pleasure.

1149
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:04,854
- How are you? Oh!
- Fine.

1150
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,481
How do you look even prettier?

1151
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:10,985
Nobody's fine and everybody needs a drink.
Paulette, another champagne or a scotch?

1152
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:13,029
Ooh, Scotch, please.

1153
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:16,407
- Is he...
- Yes.

1154
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:19,077
Seriously?

1155
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:23,247
- His heart.
- Shit.

1156
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:32,715
Say.

1157
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,342
Don't laugh.

1158
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,803
I'm going to test for Scarlett.

1159
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:38,054
Why should I laugh?

1160
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:41,057
Because it's a joke.
Everybody's testing for Scarlett.

1161
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,183
Mmm-hmm.

1162
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:45,812
Anyway, I hear Katie Hepburn
has it locked away. So they say.

1163
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,357
I have not worked since Modern Times.

1164
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,359
No. Neither have I.

1165
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:54,278
No ideas. I'm desperate.

1166
01:39:55,864 --> 01:39:56,948
Catch you later.

1167
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:04,497
I can manage a double if I have to.

1168
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,082
Should you?

1169
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:10,086
Say, are you two still married or what?
I find it all very confusing. Hmm!

1170
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,921
Hmm. It's not at all confusing.

1171
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,340
See, when everyone thought
that we were having an affair,

1172
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,466
we were married.

1173
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:18,302
Now everyone realizes we're married,
we're getting divorced.

1174
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:21,764
Man's a wizard with women,
no question about it.

1175
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:26,227
Who's that man? Sounds German.
- Looks German.

1176
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:29,772
Probably one of those directors,
there's a lot of them over here now.

1177
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,399
Maybe he's got a job for me.

1178
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:35,611
Just like Plato,
Adolf Hitler is defining the ideal state

1179
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,032
which will become a model
for backward systems.

1180
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:40,742
Do you know him personally?

1181
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:43,995
I do have that good fortune, yes.

1182
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,582
And you have my word.

1183
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:50,126
Our ambitions are only to defend

1184
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:52,295
our historical frontiers to the east.
That's paramount.

1185
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,464
Told you. Paramount.

1186
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:56,090
It's not funny, Doug.

1187
01:40:56,341 --> 01:41:00,011
He merely wants to improve the situation
for the German people.

1188
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,554
Create jobs...

1189
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:05,808
- How can they let these fascist thugs...
- Charlie...

1190
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:08,519
...to cut out the profit speculator.

1191
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:10,897
The Jew.

1192
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,859
Mr. Chaplin! I am a great admirer of yours.

1193
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:19,822
I'm sorry.
I prefer not to shake hands with Nazis.

1194
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,660
What have you got against us, Mr. Chaplin?

1195
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,830
What have you got against everybody else?

1196
01:41:28,665 --> 01:41:30,875
You must forgive Mr. Chaplin.

1197
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:33,878
- He's a Jew.
- Ah, so!

1198
01:41:35,672 --> 01:41:37,548
I'm afraid I don't have that honor.

1199
01:41:40,677 --> 01:41:42,136
Shame on you!

1200
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,725
Ah! The former Miss Levy.

1201
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,022
Shall we, my dear?

1202
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:04,117
- Good night.
- God bless you, Charlie.

1203
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:08,579
- Uh, I'll call you.
- Yes. Please do.

1204
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:11,666
- All right. Good night.
- Night.

1205
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,672
A lovely international incident
you caused in there!

1206
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:19,674
Hey, let's go on.

1207
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,552
Not tonight, old darling. A bit tired.

1208
01:42:24,054 --> 01:42:27,348
It's funny, you know, you look a lot like him.

1209
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:30,643
Adolf, I mean.

1210
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:37,316
You know, with your mustache on.

1211
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:39,527
I think he stole your act!

1212
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,407
Good night, old boy.

1213
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:47,076
Night!

1214
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:51,247
Sweet prince.

1215
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,796
So much ended around then.

1216
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,257
I'd been there 25 years.

1217
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:05,136
Everybody else had gone over to sound.

1218
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:08,681
I didn't know how much longer
I could hold out against it.

1219
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,391
Mario.

1220
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:13,477
Of course, UA was over for me.

1221
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:15,646
United Artists?

1222
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:21,611
You know, you haven't written anything
about that. How it began, I mean.

1223
01:43:21,653 --> 01:43:25,698
Oh, I'll put something in.
It was a great idea, I think.

1224
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:29,160
Creative people really had their say
for the first time.

1225
01:43:29,244 --> 01:43:31,370
- You like milk?
- No milk.

1226
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:38,461
I remember some distributor saying,
"The lunatics have taken over the asylum. "

1227
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:42,089
- That became quite a famous remark.
- Yeah.

1228
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,760
Thank you.

1229
01:43:48,847 --> 01:43:51,766
But UA did mean a lot to Doug.

1230
01:43:54,102 --> 01:43:57,021
When my mother died, it was sad. Yes, but...

1231
01:43:58,649 --> 01:44:01,150
She was old, she'd had her run.

1232
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:04,070
It was different with Doug.

1233
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:07,281
Even today, I still miss him.

1234
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:14,330
Oh, yes, tell me, when did you actually
start work on The Great Dictator?

1235
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:16,332
- '38.
- '38?

1236
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,210
And everyone thought you were crazy then.

1237
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:23,214
When the Second World War broke out,
you became a genius overnight.

1238
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,593
Well, not to those who thought
I was a communist.

1239
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,249
Big smile!

1240
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:06,716
I know you. You bastard.

1241
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:11,554
Syd? Is that you?

1242
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,308
Hmm.

1243
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,352
What's the matter, Syd?

1244
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:21,480
For 10 years, you've been on at me
to make me a talkie. Now I'm making a talkie.

1245
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:24,358
Yeah, but not this.

1246
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,197
I know this man.

1247
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,285
We're born the same year, four days apart.

1248
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:37,621
He's like me, capable of anything.

1249
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:44,420
Nobody wants to see a film
about Adolf fucking Hitler!

1250
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,422
I do!

1251
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,720
You're missing the point.

1252
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:56,974
In the end, it's not about Hitler,
it's about The Tramp.

1253
01:45:57,059 --> 01:46:00,853
- The little Jewish barber taking his place.
- Charlie,

1254
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:03,939
what's happening in Europe
is not our problem.

1255
01:46:04,232 --> 01:46:07,610
90% of Americans say
we should stay out of the war.

1256
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:09,862
That's nine out of 10!

1257
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,156
It's not your business.

1258
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,741
You're a comic.

1259
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:18,704
Yes, Syd. And you are a Jew.

1260
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:28,839
Nevertheless,

1261
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,800
I've got to give it a try.

1262
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:34,512
Otherwise, what have I been doing

1263
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,806
all these years?

1264
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:41,185
I know talking will be the end of The Tramp.
That's for sure.

1265
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:46,857
But at least he'll go out
saying something I believe in.

1266
01:46:49,528 --> 01:46:52,822
All right. We'll see how it goes.

1267
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:54,115
Roll camera!

1268
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:59,120
The Great Dictator, scene Y-11-A, take one.

1269
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,670
I'm sorry, but I'm not an emperor.

1270
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:11,048
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1271
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:13,759
I should like to help everyone, if possible.

1272
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,512
Jew, Gentile, black man, white.

1273
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:20,850
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1274
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:23,853
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1275
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,856
Greed has poisoned men's souls,

1276
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:29,650
has barricaded the world with hate,

1277
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:32,528
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1278
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:34,363
Do not despair.

1279
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:38,284
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.

1280
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,786
He's not talking about Germany, you know?

1281
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:45,207
He is talking about America. That is...
Turn that goddamn thing down!

1282
01:47:46,209 --> 01:47:48,461
Soldiers, don't
give yourselves to brutes.

1283
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:52,381
That is what we need
to make people understand.

1284
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,717
...tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel.

1285
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:58,637
To drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder.

1286
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:02,016
Mr. Seeley, you're looking a little pale.

1287
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:05,561
Maybe it's time you took a trip to California.

1288
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:09,690
Comrades! Let us all fight for a new world.

1289
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:11,275
Commie bastard!

1290
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:17,740
Soldiers! In the name of democracy,
let us unite!

1291
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:24,246
- So what brings you to California?
- Oh, I was sent by my firm.

1292
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:27,583
We're planning on expanding our interest
in the movie business.

1293
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:31,170
Although I really don't know
that much about it.

1294
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:33,255
Quite a full house today, sir.

1295
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:36,509
Congratulations, Charlie,
on the London opening.

1296
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:37,927
Oh, thank you.

1297
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:42,723
- Tea is on its way, sir.
- Good.

1298
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:44,767
Lovely afternoon, Charlie, thank you.

1299
01:48:44,809 --> 01:48:46,894
Sorry, Charlie.

1300
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:57,363
Women drop handkerchiefs.
I guess men drop other things.

1301
01:49:05,455 --> 01:49:07,122
- Charlie?
- Yes.

1302
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:11,961
Charlie, upper regional domes
immensely expansive.

1303
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,504
What?

1304
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:17,675
Upper regional domes,
immensely expansive.

1305
01:49:17,759 --> 01:49:20,261
That's how you describe Joan Barry
in your book.

1306
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:24,223
She was very... She was
well-endowed, is that what you mean?

1307
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:26,016
Yes.

1308
01:49:26,142 --> 01:49:29,144
You honestly expect your readers
to believe that it wasn't just sex?

1309
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:32,898
Well, I didn't have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her.

1310
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:36,277
I didn't exactly throw money around.
I spent thousands on her.

1311
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:38,445
I wrote a screenplay for her.

1312
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:42,825
I don't care what the readers think.
Joan definitely had talent.

1313
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:45,953
She was intelligent. She was pretty.

1314
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:48,330
She was willing to work hard.

1315
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:52,001
And the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic.

1316
01:49:54,129 --> 01:49:56,130
But she became erratic.

1317
01:49:57,048 --> 01:50:01,135
For whatever reason,
she began to have some kind of breakdown.

1318
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:06,515
She took to driving up to my house,
drunk, in the middle of the night.

1319
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:11,186
She was arrested, ran up debts,
made scenes.

1320
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:16,692
In the end, as I've explained, I refused
to have anything further to do with her.

1321
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:20,321
How could you have been
such a fool, Charlie?

1322
01:50:20,822 --> 01:50:23,699
You took up with a crazy girl
with umpteen different identities,

1323
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,951
was a promiscuous, vengeful liar.

1324
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,539
And for, perhaps, the only time in your life,
you didn't propose marriage.

1325
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:34,335
Hoover had kept tabs on you for 20 years.

1326
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:37,379
And he still had no idea how to nail you
until you played

1327
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:41,175
right into his hands by shutting Joan out.

1328
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,097
You're improving, Frank.

1329
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:50,142
Can't you find someone else
to play with?

1330
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:53,062
Apparently not. Not anymore.

1331
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:57,524
- Who's that?
- Ah, the debutante.

1332
01:50:58,693 --> 01:51:00,694
You're doing a favor for her agent.

1333
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:04,448
Oh, not another one that wants to act.
It's endless. Endless!

1334
01:51:05,367 --> 01:51:07,284
This is the last time.

1335
01:51:07,702 --> 01:51:09,578
They all think it's so easy, you know.

1336
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,830
I bet when she was 10,
she wanted to be a fireman.

1337
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,707
Tell you what, you have half an hour,
then get me out of it.

1338
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,084
- Some appointment.
- Right.

1339
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:17,419
- Someone important.
- Leave it to me.

1340
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,296
Mr. Chaplin?

1341
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:22,966
I'm Oona O'Neill.

1342
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:27,096
Hi.

1343
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,597
My agent did say 3:00.

1344
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,432
But if I'm interrupting your game,
I can always come back...

1345
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:32,101
No! No.

1346
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,562
I was waiting for you.

1347
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:42,820
I always have tea at 4:00.

1348
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:46,115
- So how long have you been in Hollywood?
- Just this summer.

1349
01:51:48,076 --> 01:51:50,661
My agent got me a screen test at Fox.

1350
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,164
They gonna put you under contract?

1351
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:56,875
I don't know.

1352
01:51:59,295 --> 01:52:00,295
You tell me.

1353
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:04,258
Yes, if you want me to.

1354
01:52:05,593 --> 01:52:06,593
Uh, Charlie!

1355
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:10,514
Charlie, excuse me.
It's nearly time for your appointment.

1356
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:12,474
Appointment?

1357
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:17,479
Appointment.

1358
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:20,941
Who's it with, Frank?

1359
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,527
Uh, Fred.

1360
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,323
Fred. Not Astaire again.

1361
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:31,368
- That's right.
- Ginger, too?

1362
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:33,078
Could be.

1363
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,290
Well, I'm sick of them.

1364
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:38,167
Tell them I've got nothing more
to teach them.

1365
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:40,085
They're gonna have to try
and make it on their own.

1366
01:52:42,213 --> 01:52:43,380
Right.

1367
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:50,345
I'm sorry.
I asked him to interrupt in case I was...

1368
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:55,225
I mean, in case you were...

1369
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,400
I've never been to England.

1370
01:53:34,724 --> 01:53:36,391
You're a good dancer.

1371
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:08,799
George, l’ve just
written this for the end.

1372
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:13,387
For the last 20 years
I have known what happiness means.

1373
01:54:14,055 --> 01:54:17,808
I wish I could write more about this.
But it involves love.

1374
01:54:18,434 --> 01:54:22,104
And perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations.

1375
01:54:22,146 --> 01:54:24,481
Because it is more than one can express.

1376
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:25,941
Excuse me.

1377
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,444
- ... Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Henry.

1378
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:35,117
- I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.
- No, it's all right. Come in. Come in.

1379
01:54:39,455 --> 01:54:40,789
What is it, Henry?

1380
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:42,708
Well, I'm not quite sure, sir.

1381
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:45,252
I just took a call from Miss Barry, sir.

1382
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:49,089
She wanted me to tell you, sir,
that she's pregnant, sir.

1383
01:54:58,224 --> 01:55:00,601
I never... Um... Before I started...

1384
01:55:04,314 --> 01:55:05,731
Where's Mr. Charles?

1385
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,316
With Harry.

1386
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:11,653
Oh, he may be on the stage by now.

1387
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:15,324
Mr. Charles, he down there?

1388
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:22,497
Charlie. Okay.

1389
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:27,920
She'll drop the paternity suit.
I just talked to her lawyers, she'll settle.

1390
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,047
- No.
- What?

1391
01:55:31,007 --> 01:55:32,507
Well, just listen.

1392
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:36,428
She'll take $150,000.
And that's nothing, not compared to a trial.

1393
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:40,515
She says you did it at Christmas
when she came to your house.

1394
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:42,476
- Morning, Mary.
- Good morning.

1395
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:45,187
Kid, I've been making deals for you
all our lives.

1396
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:46,355
I've never made one this good.

1397
01:55:46,397 --> 01:55:49,858
It was over long before Christmas.
It can't be my child.

1398
01:55:49,901 --> 01:55:51,360
Just get it out of the way.

1399
01:55:51,402 --> 01:55:53,028
I can't do that.

1400
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:56,448
I've got Oona to think of now.
Syd, I've got to prove my innocence.

1401
01:55:56,532 --> 01:56:00,202
Look, I'm all for proving your innocence, kid.
But how?

1402
01:56:04,457 --> 01:56:05,540
Go back to them.

1403
01:56:07,877 --> 01:56:09,211
I beg you.

1404
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:12,381
Get them to agree to a blood test.

1405
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:15,801
So that night
when you went to his house,

1406
01:56:15,885 --> 01:56:20,555
did you and Mr. Chaplin
have sexual relations?

1407
01:56:21,683 --> 01:56:23,058
Doesn't it look like it?

1408
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,394
Never mind what it looks like.

1409
01:56:25,436 --> 01:56:27,771
Did you have sexual relations
with Mr. Chaplin?

1410
01:56:27,855 --> 01:56:31,024
She just said she did. Why else
would she agree to the blood tests?

1411
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,655
The next morning he just called a cab.

1412
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:39,241
Paid me off.

1413
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:45,080
He wanted somebody younger, classier.

1414
01:56:47,917 --> 01:56:49,292
Didn't he?

1415
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:04,558
Hello.

1416
01:57:06,769 --> 01:57:07,811
Yes.

1417
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:10,605
Yes.

1418
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,278
Yes, thank you.

1419
01:57:18,156 --> 01:57:19,740
It's all over.

1420
01:57:20,616 --> 01:57:23,035
The blood test prove it's not my baby.

1421
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:36,590
Right, let's just forget all this new-fangled
rubbish about blood tests.

1422
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:38,633
Let's put it out of our minds.

1423
01:57:38,676 --> 01:57:41,678
His Honor has ruled them inadmissible.

1424
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:45,807
What is important now
is the financial future of this poor child.

1425
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:49,311
It is her future the state of California
is here to protect.

1426
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,022
It makes me mad

1427
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:56,568
to watch the way this fellow
tries to put it over us simpletons.

1428
01:57:56,652 --> 01:58:00,238
This great star of stage and screen,
this alien,

1429
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:03,450
who has enjoyed the hospitality
of our country for nearly 30 years

1430
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:05,494
without ever once, ever once,

1431
01:58:06,037 --> 01:58:08,789
deigning to apply for American citizenship.

1432
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:13,585
But what good
has all this money done Chaplin?

1433
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:16,421
Wasting his substance in debauching girls.

1434
01:58:16,506 --> 01:58:18,632
What good has it done the country?

1435
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:22,010
This is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism.

1436
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:26,807
Now my client, on the other hand,

1437
01:58:28,893 --> 01:58:30,310
is, alas,

1438
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:34,523
no more moral than Chaplin.

1439
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:39,277
Yes. Yes. They're both equally guilty.

1440
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:43,448
Only, Chaplin is old enough to be her father.

1441
01:58:44,033 --> 01:58:46,326
Prowling around with girls that age.

1442
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:51,706
Members of the jury, use your God-given
common sense, and just look at this man.

1443
01:58:53,501 --> 01:58:57,129
This cheap, Cockney cad.

1444
01:58:59,298 --> 01:59:00,507
This

1445
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:04,386
little tramp.

1446
01:59:06,347 --> 01:59:08,557
And then take a very good look

1447
01:59:09,767 --> 01:59:11,977
at innocent little Carol Ann.

1448
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:16,898
I defy you not to see the resemblance.

1449
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:19,609
Gentlemen and ladies,

1450
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:24,072
wives and mothers around the country
are watching you.

1451
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,701
Watching to see you stop Chaplin
in his tracks.

1452
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:32,622
You'll sleep well
the night you give this baby a name.

1453
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:36,084
The night you show this lecher

1454
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:40,213
that the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row.

1455
02:00:07,658 --> 02:00:09,701
It's a star-studded evening here.

1456
02:00:12,955 --> 02:00:17,125
Here is Charlie Chaplin
with his lovely wife, Oona.

1457
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:25,800
There goes Mrs. Chaplin,
looking gorgeous this evening

1458
02:00:25,843 --> 02:00:27,636
on the arm of her famous husband...

1459
02:00:46,822 --> 02:00:48,990
Are you a communist, Mr. Chaplin?

1460
02:00:49,033 --> 02:00:52,160
- Are you a fellow traveler?
- Mr. Chaplin...

1461
02:00:52,245 --> 02:00:55,163
Are you going to attend
the McCarthy hearing?

1462
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:58,250
- Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.
- Mr. Chaplin...

1463
02:00:58,334 --> 02:01:02,379
Mr. Chaplin has repeatedly said
he'll go whenever they call him.

1464
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:09,803
And even... Even if there were only
one communist in the state department,

1465
02:01:10,346 --> 02:01:13,014
even if there were only one communist
in the state department,

1466
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:16,017
that would still be one communist too many.

1467
02:01:18,562 --> 02:01:21,648
Mr. Lawson, are you
a member of the Communist Party

1468
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,192
or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

1469
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:27,696
It's unfortunate and tragic
that I have to teach this committee

1470
02:01:27,738 --> 02:01:29,781
- the basic principles of Americanism.
- That's not the question.

1471
02:01:29,865 --> 02:01:31,825
That's not the question.

1472
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:35,120
The question is, have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

1473
02:01:35,204 --> 02:01:39,291
I'm framing my answer in
the only way in which any American citizen

1474
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:43,878
can frame his answer to a question
which absolutely invades his...

1475
02:01:43,963 --> 02:01:46,339
Then you refuse to answer
that question, is that correct?

1476
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:48,925
I have told you
that I will offer my beliefs...

1477
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:51,553
- I have written Americanism...
- Stand away from the stand!

1478
02:01:51,595 --> 02:01:53,930
- ... for many years and I shall continue...
- Stand away from the stand!

1479
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:56,558
...to fight for the Bill of Rights
which you are seeking to destroy.

1480
02:01:56,642 --> 02:01:58,101
Officer, take this man
away from the stand.

1481
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:09,195
I'd love to get away for a while, darling.

1482
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:14,409
Maybe after this bundle arrives
we could take the children and go.

1483
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:27,922
Sir.

1484
02:02:29,258 --> 02:02:30,425
Sir.

1485
02:02:31,093 --> 02:02:34,721
We've just got word.
Chaplin's off to London on vacation.

1486
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:03,124
KK.
- Mummy, Mummy.

1487
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:04,709
Where did you leave Mr. Chaplin?

1488
02:03:04,794 --> 02:03:07,462
- We left him back there at the stern.
- Mummy.

1489
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:09,506
It's all right, darling.

1490
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:12,467
Charlie.

1491
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:24,813
Charlie.

1492
02:03:25,606 --> 02:03:28,733
What? What is it, sweetheart?

1493
02:03:31,153 --> 02:03:32,278
Is it Syd?

1494
02:03:33,155 --> 02:03:34,322
No.

1495
02:03:35,157 --> 02:03:36,658
What is it?

1496
02:03:41,205 --> 02:03:42,705
They've thrown you out.

1497
02:03:45,459 --> 02:03:48,002
Thrown me out? Thrown me out of what?

1498
02:03:51,882 --> 02:03:53,383
Of America.

1499
02:03:57,388 --> 02:03:59,013
I'm so sorry.

1500
02:04:05,813 --> 02:04:07,689
- I can't go back?
- No.

1501
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:15,155
Charlie.

1502
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:21,995
There are nights
it's still hard being in exile.

1503
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:24,706
I'm sure they wouldn't
refuse you a visa now, Charles.

1504
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:27,584
Have you never thought of going back?

1505
02:04:27,668 --> 02:04:30,795
- Why don't we all go inside?
I have everything I need right here.

1506
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,089
- But it's cold.
I like the cold.

1507
02:04:33,174 --> 02:04:35,425
- I have to go anyway.
Telephone.

1508
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:38,678
Charlie, I heard the first three rings,
thank you.

1509
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:43,600
No, George, in answer to your question.
I'm used to invitations.

1510
02:04:44,226 --> 02:04:45,518
Ah, yes.

1511
02:04:45,561 --> 02:04:46,936
Well, it's been a long day, Charlie.

1512
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:49,564
Yes. You must be very tired.

1513
02:04:51,233 --> 02:04:53,276
Come on, George, finish it off.

1514
02:04:54,445 --> 02:04:56,237
The question mark.

1515
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,114
What's it all about?

1516
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,950
You mean that?

1517
02:05:02,578 --> 02:05:03,620
Yes.

1518
02:05:05,122 --> 02:05:08,500
Well, it was a personal matter, really.
Nothing relevant.

1519
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:09,751
Tell me.

1520
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:12,879
All right.

1521
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:15,924
The madness.

1522
02:05:17,134 --> 02:05:20,094
I just wondered, how much did it affect you?

1523
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:24,140
What makes you think it did?

1524
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:27,685
- Well, your mother was certified insane...
- Yes.

1525
02:05:28,312 --> 02:05:30,688
...and your grandmother
was certified insane as well, and...

1526
02:05:30,773 --> 02:05:32,023
Yes.

1527
02:05:34,443 --> 02:05:37,695
That's not what dogged me, George.
It wasn't that.

1528
02:05:43,494 --> 02:05:44,786
It was...

1529
02:05:45,329 --> 02:05:50,291
It was the knowledge that if you did
what I did for a living, if you were a clown,

1530
02:05:50,834 --> 02:05:54,587
and you had a passion
to tell a particular kind of story,

1531
02:05:58,300 --> 02:05:59,634
something

1532
02:06:02,429 --> 02:06:03,680
beyond,

1533
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:07,433
but you only have the one chance
to get it right.

1534
02:06:07,476 --> 02:06:09,227
And I never did.

1535
02:06:09,311 --> 02:06:11,729
One never does. But you know that.

1536
02:06:12,856 --> 02:06:15,358
That's not the problem.

1537
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:25,493
It's when you feel you're getting really close

1538
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,663
but you can't make it the rest of the way.

1539
02:06:29,206 --> 02:06:32,500
You're not good enough.
You're not complete enough.

1540
02:06:33,669 --> 02:06:35,920
And despite all your fantasies,

1541
02:06:37,506 --> 02:06:38,715
you're second-rate.

1542
02:06:39,008 --> 02:06:40,008
Charlie.

1543
02:06:40,217 --> 02:06:41,634
Human.

1544
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:46,848
That's very hard.

1545
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:53,396
Why didn't you add that?

1546
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:55,565
It's not important, really.

1547
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:59,277
End of the day,
you're not judged by what you didn't do,

1548
02:06:59,361 --> 02:07:01,112
but by what you did.

1549
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,283
And I didn't change things, I just...

1550
02:07:07,202 --> 02:07:08,536
He just

1551
02:07:11,081 --> 02:07:12,874
cheered people up.

1552
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,461
Not bad, that.

1553
02:07:59,254 --> 02:08:00,588
Charlie?

1554
02:08:03,133 --> 02:08:04,425
Charlie?

1555
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:11,557
Charlie, dear.

1556
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:15,269
I dreamed I was answering questions
for George. Silly.

1557
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:20,358
Charlie, that was California calling again.
You really do have to give them an answer.

1558
02:08:20,442 --> 02:08:23,653
No. They took 20 years
to make up their mind,

1559
02:08:23,737 --> 02:08:26,823
- I can take another afternoon.
- Enough. Enough!

1560
02:08:32,287 --> 02:08:34,414
What if they still hate me?

1561
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:49,470
Live from Los Angeles, the 44th
annual Academy Awards presentation.

1562
02:09:03,485 --> 02:09:05,987
Suppose they start throwing things.

1563
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:08,156
Now that would be a story.

1564
02:09:08,198 --> 02:09:10,992
You never know on the stage.

1565
02:09:11,243 --> 02:09:15,538
Hmm, I can see the headlines now.
"Amazing Incident At Academy Awards.

1566
02:09:15,622 --> 02:09:17,915
"Chaplin Disappears
Under Avalanche Of Oscars. "

1567
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,709
Mr. Walter Matthau.

1568
02:09:20,669 --> 02:09:22,128
Oh, look, darling, it's Walter.

1569
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:25,923
Does that make you happy?

1570
02:09:26,008 --> 02:09:28,009
- No.
- Crabby.

1571
02:09:28,844 --> 02:09:32,889
Oh, I should never have let them
show those film clips. I never...

1572
02:09:32,973 --> 02:09:35,975
People won't like them.
They'll think they're old.

1573
02:09:36,018 --> 02:09:38,478
Well, they are old.
Well over 50 years, some of them.

1574
02:09:42,357 --> 02:09:45,693
You know the worst thing about age,

1575
02:09:47,029 --> 02:09:49,030
you can't defend yourself.

1576
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:55,369
When I was young, handsome,
had my power,

1577
02:09:56,455 --> 02:10:01,626
if they came after me, I'd make a movie
and make them laugh and I'd make them cry.

1578
02:10:04,129 --> 02:10:06,088
Now I'm at their mercy.

1579
02:10:07,716 --> 02:10:09,467
- Come in.
- Go away.

1580
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:12,762
We're ready for you, Mr. Chaplin.

1581
02:10:12,846 --> 02:10:16,015
This is a historic milestone
in the life of the Academy.

1582
02:10:16,058 --> 02:10:17,809
Behave yourself.

1583
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:21,896
I would like to present the President
of the Academy, Mr. Daniel Taradash.

1584
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:25,817
Now remember, the President
of the Academy, Mr. Daniel Taradash.

1585
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:27,527
- Taradash?
- Yes.

1586
02:10:27,569 --> 02:10:29,362
Sounds like a spice.

1587
02:10:29,571 --> 02:10:32,448
The inscription reads,
"To Charles Chaplin,

1588
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:36,911
"for the incalculable effect
he has had in making motion pictures

1589
02:10:36,954 --> 02:10:39,247
"the art form of this century.

1590
02:10:41,959 --> 02:10:46,921
"Humor heightens our sense of survival
and preserves our sanity. "

1591
02:10:47,673 --> 02:10:50,174
These are the words of Charlie Chaplin.

1592
02:10:50,551 --> 02:10:54,262
The abiding elements
of Chaplin's artistic conscience

1593
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,098
as actor, writer, director,

1594
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,435
and to quote W.C. Fields,
"The greatest ballet dancer that ever lived. "

1595
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,105
A few years ago, Mr. Chaplin said,

1596
02:11:04,648 --> 02:11:07,358
"My only enemy is time. "

1597
02:11:08,318 --> 02:11:10,236
We respectfully disagree.

1598
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:12,613
I'm going to leave you here, darling.

1599
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:14,699
My white dress, remember?

1600
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:17,535
They mustn't see anyone
till the clips are over.

1601
02:11:18,704 --> 02:11:22,456
...some unfathomable future
on some faraway star.

1602
02:11:22,624 --> 02:11:27,628
Time is Charlie Chaplin's dearest
and eternal friend.

1603
02:11:28,755 --> 02:11:30,715
And here is the proof.

1604
02:11:30,799 --> 02:11:34,302
Watch, remember, rejoice.

1605
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,828
I love you, Charlie.
