This Story is True.
It is drawn from the writings and personal.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,948
Memories of Corrie Ten Boom,

3
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,051
<i> Her family and others who - </i>
<i>  with them - </i>

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,212
endured the darkness...

00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:48,172
The Hiding Place

6
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:07,247
Haarlem, Holland - Spring 1940

7
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,282
<i>By Wireless from the BBC,</i>

8
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,518
<i>Her Majesty,</i>
<i>The Queen of the Netherlands.</i>

9
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,188
<i>Fellow Hollanders,</i>

10
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,259
<i>The Lights have gone out</i>
<i>of a free Holland.</i>

11
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>Where only two weeks ago</i>
<i>there was a free Nation of Men and Women,</i>

12
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,901
<i>both up in the cherished tradition</i>
<i>of Christian Civilization,</i>

13
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>There is now stillness of death.</i>

14
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,508
<i>Oppressed, Threatened...</i>

15
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,377
<i>Watched on every side...</i>

16
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:42,649
<i>by the power that would tear out</i>
<i>all hope from the soul of man.</i>

17
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:48,488
<i>The unhappy people of Holland</i>
<i>can only Pray in silence,</i>

18
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,090
<i>For those who have lost their voice...</i>

19
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,394
<i>but not their Hope</i>
<i>or their Vision</i>

20
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,898

22
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,993
Oh.......
Coffee...

23
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,669
In the parlour.

24
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,848
<i>Attention ! Attention !</i>

32
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,580
Good Morning Mr.Ten Boom.

33
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,811
I appologize for the intrusion.

34
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,553
- They are collecting all radios.
- I can see that.

35
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,757
And Dutch Police men assisting them !

36
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,521
We do what we must.

38
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,066
- The radio is ?
- Upstairs in the Parlour !

39
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,557
Get it.

40
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,900
You have many beautiful clocks here.

41
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,846
BÃ¡varo ?

42
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,052
The cabinet looks like
Sir Berringer's works.

43
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,385
Yeah, 1886.

44
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,459
You know watches,... clocks ?

45
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,095
My Father is a watch maker.

46
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,825
I grew up in Reuverswinch.

47
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,365
You look what you have grown into.

48
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,403
- What District ?
- Mattenbraw.

49
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,604
Mattenbraw...

50
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,075
Mattenbraw, 1895.

51
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,453
- Magnificient.
- But you should have seen that watch...

52
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,054
When it was taken in.

53
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,257
The way some people treat a watch
No care... No....

54
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,427
understanding.

55
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,056
It was a gift on my 70th 
Birthday.

56
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,703
" To Grandpa Ten Boom,
      - From the Children of Haarlem.

57
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,503
26th of March 1935. "

58
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,968
Give him the horn.

59
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,539
- Any other radios in the house ?
- No, No.

60
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,018
Good day then.

61
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:35,338
JEWS NOT WELCOME

62
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,818
FORBIDDEN TO JEWS

63
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,576
I don't want anything too expensive,
you understand ?

64
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,578
Or just this one ....

65
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,481
Seven Jewels , in a Swiss factory,

66
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,085
But, all the craftsmen are German immigrants.
It's 42 Guilders.

67
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,189
Its for Aniversary. 
We could spend little more.

68
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,392
Oh, Well,,,Then just this one 

69
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,863
Bamendor works.
uhh...Excuse me...

70
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,991
Papa, Are you going out ?

71
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,968
I will not caught around this house
and do nothing.

72
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,533
Papa ?

73
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,580
Excuse me..

74
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,014
I'm Sorry.

75
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,853
Yes...

76
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,822
You... see...

77
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,792
You could have it engraved...

78
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,362
Or you could order it in ...
White Gold.

79
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,264
The White Gold is 60.

80
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,800
<i>Residents in the occupied Netherland</i>

81
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,362
<i>must come forward according to</i>
<i>the following regulations.</i>

82
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,574
<i>- A Person is considered as being a Jew ...</i>
- Here's your star.

83
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,043
<i>Or part Jew...</i>
- Next.

84
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:16,174
<i>if he had atleast one grand parent with</i>
<i>originary of full Jew.</i>

85
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,218
<i>A grand parent is considered a Jew</i>

86
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:23,756
<i>if he belongs or has belonged </i>
<i>to the Jewish Church.</i>

87
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,794
You shouldn't be here.

88
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,592
I have come for my Star.

89
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,600
They are for Jews.

90
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,671
You don't have a "J"
on your identity card.

91
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,640
You could get it for me.

92
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,977
If we all where them 
they would't know the difference between...

93
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,878
a Gentile and a Jew.

94
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,650
Go home, please.

95
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,948
Go home.

96
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,489
I will wear my Star !

97
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,694
And I wont take it off....
Until GOD tells me to take it off !

98
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,530
The GOD of Abraham and Issac...

99
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,225
Are my GOD, too !

100
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,167
Who's the leader ?

101
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,244
Hurry, Quick.
Turn around !

102
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,784
Good Morning...

103
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,514
Isn't it Miss.Ten Boom ?

104
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,655
Children, Stop here.

105
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,287
The watch maker shop ?

106
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,887
Ten Boom, Berteljorisstraat !

107
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,893
Yea, you came for our radio.

108
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,469
I wrote to my Father.

109
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,739
- I told him about your shop.
- Who are those boys ?

110
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,042
Why are they being allowed to 
torment that man ?

111
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,411
They are young Dutch patriots.

112
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:57,717
You might have heard public statements
derogatory to the Reich and our Fuhrer.

113
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,586
They are expressing their indignation.

114
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,747
Patriots ?

115
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,490
Who are these children ?

116
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,962
I teach a class.

117
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,598
I tell them about GOD.

118
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,362
And this I used to.

119
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,703
This will be the last one.

120
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,607
Thanks to your new directive
concerning unauthorised meetings.

121
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,945
Miss. Ten Boom...
The measures are temporary.

122
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:30,282
When all this is over. 
When order has been restored,

123
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:35,242
then all the Aryan peoples will live together
as brothers in our life.

124
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:41,494
Men live together as brothers
only in the Kingdom of our LORD.

125
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,928
Nowhere else.

126
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,488
May we go ?

127
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,329
Come... yea.

128
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,528
Children... Children...

129
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,596
Come ! Come !

130
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,299
Have some cookies. yea...

131
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,302
Jan comes running for 
the cookies.

132
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,404
Lisa, yea.

133
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,737
Carol... ah, yea !

134
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,208
Ha ! Cookies ?

135
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,685
I may not be able to be with you
for a while.

136
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,714
But Jesus will still be there...

137
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,020
Always watching over you.

138
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:57,030
You see without Jesus,

139
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,338
We are like this.

140
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,704
Empty !

141
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,935
We can do nothing.

142
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,317
But then Jesus fills us...

143
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,877
with His Love,

144
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,753
Then we are full....
Yea !

145
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,322
We can do anything.

146
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,925
We can do anything...

147
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,104
Nothing serious, Pastor.
Little bit dirt may be.

148
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,673
It has been loosing 
5 seconds a day.

149
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,276
May be a good cleaning.

150
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,612
You can do it in an hour ?

151
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,814
While I am here...

152
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,183
It really would be most helpful.

153
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,751
Yea !

154
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,286
Good !

155
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,155
I will have an hour chat
with your papa.

156
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:54,023
I hear he has been wearing
a Jewish Star.

157
00:14:55,394 --> 00:15:01,634
Stubbornness is the child of pride..
And pride is the first of the seven deadly sins.

158
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,203
I will speak to him about it.

159
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,406
I will need to be back
at the Church by 1:30.

160
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,874
It will be ready.

161
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,783
Dr. Heemstra !!

162
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,618
Miss. Ten Boom.

163
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,485
Can only stay for a moment.

164
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,443
We need milk for him,
not soup.

165
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,844
Good LORD.... You don't intend
to keep it !

166
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,876
But you can't !..........

167
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,045
It's illegal !

168
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,491
You could all be arrested !

169
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,153
Aha.. he is beautiful.

170
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,356
Pastor...

171
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,136
The LORD must have sent you here !

172
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,272
You live in the Country !

173
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,741
There he could be safer !

174
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,643
Its...

175
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,975
Impossible.

176
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,044
I have my own family to think of.

177
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,722
We could loose everthing 
for that child.

178
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,625
Where would my Church be
without a Shepherd ?

179
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,423
- Ah, But...
- No, Betsie !

180
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,431
Pastor has decided.

181
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:44,164
It is the Law !
And Christians must obey the Law !

182
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,407
Think what you are risking,

183
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,610
for the sake of one Jewish baby.

184
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,013
Will you report us, Pastor,

185
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,216
If the baby must stay
a while with us ?

186
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:02,654
Corrie...
We are ment to obey the law of the State

187
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,818
If it does not go against
a higher law of GOD.

188
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,799
Pastor, you want me to 
take off my Star.

189
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,257
Very well... I will not wear it.

190
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,463
And we will keep the child.

191
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,479
As a Christian...

192
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,183
I am sorry that any man
must suffer,

193
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:35,421
No matter who he is 
what his race.

194
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:40,882
- But remember it is the Jews,..
- Who gave us the Bible...

195
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,559
and our Saviour !

196
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,137
It is on your heads.

197
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,836
I'll pick up my watch tomorrow.

198
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,738
Good Day, Ten Boom.

199
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,741
Ladies.

200
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,324
GOD forgive him.
He did not mean it.

201
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,192
How can that man call himself 
a Christian ?

202
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,498
If a mouse lives in the cookie jar,

203
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,400
that doesn't necessarily make 
him a cookie.

204
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,538
What do we do ?

205
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,269
- He must have milk !
- He should go to the country.

206
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,378
- Careful, He'll suffogate.
- No

207
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,315
- Where would you send him ?
- GOD will know.

208
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,550
Doors are opening
all over Holland.

209
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,544
Last week we had a Dutch farm girl 
and a peasant Baroness in the same bed.

210
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,660
And now you will have our little 
Moses into basket.

211
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,735
Corrie, Please.

212
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,930
Thank you.

213
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,266
- Willem !
- He must not cry !

214
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,237
- You certainly are organised.
- It's not the first time.

215
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,851
We are away station...

216
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,751
For a day or a week.

217
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,459
You hid this from us, Willem ?

218
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,363
Germans Jews before the occupation,
and now the Dutch.

219
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,991
We do what we can.

220
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,693
But the Nazis will not be satisfied 
until there is not a Jew left in Europe. 

221
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:36,575
They have touched the Apple of GOD's eye.
I pity them.

222
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,777
- I hate them.
- Ah, Corrie...

223
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,372
You can't hate anyone and
walk with the LORD....

224
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,752
You could have told us,
Willem, We might have helped.

225
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,288
It is important toget our 
little friend out of here.

226
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,957
You would be hard pressed to explain
this sudden gift from heaven.

227
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,293
Son, I will walk with you
a little way.

228
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,094
Good Bye, Moses.

229
00:19:56,094 --> 00:20:00,532
We have been managing all right.
Sometimes we have some potatoes...

230
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,502
and occasionally eggs even !

231
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,700
So far we have not done too badly.
And of course we...

232
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,612
- Is this the Dutch farm girl ?
- Grand pa !

233
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,148
Kik, Did you get anything ?

234
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,383
The carbon from the waste basket,

235
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,420
If you hold it out to the light,
You can just make it out.

236
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,718
Thank you.

237
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,958
You see, Papa...

238
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,826
- We have a contact in the Gestapo...
- H a a s h (Quiet)  !

239
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,089
He gives us a deportation list
whenever he can.

240
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,859
Alright, Kik ?

241
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,608
Bye, Grandpa.

242
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,874
- God Bless you, Kik.
- Steady it with one hand... Good !

243
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,141
Papa...

244
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,723
Everyday now...

245
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:02,353
They send 400 Jews from Amsterdam
Central Station.

246
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,689
We reach those we can.

247
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,928
Do we know anyone on the list ?

248
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,811
- I beg your pardon.
- No, please...I...I...

249
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,547
I am sorry ...

250
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,482
to inconvenience you.

251
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,994
May be he is a...

252
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,047
Papa...
There is a Gentleman upstairs.

253
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,749
We have met.

254
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,418
- It was too late...
- He has no place to go.

255
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,253
Papa, He is a Professor.

256
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,189
Willem studied with him.
They closed the university.

257
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,725
All the Jewish teachers 
were forced...

258
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,920
Ah, Betsie...

259
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,664
Good morning again, Professor.

260
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:24,770
I appologise for the intrusion,
Mr. Ten Boom.

261
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,671
Please...

262
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,935
Thank You.

263
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,417
Professor...

264
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,649
Will you do us the honour
of asking the Blessing ?

265
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,862
<i>       Ba-ruch a-tah A-do-nai...       </i>
 <i>( Blessed are You, Lord, our God ) </i>

266
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,532
<i>  E-lo-hei-nu Me-lech Ha-o-lam,</i>
 <i>   ( King of the universe, )</i>

267
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:00,372
<i>    ha-mo-tzi le-chem min ha-a-retz.      </i>
<i>( who brings forth bread from the earth )</i>

268
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,640
Amen.

269
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,801
Amen.

270
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,154
How fortunate aunt Bep
had big feet.

271
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,349
Yes.

272
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,794
Hmm... When were you born ?

273
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,989
Born ?

274
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:33,238
19th August 1885.

275
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,073
Father's Name ?

276
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,642
Ten Boom Casper.

277
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,411
Mother ?

278
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,914
Ten Boom Cornelia.

279
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,250
Her maiden name ?

280
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,586
Miss. Ten Boom...

281
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,689
If we are stopped, ey...

282
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,558
I could never 
pass as you.

283
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,494
Professor Ziener...

284
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,697
There are no ifs in GOD's world.

285
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,299
He brought you to 
this house,

286
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,735
And he will see you
get safely away.

287
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,408
This is your turn, Professor.
Stay close with me.

288
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,672
I'll try.

289
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:53,013
It's wonderful, Professor !
We are almost there.

290
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,819
- Katrien !
- Aunt Corrie !

291
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,691
- Aunt Corrie !
- Katrien !

292
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,266
I need your father's help.

293
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,303
You should have seen Professor Ziener
getting into the boat.

294
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:16,508
Katrien's father was attending him like 
Queen Willemina boarding the yatch !

295
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,111
Cornelia, do you think that you are 
enjoying this a little too much ?

296
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,047
Enjoying ?

297
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,616
No, I was terrified.

298
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:28,787
I am been able to laugh at it
all dressed up like Betsie...

299
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:33,358
Oh....Thank GOD.
He kept the patrols away.

300
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,027
Be sure to save a piece of cake 
for Willem's friend.

301
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,429
Friend ?

302
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,664
It is all very mysterious.

303
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,300
Someone he wants us to meet.

304
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,071
What did Willem say when you
told him about Professor Ziener ?

305
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:50,974
This is not some game you play 
when the mood strikes.

306
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,913
If you become involved in 
this work,

307
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,149
people will be forced to trust you 
with their lives...

308
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,887
I told you, Willem.
We gave him my papers.

309
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,091
We thought it out 
very carefully.

310
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,259
And if they questioned him...

311
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,161
Was he supposed to sing Soprano ?

312
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,163
No !

313
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:17,002
He was going to have ...
Quincy Throat.

314
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,266
Excuse me.....

315
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,777
When you wander along the cannal
taking someone out of there ?

316
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,079
How did you know
that you could trust him ?

317
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,881
I knew the man....

318
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,417
And he knew what the LORD told me.

319
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,452
Papa...

320
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,853
You are the master of this house.

321
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,455
The Master of this house...

322
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:47,327
Commands that we open the door
to anyone who knocks.

323
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,903
We cannot afford to 
ignore anyone 

324
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:56,465
who seriously engages in our work
whatever the methods.

325
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:02,572
Perhaps you will allow us
to assist your efforts.

326
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,120
Thank you for the delivery, Mr. Smit.

327
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,059
Only for emergencies !

328
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,899
We have a contact at the exchange,

329
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,603
But you can never be certain that
the line is not tapped.

330
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,807
But you would expected to develop
your own sources.

331
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,143
The less contact you
have with me,

332
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,408
or with anyone else...
the better.

333
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:13,218
Willem,
We know half of Haarlem.

334
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,587
We have friends everywhere !

335
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,557
Dear Lady,
Knowing them is onething...

336
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,795
- Knowing their political views...
- GOD knows !

337
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,765
And we will ask Him to lead.

338
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,701
We appreciate your concerns,
Mr. Sluring.

339
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,341
We are not the most likely candidates.

340
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:41,938
But since there is a need,
we must do what we can to meet it.

341
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:46,117
People have everykind of reason for 
wanting to work in the underground,

342
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,711
Excitement ! perhaps....

343
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,691
Mr. Sluring,

344
00:29:53,691 --> 00:30:00,698
We've passed the age when excitement is of
any major concern in our lives

345
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,064
Truthfully...

346
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,471
I would rather do anything else.

347
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,742
I would like to close the door
and never open it again.

348
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,508
Until this whole hideous 
thing is over.

349
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,978
But that's me.

350
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,951
My LORD JESUS...

351
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:24,445
Tells me to open the doors
to whatever comes.

352
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,249
To give His Love
in what ever way I can.

353
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,298
And I will listen to His voice...

354
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,630
Not mine.

355
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,671
Do we pass inspection ?

356
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,340
How many can you take ?

357
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,784
There is... Mama's room,
and there's your old room,

358
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,454
And there is.... aunt Anna's room,
and... aunty Bep's room

359
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,389
and our 3 rooms... there is 7.

360
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,426
And could share bed 
if we have to.

361
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:05,263
So our hotel is ready 
for guests.

362
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,561
Not quite.

363
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,494
What you do 
if Gestapo comes ?

364
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,907
You'll have a visitor
Jan Smit.

365
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,311
Actually it's 2 houses

366
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,181
Over a 100 years ago
they were joined together.

367
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,652
The one in the front is 2
rooms deep and 1 room wide.

368
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,688
The one at the back...here

369
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,490
Is 3 rooms.

370
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,323
One on top of the other.

371
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,796
Papa, This is Mr. Smit.

372
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,198
Mr. Smit.

373
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:44,435
We know some Smits in Amsterdam.
Are you the Smit family that...

374
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,472
Papa, this is the man I told you about.

375
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,964
He has come to inspect
the house.

376
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,244
Oh... a building inspector ?

377
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,347
Do you have offices
on Grote Hous street ?

378
00:31:56,347 --> 00:32:01,119
No, Papa, he is not a building inspector
and his name is not Smit.

379
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,354
- Not Smit ?
- Excuse us, Papa.

380
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,414
We must locate the rest of the house.

381
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,357
The Parlour...

382
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,100
Meal times..... that's the 
favourite hour for a raid...

383
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,908
Watch your waste baskets...

384
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,009
and astrays.

385
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,720
It need to be as high 
as possible.

386
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,987
They'll ask for the best chance to reach
a safe place while they search below.

387
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:47,126
- These are all bedrooms ?
- Yea.

388
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,868
If the raid comes at night,

389
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,304
They'll have to take their bedding 

390
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,174
Make certain that the 
mattress gets tugged.

391
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:00,845
The favourite trick of the Gestapo
feeling for a warm spot on the bed.

392
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,245
What's up there ?

393
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:18,854
The roof is directly above.
Who sleeps here ?

394
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,965
I do.

395
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,263
Perfect !

396
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,210
The Wall ... will go.

397
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,371
Here !

398
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,325
All clear...
The sign is in the window.

399
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:02,040
You see there is a 
distinctive marking,  

400
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,441
You can always sell
Flenstadht's work.

401
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,519
Lovely day, Aunt Betsie.

402
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,181
Peter, no !

403
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,820
- I'll come for it tuesday then.
- Good.

404
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,295
Uhha. Ten Boom !

405
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,067
Frisian !

406
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,038
Such beautiful wood !

407
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,610
My Father made a case like this once.

408
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,912
Oh, He spent months building it,
polishing, oiling.

409
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,452
It is just a shell...

410
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,081
It needs complete 
set of works.

411
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,722
What price will you be asking ?

412
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:01,155
Well, It will take some months to be ready.

413
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,302
Name a good price.

414
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,066
Exorbitant(expensive) even, I will Pay.

415
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,537
I like the Clock.

416
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,580
- I can afford the best !
- But...

417
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,382
It has no works..

418
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,475
No....hh.

419
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,184
Very well.

420
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,582
Tuesday, Mr. Ten Boom.

421
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,061
Kik ! Hurry !

422
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,676
Aunt Betsie, How many times
do you have to be told ?

423
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,980
Take the sign out of the window
when it isn't safe ! !

424
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,182
Kik...

425
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,913
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry !

426
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,848
Grandpa... Look ! 

427
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,303
Tea, Mr. Smit ?

428
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,635
Ah, Thank you !

429
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,479
Yes, yes, yes,... yes !

430
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,790
- Good Morning.
- Milk !

431
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,560
Not Milk ! Paint !

432
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,128
Paint ?

433
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,264
Betsie ! O Betsie !

434
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,201
Do you remember
Fred Koonstra ?

435
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,538
Of course, he read our 
electric meter for years.

436
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,474
- His daughter was in our Bible class.
- Yea.

437
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,544
- Milk !
- Paint.

438
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,813
Paint !

439
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,882
Elsie Koonstra.

440
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:03,020
I know her name i just have to
sort out few faces.

441
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,423
She must be into her 
twenties by now.

442
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:09,627
I heared yesterday that Fred Koonstra 
works in the Food Office.

443
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,729
Where ?

444
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,721
They issue ration cards.

445
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:31,347
I will be frank
we had some unexpected company.

446
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,385
First, a baby...

447
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,549
Then a man,
and then last night, a couple.

448
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,888
All Jews, Mr. Koonstra.

449
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,694
Why do you tell me ?

450
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,569
There are only 3 of us 
left at home now.

451
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,766
My Father, My Sister and Me.

452
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,142
And our ration cards are
just not enough.

453
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,711
All ration cards are checked.

454
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,976
Accounted for in dozen
differnt ways.

455
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,515
Yea ! Yea ! I know I...

456
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,420
Should not have asked you.

457
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,430
I thought perhaps you 
could advice me.

458
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,628
The food office at Utrecht
was robbed last week.

459
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,328
- Men were caught.
- And shot.

460
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:35,768
If it happened at noon and just 
the record clerk and I were there.

461
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,516
We would have to be tied and gagged.

462
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,923
How many cards 
do you need ?

463
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,259
A hundred !

464
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,627
I know someone who 
might do it.

465
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,077
Papa, Now !

466
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,709
Papa !

467
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,140
- Done.
- How long ?

468
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,476
47 seconds !

469
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:42,344
They better not send us
anyone wider than me.

470
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,044
Hallelujah !

471
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:50,451
Oh LORD ! we ask Your blessing 
on this Hiding Place.

472
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,388
You can eat what you like !

473
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,162
- Herren, It is not kosher.
- Its not a problem.

474
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,532
Could you pass the potatoes,
Please ?

475
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,733
Oh..My GOD !

476
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,396
Go, go, go! go!

477
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,108
Hurry, Hurry.

478
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,909
I will get one to put,
one on each side .

479
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,440
Your'e spilling it !

480
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,297
Corrie ?

481
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,969
One minute and 15 seconds.

482
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,976
It's long enough to cuddle 
the stomach.

483
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,871
Peace be with this house
and all who dwellth in it.

484
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,707
- The peace of the LORD GOD...
- Please come in, Don't stand outside and pray.

485
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:21,445
I was told that you have accomodations.
I will require a room for myself,

486
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,648
quiet for study and preferably
with no children.

487
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,617
Well, Can you take me in ?

488
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,889
Well, yes, but there are
many questions that i have...

489
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,092
I would like something to eat.

490
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,619
Last meal was yesterday.

491
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,788
Thank you ! Good afternoon.

492
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,303
This is a Kosher House ?

493
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,406
Well, we try, we have many requests
that we are not able to handle..  

494
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,341
And there are no children ?

495
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:57,348
Well, not at present,but
they come and they go. 

496
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,384
Let them stay gone
while I am here.

497
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,086
This is the way ?

498
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,855
- Yea ! I regret...
- My contacts have told me...

499
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:09,360
that most of you guests are transients that
they are on the way out of the country.

500
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,630
- Most of them, Yes.
- Well, I will not be.

501
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,401
I am a teacher and chief compere
for the congregation Beth Kodesh 

502
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:22,740
I will not be driven away by grining sea
creatures their powers and their Reich

503
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,341
Who is this man ?

504
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:28,279
A Patriach like Issac or Jacob 
Father of Nations !!

505
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,915
Papa, We have a new guest.

506
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,684
This is my father, Mr. Ten Boom.

507
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,753
Papa, This is Mr...

508
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,756
Wijnstok, Meyer Wijnstok.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ten Boom.

509
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:43,659
GOD willing and the accomodation 
proving suitable,

510
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,964
I will be staying with you 
until this nonsense is over.

511
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,999
- You're Welcome.
- Thank You.

512
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,162
Miss. Ten Boom,
My room, please.

513
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,821
Aunt Betsie !

514
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,491
My friend Jan wants a 
place to stay for a while...

515
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,493
He got away from the transport.

516
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,263
By noon tomorrow he will have
new identity papers.

517
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,965
But...

518
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,634
Where did you get the uniforms ?

519
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,270
Not all Germans are Nazis, 
Aunt Betsie.

520
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,761
Is it Jan ?

521
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,179
Corrie ! Mr. Wijnstock refuse 
kitchen duty again.

522
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,214
He has to study..

523
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:40,918
If he wants to eat he must
have to share the work.

524
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,454
- Where is he now ?
- In the parlour.

525
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,982
Oh can I have a ...
Oh, excuse me! I'm sorry.

526
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,261
Corrie, He's already been upset today.

527
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:55,032
He found out we call him 
"Eusie" behind his back.

528
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,501
We save his great dignity.

529
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,070
He should be flatter, 
he reminds us of a scholar

530
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,673
But a Gentile scholar...he said...

531
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,476
We should have atleast 
called him "Josephus". 

532
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,944
Rules are rules !

533
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,484
M. Wijnstok, my sister tells me 
that you have refused,,,

534
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,976
Miss. Ten Boom, I am Praying.

535
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,328
First you refused to work on saturday
because that was the Sabbath.

536
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,831
Then you refused to work on sunday 
because that was our day of rest.

537
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:32,202
I was simply trying to pay respect
to the practise of this house.

538
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,738
But today is tuesday.

539
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,206
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,

540
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,443
Why you've found it necessary 
to give me a nick name ?

541
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,478
We called you "Eusie" simply because...

542
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:45,676
Eusie is a kind of name 
you give to a pet cat.

543
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:49,420
As a guest in your house am I no 
longer entitled to respect...

544
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,922
We are getting completely
out of subject.

545
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:55,459
However as if it seems to give
you both satisfaction.

546
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,429
Please have the courage to 
use the name to my face.

547
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,865
You want Eusie,
Eusie it will be.

548
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,095
Ladies !

549
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,547
- Good Morning !
- Good Morning !

550
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,053
- Good Morning !
- Good Morning !

551
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,522
After Seven !

552
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,548
Just smell breakfast ?
Yea...

553
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,865
Betsie !

554
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,366
Betsie...

555
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,835
- Good Morning !

556
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,371
- What is it ?
- Today is the 18th !

557
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,740
- It's Mama and Papa's Aniversary !
- Oh, no!

558
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,379
54 cupons for the pass.

559
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,974
Tell Mr. Klassen,
It's for Papa.

560
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,652
Corrie...

561
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:04,595
Corrie...
That blouse and that skirt...

562
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,231
You just can't. Not today.

563
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,432
But its a....

564
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,868
You look like a flag 
on a mud boat

565
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,836
You always liked this blouse.

566
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,706
The blouse is beautiful,
and you are beautiful.

567
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:20,110
But the combination of you and 
blouse and skirt....

568
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,704
is impossible.

569
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,225
<i>Santa FLucia</i>

570
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:41,687
<i>Santa FLucia</i>

571
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,904
Papa Ten Boom, You are
a most singular man.

572
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,913
You are such a great man !

573
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,815
There must have been a great woman.

574
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:04,621
Now, this is not 
exactly a song...

575
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,324
it is more a...

576
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,092
 a Blessing.

577
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,529
Its a ..It means 
May GOD bless you,

578
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,096
May He protect you,

579
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:22,227
May His face 
shine upon you !!!

580
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:54,097
You want the whole of 
Haarlem to hear you ?

581
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,503
I did not asked to be born a Jew. 

582
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,310
I am sick of being expected to...

583
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,147
bear the burdern of suffering 
for the entire world.

584
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,217
Because my Mother's 
name was .. Stein.

585
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:12,422
So you will be another Esau,

586
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,727
Selling your birth rights
for a mash of porridge

587
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,563
I don't want your great
Judaic Heritage !

588
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:24,728
I dont want any part of
your LORD GOD JEHOVA.

589
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,705
It is no easy thing,

590
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,732
to stand in the Palm of GOD's Hand.

591
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,386
Betsie, go to the door.

592
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,947
- Betsie, go !
- Yes, yes I'll go.

593
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,401
Yes, in a moment !

594
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,995
This is Beukers.

595
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,206
Betsie, are you crazy ?

596
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,310
The whole street can 
hear your Jews singing.

597
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,642
Oh! Thank you !.

00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,716

How can I ever remember them ?

609
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,345
You used to pass 
messages in Church.

610
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,747
- Kik !
- Aunt Corrie.

611
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,988
All these numbers...
What do they mean ?

612
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,624
Different things,
instructions mostly.

613
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,726
Instructions of what ?

614
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,295
Well, there could be
a Pilot down somewhere.

615
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,098
The numbers could be coordinates
for picking him up... 

616
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,268
Or may be for blowing up
a Nazi supply train

617
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,103
Things like that.

618
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,435
Sabotage ?

619
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,798
We could have blood on our hands.

620
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,947
For Holland.

621
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,087
Does that make it right ?

622
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:00,318
Lieing, stealing, killing ?

623
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,994
What ever helps Holland is right.

624
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:07,657
Need the message, Aunt Corrie,
they are waiting.

625
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,870
Will there be life,
when this is over ?

626
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,145
Miss. Ten Boom?

627
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,579
Yea !

628
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,446
Thank you for being so prompt.

629
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,991
I'vee heared a great deal about you.

630
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,526
about your work.

631
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:46,553
- I am afraid it is my father's work.
- Not of watch making.

632
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,335
Your other work.

633
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,508
You mean the children ?

634
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,877
We had to disband the class.

635
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,646
Miss. Ten Boom,

636
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,349
Many of us who are in opposition to 
publicise our feelings, 

637
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,342
are in great sympathy in 
what you are doing. 

638
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,220
People call your house
"GOD's Underground".

639
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,402
Are you trying to trap me Sir ? 

640
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,139
Using the name of the 
LORD is not the way.

641
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:33,906
If it were a trap you would be down
the hall talking with the Gestapo.

642
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,713
This will go no further.

643
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,944
Then why did you send for me ?

644
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,149
I want you...

645
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:50,783
to pass this man's name on to your freinds.

646
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,397
Who is he ?

647
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,093
A business man.

648
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,401
He betrays people to the Gestapo.

649
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,909
The going rate is 75 guilders a head.

650
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,607
Just pass it on...

651
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,751
They'll take care of him.

652
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:26,690
If I could do what you ask...... 

653
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,662
It would be same as killing him myself

654
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:35,432
I can only put him in 
the hands of the LORD,

655
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,139
And ask the LORD 
to reach his heart.

656
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,152
Do that, Miss. Ten Boom.

657
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,039
The demons are out tonight ?

658
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,945
I would assume you could sleep to anything

659
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,288
Some Tea ?

660
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,825
Thank you.

661
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,507
You Know, Miss. Ten Boom...

662
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:48,044
You and I are very much alike.

663
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,713
Stubborn...

664
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,214
Tough...

665
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,341
Determind.

666
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,508
You still don't do 
your share of the work 

667
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,457
Yea..Same, Yes.

668
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,692
But I... I am also...

669
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,456
So ......Are you in !

670
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,860
Did you know that...

671
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,599
I have a wife and small son ?

672
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:22,910
Precisely, I do not choose to expose myself.

673
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,480
They got away.

674
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:34,016
Atleast I.....
think they did.

675
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:39,329
I will not go around 
like the others, 

676
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:44,062
begging for sympathy and reassurance.

677
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,337
We know so little about each other.

678
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:51,641
you are busy yourself with our needs. 

679
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,577
Surely you have some needs of your own. 

680
00:56:56,346 --> 00:57:00,717
It's people like us,
Miss. Ten Boom...

681
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:05,313
Ragging torrents behind the stubborn jaw.

682
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,991
No torrents.

683
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,732
Might say my life
has been ......boring; 

684
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,134
Till all this ?

685
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,659
Until all this.

686
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:26,803
Was marriage never considered 
for the daughter's of Ten Boom ?

687
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,847
Betsie was always unwell.

688
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,783
She was told she could not bear children, 

689
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,184
so she choose not to marry.

690
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,353
And you ?

691
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,189
I had a young man,

692
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:53,802
but i was not cut from fine
enough cloth for his family .

693
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,172
I lacked grace.

694
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,206
Still,

695
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,983
I was the first woman to be
licensed watch maker in Holland. 

696
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:17,584
And you have your Father,

697
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,962
and you have your Religion.

698
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,702
Is it enough ?

699
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,432
More than enough.

700
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,365
GOD has been good to me.

701
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,843
Yes, eu...

702
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,277
I think he has.

703
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,684
And I think...

704
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,381
I shall be going back to my bed.

705
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,821
I will pray for you family.

706
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:59,066
Don't think that you'll get me to
peel potatoes, Miss. Ten Boom.

707
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,761
Good Morning.

708
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,195
Miss. Ten Boom ?

709
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,390
Yea ?

710
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,897
My name is Vogel...
Jan Vogel.

711
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:35,926
I came all the way, from Ermelo.

712
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,244
You have a watch that needs a repair ?

713
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,446
I need 600 Guilders.

714
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,687
I've heared that you have certain contacts.

715
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:01,396
I don't understand.

716
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,025
It's my wife...

717
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,106
She is been arrested.

718
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,700
She is Jewish.

719
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,907
That's a lot of money.

720
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:24,384
There is a police man who will 
arrange everything for 600 Guilders...

721
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,512
And she'll need a place to hide.

722
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,992
What now ?

723
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,841
Someone is calling for this
within the hour.

724
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,140
Mr. Jan Vogel.

725
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,939
He is from Ermelo.

726
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,083
His wife has been taken.

727
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,745
It's for a bribe.

728
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,722
Oh...You are impossible.

729
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,125
Now hear...

730
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:06,095
I will take care of it.
Now will you please go to bed ?

731
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,064
But Willem and Tine are coming.

732
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,833
- You can come down later.
- Be sure to call.

733
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,268
I will.

734
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,726
- And use the steam kettle !
- Yea, Yea.

735
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:45,866
I felt it today the LORD would 
have us read from Romans - Chapter 8.

736
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:52,136
What then can seperate
us from Christ Love ?

737
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:57,647
Can hardship or calamity,
can persecution or abuse,

738
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:03,586
if we are hungry, or poor,
or in danger ?

739
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:07,724
or threatened with death, does 
that mean that GOD has deserted us...No ?

740
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,659
Despite all this,

741
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:13,529
We have overwhelming victory 
through Christ who loves us.

742
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:18,501
For I am convinced that neither
death nor life,

743
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,839
nor the powers of heaven nor 
the powers of hell itself

744
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,842
can keep GOD's Love from us.

745
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:29,334
Nothing in the world as it is...

746
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,383
Or the worlds, that it shall be,
in the forces of the Universe...

747
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:48,992
in all creation will ever be
able to seperate us...

748
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,834
Along the side door.

749
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,995
Come on.

750
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,972
All Upstairs !

751
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,686
Corrie !

752
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,508
Yea, I am sorry we are 
closed until 2 O' Clock.

753
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:36,646
Miss. Ten Boom...I.. 
I have an appointment with you sister.

754
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,581
Mr. Vogel ?

755
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,573
I need the money, now !

756
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,749
- Yes, Of course I'll get it.
- Please ! Miss. Ten Boom !

757
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,660
- To your places, everyone !
- Come on, Hurry up !

758
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,926
- Please, Miss. Ten Boom.
- Yes..,Yes in a moment !

759
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,295
I am just collecting it.

760
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:11,011
Upstairs, I'll take the top !

761
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,483
Miss. Ten Boom ?

762
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,611
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.

763
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,864
Where do you hide your ration cards ?

764
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,199
I don't know what you 
are talking about ?

765
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,569
- Where are the Jews ?
- What Jews ?

766
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,402
Lord Jesus, help me !

767
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,214
- Where are the Jews ?
- Saviour save me.

768
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,206
Where is the secret room ?

769
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,088
Corrie !

770
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,759
This must stop !

771
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:11,240
There's been no wrong
done in this house.

772
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,645
Then what are you doing
with all these ration cards ?

773
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,170
Feeding an Army ?

774
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:24,120
What does it say in the book of
your's about obeying the Government ?

775
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,622
There comes a time...

776
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:31,787
When we must choose between God and man.

777
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,009
Keep moving.

778
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,394
- Name ?
- Cornelia.

779
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,124
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.

780
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,594
- Name ?
- Ten Boom, Casper.

781
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,288
Papa !

782
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,190
Only Six ?

783
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,066
Seven.

784
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,830
God is with us.

785
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,200
Ten Boom...

786
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,515
Give me your word you'll
behave yourself,

787
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:37,885
And you can die in your bed 
old man.... where you belong.

788
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,356
If I stay behind,

789
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,859
I will open my door to anyone... 

790
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,327
who knocks for help.....

791
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,095
Close it up.

792
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,266
Seal the House.

793
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:52,149
Out ! Out ! Out !

794
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,670
Corrie, take my hand.

795
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,936
- My sister she needs a doctor.
- Move on !

796
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,010
Papa !

797
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,313
Papa !

798
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,982
GOD be with you, Papa !!!

799
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:23,110
And with you all, my daughters !

800
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:47,768
I have to get in there.

801
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,728
Fever down ?

802
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,763
You have them worried.

803
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,027
Tifus.

804
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,803
Yesterday's ration, 
I saved it for you.

805
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:19,041
Listen, I have family here.
My sister, my brother,

806
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,310
My father, my nephew,
the Ten Boom family.

807
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,412
Can you find out where they are ?

808
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,314
Maybe, listen...

809
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:28,517
I can get soap,
aspirin, cigarettes.

810
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,220
You can pay me when you start getting mail. 

811
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,622
Soap, 25 Guilders, Aspirin, 50.

812
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,392
Cigarettes, 100.
Almost anything.

813
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,293
Can you get me a Bible ?

814
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,568
It's Kik ! It's safe now.

815
01:12:57,606 --> 01:13:00,097
Oh, thank GOD !

816
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,777
Shh....Over the roof, quickly.

817
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,252
The roof !

818
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,744
- Where are you family ?
- Hurry !

819
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,660
- The Ten Boom s ?
- Still in prision.

820
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,430
That's all we know.

821
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,167
Mama made it cover it on my bed....

822
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:28,694
It was in a truso.

823
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:32,830
The painting by the mirro is a...

824
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:49,313
Do not go !

825
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,628
Stay...

826
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,858
Please.

827
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,262
They think i have to feed you.

828
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,676
- Everybody is been released.
- Everybo ?

829
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:11,413
Except your sister Betsie
And your father too, I think.....

830
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,949
- I am not sure.
- O ! Thank you, LORD !

831
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,918
O LORD, Thank you !

832
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:21,117
Here's a bread from the
warden's bakery ......Fresh !

833
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,865
O LORD...

834
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,001
You have done wonders.

835
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,027
Don't I get little credit ?

836
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,173
LORD, Bless this Angel.

837
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,970
Bless you !

838
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:49,251
Do u think you can last
here doin that.... Praying ?

839
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:53,312
The only way to live here is to hate.

840
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,961
Hate can put you in a
worst prision than this.

841
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:02,364
I have been 3 years in this hole.

842
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,133
I worked my way to a position. 

843
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:10,196
I live to get the
swine who betrayed me. 

844
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,739
And that's 75 Guilders !

845
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,163
Are you cold ?

846
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,533
It seems reasonably pleasant.

847
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,296
I'm Sorry.

848
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:51,328
Now you are here for the
violation of rationing rules.

849
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:57,138
Would you mind telling me ,
where you got these extra ration cards ?

850
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,782
Sometimes they just appeared.

851
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:04,149
What do you mean... appear ?

852
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,555
Pushed under the door.

853
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:09,791
Sometimes they were handed 
to me in the market.

854
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,127
By whom ?

855
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:16,291
- By Mr. Smit.
- Mr. Jan Smit?

856
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:22,463
Would you tell me all your other activities ?

857
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,044
My sister and I held Bible classes,

858
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,480
until such meetings were forbidden.

859
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:36,518
And we worked with retarded children.

860
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,021
- How ?
- Excuse me ?

861
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,790
How would you work with them ?

862
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,816
We taught them about GOD.

863
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,895
What a waste !

864
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,097
If you wanted converts,

865
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:54,228
surely one normal person is 
worth all the halfers in the world.

866
01:17:55,404 --> 01:18:00,375
In the eyes of GOD one simple child 
may be worth more than.....

867
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,344
A watch maker's daughter ?????.

868
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,510
Perpahs...

869
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,986
But I know he keeps me 
always in His sight.

870
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,221
You actually believe that ?

871
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:17,920
I beleive that you are 
in His sight too.. Lieutenant.

872
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:27,402
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,
How can you believe in a God

873
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,572
Who lets an old man die in prison ?

874
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:35,805
his body forgotten somewhere 
in a pauper's grave ?

875
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,346
My Father ?

876
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:45,253
I understand he was taken ill
after about 10 days. 

877
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,756
He was taken to hospital in the Hague,
Unfortunately...

878
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,292
there were no beds available.

879
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,728
He seemingly died in the hallway.

880
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:57,227
Some failure of organisation.

881
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:01,770
Under such circumstances when
no one claims the body ...

882
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,762
It is difficult to trace.

883

924

O LORD, You have given us your Word, 
and hidden it to everything.

925
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:41,440
Now open up a way for us to 
get it through the gates of hell. 

926
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:47,679

Lice.

946
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:35,215
Imagine what mama would say ? 

947
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:42,563
Ravensbruck...

948
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:45,999
Is not a rest camp.

949
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:52,206
Roll call 4:30, every morning.

950
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:55,175
7 days a week.

951
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,911
Tomorrow assignment, the work details.

952
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:05,711
Those who cannot work report to sick call...

953
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:09,516
Don't say i better be sick !

954
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:12,994
You will receive one half pound(227 grams)
of bread...

955
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:16,760
One half liter of soup per day. 

956
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:21,697
Once on observation upon 
which your life depends.... 

957
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:25,573
There is only one road to freedom.

958
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:27,871
Work !

959
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:37,885
Get it up !

960
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:40,547
Hold them in !

961
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,686
You're Dutch ?

962
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:53,288
Some of my people are Dutch.

963
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,526
On my Mother's side. 

964
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:03,004
You are not the only one suprised to be here. 

965
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:07,407
I thought I would be working 
at reallocation center... 

966
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:10,135
Refugees.

967
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:25,793
Supplies are extreamly limited.

968
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:28,796
And accurate record is essential.

969
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:33,597
I know my way around hospitals,
I was kind of nurse once.

970
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:37,071
I assume that is why you are assigned here.  

971
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,572
I'm a midwife.

972
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:42,235
I brought Jewsish babies into the world. 

973
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:49,216
You are not to touch the things in here.

974
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:52,186
Soap, Vitamins, Painkillers...

975
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,814
Yeast, Quinine.

976
01:34:57,558 --> 01:35:01,289
I always have the key to this cupboard. 

977
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:04,098
However...

978
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:08,831
You will find it that
I often forget to lockup. 

979
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,940
I hope you understand...

980
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,932
...66685.

981
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:14,127
Thank you, LORD !

982
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:21,041
He don't expect 
thanks for this.

983
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,475
It's warm !

984
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:27,977
I am thankful for every moment
we can be together.

985
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,510
We can atleast lie down tonight.

986
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:38,681
There has to be a plan, Corrie.

987
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:46,562
I won't be greatful for the lice. 

988
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:52,435
GOD doesn't make mistakes.

989
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:57,545
How is it its the hospital ?

990
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:02,049
Is it though your temperature
has to be above 104 to be admitted ?

991
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,984
That's the rule.

992
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:07,621
There is a gaurd in the laundry 
you can get underwear for a price.

993
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:09,590
- What does she want ?
- Bread rations.

994
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:14,960
- Oh, Dont cut too much !
- What you want, hair or lice ?

995
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:18,699
You'll learn to love
the little darlings.

996
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:21,869
The gaurds won't step foot in this lice pit. 

997
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:25,566
Pass the door.... we can do anything. 

998
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,035
Even Lice !

999
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:09,739
6-6-7-2-7.

1000
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:15,220
6-6-7-2-7 !

1001
01:38:17,591 --> 01:38:20,253
6-6-7-2-7 is missing !

1002
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,496
Here !

1003
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,055
Somebody over slept.

1004
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:50,489
The loony.

1005
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,184
Ah, Corrie...

1006
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:58,262
We are in Hell !!

1007
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,893
Why do they keep us so long ? 

1008
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:28,453
To break us.

1009
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:33,230
Betsie, Look !

1010
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,106
I was certain no one would die,

1011
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:50,708
We would all go home.

1012
01:39:51,685 --> 01:39:54,722
Those days on the train,

1013
01:39:54,722 --> 01:39:58,055
The LORD seemed to promise.

1014
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:05,364
How could I have misunderstood ?

1015
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:12,097
Dear Father, help me.

1016
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,406
Don't let me listen to my voice
and think it's yours ! 

1017
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,283
O, JESUS...

1018
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:27,344
Show me how to live in this place.... 

1019
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:35,095
You too love Him ?

1020
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,860
Put these in the mattress.

1021
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:42,729
Not now ! It's Yeast,

1022
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:48,190
And don't go spooning it around. 
I can never get enough for everybody.

1023
01:41:57,177 --> 01:42:03,083
This method consisted of painting
on the small dots

1024
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,953
of pure colours on the canvas.

1025
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,223
And colour blending was achieved...

1026
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:13,627
by placing dot of different
colours next to each other. 

1027
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:17,831
And then, from a distance,
the two colours 

1028
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:21,802
appear blended into
one single new colour.

1029
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:25,072
JESUS CHRIST has made it possible...

1030
01:42:25,072 --> 01:42:29,736
For us we ...need to have direct access.

1031
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:37,011
- There is a repeat in that point.
- In the second movement ?

1032
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:41,411
There is a ritardando
at the end of third part.
Ta.. da... da....

1033
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:49,197
<i>Stand up for JESUS, ye soldiers of the Cross ;</i>
<i>Lift high His</i>

1034
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:52,533
<i>-- Royal banner,</i>
- You are quite wrong,
- retardando is later.

1035
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:54,568
<i>it must not suffer loss</i>

1036
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:57,901
Attention ! Attention !

1037
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,812
NO ROOM !

1038
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:08,747
NO ROOM !

1039
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:28,900
You find room.

1040
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,958
German whores...
We ran them through the hospital...

1041
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,859
infected.

1042
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,996
Pass the yellow badge ?

1043
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:58,332
Race Defiler ...

1044
01:43:58,332 --> 01:44:01,529
go to be with the slavic labourer. 

1045
01:44:03,437 --> 01:44:06,031
She is just a child.

1046
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:23,781
You trod on my foot !

1047
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:44,842
Don't exert yourself, Countess.

1048
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,815
It's all I can carry.

1049
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:52,219
Any more and i'll have to stop altogether..

1050
01:44:52,219 --> 01:44:54,881
I decide who stops !

1051
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:08,969
Betsie !

1052
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:11,733
I decide who stops !

1053
01:45:13,573 --> 01:45:15,541
No !

1054
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:24,184
Don't hate, Corrie...

1055
01:45:24,184 --> 01:45:26,448
don't hate.

1056
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:35,893
- I'll first of all warm this.
- You owe two day's bread !!

1057
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,766
I will pay you next week.

1058
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:41,927
No !

1059
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:48,506
Don't !

1060
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:56,917
JESUS knows everything we feel.

1061
01:45:56,917 --> 01:46:02,255
He promised that when 2 or 3
get together in his name 

1062
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:04,991
He would be there with them...

1063
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:08,256
Even in Ravensbruck !

1064
01:46:09,996 --> 01:46:13,090
In our lives, before,

1065
01:46:13,233 --> 01:46:18,000
we would have been 
seperated by so much. 

1066
01:46:18,071 --> 01:46:23,210
But here, all that has been stripped away

1067
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,979
And we see the Truth :

1068
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:30,245
JESUS in each one of us.

1069
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:33,914
Light in this darkness.

1070
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:39,354
And we can praise Him together.

1071
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:04,084
<i>Father...</i>

1072
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,951
<i>Bless the German People</i>

1073
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:10,090
<i>From your Great</i>
<i>Storehouse of Love.</i>

1074
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:13,360
<i>Forgive them, for JESUS sake.</i>

1075
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,863
<i>Do not hold this place to the judge !</i>

1076
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,965
<i>Forgive them...</i>

1077
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:22,594
<i>Even before they</i>
<i>know to ask.</i>

1078
01:47:26,139 --> 01:47:28,074
Two days bread I need.

1079
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:29,943
I'll give you one.

1080
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:33,613
Two... Who else you know
has the Scarf !

1081
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:39,074
- I will give you one now, one tomorrow.
- I will break you.

1082
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:01,665
Come on, rub it !

1083
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:05,433
Rub it in !

1084
01:49:05,505 --> 01:49:09,242
A whole transport of poles came in last night. 

1085
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:13,144
- Vulture.
- You should know.

1086
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:18,118
- I have an underwear.
- Eyes front !

1087
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:20,820
- It's wool .
- No !

1088
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,223
- Two days bread ration.
- My comb.

1089
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:30,762
I'll collect later.
Nothing for the comb.

1090
01:49:31,364 --> 01:49:33,855
Rub hardly!

1091
01:49:35,535 --> 01:49:38,333
- Rub it.
- Thank You.

1092
01:49:46,213 --> 01:49:51,343
O ! the sky is so peaceful.!

1093
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:58,657
You politicals don't have anything 
to do with trash

1094
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:06,725
We're all trash.

1095
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:15,141
I took it from the tray...
In the infirmary.

1096
01:50:23,516 --> 01:50:26,076
Continue, continue !

1097
01:50:51,878 --> 01:50:55,041
I thought you are smart.

1098
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:02,622
You called attention to
yourself in a line.

1099
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:06,493
Imbecile(fool) ! Could you not wait until 
you're back in the block

1100
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:09,095
You are such a greedy fool ?

1101
01:51:09,095 --> 01:51:12,360
You German Cow !!!

1102
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:14,801
You know i should let them kill. 

1103
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:17,637
You great...
lumbering, imprestÃ¡vel!

1104
01:51:17,637 --> 01:51:20,507
You would like to go to the ,
No light, no water.

1105
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:25,240
You will never do anything
like stupid again !

1106
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:27,471
Never !

1107
01:51:32,886 --> 01:51:36,788
Now I...
I'll dress your hand.

1108
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:50,904
"Comfort the frightened,
help the weak,

1109
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:54,074
be patient with everyone.

1110
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:57,377
do not repay 
evil for evil,

1111
01:51:57,377 --> 01:52:00,947
but always try to do 
good to one another.

1112
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:03,249
Always rejoice.

1113
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:06,152
Pray constantly,

1114
01:52:06,152 --> 01:52:11,283
give thanks in all circumstances,

1115
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:15,695
For this is the will of GOD in JESUS CHRIST ."

1116
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:20,233
And to the mindless the 
word sound so comforting.

1117
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:23,691
In this place it's mockery !

1118
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,009
GOD didn't make this place......, Man did !

1119
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:33,580
But He has power. Surely He could stop them. 

1120
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,849
Unless ofcourse, He is the sadist.

1121
01:52:35,849 --> 01:52:38,752
No ! He is Love, all Love.

1122
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:40,820
Then He is impotent.

1123
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:44,257
You can't have it both ways my dear !

1124
01:52:44,257 --> 01:52:46,826
You see what is around you. 

1125
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:50,530
We see another world,
Just as real :

1126
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:53,192
Our life with GOD.

1127
01:52:53,633 --> 01:52:55,502
Everyday...

1128
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:59,268
it gets deeper and stronger. 

1129
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:04,544
You'll think that you can't exist 
side by side but, we know it do !

1130
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:07,445
We live them both !

1131
01:53:08,014 --> 01:53:11,151
It's enough knowing that we 
are so much done,

1132
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:14,053
moving from nothing to nothing. 

1133
01:53:14,053 --> 01:53:17,056
But you must believe your GOD.. 

1134
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:20,660
smells that stench from those chimneys 

1135
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:24,426
and refuses to do anything.

1136
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:29,134
If only...

1137
01:53:29,202 --> 01:53:32,296
you could know His Love...

1138
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:37,604
I am Maria Wrochek...

1139
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:43,415
First violinist of the
Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.

1140
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:47,714
Did your GOD will this ?

1141
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:01,059
We cannot answer.

1142
01:54:01,768 --> 01:54:07,073
All I can say is, that the
same GOD you are accusing 

1143
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:11,177
came and lived in the 
midst of our World.

1144
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:15,409
He was Beaten...
And He was mocked...

1145
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:18,741
and He died on a Cross.

1146
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:21,679
And He did it for Love...

1147
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:24,157
for us.

1148
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:26,226
And why do you think...

1149
01:54:26,226 --> 01:54:30,492
your GOD of Love sent you here ?

1150
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:38,537
To obey Him.

1151
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,375
If you know Him,

1152
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:45,435
you don't have to know why.

1153
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:51,050
First you take juice of 4 oranges,

1154
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:53,653
and half a  cream,

1155
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,488
to the cup of sugar.

1156
01:54:55,488 --> 01:54:58,157
I only use 3 quaters of the cup.

1157
01:54:58,157 --> 01:55:00,760
You should use a full cup.

1158
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:05,565
Then you put peels aside for 
grating and you whip the cream. 

1159
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:09,702
What kind of cook are you ?
You forgot the eggs.

1160
01:55:09,702 --> 01:55:12,603
Do your own recipe, then.

1161
01:55:18,077 --> 01:55:20,409
We need more sand.

1162
01:55:26,619 --> 01:55:28,746
Corrie...

1163
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:33,126
Corrie...

1164
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:36,789
Don't shut me out.......please.

1165
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:43,169
You know you can only give it to JESUS.

1166
01:55:43,169 --> 01:55:45,538
Do you think I haven't prayed ?

1167
01:55:45,538 --> 01:55:47,640
But I hate them.

1168
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,041
I hate every Nazi in this place !

1169
01:55:51,477 --> 01:55:54,913
We can't be more than what we are. 

1170
01:55:56,649 --> 01:55:59,886
Only JESUS can free
us from ourselves, 

1171
01:55:59,886 --> 01:56:02,980
from whatever happens.

1172
01:56:03,323 --> 01:56:07,193
Sister...
You can't protect me.

1173
01:56:07,193 --> 01:56:10,026
You mustn't try.

1174
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,854
LORD,

1175
01:56:41,894 --> 01:56:45,853
I can not let go of it.

1176
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:51,437
take this...

1177
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:53,803
hate...

1178
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,735
out of my life...

1179
01:56:59,212 --> 01:57:02,613
and put your love in its place.

1180
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,856
JESUS,

1181
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:13,451
so many things I do not understand.

1182
01:57:17,196 --> 01:57:19,926
Do not let me go mad.....

1183
01:57:21,934 --> 01:57:25,062
Poking about, on my own.

1184
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:30,240
You know that I am.

1185
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,745
Saviour...

1186
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:45,384
Hide me in the center 
of your will.

1187
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:05,975
How long ?

1188
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:10,612
Four months.

1189
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:13,286
What's it to you ?

1190
01:58:13,286 --> 01:58:15,447
Child...

1191
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:19,225
You would like to see me cry.. Wouldn't you ?

1192
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:22,319
Then you could mother me.

1193
01:58:22,862 --> 01:58:24,564
I only want to help.

1194
01:58:24,564 --> 01:58:29,900
What difference would it make ?
Everything dies here.

1195
01:58:34,607 --> 01:58:37,376
A drug for ! A lousiy looking whore !

1196
01:58:37,376 --> 01:58:40,213
We need vitamins
and all the calcium you can get.

1197
01:58:40,213 --> 01:58:42,548
And you are so damn knuckles.

1198
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:45,017
Two years older she'b be standing
over you with a whip

1199
01:58:45,017 --> 01:58:47,920
Ah....a baby, Katje,
a new life !

1200
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,089
I am not your personal Red Cross !

1201
01:58:50,089 --> 01:58:54,685
I can never get enough for 
you and her.. and Betsie too

1202
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:10,076
- What are you doing ?
- Nothing ! I was just...

1203
01:59:10,076 --> 01:59:13,068
I said what were you doing ?

1204
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:16,949
We have a pregnency in 28.
a kid of 18. It's...

1205
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:19,252
I do not want to know !

1206
01:59:19,252 --> 01:59:23,552
All pregencies are transferred 
to experimental.

1207
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:16,375
Yeast, B vitamins.
It will help your soup down .

1208
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:19,640
We even have a midwife.

1209
02:00:40,266 --> 02:00:45,670
<i>Group 5, over 100 women,</i>
<i>report to a your inspector.</i>

1210
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:49,709
<i>Prisioner 146723</i>

1211
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:53,076
<i>Report to administration</i>
<i>for processamento.</i>

1212
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:09,328
All this German slop 
has to be good for something.

1213
02:01:09,328 --> 02:01:12,999
German papers, are thick
like German heads !

1214
02:01:12,999 --> 02:01:17,936
There's lot of hot air ! The Yankes( Americans )
are half way to the Rhine.

1215
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:21,841
So...

1216
02:01:21,841 --> 02:01:27,370
We have got some hot air 
between you and the wind

1217
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:30,941
Katje, Thank you !

1218
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:38,224
It is funny about you two.

1219
02:01:38,224 --> 02:01:40,760
Uhh... tells us...

1220
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:42,561
We need a laugh !

1221
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:45,298
You are always talking about love.

1222
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:48,734
A bit neither of you ever had a man.

1223
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:56,735
We have boy friends.

1224
02:02:01,914 --> 02:02:04,483
Did you love your babie's father ?

1225
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:08,419
I was hungry.
He was nice to me.

1226
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,473
Your leg is so strange.

1227
02:02:28,504 --> 02:02:30,473
Lift this one.

1228
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:33,579
- I can't.
- Well, Try !

1229
02:02:33,579 --> 02:02:38,278
I goes like wood.
Oh I am so weak !

1230
02:02:38,884 --> 02:02:42,188
Thank GOD... He is strong.

1231
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:45,180
Katje, Katje !

1232
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:03,726
Betsie, try...
please try.....yea....

1233
02:04:06,005 --> 02:04:08,530
You know Corrie,

1234
02:04:10,042 --> 02:04:13,068
We are going to be free !

1235
02:04:13,412 --> 02:04:16,315
Before the New Year.

1236
02:04:16,315 --> 02:04:18,647
Both of us.

1237
02:04:19,318 --> 02:04:21,650
Both of us ?

1238
02:04:21,987 --> 02:04:23,422
The LORD.....

1239
02:04:23,422 --> 02:04:25,090
Showed me...

1240
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:27,422
in a dream.

1241
02:04:27,993 --> 02:04:30,359
You'll see !

1242
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:38,168
- I'm not going to die, Corrie.
- No.

1243
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:57,623
Fare enough.

1244
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:59,158
Leave her there.

1245
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:01,193
- Please.
- Leave her !!

1246
02:05:01,193 --> 02:05:05,493
All prisoners report to the Lagerstrasse.
(German meaning " Camp Street ", 
 name of the main street in 
  concentration camps.) 

1247
02:05:21,113 --> 02:05:25,015
- Please, let me stay with her.
- Roll call !!!

1248
02:05:51,577 --> 02:05:55,138

<i>Block 33... dismiss.</i>

1251
02:06:09,295 --> 02:06:12,787
<i>Block 35... dismiss.</i>

1252
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:20,706
Betsie !!

1253
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:24,143
The prisoner is being transferred
to the hospital.

1254
02:06:24,143 --> 02:06:29,308
Prisioner 66730 request permission 
to accompany her sister.

1255
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,617
What is the count ?

1256
02:06:31,617 --> 02:06:35,454

Block 21: 3 dead.

1257
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:39,049

1258
02:06:39,124 --> 02:06:43,228

1259
02:06:43,228 --> 02:06:44,930
Betsie !

1260
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:47,194
Sister !

1261
02:06:49,735 --> 02:06:52,533
Thank Him, Corrie.

1262
02:06:52,871 --> 02:06:54,506
Thank the LORD...

1263
02:06:54,506 --> 02:06:58,210
- For all he has done for us here.
- You will be warm soon.

1264
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:00,405
Together...

1265
02:07:00,546 --> 02:07:02,381
You and I...

1266
02:07:02,381 --> 02:07:05,145
Always together.

1267
02:07:50,195 --> 02:07:52,254
Water.

1268
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:59,398
Could I sleep here ?
Just tonight ?

1269
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:01,333
It's so cold.

1270
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:04,825
This way we can have 2 blankets.

1271
02:09:20,886 --> 02:09:25,550
If GOD loved Betsie so much...

1272
02:09:25,924 --> 02:09:28,085
Why ?

1273
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:39,669
Suffering does not mean that
GOD has stopped loving us.

1274
02:09:42,207 --> 02:09:44,343
Sometimes...

1275
02:09:44,343 --> 02:09:49,713
we have to accept things...
we do not understand.

1276
02:09:50,349 --> 02:09:53,152
I love Betsie...

1277
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,882
And I love you !

1278
02:11:54,606 --> 02:11:57,598
This is the sister.

1279
02:12:18,764 --> 02:12:22,567
Corrie, you must look...

1280
02:12:22,567 --> 02:12:25,559
Otherwise you'll never know.

1281
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:54,560
She is Beautiful.

1282
02:13:08,146 --> 02:13:10,444
Betsie !

1283
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:44,107
<i>We should do great many things</i>
<i>for others.</i>

1284
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,977
<i>And we must go everywhere.</i>

1285
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:54,352
We must tell people...

1286
02:13:56,528 --> 02:13:59,827
that no pit is so deep

1287
02:14:01,066 --> 02:14:04,593
that he is not deeper still.

1288
02:14:07,706 --> 02:14:10,698
They will believe us...

1289
02:14:12,077 --> 02:14:14,875
because we were here.

1290
02:14:15,414 --> 02:14:22,286
- Betsie talked about heaven 
  like she already been there.
- Yea

1291
02:14:24,356 --> 02:14:27,125
No one would 
wish her back.

1292
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:29,494
Read for Betsie.

1293
02:14:29,494 --> 02:14:32,190
Read for all of us.

1294
02:14:46,378 --> 02:14:50,315
"Are we not that
our earthly bodies,

1295
02:14:50,315 --> 02:14:52,918
those we have now,

1296
02:14:52,918 --> 02:14:55,487
it will die,

1297
02:14:55,487 --> 02:15:00,686
must be changed, for our heavenly bodies

1298
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:03,823
which will not die...

1299
02:15:03,962 --> 02:15:06,531
but will live forever.

1300
02:15:06,531 --> 02:15:10,235
Then the scripture will be fulfilled.

1301
02:15:10,235 --> 02:15:14,433
Death is swallowed up in Victory !

1302
02:15:15,173 --> 02:15:18,233
<i>So my dear ones...</i>

1303
02:15:18,477 --> 02:15:22,607
<i>since future victory</i>
<i>is sure</i>

1304
02:15:22,747 --> 02:15:26,513
<i>Be strong</i>
<i>and study.</i>

1305
02:15:26,651 --> 02:15:30,917

<i>of the LORD,</i>

1306
02:15:32,023 --> 02:15:36,995
<i>And we know, that our labour in the LORD,</i>

1307
02:15:36,995 --> 02:15:39,998
<i>is not in vain...</i>

1308
02:15:39,998 --> 02:15:44,594
<i>as it would be</i>
<i>if there were no resurrection.</i>

1309
02:15:46,705 --> 02:15:49,808
<i>And this is the good news,</i>

1310
02:15:49,808 --> 02:15:54,679
<i>that Christ died for our sins,</i>
<i>according to the scriptures.</i>

1311
02:15:54,679 --> 02:15:58,817
<i>And that he rose again,</i>
<i>just as the prophets had said.</i>

1312
02:15:58,817 --> 02:16:04,689
<i>For GOD so loved the world that</i>
<i>he gave his only begotten Son</i>

1313
02:16:04,689 --> 02:16:09,752
<i>that anyone who believes in him</i>
<i>shall not die...</i>

1314
02:16:09,928 --> 02:16:12,954
<i>but has eternal life !</i>

1315
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:41,793
The following prisoners will come forward

1316
02:16:41,793 --> 02:16:45,463

Corrie...

1327
02:17:26,338 --> 02:17:30,866
For what you said,
I want it, I want him.

1328
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:33,445
Then ask.

1329
02:17:33,445 --> 02:17:36,081
I don't know what to ask for.

1330
02:17:36,081 --> 02:17:39,812
He knows. Just ask !

1331
02:18:03,174 --> 02:18:06,109
GOD is with you !

1332

Sleep well, Corrie...

1334
02:18:36,741 --> 02:18:39,010
- Papa ?
- Yes, Corrie ?

1335
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:41,376
What is it like to die ?

1336
02:18:52,524 --> 02:18:55,794
When you and I 
go to Amsterdam,

1337
02:18:55,794 --> 02:18:57,896
When did I give you a ticket ?

1338
02:18:57,896 --> 02:19:00,098
Just before we get on the train.

1339
02:19:00,098 --> 02:19:02,167
So with death.

1340
02:19:02,167 --> 02:19:04,102
When the time comes,

1341
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:09,165

<i>Years later it was learnt</i>
<i>my release came...</i>

1367
02:22:45,757 --> 02:22:48,860
<i>through a clerical error</i>

1368
02:22:48,860 --> 02:22:52,564
<i>What some might call </i>

Even our questions.

1378
02:23:27,165 --> 02:23:31,202
As for myself,
in the year since Ravensbruck,

1379
02:23:31,202 --> 02:23:35,832
The LORD has sent me to some 
60 Countires.

1380
02:23:36,207 --> 02:23:41,245
And I have told to anyone 
who would listen :

1381
02:23:41,245 --> 02:23:45,705
" No pit is so deep...

1382
02:23:46,384 --> 02:23:49,945
that he is not deeper still. "

1383
02:23:50,622 --> 02:23:52,991
With JESUS...

1384
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:56,694
even in our darkest moments,

1385
02:23:56,694 --> 02:23:59,686
The Best remains...

1386
02:24:00,465 --> 02:24:04,424
And the very best is yet to be !

1387
02:24:05,403 --> 02:24:09,807
I promised my sister
I would tell it...

1388
02:24:09,807 --> 02:24:12,605
And I tell you !
