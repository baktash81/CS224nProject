1
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,737
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,241
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:22,111
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,276
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,981
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,491
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,255
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:39,196
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,262
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,929
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,975
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,443
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,775
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,715
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,219
Of course.

16
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,882
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,927
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:31,048
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:34,746
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,154
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,385
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,004
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,207
I like this one.

24
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,853
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,720
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,655
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,449
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,082
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,752
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,994
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,395
One second!

32
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,634
Open this door.

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,467
Warren.

34
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,343
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,394
Oh, God.

36
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,191
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,855
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:57,888
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,161
Bobby!

40
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,076
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:29,286
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,554
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,062
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,894
Logan.

45
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,468
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,133
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,006
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,173
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,582
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,099
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,477
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,680
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,315
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,253
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,486
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,689
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,598
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,796
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,240
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,425
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,929
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,125
Scott.

63
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,426
Scott.

64
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,602
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,277
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,507
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,016
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,748
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,720
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,025
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,158
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,864
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,997
Hey, look.

74
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,245
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,179
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,150
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,514
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,077
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,225
Mr. President.

80
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,421
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,925
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,664
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,835
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,606
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,205
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,377
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,547
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:28,287
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,623
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,331
Raven?

91
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:38,029
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,265
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,867
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,005
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,010
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,815
In here with us.

97
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,959
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,587
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:10,261
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,602
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,616
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,284
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,384
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,397
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,902
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,598
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,472
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,541
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,951
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,661
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:14,700
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,206
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,175
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,945
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,815
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,583
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,522
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,120
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,892
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,902
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,370
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:58,103
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:05,248
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:09,254
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,122
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,027
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,259
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,869
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,840
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,380
Professor?

131
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,525
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,231
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:17,756
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,823
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:24,954
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:29,934
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,130
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,334
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:41,937
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,321
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,015
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,284
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,420
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,091
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,977
Hank?

147
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,103
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,709
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,653
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,420
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,722
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,923
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:37,629
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,205
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,071
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,871
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:49,346
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,473
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,418
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,013
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,025
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,222
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,130
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,273
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,605
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,872
Storm.

167
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,448
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,818
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,017
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,163
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,664
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,998
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,063
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,301
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,647
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,182
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:06,452
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,962
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,122
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:18,136
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,672
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:26,609
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,911
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,317
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,984
No. Professor.

186
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,151
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:47,322
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,925
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,838
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:01,073
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:06,675
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,916
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:16,963
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,930
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,630
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,230
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,105
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,137
They just do it.

199
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:42,414
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:48,255
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,229
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,527
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:59,230
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,307
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,047
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:11,411
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,645
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,281
Or us?

209
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,367
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,665
Back off.

211
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:37,004
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,641
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,682
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,615
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,779
Do you?

216
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,552
And what can you do?

217
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,893
So you have talents?

218
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,091
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,262
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,396
Other than you two.

221
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:13,379
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,279
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:40,369
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,101
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,007
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,170
Shut up.

227
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:56,078
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,849
Please.

229
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,757
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:07,729
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,893
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,367
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,799
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:48,670
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,175
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:56,840
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:00,851
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,387
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,514
You'll see.

240
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,192
Jimmy.

241
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,858
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,992
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,002
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,213
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,244
It's OK.

246
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:45,054
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,138
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,370
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,281
Scott.

250
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,895
Scott.

251
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,358
Scott.

252
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:57,560
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:00,171
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,969
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,508
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,444
Stop!

257
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,296
Jean?

258
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,438
Scott.

259
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,944
How?

260
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,976
I don't know.

261
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,760
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,998
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,011
No.

264
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,773
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,653
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,361
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,161
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:13,964
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,389
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,824
I can take care of that.

271
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,203
What the...

272
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,608
Logan!

273
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:44,352
She's alive.

274
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,954
Jean.

275
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:58,701
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,033
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,908
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,737
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:15,548
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:20,387
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:24,987
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,657
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:33,797
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:39,867
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:46,043
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:52,455
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,852
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:03,196
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,738
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,774
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:15,404
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,846
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,477
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,612
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:28,193
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,491
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:35,533
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,434
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,406
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,878
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,581
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,024
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:05,460
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:11,799
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,143
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:32,485
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,560
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,259
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,558
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,133
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,067
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,674
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,573
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:56,203
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,810
You ready?

316
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:33,048
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,784
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,860
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:49,829
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,869
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,030
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,267
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:01,176
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,347
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,018
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,527
It's what you want.

327
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,094
Warren, no!

328
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,800
Told you so.

329
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,920
About time.

330
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,553
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:03,431
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,299
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,430
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:13,838
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,039
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:26,084
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,856
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:37,532
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:41,595
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:45,143
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,838
How fascinating.

342
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,217
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:56,447
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,464
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:16,706
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,810
No!

347
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,203
You saved me.

348
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,805
Eric.

349
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,876
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,610
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:08,284
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:18,301
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,031
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,267
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,140
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:33,446
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,851
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,117
I have.

359
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,788
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,923
As do I.

361
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,899
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,238
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,768
Jean.

364
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,011
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:44,920
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,716
Are you OK?

367
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,519
Yeah.

368
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,790
More than OK.

369
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,642
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:15,247
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,824
It's OK.

372
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,233
It's OK.

373
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,542
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,649
Jean.

375
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,817
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,896
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:38,168
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,438
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:46,307
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:50,973
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,412
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,851
Jean?

383
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:07,228
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,861
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,331
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,946
Oh, God.

387
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,188
Look at me.

388
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:47,102
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,036
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,005
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,541
Kill me.

392
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,410
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,109
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:02,812
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,220
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,089
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:13,621
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,700
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:30,675
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,344
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,011
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:43,083
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,253
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,627
I picked something up.

405
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,899
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,508
It's a mutant.

407
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:01,705
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,179
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,083
Where is she?

410
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:14,189
Logan.

411
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,385
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,553
What have you done?

413
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,968
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,069
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:42,848
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,987
It may be too late.

417
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,558
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,688
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,627
You were right, Charles.

420
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:01,136
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,231
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,572
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,703
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,549
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:18,781
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:22,689
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,819
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:15,172
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,114
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,744
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:26,789
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:29,723
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,920
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:36,225
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,232
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:41,362
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:43,998
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,008
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:53,812
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:04,017
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,154
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:12,701
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:16,171
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,472
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:22,978
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,714
That's it.

447
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:12,188
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,489
No, Jean.

449
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,619
Jean!

450
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,889
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:30,663
Charles.

452
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:00,263
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,937
No.

454
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,810
God!

455
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:59,881
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:04,724
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,896
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:13,731
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:17,741
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,644
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:27,410
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:32,854
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:36,527
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:40,531
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:48,731
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,332
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:56,345
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,402
Kitty.

469
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,499
Bobby.

470
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,471
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,646
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,922
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,052
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:49,360
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,662
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,701
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,673
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:05,512
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:08,107
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:10,846
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,718
Come on.

482
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:26,860
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:09,163
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,583
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:27,692 --> 00:54:29,751
No.

486
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:33,822
Where are you going?

487
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,064
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:40,172 --> 00:54:42,572
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:47,337
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:50,937
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:52,983
A kiss.

492
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:56,610
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:54:58,356 --> 00:55:00,824
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:04,355
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:08,560
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,726
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:14,032
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:16,308 --> 00:55:19,243
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:20,902
Marie.

500
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:24,308
Marie.

501
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:08,591
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:14,723
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:22,662
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:27,078 --> 00:56:30,980
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:34,574
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:36,950
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,692
Jean.

508
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:51,826
Enough.

509
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:55,330
Enough.

510
00:56:57,676 --> 00:56:59,906
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,946
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:07,142
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:10,214
As nature intended.

514
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:18,155
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:19,464 --> 00:57:21,728
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:33,104
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:36,977
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:37,115 --> 00:57:40,551
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:46,521
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:50,719
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:56,631
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,485
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:15,587 --> 00:58:19,148
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:25,160
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:31,099
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:36,107 --> 00:58:38,769
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:38,877 --> 00:58:43,211
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:45,373
It was, son.

529
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:53,251
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:57,294
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:13,401
Rogue.

532
00:59:14,345 --> 00:59:16,404
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,890
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:43,241 --> 00:59:45,471
Logan.

535
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,134
Logan.

536
00:59:47,245 --> 00:59:49,042
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,944
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,981
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,417
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:59:56,521 --> 00:59:58,853
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:19,711 --> 01:00:22,407
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
01:00:22,514 --> 01:00:26,382
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,918
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,353
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:36,659
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:40,492
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:42,657
Because you love her.

548
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:55,240
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,543
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:11,863 --> 01:01:14,832
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,499
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:18,736 --> 01:01:21,432
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:25,503
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:32,241
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,046
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:36,221 --> 01:01:39,281
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:40,692 --> 01:01:44,685
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:50,891
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:54,662
Make a move.

560
01:02:00,044 --> 01:02:03,741
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:19,258
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:23,266
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:29,773
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:33,776
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:36,676
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:40,740
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:02:42,153 --> 01:02:46,715
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:51,718
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:55,959
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:59,730
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:06,037
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:09,375
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,108
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:12,216 --> 01:03:15,879
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:15,987 --> 01:03:19,514
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:23,753
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:25,953
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,474
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:45,340
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:47,885 --> 01:03:51,787
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:15,298
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:23,534
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:25,643 --> 01:06:27,702
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:28,713 --> 01:06:30,772
We have ours.

585
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:39,245
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:46,953
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:50,327
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:50,434 --> 01:06:52,629
take control of the cure,

589
01:06:52,737 --> 01:06:55,137
and destroy its source.

590
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:58,936
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,922
Jean.

592
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:31,669
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.

593
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:34,677
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:07:34,845 --> 01:07:40,340
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:49,126 --> 01:07:52,960
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:53,097 --> 01:07:56,692
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:56,867 --> 01:08:00,303
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:00,438 --> 01:08:04,033
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:19,513
OK.

600
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:24,258
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:25,396 --> 01:08:30,356
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:32,336 --> 01:08:36,966
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:41,408
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,146
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:22,742
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:38,863
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,535
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:46,837
OK.

609
01:09:46,977 --> 01:09:51,380
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:08,559
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:11,831
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:11,969 --> 01:10:14,938
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:27,311
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:10:27,451 --> 01:10:30,784
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:10:30,888 --> 01:10:34,619
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:37,318
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,562
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:45,669 --> 01:10:48,433
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:50,564
I need help.

620
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:53,472
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:53,611 --> 01:10:56,444
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:10:56,547 --> 01:11:01,849
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:05,410
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:05,523 --> 01:11:07,582
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:11,762 --> 01:11:15,892
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,969
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:19,103 --> 01:11:24,769
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,810
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:28,946 --> 01:11:31,471
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:33,948
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:36,178
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,280
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:44,154
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:46,320
Are you?

635
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:49,523
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:50,835 --> 01:11:53,235
X-Men.

637
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:55,362
All of us.

638
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:04,278
We're in.

639
01:12:04,415 --> 01:12:06,474
Let's go.

640
01:12:10,521 --> 01:12:13,456
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:14,592 --> 01:12:19,757
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,318
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:50,654 --> 01:13:52,679
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,728
We're trapped.

645
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:05,852
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:23,232
My God.

647
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:51,266
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:10,676
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:14,120
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:17:30,941 --> 01:17:33,808
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:39,006
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:47,925 --> 01:17:50,792
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:56,934 --> 01:17:59,767
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:09,313 --> 01:18:12,009
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:18,589 --> 01:18:20,420
Fire!

656
01:18:27,197 --> 01:18:31,964
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:51,822 --> 01:18:56,020
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:02,422
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:06,332
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:09,228
Then God help us.

661
01:19:19,082 --> 01:19:21,107
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:55,052 --> 01:19:58,180
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:06,122
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:09,494
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:28,012
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:34,191 --> 01:20:36,785
Finish them!

667
01:21:12,062 --> 01:21:13,723
Not yet.

668
01:21:28,478 --> 01:21:31,208
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:33,373
With pleasure.

670
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:41,851
Hold it!

671
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,785
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:48,126
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:48,265 --> 01:21:50,324
Kitty!

674
01:22:00,644 --> 01:22:02,703
Come on.

675
01:22:05,882 --> 01:22:07,782
Grow those back.

676
01:22:18,462 --> 01:22:20,487
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:21,498 --> 01:22:24,092
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:55,966 --> 01:22:58,025
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:04,199
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:06,332
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,905
Girls.

682
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:11,343
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:11,448 --> 01:23:14,679
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:14,784 --> 01:23:17,014
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,384
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:43,368
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:43,513 --> 01:23:46,073
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:46,216 --> 01:23:49,310
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:49,419 --> 01:23:50,647
No.

690
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,593
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:03,066 --> 01:24:05,296
This way.

692
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:10,362
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:14,077 --> 01:24:16,409
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:24:19,849 --> 01:24:22,079
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:24:22,185 --> 01:24:24,710
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:38,066
Don't. No.

697
01:24:38,935 --> 01:24:40,698
Don't.

698
01:24:40,804 --> 01:24:44,706
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:45,442 --> 01:24:47,740
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:17,774 --> 01:25:19,935
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,689
Take cover.

702
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:37,025
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:51,900
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:53,600
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:45,160
We work as a team.

706
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:48,253
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:57,939
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:27:10,286 --> 01:27:12,311
Go ahead.

709
01:27:13,556 --> 01:27:16,081
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:16,226 --> 01:27:18,251
Right.

711
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:09,903
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:10,013 --> 01:28:12,982
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:26,124
You never should have left.

714
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,491
This is it.

715
01:28:29,632 --> 01:28:31,600
Hey.

716
01:28:31,734 --> 01:28:34,669
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:45,348 --> 01:28:47,873
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:49,452 --> 01:28:52,944
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:08,664
I'm...

720
01:29:08,771 --> 01:29:11,433
One of them?

721
01:29:21,517 --> 01:29:24,850
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,775
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,305
It's over.

724
01:29:55,518 --> 01:29:57,509
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,332
No!

726
01:30:29,452 --> 01:30:32,512
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:43,089
Bobby!

728
01:30:53,209 --> 01:30:55,268
What have I done?

729
01:31:06,055 --> 01:31:10,389
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:10,526 --> 01:31:12,994
Go.

731
01:31:16,566 --> 01:31:18,295
Jean!

732
01:32:03,513 --> 01:32:05,572
Jean!

733
01:32:05,715 --> 01:32:08,115
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,292
You would die for them?

735
01:32:58,401 --> 01:33:00,460
No, not for them.

736
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:03,696
For you.

737
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,699
For you.

738
01:33:12,715 --> 01:33:14,774
Save me.

739
01:33:16,652 --> 01:33:18,313
I love you.

740
01:34:57,653 --> 01:35:00,281
You're back.

741
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:09,120
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:09,265 --> 01:35:11,256
I had to.

743
01:35:12,134 --> 01:35:15,160
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,707
It's what I want.

745
01:35:30,987 --> 01:35:32,614
Hey.

746
01:35:33,556 --> 01:35:35,820
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:38,620
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:38,761 --> 01:35:41,889
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:42,064 --> 01:35:46,228
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:46,335 --> 01:35:49,168
human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:49,272 --> 01:35:51,331
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,774
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,371
Morning.

754
01:43:51,787 --> 01:43:54,517
Hello, Moira.

755
01:44:00,929 --> 01:44:02,590
Charles.
