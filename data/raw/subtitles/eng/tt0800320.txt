00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,769
<i>The oldest stories ever told
are written in the stars.</i>

2
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,941
<i>Stories of time before man and gods,
when Titans ruled the earth.</i>

3
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,540
<i>The Titans were powerful...</i>

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,741
<i>...but their reign was ended
by their own sons...</i>

5
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:56,912
<i>...Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.</i>

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,522
<i>Zeus convinced his brother Hades...</i>

7
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,629
<i>...to create a beast so strong
it could defeat their parents.</i>

8
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,663
<i>And from his own flesh...</i>

9
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,236
<i>...Hades gave birth
to an unspeakable horror...</i>

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,304
<i>...the Kraken.</i>

11
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,573
<i>Zeus became king of the heavens.</i>

12
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,820
<i>Poseidon, king of the seas.</i>

13
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,356
<i>And Hades, tricked by Zeus...</i>

14
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:36,791
<i>...was left to rule the underworld
in darkness and in misery.</i>

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,300
<i>It was Zeus who created man...</i>

16
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,632
<i>...and man's prayers
fed the gods' immortality.</i>

17
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,868
<i>But in time, mankind grew restless.</i>

18
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,173
<i>They began to question the gods...</i>

19
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,409
<i>...and, finally, rise up against them.</i>

20
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,353
<i>Into this world, a child was born.</i>

21
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,060
<i>A boy who would change everything.</i>

22
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,027
Shh. Shh.

23
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,170
Perseus.

24
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,300
What is it, son?

25
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,064
I'll have a brother or a sister soon.

26
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,459
Think we're gonna love this child
differently to the way we love you?

27
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,375
No, we won't.

28
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,707
This child will be yours.

29
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,545
Me...

30
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,414
...I'm no one's son.

31
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,015
I am your father, Perseus.
Marmara is your mother.

32
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,957
And you'll always be our son.

33
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,893
The bond between us
is much more than flesh and bone.

34
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,961
The love we have for you...

35
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:01,038
...it's that love that gods and kings
fight over.

36
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,571
I've never understood the gods.

37
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,576
But even I don't question
that you were saved for a reason.

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,010
And some day...

39
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:14,347
...that reason is gonna take you
far away from here.

40
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,848
But not tonight, eh?

41
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,011
Perseus. Perseus!

42
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,374
Getting frail, old man.

43
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,142
Marmara! Marmara!

44
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,283
Another day, nothing.

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,019
Caught on the reef.

46
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,596
To whom do I direct our gratitude
for this glorious bounty?

47
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,028
Spyros, please.

48
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,465
Poseidon, Zeus?
Who do I thank, Marmara?

49
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,470
- Thank the men who provoke them.
- They crush my island.

50
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,737
They put a plague on yours.

51
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,469
They take from us what they want.
We're their slaves.

52
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,078
The gods gave us life.

53
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,848
- For that, we should be thankful.
- I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.

54
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,543
I'm a fisherman. Perseus is a fisherman.

55
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,020
They've even taken that away from us.
What we are.

56
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,493
Still they want us to love them anyway.

57
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,823
One day...

58
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,464
...somebody's gonna have to
make a stand.

59
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,964
One day, somebody's gonna have to say:

60
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,396
"Enough. "

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,428
Just like the day you came to me.

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,634
The storm brought me right to you.

63
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,042
I know you have questions, son.

64
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,016
I wish I had the answers.

65
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,551
I have everything I need...

66
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,583
...right here.

67
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,794
Good night, son.

68
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,643
Hold her steady!

69
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,577
Tekla, the wreath.

70
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,279
Fetch the wreath.

71
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,449
The statue of Zeus. Magnificent.

72
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,365
Something isn't right.

73
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,234
The soldiers, what are they doing?

74
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,807
Come on!

75
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,508
Lift it!

76
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,821
Hang on!

77
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,494
In the name of the king and queen!

78
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,657
Who are they?

79
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,735
Soldiers from Argos.

80
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,429
What have they done?

81
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:57,064
They've declared war.
War against the gods.

82
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,427
- Let's turn the boat around.
No.

83
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,034
Do nothing.

84
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,808
Behind you!

85
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,388
Hold on!

86
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,032
Tekla.

87
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,299
Where's the boy?

88
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,143
Tekla!

89
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,141
No!

90
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,005
Go!
- No!

91
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,438
No!

92
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:13,106
<i>Zeus, you must bring an end
to this. They attack our temples!</i>

93
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,907
<i>Now they dare to desecrate Zeus' image.</i>

94
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,379
<i>We could reach out to them.</i>

95
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,177
<i>An accommodation could be made.
A truce!</i>

96
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,149
No!

97
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,616
I created them...

98
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,854
...and they reward my love with defiance?

99
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,329
There will be no truce.

100
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,463
Finally.

101
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,570
Some rage from you.

102
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,873
How long has it been?

103
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,234
How long, brother...

104
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,210
...since you've seen my face?

105
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,478
Hades.

106
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:03,420
Endless years,
I've watched from the underworld...

107
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,789
...and saw your wrath
tempered with love.

108
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,266
You created them for one reason...

109
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:16,841
...so their prayers
would fuel our immortality.

110
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,534
But you love them too well.

111
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,202
They've grown strong.

112
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,647
And now I am forced to rise
because we are all threatened.

113
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,719
What do you want, brother?

114
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,789
Let me loose upon them.

115
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,789
They will pray again...

116
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,123
...and you will bathe in their awe
and fear.

117
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,232
And we will grow strong again.

118
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,664
He belongs in the underworld, not here.

119
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,100
You do not tell me where I belong.

120
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,765
You say it is love that feeds us.

121
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,539
But you depend on their love.

122
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,479
I've only learned to live on their fear...

123
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,042
...their pain.

124
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,623
Zeus, our brother speaks the truth.
Hear him.

125
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,456
Go. Do what you will.

126
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,032
Father, we need the mortals.

127
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,499
No, Apollo.

128
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,137
Hades is right.

129
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,899
Their insolence has a price.

130
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,033
Like children, they need to be
reminded of the order of things.

131
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,373
Set an example, brother.

132
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,344
Turn them on each other...

133
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
...and back into our arms.

134
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,695
- Are we the last boat to come in?
No, captain.

135
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,098
You're the only one.

136
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,624
Is he one of ours?

137
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,430
No. We found him off Paxos
amongst our dead.

138
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,094
He was the only survivor.

139
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,003
Let the palace figure out
what to do with him.

140
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,807
Squad by four!

141
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,002
Go on.

142
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,280
Because if we show the gods our love...

143
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,714
...they shall show us love in return.
They shall.

144
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,446
They gave us the corn in the fields,
the sun in the sky.

145
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,180
These are all gifts given to us.

146
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,689
Gifts can be taken away.
This will be taken away...

147
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,589
...if we do not pay love to our gods.

148
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,493
If we do not, we stay in filth and misery,
which we have brought upon ourselves.

149
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,362
Move. Out of the way.
Our gods, we beg for the whip...

150
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,402
The beauty and clarity of servitude.

151
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,333
Man cannot rule man. You defy the gods
and you will be punished.

152
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,743
Is this all there is?

153
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,942
We lost many men, Your Majesty...

154
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,951
...but we have victory.

155
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,722
To King Kepheus! To Queen Cassiopeia!

156
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,896
No.

157
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,395
To you...

158
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,073
...our mighty legion.

159
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,974
Our heroes who have dared
to strike a blow at the heart of Zeus!

160
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,073
The temples are burning.

161
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,515
The statues have fallen.

162
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,121
We have starved them of our prayers.

163
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,784
Tonight...

164
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,324
...after a generation of struggle...

165
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,156
...the sun does not set over the ocean.

166
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,629
It sets on Olympus itself.

167
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,368
A new era has begun.

168
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,361
The era of man!

169
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,106
That frown doesn't suit you, Andromeda.

170
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,302
Have something to drink.
You'll feel more lively.

171
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,649
Andromeda.

172
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,618
What's your name?

173
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,620
Perseus.

174
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,260
Take this.

175
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,636
Please drink.

176
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,903
Hands off.
Enough.

177
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,909
Our daughter, the missionary.

178
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,848
Have you seen what's happening
out there?

179
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,214
Have you even bothered to look?

180
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,483
We serve as an inspiration.

181
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,818
Hundreds of our men
have lost their lives...

182
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,453
...yet we celebrate.

183
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,022
You provoke the gods and you act
as if there will be no consequence.

184
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,189
Well, what do you want?
Should we be afraid?

185
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,531
Should we be trembling
and soiling ourselves in fear?

186
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,228
The gods need us.

187
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,703
They need our worship.

188
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,905
What do we need of them?

189
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,671
- Look at my daughter.
- Don't.

190
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,873
What could be more
divine than her face?

191
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,575
More beautiful
than all the women of Greece.

192
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,349
More beautiful than Aphrodite herself.
The Olympians should envy her.

193
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:10,393
- We are the gods now.
- My queen. You're making a spectacle.

194
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,735
Interesting.

195
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,900
You!

196
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,162
You are specks of dust
beneath our fingernails.

197
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,636
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

198
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,466
You have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension.

199
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,166
Who are you?

200
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,479
I am Hades.

201
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,045
Kneel.

202
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,352
Not now, Perseus.

203
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,324
You will have your chance.

204
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,565
What do you know of beauty?

205
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,707
What is more beautiful than death?

206
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,346
Gaze upon me, mortal queen.

207
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,517
Mother.
Princess.

208
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,925
In 10 days...

209
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,333
...when the sun is eclipsed...

210
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,764
...I will unleash the Kraken.

211
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,106
Argos will be swept from the earth...

212
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,441
...and all of you with it.

213
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,875
Unless...

214
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,078
...you sacrifice the princess...

215
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,315
...you so foolishly compare to the gods.

216
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,552
Only her blood will sate the Kraken...

217
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,787
...and Zeus...

218
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,832
...who you have so offended.

219
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,565
Choose your penance, Argos.

220
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,641
Destruction or sacrifice.

221
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,937
This is the will of Zeus.

222
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,976
The will of your father.

223
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,158
There is a demigod in Argos.

224
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,063
That is impossible.

225
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,236
He's yours.

226
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,903
His name is Perseus.

227
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,443
We could offer him sanctuary.

228
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,013
Have I heard his prayers?

229
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,346
This son knows no love for me.

230
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,486
He's no different from any of the others
who have turned their backs on us.

231
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,525
For the last time, demigod, speak!

232
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,694
- I'm not a demigod.
- Who are you? Why were you sent?

233
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,496
I don't know.

234
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,773
I advise against this, sire.

235
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,912
- He's not to be trusted.
- What would you have me do? Draco.

236
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,711
Leave him.

237
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,284
Is it possible?

238
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,688
If it's true you are the son of Zeus...

239
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,726
...you can save us.

240
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,789
You must save us.

241
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,458
I can't save you. I'm just a man.

242
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,231
My lord, as terrible as it is
to utter the words...

243
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,136
...a sacrifice is the only way.

244
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,038
Don't even say the word.

245
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,643
He's right.

246
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,711
No one should have to die for me.

247
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,180
Let Perseus go.

248
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,915
Sire, we need to get the princess
out of the city now.

249
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,922
- I'll find a place to hide her.
- You can't hide from Hades.

250
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,492
So says the bastard son of a god.

251
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,228
My father...

252
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,762
...was killed by a god.

253
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,371
My mother, sister...

254
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,840
...everyone I loved was killed by a god.

255
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,838
I mend nets...

256
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,950
...not wield a sword.

257
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,521
So, demigod, you have a visitor.

258
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,956
She says she knows you.

259
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,238
My name is lo, Perseus.

260
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,371
And how do you know me?

261
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,907
I've watched you all your life.

262
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,673
I guided you to your family.

263
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,477
Are you a god?

264
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,312
There are gods and there are men...

265
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,988
...and there are those of us
who are in between.

266
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,448
Many years ago...

267
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,255
...I refused a god's advance.

268
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,420
I was cursed with agelessness.

269
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,133
That's not much of a curse.

270
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,565
I've lived for years
watching my loved ones die.

271
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,605
I imagine you're sympathetic
to that plight.

272
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,375
Is it true?

273
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,107
Am I the son of Zeus?

274
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,243
Yes.

275
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,357
The story of your birth
began with the rebellion of King Acrisius.

276
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,591
<i>Mankind had grown tired
of the gods' mistreatment and cruelty.</i>

277
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,794
<i>Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.</i>

278
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,436
<i>It is said the other gods...</i>

279
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,406
<i>...wanted to simply lay waste to Acrisius
and his army...</i>

280
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,341
<i>...but Zeus loved man too much.</i>

281
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:13,143
<i>Instead, he chose to make an example
of Acrisius.</i>

282
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,911
<i>He disguised himself as the king...</i>

283
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,456
<i>...and visited the chamber
where the king's wife was sleeping.</i>

284
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,650
My king.

285
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,865
Zeus?

286
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,578
<i>Acrisius grew mad with rage.</i>

287
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,341
He ordered the execution of his wife...

288
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,918
...and Zeus' newborn son.

289
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,693
I curse you, Zeus.

290
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,330
I deny you the body you soiled...

291
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,398
...and the bastard child with it!

292
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,799
No!

293
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,348
The queen and her child
were cast into the sea.

294
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,547
Your mother was killed, but you...

295
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,454
...part man, part god, you lived.

296
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,161
I've watched over you ever since...

297
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,356
...waiting for the day when you will help
bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.

298
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,731
You were born to kill the Kraken.

299
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,431
I don't know why I was born...

300
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,777
...or what I am.

301
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,738
But I know it's not the Kraken
I wanna kill.

302
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,450
How do I get to Hades?

303
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,643
If the Kraken falls...

304
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,517
...Hades will be weak enough
for you to strike a deathly blow.

305
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,455
Only then will you have the revenge
you seek.

306
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,686
Then they better release me.

307
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,398
If the Kraken can be killed...

308
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,764
...the Stygian witches will know how.

309
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,736
The witches are further away
than the legion has ever been.

310
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,999
No man can go there.

311
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,836
No man.

312
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,673
Keep your distance, lo.

313
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,481
Zeus, forgive us for these affronts
and protect us.

314
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,319
And you still believe
they're going to help?

315
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,459
This is suicide.

316
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,960
And the shields. Come on, boys.

317
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,155
It's a lost cause.

318
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,961
We've no chance, and you know it.

319
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,170
Here's who you drew into this, Perseus.
An honor guard.

320
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,739
Young men who look good
on a reviewing stand...

321
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,608
...and old soldiers,
heading towards retirement.

322
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,443
Do you know what the Kraken is?

323
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,882
The Kraken is the end of us.
A colossal, elemental beast.

324
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,957
It doesn't think. It doesn't feel.
Even the gods fear it.

325
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,529
- And you, you're going to kill it?
- Don't come.

326
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,295
- I don't need your help.
- Of course not.

327
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,328
You're the son of Zeus.

328
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,997
- But we have orders.
Come, we need to leave!

329
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:27,042
Gentlemen, may our journey be long,
filled with agony and torment...

330
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,147
...and may we all complain about it
bitterly as old men.

331
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,341
- So what should we bring?
- Bring everything.

332
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,147
What makes you think the witches
will tell us anything?

333
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,556
Oh, they'll tell us, or I'll kill them too.

334
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,397
Come on. Let's go, boys.

335
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,930
- What is this?
- Just leave it.

336
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,272
Don't leave us
to the mercy of the gods! Please.

337
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,041
Don't go. Please stay!

338
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,054
Stay here. Please? Please? Help us.

339
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,885
You're just going to
make the gods angrier. Please.

340
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,119
Just sacrifice the princess!

341
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,287
Watch your mouth!
Stay back. Stay back!

342
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,092
You'd think they might be thankful.

343
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,363
You cannot desert us!

344
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,299
Maybe they're tired of being thankful.

345
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,963
Good news!

346
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,233
My brother and I have decided...

347
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,140
- to accompany you on your journey.
- We have enough strangers here.

348
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,180
We can be of great help to you,
trust me. You'll need us.

349
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,078
I need soldiers, not hunters.

350
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,216
Which one of your soldiers
knows how to cut the impenetrable skin...

351
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,823
...of the Nemean lion?

352
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:51,052
Which one of them knows the soft points
on a centaur's armor?

353
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:56,462
Which one of them knows which jugular
to slice on a five-headed Hydra?

354
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,033
- The middle one.
- The middle one. Good guess.

355
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,571
My brother and I, we know how to kill.

356
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,368
- We enjoy it.
- If you can keep up...

357
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,442
...and you don't mind dying, come along.

358
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,674
It is death who should be afraid of us.

359
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,463
King Acrisius.

360
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,259
There is no Acrisius.

361
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,626
Just Calibos.

362
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,671
We have an enemy in common.

363
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,913
- Zeus.
- Zeus.

364
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,278
My brother.

365
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,150
What do you want from me?

366
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:31,728
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.

367
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,521
The child of your shame.

368
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,325
Perseus.

369
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,992
He lives?

370
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,062
You murdered your wife for nothing.

371
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:48,202
Now Perseus hurls himself
from Argos to destroy me.

372
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,509
He must die.

373
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,244
- What would you have me do?
- Zeus must think I serve him...

374
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,218
...but I am growing stronger.

375
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,122
Until I possess my full power...

376
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,461
...you will be my weapon.

377
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,168
Come.

378
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,722
Use this.

379
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,804
Kill Perseus for me.

380
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,072
And I'll destroy Zeus for you.

381
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,233
I serve you.

382
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,606
The boy will die.

383
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,481
How far is it?

384
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,645
Four days to the witches.

385
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,258
Four days? I'm tired already.

386
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,623
Here, use this.

387
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,436
Would you like us to wait?

388
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,171
Oops.

389
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,356
You really are a fisherman.

390
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,500
You should've seen my father.

391
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,425
You.

392
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,732
Bring your weapon.

393
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,042
Have you handled a sword before?

394
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,344
- There's been no need.
- I see.

395
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,011
Left foot forward.

396
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,749
Your motions should be fluid.

397
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,624
The weapon is a part of you.

398
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,195
Like the sting on a wasp.

399
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,796
Stay focused.

400
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,432
Know what's around you.

401
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,643
Keep your balance at all times.

402
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,280
You fall...

403
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,210
...you die.

404
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,154
Get up.

405
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,554
Don't...

406
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,775
There is a god in you.

407
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,644
Be sure to bring it.

408
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,353
End of lesson.

409
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,311
Perseus.

410
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,010
A gift from the gods.

411
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,012
- Forged on Olympus.
- Why?

412
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,276
Just accept it.

413
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,420
I can do this as a man.

414
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,415
So it's yours.

415
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,967
Gentlemen, retrieve our savior.

416
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,561
Shh.

417
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,666
The Pegasus.

418
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,862
No man has ever ridden one.

419
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,212
It's a message.

420
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,413
They're watching us.

421
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,260
Perseus!

422
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,866
Perseus!

423
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:28,962
Perseus!

424
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,576
Why does it always have to be...?
- Shh!

425
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,336
Listen.

426
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,484
Help me!

427
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,357
Help me!

428
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,357
You reek of your father.

429
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,225
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Let's ask him.

430
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,578
Let it go.

431
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,506
No. We split up.

432
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,152
Just follow the blood.

433
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,125
Come on!

434
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,665
Look! His blood.

435
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,723
Are you happy now?

436
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,663
Attack!

437
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,869
Wait! Wait!

438
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,214
What is that?

439
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,747
Come on!

440
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,144
Lxas!

441
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,420
Spear!

442
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,801
Draco!

443
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,853
Faster!

444
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,062
Let's go, let's go!

445
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,170
Go, jump!

446
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,371
Run!

447
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,807
Back up! Back up! Back up!
There's more!

448
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,276
- Run!
Everyone. Back to back!

449
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,389
Stand your ground.

450
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,961
Three more!
In the name of the gods, they're bigger.

451
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,883
What are they?

452
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:04,818
Djinn.

453
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:11,065
I fought them in the legion.

454
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,260
This is their desert.

455
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,432
- Enemies?
- I thought so.

456
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,509
They aren't human. Not anymore.
Desert conjurers, cutthroats.

457
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,271
- Well, somebody should thank them.
What?

458
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:49,495
- What is it?
- Venom. From Hades.

459
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:55,668
- Pray. Pray to Zeus for strength.
- No. No.

460
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,780
Pray to your damn father.

461
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,075
Hear my prayer.
Protect and heal your son.

462
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,684
- No.
Please, Zeus, hear me.

463
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,363
Would you like some bread?

464
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,226
Thank you.
Thank you.

465
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,594
- Please.
Have some bread.

466
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,326
Over here. Over here.

467
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,664
- For you.
- Please.

468
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,545
No.

469
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,611
We must turn our hearts to Hades!

470
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,085
It is the only way!

471
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,593
Brothers and sisters!

472
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,095
Come to me! Come!

473
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,199
I have the way out of our misery.

474
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,736
Hades has asked for the princess.

475
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,867
Sacrifice one for the life of the city.

476
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,913
Why do they remain silent
while we suffer?

477
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,610
Why do they guard the woman
whose death will save us?

478
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,111
Is she better than any one of you?

479
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,422
We have long worshiped Zeus in Argos.

480
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:19,926
But it is Hades
who now offers us salvation.

481
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:24,591
We must pray to the one
who showed us our sin...

482
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:27,703
...and who offers us redemption...

483
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,971
...through blood.

484
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,454
A bribe for the ferryman.

485
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,699
When they get injured in battle...

486
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,827
...they replace their limbs
with charwood and black magic.

487
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,441
They feel no pain.

488
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,406
Live hundreds of years.

489
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,511
So how old is that one?

490
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,048
I don't care. I don't trust them.

491
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,357
You're burning.

492
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,130
Drink this.

493
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,533
I'll get more water.

494
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,276
Come on!

495
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,287
Look out!

496
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,763
What?

497
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,329
What's he saying?

498
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,737
The Djinn have waited many years for
the one who will free them from the gods.

499
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,543
- He says he is no friend of the humans.
- You don't say.

500
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,547
But the only way we can help Perseus
is together.

501
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,681
Draco.

502
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,385
Look.

503
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,637
Together.

504
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,024
- He's not ready to travel.
- Time is slipping away, lo.

505
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,591
He may be a demigod,
but he's still mortal.

506
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:37,990
Feeling better?

507
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,355
- Yeah, a bit.
- Good.

508
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,527
Your pride is killing my men.

509
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,362
- You were given gifts. Use them.
- Those gifts are a trap!

510
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,800
- I don't care what they are. Use them.
- No.

511
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,968
I will not use that sword
or anything that they give me!

512
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,303
So we'll just continue to die.

513
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:04,543
I can't become like them.

514
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:10,992
If I do this, I do it as a man.

515
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:15,261
But you are not just a man.

516
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:17,961
I choose to be.

517
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,603
A man cannot do this, Perseus.

518
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:23,636
According to who?

519
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:25,569
The gods?

520
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,019
If I had your gifts...

521
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,188
When you need your sword,
it's in my bag.

522
00:52:55,304 --> 00:52:56,328
They're riding them.

523
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,218
They tried to kill us.
I'm not getting on it.

524
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:18,286
Magnificent.

525
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,520
What are you waiting for?

526
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,725
Well, we need to make up for lost time.

527
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:59,125
We're making good time.

528
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:02,202
Not good enough.
The eclipse is drawing near.

529
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,664
How close are we to the Norn Mountains?

530
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:09,277
It'll be two days
before we reach the witches.

531
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:16,446
This thing is making me feel sick.

532
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,746
Trust me, it's better to be on one
than in one.

533
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:28,424
What, don't you ever smile?

534
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:31,464
When I spit in the eyes of the gods...

535
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:34,430
...then I'll smile.

536
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:17,407
- What is this place?
- The Garden of Stygia.

537
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:21,348
This is where the Kraken
defeated the Titans.

538
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:23,747
It's what Argos will look like
when we fail.

539
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,811
Every step we take
is an insult to the gods.

540
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,116
- Good.
- Perseus.

541
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:34,492
Only ask what you need to know.
Nothing more.

542
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,721
Of course.

543
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:18,799
Visitors.

544
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:20,407
Who is it?
Visitors.

545
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:22,510
Got the eye.

546
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:25,044
Give it to me.
Who is it?

547
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,309
Who is it? Who is it?

548
00:56:32,254 --> 00:56:33,812
The eye. Give it to me.

549
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:35,286
Perseus, no.

550
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,591
We didn't come here to fight.

551
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:41,994
- We just have one question.
Young Perseus.

552
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,462
Son of Zeus.
So fresh.

553
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:45,657
Perseus.
Closer.

554
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:46,892
A little nibble.

555
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,597
- Flesh of a god.
Flesh of a god.

556
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:54,038
- Witch.
- Don't. Easy.

557
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,943
Stale meat, ladies.

558
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:05,246
So which one's
gonna answer my question?

559
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,821
You want to know about the Kraken.
Kraken?

560
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,518
Do it.
- Kill it.

561
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,785
- That's right.
A wasted journey.

562
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,861
The Kraken fears no weapon.

563
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:15,857
It must have a weakness.

564
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,432
Maybe.

565
00:57:19,468 --> 00:57:21,060
But knowledge demands payment.

566
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,467
- Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.

567
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:24,765
Eusebios!
Watch out!

568
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:29,104
Look out!
Lxas, shoot!

569
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:34,873
Help!
The eye!

570
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:44,525
Let him go! Do it!
You wouldn't dare.

571
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:47,294
We cannot see the answers
without the eye!

572
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:48,589
Let him go!

573
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:52,534
Now answer the question.

574
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:55,067
How do we kill the Kraken?

575
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:57,797
- There is a solution.
Solution.

576
00:57:57,973 --> 00:57:59,634
But it is an impossible one.

577
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:01,867
- Yeah?
- The Gorgon, Medusa.

578
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:03,534
Medusa.

579
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:06,875
Anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.

580
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:10,849
Killed by her.
- Her prison lies across the River Styx...

581
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,114
- at the edge of the underworld.
A Titan against a Titan.

582
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,020
She's no use against the Kraken.
We can't control her.

583
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:19,991
Then we take her head.

584
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:24,121
Clever boy.
- Now the eye. Give us the eye.

585
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,631
- The eye.
- The eye.

586
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:31,932
Where is it?

587
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:39,775
But wait. There's more.
Don't you want to know more?

588
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:41,176
Perseus, no.

589
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:44,347
Tell him.
Tell him.

590
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,544
What?

591
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,315
Your journey does not end well.

592
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,258
Fate has spoken.

593
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,727
You will die, son of Zeus!

594
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:01,802
It's a lie. Come.

595
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:03,899
Written as history.

596
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,103
Perseus.

597
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:11,337
You will die.

598
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,356
Why are the Djinn leaving us?

599
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:35,503
They believe we will all die.
It's the prophecy.

600
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:58,617
Who are you?

601
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:11,402
Well, you can call me "Father"...

602
01:00:12,374 --> 01:00:15,104
- if you wish.
- My father's dead.

603
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:17,269
He was killed by a god.

604
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:20,313
An unfortunate casualty
in a war men brought on themselves.

605
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:24,747
Men didn't murder my family.
Your brother did.

606
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:27,348
You heard the witches' prophesy.

607
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,991
You will not defeat the Kraken,
much less Hades.

608
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,323
If you continue this journey,
you will die, and Argos will still fall.

609
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:36,157
If you're so sure, why are you here?

610
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:38,128
To offer you sanctuary.

611
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,100
Your blood is mine, Perseus,
and that makes you a god.

612
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,933
It's time you came to Olympus
and started living like one.

613
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:48,076
Rather die in the mud with those men
than live forever as a god.

614
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:49,608
You foolish boy.

615
01:00:49,778 --> 01:00:52,770
Man's entire existence
is a gift of my grace.

616
01:00:52,948 --> 01:00:54,347
For someone who created man...

617
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:56,916
...you don't know much about us.

618
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,554
We live...

619
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:02,448
...we fight and we die...

620
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:05,320
...for each other, not for you.

621
01:01:07,029 --> 01:01:08,690
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.

622
01:01:09,998 --> 01:01:12,967
- I will not make this offer again.
- Good.

623
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:15,035
Because I'd hate to refuse you twice.

624
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,263
Perseus.

625
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,997
Wait.

626
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:28,181
It's expensive where you're going.

627
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,809
Kucuk fashioned this shield
from the Scorpioch.

628
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:59,013
Stronger and lighter than any metal.

629
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,506
Very rare and high-quality item.

630
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:07,851
We can fight anywhere...

631
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:12,257
...but not in the underworld.

632
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,986
Yeah.

633
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,058
Good luck, fisherman.

634
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:37,718
We all heard what the witches said.

635
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:41,385
But we can prove them wrong.

636
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,390
I need your help.

637
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,370
It wasn't the gods
that saved me up there.

638
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:02,240
If you believe that we have a chance.

639
01:03:06,214 --> 01:03:08,409
I never liked Argos much anyway.

640
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,384
I know the way.

641
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:23,492
Then we go to the underworld.
We kill Medusa.

642
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:17,381
Now what?
- We wait for Charon.

643
01:04:18,453 --> 01:04:20,148
Charon only ferries the dead.

644
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:22,713
Any volunteers?

645
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:34,128
Heads we swim.

646
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:01,954
A bribe for the ferryman.

647
01:05:57,786 --> 01:05:59,481
So, what happens when we get there?

648
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:01,721
Just another beast to kill.

649
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,118
A beast?

650
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,420
Medusa was beautiful once.

651
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,429
So beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.

652
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,794
When he came for her...

653
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:17,166
...she ran to Athena's temple thinking
that the goddess would protect her.

654
01:06:17,906 --> 01:06:19,396
She didn't.

655
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,904
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.

656
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:26,078
She prayed to Athena for comfort...

657
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,614
...but the goddess felt nothing
but disgust.

658
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,447
She made sure
no one would ever want Medusa again.

659
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:36,921
One look at the creature she has become
will turn any living thing to stone.

660
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:41,423
I cannot assist you there.
A curse prevents me.

661
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:46,524
It was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa
so that Medusa would never harm a woman.

662
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:50,261
Only men are allowed in the temple.

663
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:53,869
Though no man has ever made it out.

664
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:30,903
Medusa's got a tail
and that's how she'll use it.

665
01:07:32,147 --> 01:07:33,637
Listen.

666
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,976
Hear her muscles coil.

667
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:40,052
Smell her skin.

668
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:43,418
Feel her hunger in your gut.

669
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:46,216
Medusa's killed you twice now.

670
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:52,023
Do you think she'll hand you her head?
She won't be gracious about it.

671
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,901
One look in her eyes
and you'll turn to stone.

672
01:07:57,772 --> 01:07:59,262
Good.

673
01:08:03,078 --> 01:08:06,479
- Try not to enjoy this so much.
- I'm trying to help you live.

674
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:09,813
Don't look at me.

675
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,237
Ease your storm.

676
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,911
We're nearing Medusa's lair.

677
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,429
I never thought I could reach this place.

678
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:05,634
Who'd you lose?

679
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,109
My daughter.

680
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:18,812
Taken away on her 16th birthday.

681
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:22,318
Dragged down here.

682
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,225
I have a feeling I'll see her soon.

683
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:32,794
You brought us this far.
Let's go the rest of the way.

684
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,020
- How many coins did you get, Perseus?
- Just the one.

685
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:23,340
I only knew one great man in my life.

686
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:27,878
My father.

687
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:32,086
Now I know four more.

688
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:36,988
And a woman.

689
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,434
And whatever the hell you are.

690
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:48,300
I know we're all afraid.

691
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:50,009
But my father told me:

692
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:53,204
Someday someone was gonna have to
take a stand.

693
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:56,878
Someday someone
was gonna have to say, "Enough. "

694
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,016
This could be that day.

695
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,855
Trust your senses.

696
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:07,187
And don't look this bitch in the eye.

697
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:41,785
- Doesn't really inspire confidence.
- Quiet.

698
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,561
- Listen.
Eusebios.

699
01:11:44,732 --> 01:11:46,529
Keep your eyes down.

700
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:10,017
Here we go.

701
01:12:20,768 --> 01:12:22,793
Solon!

702
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:28,272
Keep going!

703
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:32,406
Flank her.

704
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:39,046
- Draco.
- Go!

705
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:41,554
Eusebios, follow me.

706
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,292
Hang on!

707
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,494
Eusebios.

708
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,332
Remember what Perseus said.

709
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:36,406
Eyes down.

710
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,517
Lxas, no.

711
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,657
Eyes down.

712
01:14:05,506 --> 01:14:08,031
Where are you?

713
01:14:10,144 --> 01:14:12,009
Where are you?

714
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,218
Eusebios.

715
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:29,896
Go!

716
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:46,406
Wait here.

717
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:49,007
I'll lure her out.

718
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:51,979
Get ready.

719
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,392
Now!

720
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:00,483
Together.

721
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:44,930
Let them know men did this.

722
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,450
Just you and me, son of Zeus.

723
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,980
Perseus.

724
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,689
Don't become one of them.

725
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,307
lo, I'm here.

726
01:19:46,714 --> 01:19:48,705
There's no time.

727
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,313
The eclipse.

728
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:58,023
Perseus, you must go
before it's too late.

729
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:04,455
I'm not going anywhere.

730
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,759
My fate is certain.

731
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:11,268
But the fate of Argos
is still in your hands.

732
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:14,505
All my life you've been there.

733
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,836
You never left me.

734
01:20:18,946 --> 01:20:20,106
I can't leave you.

735
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:24,407
This part of the journey
you must do alone.

736
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:26,518
Perseus...

737
01:20:26,687 --> 01:20:29,019
...you're not just part man, part god...

738
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:33,419
...you're the best of both.

739
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:41,299
Everything will be all right.

740
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:38,649
Brother.

741
01:21:39,293 --> 01:21:42,751
It is time for the mortals to pay.

742
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:47,832
My child waits to do your will.

743
01:21:58,345 --> 01:22:00,074
Leave us.

744
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:09,385
Release the Kraken!

745
01:22:37,017 --> 01:22:40,077
The Kraken comes now!

746
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:44,888
Our suffering ends
when the beast is sated!

747
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:47,450
Will it take us...

748
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:51,390
...or will it take Andromeda?

749
01:22:51,565 --> 01:22:53,624
Andromeda!

750
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:58,600
It's my name they're calling.

751
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,038
This cannot continue.

752
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,580
Stay back!
Stay back!

753
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:47,348
Look! The Kraken! Help us!

754
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:16,474
Andromeda!

755
01:24:18,986 --> 01:24:23,980
Hades, we sacrifice our princess
in your name.

756
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:32,761
It comes, brothers and sisters!

757
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,358
Argos has fallen.

758
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:09,095
Do you feel stronger, brother?

759
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:12,467
You thought the Kraken
would bring you their prayers.

760
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:17,239
But the Kraken is my child.
It feeds only me.

761
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,778
I command Olympus.
Remember who you serve.

762
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:23,712
I serve myself.

763
01:25:23,884 --> 01:25:26,978
I have since you cheated me.

764
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:30,450
You sent me to the underworld
to be hated...

765
01:25:30,624 --> 01:25:32,717
...while you basked in their love.

766
01:25:33,827 --> 01:25:35,385
We need the love of humans.

767
01:25:35,562 --> 01:25:37,462
No, you need it.

768
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:39,258
I survive on their fear.

769
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:42,028
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.

770
01:25:42,202 --> 01:25:46,298
You'll watch while my blessed avenger
devours their hopes.

771
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:49,499
And then finally you'll know my pain.

772
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:53,308
There is still a demigod in Argos...

773
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,175
...brother.

774
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,080
Perseus.

775
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:36,519
The bag! Come on!

776
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:50,697
Hyah!

777
01:28:07,147 --> 01:28:10,412
Hey, fisherman!

778
01:29:15,415 --> 01:29:17,110
Come on!

779
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,447
No!

780
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:12,327
I'm a god.

781
01:31:12,499 --> 01:31:14,228
I will live forever.

782
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:15,834
But not here.

783
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:44,079
The boats are coming for us.

784
01:32:49,062 --> 01:32:50,495
For you. Not for me.

785
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:53,557
You won't stay, will you?

786
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:57,100
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

787
01:32:58,004 --> 01:32:59,335
I cannot be a king.

788
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,171
I serve you better as a man.

789
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,878
You'll make a fine queen for them.

790
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:48,684
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.

791
01:33:50,323 --> 01:33:51,950
As do I.

792
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:53,752
Hades lives.

793
01:33:54,227 --> 01:33:56,525
He's just sent back to the underworld.

794
01:33:56,696 --> 01:33:58,630
Biding his time, no doubt.

795
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:02,496
Waiting for men to grow weak,
and in their weakness, he grows stronger.

796
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,634
It's mankind who holds the key
to Hades' rise.

797
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:06,830
It always was.

798
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:09,407
So we'll see him again.

799
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:11,272
Yes.

800
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:14,243
But now the world knows
a man can stop him.

801
01:34:15,048 --> 01:34:17,846
Of course, you had some help.

802
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:21,181
A sword, the Pegasus...

803
01:34:22,155 --> 01:34:26,819
I wanted men to worship us again,
but I didn't want it to cost me a son.

804
01:34:29,095 --> 01:34:30,357
That's almost human of you.

805
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:34,330
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer
to take your place as one of us.

806
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:41,339
I've got everything I need right here.

807
01:34:42,142 --> 01:34:44,007
You may not want to be a god, Perseus...

808
01:34:44,177 --> 01:34:47,704
...but after feats like yours,
men will worship you.

809
01:34:49,115 --> 01:34:50,980
Be good to them.

810
01:34:51,151 --> 01:34:53,483
Be better than we were.

811
01:34:54,721 --> 01:34:58,088
And if you insist on continuing
this mundane human existence...

812
01:34:58,258 --> 01:35:00,021
...I won't have you do it alone.

813
01:35:01,361 --> 01:35:02,953
You're the son of Zeus, after all.
