00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:37,052
Korea's Chosun Dynasty, founded at the end
of the 14th century, lasted until the
beginning of the 20th. 

10
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:43,065
Lasting over 500 years, its uniqueness
under the reign of 27 kings still remains
unmatched in the annals of word history. 

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:49,572
To each King were assigned several Royal
Secretaries whose function was to keep
a diary on behalf of the King. 

12
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:55,837
Upon the King's passing, Court Historians
edited these exhaustive records for
posterity, including succeeding Kings. 

13
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:02,920
The massive collection of these edited
diaries, called "The Royal Records of the
Chosun Dynasty" has survived intact, 

14
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:10,425
The King of this story, the Records show,
was singularly tyrannical: No king before
or after him shared his excesses. 

15
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:17,296
Nonetheless, the Records also give us
a portrait of him as a man of great
sensitivity and intelligence. 

16
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,330
Produced by JUNG Jin-wan, 

17
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:25,769
Directed by LEE Jun-ik

18
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:32,911
When he was a child, his mother was
ordered to commit suicide by poison
after falling victim to court machinations. 

19
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:40,523
Her death left a lasting trauma on the
future king's psyche. No doubt, this
trauma played a significant role in the

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:49,032
deformation of his character.
On September 2, 1506, he was dethroned
violently after a revolt by the nobles. 

21
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,442
To be up here,
away from the bustle, 

22
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,416
My legs like wings would spread!

23
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:14,661
Ahoy! What is that flower
in full bloom I see yonder?

24
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,629
Dost thou not recognize
the one and only!

25
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,326
So it is! The one and only!

26
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,393
With rose petal'd lips!

27
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,695
O friend, 

28
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:29,275
beat thee thy leather while
I go pick the flower. 

29
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,572
Hee haw!

30
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,092
My, my, there comes a fool,
rash and proud!

31
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,833
Never knew a fool
who knew his place!

32
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,633
Ho! A tongue most untamed!

33
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,075
Master of this house am I,
come to bait thee!

34
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,374
A gallows-hung scoundrel is
what I see. 

35
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,915
With an ill-fitting coat
to hide his sores!

36
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,782
Oh thorny Rose,
is thy Iris closed for me?

37
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:18,656
Open them, and see as
I walk the Master's gait. 

38
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,523
Oh, really!

39
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,476
Good Heavens!

40
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,113
Me thought it would be a
mere hop and a skip. 

41
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,286
But t'was longer than a runny
trip to the outhouse!

42
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,357
Master gait, master bait, 

43
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,155
either way strains the balls!

44
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,891
And now, a fornicating wench

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,000
running off upon being surprised. 

46
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,863
'Tis thy own form, saucy wench. 

47
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:19,646
I was expecting to see thee fall
and crack thy frame. 

48
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,713
But not bad!

49
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,924
Indeed, gifted are my two legs, 

50
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,552
but it is my third
that has true genius. 

51
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,819
And thou shall see it
this night!

52
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,393
Master wants to see you. 

53
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:15,041
Thy twin eggs, are they cracked yet,
or just in the crack?

54
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,441
Safely in the crack... 

55
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,144
Plugging my bunghole!

56
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,505
But now,
I must drain my bladder. 

57
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,353
I gotta pee before I continue!

58
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:31,312
Why, you dirty boor!

59
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:37,430
So then, let's try it
on for size!

60
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,025
Good idea! I shall oblige!

61
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,768
You promised us a meal!

62
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,802
We ain't squirrels!

63
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,510
Be thankful you
weren't thrown out!

64
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,617
Don't go, Gong-gil!

65
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,023
There are things you
shouldn't sell!

66
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,853
Let go. Move it!

67
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,000
What kind of life is that?

68
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,965
Mister fuckin' Righteous, eh!

69
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,879
Stop it!

70
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,186
Let go! Let go!

71
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,073
Gong-gil wants to go, 

72
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,132
so what's it to you?

73
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,841
Stop pimping off of Gong-gil. 

74
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,208
You piece of shit!

75
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,485
Want us to starve to death?

76
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,554
Go fuck yourself, 

77
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,852
and spare me your
high tone bullshit. 

78
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,628
I won't let you!

79
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,932
Hey, it's a dog-eat-dog
world out there. 

80
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,639
Just mind your own business. 

81
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,746
You... you are... 

82
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,385
Come on out. 

83
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,696
Somebody help me!

84
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,825
Get up. 

85
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,397
Let go. 

86
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:49,207
OK, fine.
Let's die together. 

87
00:10:55,588 --> 00:11:00,025
Get th-th-those bastards!
Now!

88
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,158
Go after them!

89
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,529
Go after them!

90
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,006
You're only making it worse. 

91
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,111
Let us go, please. 

92
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,753
Grab them. 

93
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,729
I beg you, let us go. 

94
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,071
You piece of shit.
Shut your trap. 

95
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,047
You shit!

96
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,619
Let go, you fuck!

97
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,627
I'll make sure you
never walk again. 

98
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,467
No!

99
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,809
Give me your hand. 

100
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,369
Will he be okay?

101
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,400
That dog deserves to die. 

102
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,170
Ouch... ow... 

103
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,210
Hey, watch where
you're going!

104
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,343
Hey, watch where
you're going!

105
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,317
Sprained your eyes, did ya?

106
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:29,484
Not my eyes, but my legs did
comin' o'er the hill. 

107
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,063
Hey, you sound like
Kang the Blind!

108
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:41,239
And you stink like
Bong the Blind!

109
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,034
Well! Hail fellow, well met!

110
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,139
Let's see, am I over here,
and you over there?

111
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,614
No, I'm over here and
you over there. 

112
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:02,161
No, I'm here and
you are there?

113
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,964
I am here. You are there. 

114
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,058
- Where? Where?
- Here. Here. 

115
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,178
Let's go to Seoul. 

116
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,885
And we'll put on a show
to end all shows!

117
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,974
Ouch, ow, ow... 

118
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,442
What's the matter?

119
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,706
I haven't eaten in years. 

120
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,973
My head is spinning

121
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,150
and can't see nothin' straight... 

122
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,221
I can't do this no more. 

123
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:46,021
- So it is.
- What do you say folks?

124
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,460
This cheeky fool says, 

125
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,327
No pay, no play. 

126
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,132
Shall we call it a day?

127
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,601
We're the best showmen in town, 

128
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,835
just workin' for a livin'. 

129
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,794
Thank you, sir,
thank you, thank you. 

130
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:07,209
You expect money for
some crap like that?

131
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,985
Do you folks want to see
some real skill?

132
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,352
Show us what you got. 

133
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,871
A cheap third-rate,
but still not

134
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,237
entirely without talent... 

135
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,179
A country bumpkin
with ambition, I see... 

136
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,479
I guess I could teach you
a thing or two. 

137
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,924
Watch and learn, eh?

138
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,286
Sure. 

139
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,408
Talent like that
will get you far. 

140
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,456
But, sorry to say,
not with this

141
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,515
sophisticated audience. 

142
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,120
Maybe you should retire. 

143
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,854
Don't you agree?

144
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:42,065
This time it will be
a pair-jump. 

145
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,004
Don't blink or you'll miss
the action, eh?

146
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,952
Howdy, I'm Six Dix. 

147
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,731
He's Seven Ravin' and
that one's Eight Pate. 

148
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,864
Say, where is the biggest
show spot in Seoul?

149
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:55,211
It's been a while
sincethere was one. 

150
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,575
Why is that?

151
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,977
Don't tell me you don't know?

152
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,755
The King's cleared out
half the city

153
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:08,055
to double his hunting ground. 

154
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,064
With only half
the people as before, 

155
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,498
there ain't gonna be no show. 

156
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:24,075
But there is
another kind of show... 

157
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:45,091
Gosh, I feel just awful!
I have 9!

158
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,634
Raking in money like

159
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,898
the King does virgins. 

160
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,467
Nah, I ain't that good yet. 

161
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,807
Now, let's see

162
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:05,447
if I am as lucky as
that tramp Nok-su. 

163
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,777
Who's Nok-su?

164
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,586
Nok-su the Whore?

165
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,130
The bitch has the King
living inside her skirt. 

166
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:23,534
Before, she had every rich man
living inside her skirt. 

167
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,066
Every dime I ever won
went right into

168
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,796
her bearded pouch. 

169
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,201
Here comes that
awful feelin' again!

170
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,245
I have 8!

171
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,929
So where is my cut?

172
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,692
Let's do this again tomorrow. 

173
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,201
It's only the first game,
so, Captain... 

174
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,273
Mind if I call you 'Captain'?

175
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,342
So, just like today, you... 

176
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,885
If I help you make
more money tomorrow... 

177
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,016
Will you do as I say?

178
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,861
Captain, don't start
giving orders. 

179
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:29,999
So, what's your plan?

180
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,434
We mock the King. 

181
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,341
The King?

182
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,309
Did you not hear?

183
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,871
In front of a cunt,
every man kneels. 

184
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,481
Is the King any better than
the rest of us?

185
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:51,715
The King's bed, that's where
the big money is. 

186
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,325
Just a minute. 

187
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:13,339
I ain't playing no eunuch!
I got balls!

188
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,981
This is bullshit.
Forget it, I'm out. 

189
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,973
- Oh, man!
- Come on!

190
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,984
It's better than starving,
I suppose. 

191
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,779
Go!

192
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,656
Hurry up!

193
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,895
"None"

194
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,144
Eunuch Kim, 

195
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,519
what haste causes thee
to jingle thy bells so?

196
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,918
Hee haw!

197
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,714
Jingle, shingle!
Sure, if I had any!

198
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,484
I'd jingle-jangle all the way!

199
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,531
That's odd, 

200
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,625
I'm sure I heard jingles. 

201
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,169
Were they my bells, then?

202
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,864
Wasn't it?

203
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,441
Nok-su, Royal Consort

204
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,453
- Isn't she the King's Consort?
- Sure is. 

205
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,090
What on earth is that woman doing!

206
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,858
People say, 

207
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:38,263
she a Lady now but she still
shits like a horse. 

208
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:43,326
So then the rumors were
true after all!

209
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,955
That feels good!

210
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,132
We hit the jackpot today!

211
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,945
Bring it on!
Bring everything!

212
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,681
Captain, let's do
the show everyday. 

213
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,549
No, 3 times a day!

214
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,914
And rake it in!

215
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,652
How about a drink, fellah?

216
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,791
I swear, I never saw
a fellah so shy. 

217
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,762
But man, he sure knows how to
gyrate them hips!

218
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:46,531
Captain, we should have done
this earlier!

219
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,801
Someone grabbed my balls
thinking I really had none. 

220
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,598
It scared the shit out of me!

221
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,032
I saw, I saw!

222
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,906
To the Captain!

223
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:04,509
I knew you'd over do it. 

224
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,982
Just say 'no' next time. 

225
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,651
Feel good?

226
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,485
Yeah. 

227
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,993
What feels so good?

228
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,925
It's all good. 

229
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,408
My belly!

230
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,976
Her water broke!

231
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,217
Adulterer

232
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,412
There it is!
I see the baby!

233
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,157
Come on, push!

234
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,927
Let's have a look. 

235
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:01,002
He has my forehead
and my big nose too. 

236
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,678
This calls for a celebration!

237
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,612
Hee haw!

238
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,311
Thank you very much!

239
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,257
Step back. 

240
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,498
Take these wretches
to jail at once. 

241
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,709
What, did you expect a prize
for mocking the King?

242
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,581
Go see for yourself. 

243
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,883
Is it a crime to show
what everyone

244
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,427
already jokes about?

245
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,792
How disrespectful!

246
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:03,992
If it's about the King's
"equipment"... 

247
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,094
he is the King after all. 

248
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,807
So we thought it ought
to be King-size. 

249
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,406
Watch your tongue!

250
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,474
Flog these fools!

251
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,126
Wait!

252
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,029
We can't die like this!

253
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,264
Let us show it to the King. 

254
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,604
What? Keep flogging!

255
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,162
Hold it!

256
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:51,076
What did you say?

257
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,180
If the King likes it,
then we're innocent. 

258
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,351
We will make the King laugh. 

259
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:04,017
But if he does not... 

260
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,799
your heads will roll!

261
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,488
Idiots that we are!
We messed with the King!

262
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:10,929
I got shit for brains,
that's what!

263
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:16,162
What insane King would
find this amusing?

264
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,469
In any case,
it's a 'do or die'. 

265
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,238
So we're gonna die!

266
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,933
Like dogs!

267
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,898
I'd rather be flogged. 

268
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:35,685
The special event today... 

269
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,252
has been arranged for
His Majesty's pleasure. 

270
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,989
Just relax and do
what we always do. 

271
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:50,791
May it please you all. 

272
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:19,158
June 1st, 1504

273
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,196
As we jest,
let ye mirth issue unimpeded. 

274
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,760
So we may live yet another day. 

275
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,970
Go. 

276
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,994
Eunuch... Kim... 

277
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:57,430
What haste...
causes thee to jangle thy bells so?

278
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,599
What the?

279
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,141
Jingling my... balls?

280
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,446
I... heard... 

281
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,006
M, m, my... balls?

282
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,048
But I... ain't got none. 

283
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,756
Hee... haw!

284
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,709
Hee haw!

285
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,417
None

286
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:53,413
Isn't that... the King's Consort?

287
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,126
Sure, why... not?

288
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:02,830
Rumor has it that the tramp... 

289
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,834
The wench... 

290
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,637
I mean, the Lady!

291
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,101
Ah! That feels good!

292
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:09,529
Come on, push!

293
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,567
Captain, we're doomed!

294
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,434
We're dead now!

295
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,203
Let's have a look. 

296
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:54,375
He has my forehead
and my big nose too. 

297
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,977
Let me have a look at you. 

298
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:06,380
Ho, ho, my son,
my boy, my son. 

299
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:11,927
Come from Heaven or

300
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:16,462
from the silent Earth?

301
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:26,603
My pride, my boy, my son. 

302
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,484
So thou thinkest he's thy issue?

303
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:48,891
What everyone knows,
thou dost not. 

304
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:58,064
Then of whose loin is he?

305
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,108
One of the eunuchs is
still half a man. 

306
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,214
And he did his nightly rounds. 

307
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,251
Who is he? Spit it out!

308
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,315
Spit with an empty mouth?

309
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,884
You wily wench!

310
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,095
Fine. I shall fill it!

311
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:26,526
The one above or the one below?

312
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,129
The one above. 

313
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,769
With teeth and tongue!

314
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:22,425
Hear this!
I shall suffer these clowns

315
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,321
to entertain me
from time to time. 

316
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,157
Prepare their quarters
within the palace. 

317
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,840
Dig in. 

318
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,844
But Captain, 

319
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,310
why does the King want to
keep us here?

320
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,020
Maybe to raise our status?

321
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,228
We're minstrels,
what does our status matter?

322
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,797
A full tummy,
that's what counts. 

323
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,162
Damn right. 

324
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,165
I thought we'd never eat!

325
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,374
Shit!
Who is gonna eat this now?

326
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,811
It's still food,
it won't kill you. 

327
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:47,869
It's good. 

328
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,917
- Come on now, work with me!
- Hold me tighter!

329
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,853
The one above
or the one below?

330
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,445
The one above. 

331
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,589
I'm coming! I'm coming!

332
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,685
- Unload, my Lord!
- I am spent!

333
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,263
You know,
the one who played me... 

334
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,737
You stared at him so intensely, 

335
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,171
as if to drill
a hole in his face. 

336
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,702
A hole?

337
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,410
But is he really a man?

338
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,809
His skin is so fair. 

339
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:32,119
Not even eunuchs have
it so fine. 

340
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:41,165
It is not advisable,
Your Majesty. 

341
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,696
Every time,
it's always "no, no, no. "

342
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,232
So what is allowed then?

343
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,599
Why does Your Majesty
wish their presence here?

344
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,145
What is so wrong with

345
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,547
keeping them here?

346
00:41:56,548 --> 00:42:00,210
According to the edict issued by
the previous King... 

347
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,581
A show must suit the occasion
that calls for one. 

348
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:09,418
The law covers such
trivial matters as well?

349
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,251
It does, Your Majesty. 

350
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:16,200
If Your Majesty insists
on keeping them here... 

351
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,636
There will be protest
upon protest. 

352
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,456
This cannot be allowed,
Your Majesty. 

353
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:43,085
May Your Majesty reconsider. 

354
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,865
Cheo-seon!
Am I King or not?

355
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,263
Am I still King when my dead father
still rules, huh?

356
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,036
Your Majesty, calm yourself. 

357
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,973
The prudent hunter treads
silently to capture the prey. 

358
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,149
So, the ministers want us out?

359
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,825
But the King told us to stay. 

360
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,222
Wasn't that by a Royal order?

361
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,696
They see you as vermin, 

362
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:32,199
to be gotten rid of
as soon as possible. 

363
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,614
Had I known that the King was

364
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,343
so powerless... 

365
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,517
I would not have bothered
to mock him!

366
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,589
So he laughed once, and now

367
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,956
you think you own the world. 

368
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,697
Tell him,
thanks for the snack. 

369
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,935
You had the guts
to lampoon the King. 

370
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,131
So why not the ministers?

371
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:15,240
So we're allowed to
satirize them too?

372
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:26,860
Then help me set up an audition
for more minstrels. 

373
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,925
Clothes define the man!

374
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,327
Ladies! Get in line!

375
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:39,610
Are we to make fun
of the ministers

376
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,305
or make them laugh?

377
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,705
Both. 

378
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,343
We fooled with the King
and he laughed, right?

379
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,853
So if we fool with the ministers,
they'll laugh too. 

380
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,453
I see. 

381
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,251
But Captain, those ministers are
just dying to kick us out. 

382
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,928
What if we get into
trouble later?

383
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:05,335
So we need to find
the best minstrels

384
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:08,706
and put on a show
to blow them away. 

385
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,196
Right, Captain?

386
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,606
Are you done?

387
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:24,146
Wow, your writing looks
exactly like Gong-gil's!

388
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:25,756
Yeah!

389
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:30,591
I learned to write by
imitating his style, that's why. 

390
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,598
Minstrels Audition

391
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,895
You're the man when
it comes to imitating!

392
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,173
Copy this and go paste them

393
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,198
all over town. 

394
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,206
Now copy it exactly. 

395
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,819
What?

396
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,026
What's so funny?

397
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,572
It's just that... 

398
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:22,404
minstrels don't know how to read!

399
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,348
Captain, trust me on this. 

400
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,591
Minstrels Audition
at the Royal Palace

401
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:39,051
Come on in, fellahs. 

402
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,094
What's going on?

403
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,009
Hee haw!

404
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,977
Over the lovely... 

405
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,713
Here, my love!

406
00:47:54,538 --> 00:48:00,344
Next up is Choi from Pyong-yang!

407
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:03,313
Break a leg!

408
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,542
Hee haw!

409
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,343
Yessiree!

410
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,820
Sir, it is I. 

411
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,758
Do I know thee?

412
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,899
I heard word about a vacant post. 

413
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,635
'Tis for thee. 

414
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,844
It's a turtle of gold. 

415
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,947
Put it away!

416
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,920
As I cannot... 

417
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:46,323
'Tis nothing, I swear. 

418
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:50,726
I say, I cannot accept!

419
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,828
'Tis but a piss-colored metal!

420
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,891
Is thy heart immovable?

421
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,103
Indeed, as a mountain!

422
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,971
Truly? Verily not?

423
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,405
May Heaven fall asunder! No!

424
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,940
You're a tough nut to crack!

425
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,174
Fine, then!

426
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:20,180
Hey, your technique is
too crude!

427
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:27,995
I must return home
but I am broke. 

428
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,962
So, take it for a nickel. 

429
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,101
In that case... 

430
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,901
I'll buy two. 

431
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,358
Sir, about my husband... 

432
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,802
Madam, not in this manner. 

433
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,478
It's all I have, sir. 

434
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:16,446
Please, no, no... 

435
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,507
This will bring only trouble. 

436
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:31,423
Sir, it's a token of my esteem. 

437
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,692
What dost thou take me for?

438
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:42,198
Such firmness!
Just as I've been told. 

439
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,169
Be gentle, madam!

440
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,776
Such a precious gift!

441
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,448
Let my hands speak for me. 

442
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,970
As a token of my... 

443
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,075
Keep going. 

444
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,585
Let me have a look. 

445
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,161
I dislike odd-shaped things. 

446
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,100
But something like this might do. 

447
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,342
Like this?

448
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,689
You shall have it!

449
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,395
You just don't get it,
do you!

450
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,198
Look. 

451
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,634
Like this. 

452
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,811
Like this. 

453
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:44,023
I've got it! Here!

454
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,521
Exactly. 

455
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,925
Here we go!

456
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,628
Hee haw!

457
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,995
To you, my lords!

458
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,960
Lighten your hearts and enjoy!

459
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,776
What's the matter?

460
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,442
A pang of conscience, perhaps?

461
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,280
Most certainly. 

462
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:05,152
So who is it?

463
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:08,560
Is it you?

464
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:13,601
I hear song and dance
never stops at your house. 

465
00:54:13,602 --> 00:54:16,331
That is not so, Your Majesty!

466
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:20,199
Then you perhaps?

467
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:23,344
A retinue of over 100 virgins

468
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:26,211
on your trip to Pyongyang?

469
00:54:26,547 --> 00:54:29,380
Never, Your Majesty!

470
00:54:30,218 --> 00:54:33,619
So it's you then?

471
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,090
How now!

472
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:41,858
Spill the cup given
by the King?

473
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,133
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

474
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:47,328
Forgive you for what?

475
00:54:47,668 --> 00:54:51,104
Even your sentry
demands bribes, I hear. 

476
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:54,542
So, my wine is not good
enough for you?

477
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:56,066
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

478
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:59,576
I grew up
in poverty as a child... 

479
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:02,510
So you sold titles for money?

480
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,685
So was I a fool to give
you one for free?

481
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,416
Share thy profit,
you ungrateful cur!

482
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:18,890
Dismiss him from the Ministry, 

483
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,397
and seize all his property. 

484
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:22,866
And... 

485
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:26,535
Cut off all his fingers, 

486
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:31,337
and you ministers shall
see them at hand. 

487
00:55:42,857 --> 00:55:44,722
what is your name?

488
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:53,056
I am Gong-gil, Your Majesty. 

489
00:55:58,706 --> 00:56:01,402
Comedy in a bloodbath!
Nice going!

490
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,275
I hope we don't get hurt
in the end!

491
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:08,115
The King was amused,
so what's the worry?

492
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:12,017
Yeah, but he can be so cruel!

493
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:14,121
It makes me nervous!

494
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,419
wrap it up and go to bed. 

495
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,529
why did the King call
for Gong-gil?

496
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:28,394
who knows?
what's taking so long?

497
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:37,544
Never look at his face. 

498
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:42,277
Do not ask any questions. 

499
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,252
And before you answer,
always say... 

500
00:56:47,188 --> 00:56:50,783
If it pleases Your Majesty... 

501
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:54,829
And if he praises you, say, 

502
00:56:54,830 --> 00:57:00,233
By Your Majesty's grace. 

503
00:57:37,405 --> 00:57:38,804
Let's play. 

504
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,267
If it pleases Your Majesty... 

505
00:57:46,314 --> 00:57:47,747
Sir?

506
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:52,609
I said, let's have some fun. 

507
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:55,856
If it graces by Your Majesty... 

508
00:57:55,857 --> 00:57:59,792
That bastard of a minister
spoiled the fun, didn't he. 

509
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:04,020
So, just you and me,
let's play. 

510
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:41,989
Gong-gil's back!
Gong-gil! Come here. 

511
00:59:42,963 --> 00:59:45,295
what did the King want?

512
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:47,900
what did you do?

513
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:50,794
we played with puppets. 

514
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:53,934
- Puppets?
- He enjoyed it. 

515
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:56,435
And that's all?

516
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:03,951
He poured me some wine. 

517
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:07,682
He did? And what else?

518
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:57,760
Come to mama.
Poor baby's hungry. 

519
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,473
Baby wants mama's milk.
Come on. 

520
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,538
Don't want milk?

521
01:01:07,314 --> 01:01:09,646
Then some wine, baby?

522
01:01:57,064 --> 01:01:59,999
Did you all view
Yun's fingers?

523
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:05,094
Don't tell me you really did!

524
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:07,942
Your Majesty, for every crime

525
01:02:07,943 --> 01:02:10,604
there is a fitting punishment. 

526
01:02:11,078 --> 01:02:13,914
No doubt Yun deserves to be

527
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:15,882
punished for corruption. 

528
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:20,287
But allowing the minstrels to mock
the dignity of ministers... 

529
01:02:20,288 --> 01:02:24,087
will only undermine
the authority of the government. 

530
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:27,588
They're jesters, so they jest. 

531
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:33,400
But if Your Majesty continues
to dance to their tune... 

532
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,833
Their tune?

533
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:40,563
It is you who would seek to
call the tune!

534
01:02:40,808 --> 01:02:42,876
You speak only to nag me

535
01:02:42,877 --> 01:02:44,545
about the damn law!

536
01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:48,716
Dismiss this nagging
fool immediately!

537
01:02:48,717 --> 01:02:53,020
Your Majesty, given his
loyalty to the previous King... 

538
01:02:53,021 --> 01:02:54,855
Surely he deserves some mercy. 

539
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:58,325
Loyal to my father?

540
01:02:58,326 --> 01:03:00,259
Yes, but then
why not to me as well?

541
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:04,832
The previous King was like

542
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:08,962
a wise father to the people. 

543
01:03:10,804 --> 01:03:13,329
Your Majesty!

544
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:15,405
Your Majesty!

545
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,205
Sully my sight nevermore!

546
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:27,847
His Majesty!

547
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,057
You play too!

548
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,528
Go on!

549
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:48,065
Do it!

550
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,751
Gong-gil!

551
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:35,446
where is my Gong-gil?

552
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:55,840
Sit over there. 

553
01:04:56,276 --> 01:04:57,144
But, Your Majesty... 

554
01:04:57,145 --> 01:05:00,170
I insist. Sit. 

555
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,710
Now look at this. 

556
01:05:12,793 --> 01:05:15,990
Father, I long to see mother!

557
01:05:16,764 --> 01:05:20,325
Did I not tell thee
to forget her?

558
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:23,570
Sir, I beg of thee,
just this once... 

559
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:24,901
weak in will, 

560
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,302
thou art fit to become
but a changeling!

561
01:05:30,577 --> 01:05:35,378
Father! I beg thee!

562
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:03,167
And follow this book
for whose pleasure?

563
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,778
You serve the King,
do you not?

564
01:06:20,494 --> 01:06:26,660
But why does the King call
for Gong-gil so often?

565
01:06:27,034 --> 01:06:31,368
His Majesty calls
whom he pleases. 

566
01:06:31,605 --> 01:06:34,096
It concerns you not. 

567
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,017
we're leaving this place. 

568
01:08:04,364 --> 01:08:06,355
Cheo-seon wants us to do this. 

569
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,166
Shit, what are we now, puppets?

570
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:23,881
we should have left sooner. 

571
01:08:29,222 --> 01:08:32,350
Fine, so we'll leave. 

572
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:35,161
But... 

573
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,892
After we do this. 

574
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:43,165
I really want to. 

575
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:47,968
we cannot do this anywhere else. 

576
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,224
There's the King's grandmother. 

577
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:11,498
And the previous King's consorts. 

578
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:12,590
Really!

579
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:14,130
Let's get ready. 

580
01:09:15,535 --> 01:09:18,038
Pay attention and
stick to your parts. 

581
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:19,300
Yeah, yeah. 

582
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:23,238
Just this once,
then we leave. 

583
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:39,886
If tonight the King... 

584
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:44,787
Should call me to his bed... 

585
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:51,232
'Tis already the 300th night... 

586
01:09:51,571 --> 01:09:57,203
Of my forlorn Ioneliness. 

587
01:09:58,645 --> 01:10:00,169
Ouch!

588
01:10:07,354 --> 01:10:10,812
My Lord, this night... 

589
01:10:11,058 --> 01:10:13,993
Let me serve thee. 

590
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:26,967
Another night, another nought. 

591
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:31,209
Passion swells. 

592
01:10:32,779 --> 01:10:41,380
So I kept this
awI pressed to my arm. 

593
01:10:50,464 --> 01:10:53,297
Her Majesty!

594
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:56,967
This is most unfair!

595
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:00,728
You fools!

596
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:03,204
whisper, whisper. 

597
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,139
She this, she that. 

598
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:11,541
Stop mumbling and speak!

599
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:19,058
Surely that is not us
that those jesters mock?

600
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:23,787
They would not dare
with the Queen mum watching. 

601
01:11:33,607 --> 01:11:35,404
Oh, Mother!

602
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,086
No! Desist! I beg thee. 

603
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:32,796
Must you demand the death
of the woman I love?

604
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,928
Infinite is her deviousness. 

605
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:40,296
She has my son's
soul bewitched. 

606
01:12:41,074 --> 01:12:43,235
Drink this bitter potion. 

607
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,451
Unbounded is the King's love... 

608
01:12:56,523 --> 01:12:59,424
But many are those who want it. 

609
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,862
He giveth me this
black liquid of love, 

610
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:08,095
how can I refuse?

611
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,935
My son. 

612
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:19,511
Dwell long in
the sweetness of life... 

613
01:13:22,415 --> 01:13:26,351
And bury me by the road

614
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,648
the King travels on. 

615
01:13:34,794 --> 01:13:36,193
My son!

616
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:57,883
Mother!

617
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,668
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

618
01:14:33,286 --> 01:14:35,584
what is all this?

619
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:38,252
My mother they murdered!

620
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,859
Art thou blind?

621
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,863
Nonsense! She was a woman
of treachery and... 

622
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:47,067
Silence!
Do not kill my mother twice!

623
01:14:47,068 --> 01:14:48,625
No!

624
01:14:49,536 --> 01:14:50,704
Mercy! Mercy!

625
01:14:50,705 --> 01:14:51,864
Your Majesty. 

626
01:14:52,839 --> 01:14:54,500
Enough!

627
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,910
Touch me not!

628
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:58,241
No!

629
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:48,325
what the hell is going on?

630
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:51,898
Every time we do a show, 

631
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,366
people end up dead!

632
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:57,234
Thanks to that loose
cannon of a King!

633
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:00,766
Gong-gil!

634
01:16:01,508 --> 01:16:05,103
Have you heard anything?

635
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,738
Pack your things. 

636
01:16:08,114 --> 01:16:09,103
Eh?

637
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:13,618
- we're leaving this place.
- Leave?

638
01:16:14,587 --> 01:16:16,521
I told the old man
we're leaving. 

639
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:21,222
Allow me to leave,
Your Majesty. 

640
01:16:22,562 --> 01:16:27,431
Take this, although compared to
what you've given me, 

641
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:29,202
it is nothing. 

642
01:16:29,203 --> 01:16:30,430
Your Majesty!

643
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:34,029
Grant me to leave this place. 

644
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:41,012
Very nice!

645
01:16:42,148 --> 01:16:45,140
An official's robe
just so becomes you. 

646
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:50,953
The silk looks stunning
with your fair skin!

647
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:53,354
But still, 

648
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:57,986
for all the hard work he did
exposing all your enemies... 

649
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:00,795
A rather shabby gift,
isn't it?

650
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,800
Leave us. 

651
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:07,364
what if he's really a girl?

652
01:17:08,341 --> 01:17:11,777
His voice, his gestures... 

653
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,514
Not even eunuchs can have
the same finesse. 

654
01:17:14,515 --> 01:17:15,811
Enough!

655
01:17:16,316 --> 01:17:19,979
Are you not curious?
Let's strip him. 

656
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:23,122
Go on! Be a man
and show it to me!

657
01:17:23,123 --> 01:17:23,957
Enough, I say!

658
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:25,322
A little shy, are we?

659
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:29,289
Then we will all strip.
How's that?

660
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:33,330
You vile clown!

661
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:34,727
You just wait!

662
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:38,701
My Lady! Please!

663
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:41,735
You filthy clown! Let go!

664
01:17:41,975 --> 01:17:43,465
How dare you?

665
01:17:43,676 --> 01:17:46,546
Let go!

666
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:49,849
How could you do this to me!

667
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,340
- Open this door!
- Let go!

668
01:18:21,548 --> 01:18:23,448
Let me go. 

669
01:18:30,757 --> 01:18:37,526
You never had any intention of
ever leaving, did you?

670
01:18:40,533 --> 01:18:42,000
That's not true. 

671
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,128
So what's this then?

672
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,301
Might as well fuck
the richest guy in town, 

673
01:18:49,576 --> 01:18:51,544
is that it?

674
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:57,607
Don't talk to me that way. 

675
01:19:15,735 --> 01:19:22,334
Hear this. I have conferred
a rank upon Gong-gil. 

676
01:19:23,576 --> 01:19:26,443
Arrange a celebration
in his honor. 

677
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:30,249
we are still in mourning
over the deceased Queen, 

678
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,649
Your Majesty. 

679
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,619
But I have conferred a rank. 

680
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:42,289
So a celebration is in order,
is it not?

681
01:19:44,397 --> 01:19:47,696
Perhaps a hunt could
please Your Majesty. 

682
01:19:49,502 --> 01:19:53,962
Party 'No', but hunting 'Yes'?

683
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,834
Not to kill, but only for

684
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,978
the pleasure of the chase. 

685
01:20:02,582 --> 01:20:03,983
First it's eunuchs, 

686
01:20:03,984 --> 01:20:07,316
then servant girls,
and now this!

687
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,356
what's with the chicken mask?

688
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:14,793
Gong-gil's been what?
Entitled?

689
01:20:14,994 --> 01:20:16,696
And so we must wear

690
01:20:16,697 --> 01:20:18,789
these ridiculous things?

691
01:20:19,599 --> 01:20:25,003
Shut up!
Just do as you're told. 

692
01:20:25,271 --> 01:20:26,465
Aye, aye. 

693
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:50,029
Okay, we're on. 

694
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:52,293
Everybody disperse, quickly!

695
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,764
- where to?
- That way. 

696
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,561
which way? which way?

697
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,669
where is the Captain?

698
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:30,870
I don't know. 

699
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:33,065
- And Gong-gil?
- No idea. 

700
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:35,097
This is bullshit!

701
01:21:49,722 --> 01:21:50,848
It's Gong-gil!

702
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,793
Gong-gil! Over here!

703
01:22:09,742 --> 01:22:12,006
Gong-gil, where's the Captain?

704
01:22:12,478 --> 01:22:15,379
Man, this sucks. 

705
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:18,712
what's this?

706
01:22:19,485 --> 01:22:21,077
Run!

707
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:37,003
Gong-gil!
Gong-gil is in danger!

708
01:22:37,004 --> 01:22:38,834
Come on! Let's go!

709
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:56,348
Shoot!

710
01:23:57,216 --> 01:23:58,376
Shoot!

711
01:24:02,255 --> 01:24:03,449
Gong-gil!

712
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,258
Oh, no!

713
01:24:30,616 --> 01:24:32,641
So, I see. 

714
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:36,043
we're not hunting quails,
are we?

715
01:24:36,455 --> 01:24:41,119
By selfless sacrifice,
ministers have built this kingdom. 

716
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,759
Yet you invite gutter rats
to mock us?

717
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:50,162
when my father sentenced
my mother to death... 

718
01:24:51,871 --> 01:24:55,307
You were the one who
delivered the poison!

719
01:24:56,475 --> 01:25:00,571
Her blood is on your hands!

720
01:25:06,585 --> 01:25:12,217
Heaven has seen the evils
of your tyranny. 

721
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:20,828
And will punish you for it. 

722
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:35,671
we should have left... 

723
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,749
when we had the chance!

724
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:49,754
- Six Dix! Don't go!
- No! No!

725
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:51,315
Six Dix!

726
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,693
Come back!

727
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:17,444
By selfless sacrifice, 

728
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:22,278
ministers have built
this kingdom. 

729
01:27:23,422 --> 01:27:28,883
Yet you invite gutter rats
to mock us?

730
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,862
Now it's your turn. 

731
01:27:34,266 --> 01:27:35,995
Take this. Take it. 

732
01:27:38,037 --> 01:27:39,868
Now, shoot me!

733
01:27:41,474 --> 01:27:43,876
No, shoot her instead. 

734
01:27:43,877 --> 01:27:47,744
Here is a wench who stops
at no evil! Shoot!

735
01:27:52,384 --> 01:27:53,908
Shoot!

736
01:27:58,557 --> 01:28:00,149
Shoot!

737
01:28:16,142 --> 01:28:17,541
Shoot, I say!

738
01:28:31,924 --> 01:28:38,955
Heaven has seen the evils
of your tyranny. 

739
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:05,218
My Lady, here is the flyer, 

740
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:07,459
written by Gong-gil's hand. 

741
01:29:13,465 --> 01:29:14,932
Read it out loud!

742
01:29:19,905 --> 01:29:23,397
In depravity upon depravity,
the King... 

743
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:26,005
what's this about?

744
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,372
They say these flyers are
pasted all over Seoul!

745
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:31,714
Then this was written by?

746
01:29:31,917 --> 01:29:33,544
You numbskull!

747
01:29:34,553 --> 01:29:37,989
Now you see why
I wanted a copy of this?

748
01:30:23,802 --> 01:30:25,702
want to know who wrote this?

749
01:30:31,577 --> 01:30:32,942
Look at it. 

750
01:30:37,783 --> 01:30:39,182
Haven't you heard?

751
01:30:39,652 --> 01:30:42,721
There are flyers up
criticizing the King. 

752
01:30:42,722 --> 01:30:44,882
And not just the King either. 

753
01:30:45,224 --> 01:30:49,217
we're mentioned too,
and not in a nice way!

754
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:51,363
we too could end up dead. 

755
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:53,430
Let's go. 

756
01:31:05,944 --> 01:31:07,104
Don't go. 

757
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:08,678
Let's go, Captain!

758
01:31:34,273 --> 01:31:36,867
No! Don't go!

759
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:39,007
You've gone mad!

760
01:32:06,905 --> 01:32:10,976
No! No! No!

761
01:32:10,977 --> 01:32:12,344
- Let go!
- Don't go!

762
01:32:12,345 --> 01:32:13,846
Let go of me!

763
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:18,306
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Let go!

764
01:32:36,034 --> 01:32:37,365
write this. 

765
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:44,332
In depravity upon depravity,
the King... 

766
01:32:46,812 --> 01:32:48,074
My Lady!

767
01:32:48,514 --> 01:32:50,004
Keep writing!

768
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:55,714
In depravity upon depravity,
the King... 

769
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:01,152
Keep writing, I say!

770
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,766
with dancing girls
on his lap, 

771
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:10,035
and clowns by his side... 

772
01:33:10,036 --> 01:33:12,526
The King indulges
in the most vulgar... 

773
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,408
It's identical!

774
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:30,721
Arrest him!

775
01:33:36,395 --> 01:33:41,332
Your Majesty, I know nothing
about this. My Lord!

776
01:33:42,134 --> 01:33:43,692
But why?

777
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,873
You have the wrong man. 

778
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:03,281
I wrote it. He's innocent. 

779
01:34:03,989 --> 01:34:07,652
The audacity of it has
my signature all over it. 

780
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:12,118
After all, it was by audacity
that I got in the palace. 

781
01:34:12,264 --> 01:34:14,032
You're making this up!

782
01:34:14,033 --> 01:34:16,330
well, well. 

783
01:34:18,437 --> 01:34:23,898
A whore and her
tongue's work is never done. 

784
01:34:24,276 --> 01:34:25,675
How dare you!

785
01:34:35,654 --> 01:34:37,246
Look closely. 

786
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,770
He's lying!

787
01:34:58,076 --> 01:35:00,044
why would he confess
so readily?

788
01:35:06,485 --> 01:35:08,476
He learned to write from me. 

789
01:35:09,555 --> 01:35:11,853
He imitated my style. 

790
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:14,421
That's why it looks the same. 

791
01:35:14,826 --> 01:35:17,454
But he has no guts
to write such a thing. 

792
01:35:19,231 --> 01:35:21,028
These words are mine. 

793
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:23,525
He is the King's beloved. 

794
01:35:23,869 --> 01:35:26,337
why would he do such a thing?

795
01:35:27,773 --> 01:35:29,434
As soon as day breaks... 

796
01:35:29,775 --> 01:35:31,470
Behead him. 

797
01:35:37,716 --> 01:35:41,174
In bringing the minstrels
into the palace... 

798
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:45,390
I wanted them to show
Your Majesty... 

799
01:35:45,391 --> 01:35:49,986
The corruption
plaguing your court. 

800
01:35:51,463 --> 01:35:52,896
And?

801
01:35:53,398 --> 01:35:58,537
But in your lust for a boy,
you've become... 

802
01:35:58,538 --> 01:36:00,368
Do you wish to die?

803
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:03,337
Perhaps your time has come. 

804
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:12,281
Death, I do not fear. 

805
01:36:14,653 --> 01:36:18,783
But to see the previous King... 

806
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:20,655
Get out!

807
01:36:21,259 --> 01:36:23,420
And appear never again!

808
01:36:40,012 --> 01:36:41,707
My Lord! Spare him!

809
01:36:44,683 --> 01:36:47,015
Spare him! My Lord!

810
01:36:50,822 --> 01:36:53,655
Spare him! I beg you!

811
01:37:33,999 --> 01:37:38,629
You're free to go.
Your work is done. 

812
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,938
That's not by a Royal order,
is it?

813
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:48,241
Forget Gong-gil. 

814
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:10,065
From up here, even the palace

815
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:13,798
looks no better than a hovel!

816
01:38:16,775 --> 01:38:20,108
In a world full of scoundrels,
only here... 

817
01:38:20,679 --> 01:38:24,115
Did I meet the nastiest
of them all. 

818
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:28,075
Ho! And the foul things
he would do!

819
01:38:28,754 --> 01:38:33,191
will you hear this tale then?

820
01:38:36,628 --> 01:38:41,531
As the gods kill us
for their sport, so would he. 

821
01:38:43,602 --> 01:38:46,696
He killed more souls than... 

822
01:38:47,105 --> 01:38:49,630
There are tiles on these roofs. 

823
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:52,606
His lust insatiable... 

824
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:57,504
Even 2,000 virgins were
not enough. 

825
01:38:57,916 --> 01:39:00,248
why, his pecker was this big. 

826
01:39:00,919 --> 01:39:04,047
No, this big!

827
01:39:04,823 --> 01:39:09,021
with it he skewered clam
after virgin clam. 

828
01:39:10,095 --> 01:39:14,964
And when he got tired
of girls... 

829
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:20,766
He wasted no time
mounting a boy. 

830
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:25,176
whoever pleased
his one-eyed snake... 

831
01:39:25,977 --> 01:39:30,073
was given delicacies
and silk robes. 

832
01:39:30,515 --> 01:39:33,507
And a title to boot!

833
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:45,658
My Lord! My Lord!

834
01:39:57,209 --> 01:40:00,007
Please, no! My Lord!
Spare him!

835
01:40:34,846 --> 01:40:37,440
No! Your Majesty!

836
01:40:38,316 --> 01:40:43,413
Pollute not thy hands
with the blood of the vulgar!

837
01:40:46,358 --> 01:40:47,586
well said. 

838
01:40:50,996 --> 01:40:52,725
You do it then. 

839
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:57,363
Kill me instead. 

840
01:40:58,703 --> 01:41:00,000
Kill me!

841
01:41:00,505 --> 01:41:05,033
I've nothing more to lose,
so strike!

842
01:41:06,077 --> 01:41:07,635
Nothing to lose?

843
01:41:15,854 --> 01:41:17,754
Hear my command!

844
01:41:19,124 --> 01:41:21,752
Sear his eyes with iron!

845
01:41:27,532 --> 01:41:36,804
No, no, no, no, no, no!

846
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,950
The date has been fixed. 

847
01:41:55,694 --> 01:41:58,788
You have served 3 Kings. 

848
01:42:03,068 --> 01:42:08,165
Join us in serving
the 4th King. 

849
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,534
It is not men... 

850
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:18,137
But Heaven that mandates Kings. 

851
01:42:18,483 --> 01:42:21,850
Then let us obey the
will of Heaven. 

852
01:42:22,187 --> 01:42:26,453
Has Heaven not abandoned
this King?

853
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:35,423
How could I know... 

854
01:42:37,002 --> 01:42:41,462
what Heaven wills?

855
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:50,709
So whose idea was it to take
in the minstrels?

856
01:42:55,754 --> 01:43:03,661
Bringing in some clowns
hardly requires an idea. 

857
01:43:14,672 --> 01:43:18,699
Jesters jest. 

858
01:43:20,145 --> 01:43:22,807
we laugh, and then it's over. 

859
01:43:43,368 --> 01:43:44,562
Hey you!

860
01:43:46,771 --> 01:43:49,365
Shall I tell you a story?

861
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:54,244
when I worked as a servant
in my youth... 

862
01:43:56,281 --> 01:44:01,719
One day, the madam's ring
went missing. 

863
01:44:02,954 --> 01:44:08,859
The master was furious
with us servants. 

864
01:44:09,894 --> 01:44:12,954
But everybody kept mum. 

865
01:44:13,965 --> 01:44:19,369
It was unbearably
cold that day. 

866
01:44:20,305 --> 01:44:25,607
So I said, "I did it". 

867
01:44:26,611 --> 01:44:29,307
So where's the ring? He says. 

868
01:44:30,048 --> 01:44:36,078
So I said, "I swallowed it". 

869
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:41,755
Right then,
a club comes a-flying. 

870
01:44:42,393 --> 01:44:47,831
And whacks me right
in the mouth!

871
01:44:50,135 --> 01:44:55,300
Man, did it sting!
Like it was on fire. 

872
01:44:57,342 --> 01:45:02,780
Just like my eyes right now. 

873
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:10,848
Had I been hit
in my eye instead... 

874
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:17,294
Maybe my mouth
would suffer today?

875
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:28,304
All my life,
I played at being blind. 

876
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,070
Now that I'm really blind, 

877
01:45:33,044 --> 01:45:36,411
I'll never get to
play it again. 

878
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:44,954
And I was just getting
good at it too. 

879
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:57,627
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

880
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:03,201
I was the one who
stole the ring. 

881
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:13,378
Let's run away together!

882
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:34,497
Don't look down!

883
01:46:36,074 --> 01:46:37,541
I'm scared!

884
01:46:39,077 --> 01:46:42,137
All around the rope is
an abyss. 

885
01:46:43,748 --> 01:46:47,946
Neither land nor sky,
but an abyss. 

886
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:57,860
All my life,
I played at being blind. 

887
01:47:03,835 --> 01:47:05,769
Now that I am really blind, 

888
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:10,031
it's a shame I'll never
get to play one. 

889
01:47:14,145 --> 01:47:17,114
And I was just getting
good at it too. 

890
01:47:37,235 --> 01:47:38,463
why?

891
01:47:39,771 --> 01:47:41,739
why?

892
01:49:11,229 --> 01:49:13,026
Bastard!

893
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,991
Arrange a party, Cheo-seon. 

894
01:49:20,872 --> 01:49:27,334
Cheo-seon! Cheo-seon!

895
01:51:13,551 --> 01:51:18,420
Being blind, I thought
I'd never walk the rope again. 

896
01:51:19,724 --> 01:51:22,090
But this is something else!

897
01:51:24,862 --> 01:51:29,629
Truth be told,
I have a knack for going blind. 

898
01:51:31,068 --> 01:51:33,298
Listen to this story. 

899
01:51:42,179 --> 01:51:44,670
After I saw my first show, 

900
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:47,383
I was blind to
everything else. 

901
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:50,484
what a high that was... 

902
01:51:52,023 --> 01:51:55,560
strutting on the stage, 

903
01:51:55,561 --> 01:51:57,585
rapping with a partner. 

904
01:52:01,465 --> 01:52:03,126
I could see nothing else!

905
01:52:06,203 --> 01:52:10,572
when I came to Seoul,
the glitter of

906
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:12,570
money blinded me. 

907
01:52:14,278 --> 01:52:16,212
Then I came here... 

908
01:52:20,418 --> 01:52:22,045
to the palace... 

909
01:52:26,157 --> 01:52:30,389
And being blind,
I saw nothing. 

910
01:52:32,964 --> 01:52:37,901
Didn't see the murderous
thief stealing a heart. 

911
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:51,481
well that's that. 

912
01:52:52,783 --> 01:52:55,343
Anyway, I see nothing

913
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:57,720
but an abyss now. 

914
01:52:58,923 --> 01:53:00,550
How sublime!

915
01:53:01,025 --> 01:53:03,561
I should have gone
blind sooner!

916
01:53:03,562 --> 01:53:06,325
You damn fool!

917
01:53:10,968 --> 01:53:13,596
Is it really so good
to be blind!

918
01:53:15,506 --> 01:53:20,569
Yeah, it is!
I love it, I really do!

919
01:53:32,556 --> 01:53:37,823
My, my, there's a fool,
rash and proud!

920
01:53:47,171 --> 01:53:53,201
A sightless fool who knows
not where he stands!

921
01:53:53,544 --> 01:53:55,637
Get down this instant!

922
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,542
Ho! A tongue most untamed!

923
01:53:59,383 --> 01:54:03,513
I am the King of this palace,
you wench!

924
01:54:09,627 --> 01:54:10,958
Indeed you are!

925
01:54:15,833 --> 01:54:20,668
I've always wanted to
see my King. 

926
01:54:21,639 --> 01:54:24,267
And now I've seen thee,
I see!

927
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:31,445
what? what do you see?

928
01:54:31,982 --> 01:54:34,917
Thou art blind to what's high
and what's low. 

929
01:54:35,853 --> 01:54:39,016
So thou hast turned
this world upside down. 

930
01:54:45,896 --> 01:54:47,523
My Lady! My Lady!

931
01:54:53,704 --> 01:54:58,903
what body shall
thy reborn soul take?

932
01:55:00,745 --> 01:55:02,975
A nobleman's?

933
01:55:03,447 --> 01:55:06,507
No, no. 

934
01:55:07,384 --> 01:55:11,218
A King's, then?

935
01:55:12,056 --> 01:55:13,956
That displeases also. 

936
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:17,149
I wish to be a minstrel again. 

937
01:55:17,495 --> 01:55:18,985
witless fool!

938
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:25,264
why seek again
thy cause for ruin?

939
01:55:25,603 --> 01:55:29,505
Then what new body
awaits thee?

940
01:55:31,275 --> 01:55:32,833
It is none other!

941
01:55:33,944 --> 01:55:39,143
A minstrel!
And nothing more!

942
01:55:51,328 --> 01:55:55,355
The world's but a stage!

943
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,896
Kingly is he who struts
for a while, then exits in style!

944
01:56:01,705 --> 01:56:03,696
Then together again, 

945
01:56:04,241 --> 01:56:06,209
we shall royally
this blessed earth roam!

946
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,624
Hee haw!

947
01:57:04,969 --> 01:57:09,006
Hey, hey!
Am I here and you there?

948
01:57:09,007 --> 01:57:11,270
No, I'm here
and you're there. 

949
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,044
Oh, I'm there and you're here. 

950
01:57:14,045 --> 01:57:16,672
we're all here!

951
01:57:17,014 --> 01:57:18,777
And there is neither you nor me. 

952
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:22,484
Hi ho!

953
01:57:22,686 --> 01:57:24,415
Hee haw!

954
01:57:55,552 --> 01:58:01,513
