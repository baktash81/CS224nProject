[Snorting]

2
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,980
[Narrator] This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart...

3
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,220
and how it changed our valley
forever.

4
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,460
There was a time
not so long ago...

5
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,790
when pigs were afforded no respect
except by other pigs.

6
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,660
They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.

7
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,020
In those days, pigs believed that
the sooner they grew large and fat,

8
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,950
the sooner they’d be taken
into pig paradise.

9
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,580
- Has! Has! Get up!
- A place so wonderful...

10
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,590
- That no pig had ever
thought to come back.
- You! Yeah!

11
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,180
Good-bye, Mom.

12
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,580
So when the day came for their
parents to go to that other
world of endless pleasures,

13
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,190
it was not a time
for young pigs to be sad.

14
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,300
Just another step towards the day when
they, too, would make the journey.

15
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,500
- [Sobbing]
- Perhaps it was because he was alone.

16
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,900
Perhaps his sadness
made him easier to catch.

17
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,310
Whatever the reason, of the thousands
of animals in the piggery that day...

18
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,980
only one was chosen.

19
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,150
- How’s this one, Harry?
- Just right for the purpose.

20
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,270
- How much do I owe you?
- It’s a runt, Harry.
A worthless, little runt.

[Chuckling]
You’re too modest, Esme Hoggett.

25
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,500
Nine out of ten first prizes
for jams and jellies...

26
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,420
is more than
a matter of luck.

27
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,950
Luck still plays its part. Our berries
were wickedly good this year.

28
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,500
And our water
is very tasty too.

29
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,180
Of course, we don’t use
the town water.

31
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,670
Arthur Hoggett!
How’s it going, Arthur?

32
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,020
How are those sheep of yours?
Come on, try your luck.

33
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,660
How about taking a guess, Arthur?
All for a good cause.

34
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,550
- Don’t keep pigs.
- Christmas day. Think of it.
What a feast!

35
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,220
That’ll do, Pig.

36
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,380
[Narrator] The pig and the farmer
regarded each other.

37
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,940
And for a fleeting moment,
something passed between them.

38
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,740
- A faint sense of some common destiny.
- [Man] Hah. Strange.

39
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,260
First time the little thing
hasn’t screamed its head off.

40
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,540
Now you’ll have
to have a guess.

41
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,460
- Sixteen pounds, five...
- [Pig Urinating]

42
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,390
Eew.

43
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,420
Two ounces.

44
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,540
[Mrs. Hoggett]
Hooey! Hoggett!

45
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,460
Hooey! Hoggett!

46
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,870
Thanks, Arthur. We’ll be weighing
the little pig tomorrow.

47
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,140
We’ll phone you
if you win.

48
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,110
When you win, Arthur.
When you win! [Laughing]

49
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,150
Care to guess
the pig’s weight, sir?

Ooh!
[Chuckles]

54
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,380
What could we do
with a pig, eh, Duchess?

55
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,540
Just think. Two nice hams.
Two sides of bacon.

56
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,070
Oh, and pork chops, kidney, liver,
chitins, pickle his feet.

57
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,900
- [Phone Rings]
- Save his blood for black
puddin`. There’s the telephone.

[Man] Good news, Arthur.
You’ve won the pig.

60
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,270
Oh.

61
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,620
[Mouse] Pigs are definitely stupid.
[Giggling]

62
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,390
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

63
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,580
- [Puppy] What is it, Mom?
- That’s a pig.

64
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,060
- They’ll eat him when he’s big.
- Will they eat us?

65
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,940
Good heavens, no! The bosses
only eat stupid animals...

66
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,460
like sheep and ducks
and chickens.

67
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,300
[Puppies Barking]
Yea!

68
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,420
It does look stupid,
Mom.

69
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,180
Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.
But pigs are definitely stupid.

70
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,580
Excuse me.
No, we’re not.

71
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,580
- Good heavens! Who are you?
- L`m a Large White.

72
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,830
- Yes, that’s your breed, dear.
What’s your name?
- I don’t know.

73
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,980
What did your mother call you
to tell you apart from
your brothers and sisters?

74
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,110
Our mom called us
all the same.

75
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,860
And what was that,
dear?

76
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,220
She called us all Babe.

77
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,430
Perhaps we shouldn’t talk
too much about, uh, family.

78
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,580
[Crying]
I want my mom.

79

[Whimpering]

80
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,700
There, there. You’ve got
to be a brave boy now.

81
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,870
I left my mother when I was your age,
and my pups will have to leave me soon.

82
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,740
But l`ll keep an eye on you, if you
like, just til you find your feet.

83
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,390
The little pig’s a bit low.
He’s going to sleep with us...

84
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,430
- Just `til he finds his feet.
- [Snarls]

85
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,790
Until he finds his feet.

86
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,100
But, Mom,
he’ll wet the bed!

87
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,910
Nonsense!

88
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,980
If you do want to do anything,
you’ll go outside, won’t you?

89
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,540
- [Sniffling]
- Good boy.

90
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,630
[Puppies Together]
Yea!

91
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,140
Yeah! Yeah!
Stomp on him!

92

What’s your name, Pig?

93
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,220

We’ve got to do something
about that duck.

Ooh! Ooh!

100
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,110
Doodle-loo-dee-doo.

101
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,100
- What’s that noise?
- It’s only Ferdinand.

102
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,020
- What’s Ferdinand?
- He’s a duck.

103
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,990
- He wants to be a rooster.
- He hates being a duck.

104
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,940
- We’ll catch him one day
and eat him. Won’t we, Mom?
- Yes, dear.

105
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,110
Yech!

- Aren’t pigs allowed?
- Not live ones.

110
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,580
- Sorry, dear. Only dogs
and cats inside the house.
- Why?

things are.

Ooh, what a spectacular feast
l`ve got for you.

118
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,510
Oh, yes! What a lucky
little pork chop you are.

119
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,060
Delicious! Oh, yes!
Yum, yum, yum.

120
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,380
Who’s gonna grow up
to be a big, fat pig?

121
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,380
You are! You are!
Yum, yum, yum.

122
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,870
- [Puppy] Where are we going?
- To work with the sheep.

123
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,910
- What’s sheep?
- Sheep is animals
with thick, woolly coats.

124
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,420
And thick woolly heads. And men
can’t look after them without us.

125
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,700
- Why do they need us?
- [Together]
`Cause we’re sheepdogs! Yea!

126
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,110
- Not you, dear.
- Why not?

127
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,190
We have to do dogs` work.
You’re a pig. Your job
is to stay here and eat your food.

128
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,310
We’ll be back
at the end of the day.

129
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,620
[Female Voice] They don’t think
l`ll remember. Well, I don’t forget.

130
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,550
Seems like a sheep’s
just born to suffer.

131
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,940
Hello?
Excuse me.

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,900
[Coughing]
Darn wolf!

133
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,270
- L`m not a wolf. L`m a pig.
What are you?
- Ewe.

134
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,260
Pig. What are you?

135
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,070
l`m a ewe.
A ewe!

136
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,060
- You’re a sheep!
- L`ll not be called
a common sheep, thank you kindly.

137
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,710
I’m a Border Leicester ewe.
The name’s Maa.

138
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,310
- [Coughing]
- Oh.

139
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,220
- What’s wrong with you, Maa?
- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.

140
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,310
And l`m not as young
as I used to be. [Coughing]

141

[Coughing,
Bleating]

142
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,150
Hmph.

143
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,390
[Humming]

144
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,790
- Seem like a nice young pig.
What be your name?
- Babe.

145
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,620
Not like them wolves.
Treat you like dirt, they do!

146
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,630
- Bite you as soon as
look at you, those savages!
- Bite you?

147
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,060
And worse.
Some wolves be so bad,

148
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,300
they run a sheep down
and tear it to pieces.

149
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,700
- [Coughing]
- Fly would never do that!

150
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,460
Fly, is it? A right vicious creature
she be, l`ll tell you.

151
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,300
- Not Fly.
- All them wolves is cruel
to sheep. Always have been.

152
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,110
Brutal savages!
That’s what they be.

153
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,270
I wouldn’t want to see a gentle soul
like you mixin` with the likes of them.

[Coughing]

155
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,020
[Narrator]
That afternoon when he saw Fly,

156
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,140
the pig’s mind
was a tangle of questions.

157
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,270
Cruel, vicious, brutal?

158
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,100
What was it that dogs did
in the fields all day?

159
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,270
- Hello, Babe? Had a good day?
- Yes, thank you.

160
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,070
[Giggling]

161
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,140
[Narrator] The old sheep
had to be wrong about Fly.

162
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,460
And the pig promised himself
that he would never think badly
of any creature ever again.

163
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,110
Crime and Punishment!
[Laughing]

164
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,100
The morning of
the terrible crime...

165
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,820

- Hmm?

171
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,380
I was worried it might have
a harsh tone, but that’s
quite a nice musical ring.

172
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,540
I walked into O`Halloran`s Hardware,
and there it was waiting for me.

173
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,670
What a splendid way
to wake up each morning!

174
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,180

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,700
[Narrator] When embarking
on an audacious crime,

176
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,380
a duck needs
a willing accomplice.

177
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,300
A creature who is reliable,
beyond suspicion,

178
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,620
and above all,
extremely gullible.

179
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,460
Hey! Psst!

180
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,510
Wha... What?

181
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,710
You look like an intelligent,
sophisticated, discerning young fella.

182
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,500
- Who, me?
- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy!
Are you in for some fun!

183
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,660
What are we doin`?
Where are we goin`?

184
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,300
[Narrator] Now the duck knew
exactly what he had to do.

185
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,340
- The alarm clock had to go.
His very life depended on it.
- [Duck] Do you see it?

186
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,900
- Yes.
- Good.

187
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,030
[Babe] So I go through the kitchen,
across the living room...

188
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,190
- Good, good.
- Into the bedroom.

189
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,580
Get the mechanical rooster
and bring it out to you.

190
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,500
- What about that cat?
- But quietly bring it out to you.

191
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,740
- Excellent.
- I don’t think I can do it.

192
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,900
It’s against the rules. Only dogs
and cats allowed in the house.

193
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,220
It’s a good rule, but this is bigger
than rules. This is life and death.

194
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,740
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Follow me.

195
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,470
[Duck] Hello! Look,
there’s something you should know.

196
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,100
- Humans eat ducks!
- [Gasps] I beg your pardon?

197
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,150
Most ducks prefer to forget it,
but the fact is that humans
like to eat plump ducks.

198
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,270
I don’t think so.
Not the boss. Not the boss’s wife.

199
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,940
Come on.
Humans don’t eat cats. Why?

200
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,140
- Well, they’re...
- They’re indispensable.
They catch mice.

201
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,380
Humans don’t eat roosters. Why?
They make eggs with the hens and
wake up everyone in the morning.

202
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,300
I tried it with the hens.
It didn’t work.

203
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,110
So I turned to crowing, and lo!
I discover my gift.

204
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,180
But no sooner do I become
indispensable than they bring in
a machine to do the job!

Ah, the treachery of it!

206
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,300
- A mechanical rooster!
- Oh, dear me.

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,980
Oh, dear you?
[Sighing]

208
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,500
I suppose the life
of an anorexic duck...

209
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,350
doesn’t amount to much
in the broad scheme of things.

210
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,340

212
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,020
Why do you need me
to do it?

213
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,990
- [Groans] l`m allergic to cats.
- Oh.

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,300

Ahh.

216
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,940
Don’t worry.
I won’t wake the cat.

217

that you must not go
anywhere near that duck.

As for the fugitive duck, when
he shows himself, let him know this:

273
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,030
Being a duck he must behave like a duck.
No more of this crowing and nonsense.

274
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,340

was Christmas dinner...

myself. You got teeth in
that floppy mouth or just gums?

499
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,260
[Laughing]

500
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,590
You see, ladies,
a heart of gold.

501
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,620
[Sheep Together]
Ahh. Heart of gold.

502
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,180
No need for all this
wolf nonsense, young`un.

503
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,980
All a nice little pig like you
need do is ask.

504
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,740
[Barking]

505
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,220
Thanks very much.
It was very kind of you.

506
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,460
- A pleasure.
- What a nice little pig!

507
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,630
All right,
how did you do it?

508
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,350
I asked them, and they did it.
I asked them nicely.

509
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,860
We don’t ask sheep, dear.
We tell them what to do.

510
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,780
I did, Mom.
They were really friendly.

511
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:45,070
Maybe Rex might be a little more
friendly if I had a talk with him.

512
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,060
No, no, no.
You better leave that to me.

513
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,180
Rex?

514
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,830
I know it was hard
for you today...

515
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,900
watching all that happening.

516
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,110
But surely it’s not worth
all this misery.

517
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,860
Please, dear,
not on such a beautiful night.

518
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,540
You put these ideas
into his head!

519
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,180
Two-faced traitorous wret...

520
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,660
[Growling, Snarling]

521
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,460
Get down!

522
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,300
Down, Rex.
Fly!

523
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,500
[Snarling]

524
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,460
[Whimpers]

525
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,150
[Narrator] A dark cloud
had descended on the valley.

526
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,140
And the pig felt that
the troubles were all his fault.

527
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,300
But he was certain that he knew
how to put things right again.

528
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,750
Oh, uh,
e-excuse me, sir.

529
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,980
But l-l-I think
all this trouble...

530
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,350
- [Snarling, Growling]
- [Squealing]

531
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,230
[Man] Well, it’s not distemper.
Can’t be rabies.

532
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,780
Must be the hormones.

533
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,550
- What about Hogget’s notion,
the dog jealous of the wee pig?
- I don’t see that myself.

534
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,590
[Mrs. Hoggett]
No. So what should we do?

535
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,950
You can keep him locked up
or... snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.

536
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,180
No.

537
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,660
Or Wednesday.

538
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,380
Hoggett doesn’t want the dog
operated on. He’s a breeding dog.

539
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,740
I can sedate him,
of course,

540
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,030
but he’ll be useless
as a working dog.

541
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:14,980
- [Groans]
- [Vet] l`ll give you pills
to put in his food.

542
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,790
Good dog.

543
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,180
[Together]
The Sheep Pig.

544
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,300
[Bleating]

545
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,830
[Sighs]

546
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,790
[Oinks]

547
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,630
[Narrator]
A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?

548
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,180
With Rex out of action
and Fly injured from the fight,
Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

549
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:56,270
Maa! Maa! The boss has
to give you some medicine.

550
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,790
Oh, dear, I thought so!
let’s horrible stuff, that.

551
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:05,020
- I know, but it’s for the best.
- Young`un, if you say so.

552
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,020
Shoo! Shoo!

553
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,580
[Narrator]
When the thought first came to him,

554
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,790
Farmer Hoggett dismissed it
as mere whimsy.

555
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,780
But, like most of his harebrained
ideas, it wouldn’t go away.

556
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,790
- [Babe] What are they doing?
- [Fly] let’s a sheepdog trial.

557
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,260
[Babe] So it’s like
a competition for sheepdogs?

558
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,220
[Fly] And their bosses.
It’s like an obstacle course.

559
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,270
How do they decide
who wins?

560
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,460
It’s time and mistakes.
You get points for how quick you are.

561
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,700
And they take points off
for every mistake.

562
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,340
Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,
that’s a mistake and you lose points.

563
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:02,180
- Looks like fun!
- For a sheepdog,
there’s no prouder moment.

564
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,470
- Rex and I used to...
- Hmm?

565
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,100
Never mind.

566
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,940
Oh.

567
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,060
[Babe]
Was Rex a champion?

568
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,100
[Fly] He had the makings
of the greatest champion there
ever was, but it wasn’t to be.

569
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,710
- [Babe] What happened?
- [Fly] A while back
when Rex was in his prime,

570
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,300
the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

571
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,590
Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

572
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,590
Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

573
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,180
He found them. They’d been
stranded by the rising water.

574
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,950
He tried to herd them across
to safety, but they wouldn’t budge.

575
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,820
Too afraid and too stupid
to save their own skins.

576
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,350
It was freezing cold
and the water kept rising.

577
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,500
Rex stayed with them
right through the night.

578
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,740
By morning,
the sheep were drowned.

579
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:02,620
- And when they found Rex,
he was barely alive.
- [Babe] Oh, Mom!

580
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,940
[Fly] Two weeks rest in front of
the fire saw him back on his feet.

581
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,820
But his hearing
was never the same again.

582
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:13,740
He’d never want anyone to know,
but he’s almost totally deaf.

583
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:18,300
- Is that why he’s so, you know, angry?
- That’s not the half of it.

584
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,020
[Fly] All this was barely a month
before the Grand National Challenge.

585
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,260
He tried his best, but he couldn’t hear
the boss’s calls, and it slowed him up.

586
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:29,820
The cold truth is that,
but for the stupidity of sheep,

587
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,540
Rex would’ve been
the champion of champions.

588
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,300
Good dog.

589
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,100
[Hammering]

590
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,070
That’s it, all right.
Good.

591
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,340
[Hoggett]
Here we go. All right.

592
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,310
Now, through here like this.

593
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,740
And then, big hook to the left.
Big hook.

594
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,750
Big hook.
Through this gate here.

595
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,500
[Narrator] It was at that
time that Mrs. Hoggett began
to worry about her husband.

596
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,260
But Farmer Hoggett knew
that little ideas...

597
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,390
that tickled and nagged
and refused to go away...

598
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,900
should never be ignored...

599
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,460
for in them lie
the seeds of destiny.

600
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,710
Close the gate like that,
and you’re done.

601
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,270
A Tragic Day.

602
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,670
Mom. Mom!
Can we start work early today?

603
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,580
Oh, dear,
it’s not even dawn yet.

604
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:14,300
You can go to work when the rooster
crows. Oh, go back to sleep.

605
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,380
[Sighs]

606
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,940
Ahem.

607
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,270
Um, excuse me.

608
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,190
Hello, sir. Excuse me,
but it’s nearly dawn, and...

609
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,500
- [Mumbling] What?
- Sorry to disturb you.

610
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,590
It’s nearly dawn, and I wondered
if you’d mind crowing just a
few minutes early this morning.

611
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,500
- Get out of here!
- But, well, see l...

612
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,310
- Get lost!
- Oh, okay.

613
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,340
Whoa!
[Groans]

614
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,790
[Bleating]

615
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,870
[Bleating]

616
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,110
[Bleating, Barking]

617
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,060
[Narrator] Now the pig understood
why the sheep called all dogs wolves.

618
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,860
And he was filled with
a deep and terrible rage.

619
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,990
- [Whimpering]
- [Barking]

620
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,230
[Maa Groaning]

621
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,260
[Groaning]

622
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,270
Maa! Maa!

623
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,420
- Are you all right?
- Hello, young`un.

624
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,780
Oh, Maa,
can you get up?

625
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,390
I don’t reckon.

626
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:20,710
It’s over, Maa.
The wolves have gone far away.

627
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,870
l`ll get the boss up here
to look after you.

628
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,700
- You’ll be all right.
You’ll be all right!
- [Groaning]

629
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,870
Oh, Maa! Maa!
[Crying]

630
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:37,820
Maa! Maa!

631
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,780
Maa!

632
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,830
- [Sheep Bleating]
- Maa!

633
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,020
[Sighs]

634
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,070
Home, Pig.

635
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,020
[Narrator] Fly knew that there
was only one fate for any creature...

636
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,620
that took the life of a sheep
on Hoggett Farm.

637
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:33,380
But Fly could never believe
that Babe was a sheep killer,

638
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,900
so she remained in the field
to do something she’d never
done before: talk to the sheep.

639
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:41,660
Tell me.
Who killed the old one?

640
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,340
- Wolf!
- Wolf. Is that the only words
you half-wits know?

641
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,230
- Wolf!
- Are you saying it was a dog?

642
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,700
- Where’s Babe?
- Was it wolf or Babe?

643
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:56,780
[Shouting]
Wolf! Babe!

644
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,540
[Narrator] Farmer Hoggett
was carrying something
in the crook of one arm.

645
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,980
A kind of black, shiny tube.

646
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,300
Come, Pig.

647
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,310
[Narrator] The pig had a vague
memory that shiny tubes produced food,

648
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,500
and guessed that some
quite unexpected surprise...

649
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,660
would come out
of two small round mouths.

650
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,540
[Shouting]
Babe! Wolf!

651
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,220
[Shouting]
Babe! Wolf!

652
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,390
Quiet!

653
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,740
[Narrator]
Fly decided to speak very slowly,

654
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:34,660
for it was a cold fact of nature
that sheep were stupid...

655
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,620
and no one would ever
persuade her otherwise.

656
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,700
Please, please
would you be...

657
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,030
so kind as to tell me
what happened?

658
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:45,340
Quiet!

659
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,020
Please, tell me
what happened this morning.

660
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,030
[Narrator]
The sheep spoke very slowly...

661
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,700
for it was a cold fact of nature
that wolves were ignorant...

662
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,140
and nothing would
convince them otherwise.

663
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,540
Babe came!
He saved us!

664
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,460
- The wolves killed Maa.
- But Babe drove the wolves away!

665
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,100
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you all very much!

666
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,980

to ya.

671
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:49,500
Oh, there you are!
Well, what do you think?

672
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,550
That was the police on the telephone.
Said there are wild dogs about.

673
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,460
Apparently the Mitchells
lost six lambs this morning.

674
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,820
What are you doing
with that gun?

675
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,260
Oh, l...
Nothing.

676
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,940

677
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,710
[Mice]
Pig of Destiny!

678
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,740
It’s all very simple.
Half an hour at 350 degrees.

679
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,900
l`ve given you
rabbit casserole for Friday.

680
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,870
Now, for Duchess, it’s liver
in the morning, heart for the evening.

681
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:46,020
Except Fridays, when it’s steak in
the morning, and cooked liver at night.

682
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:51,950
Warm it up a bit but test it,
because she bites into
it before she knows what’s what.

683
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,990
That’ll be the bus.

684
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,500
- Oh, bye, bye.
- Have a good time. Bye.

685
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,060
Hello, everyone!

686
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,540
Oh, dearie me, Valda.

687
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,710
I know I have to be
at the National Conference.

688
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:16,860
I am the Assistant General Secretary
of the Northeast Region after all,

689
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,460
but I do worry about
leaving that man alone.

690
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,180
- Still acting a bit strange?
- Just silly things.

691
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,220
Odd little things
only a wife would notice.

692
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:32,390
- Still, he can’t get up
to too much mischief in three days.
- Of course not.

693

[Whistles]

694
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,430
Go on.

695
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,140
Go on!

696
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,300
[Meows]

697
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,540
- Oh! Good evening.
Shame about the weather.
- [Hisses]

698
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,100
Nasty cough!

699
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,700
[Narrator] It had been
a long time since Arthur Hoggett...

700
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,940
had had an animal in whose abilities
he had so much faith.

701
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,580
And with the National Grand Challenge
Sheepdog Trials only two days away,

702
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,180
he wasn’t going to let the fact
that his animal was a pig deter him.

703
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:33,260
He had been worried,
for he was a truthful man,

704
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,260
that the heading might say
"Name of dog."

705
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,620
And then whatever he put
would be a lie.

706
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:43,740
But as it happened, luck,
for the moment, was running with him.

707
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,660
It’s all right, really!

708
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,220
- L`m just, well... Bless you.
- [Hisses]

709
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,830

[Meowing]

712
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,860
Whoa, whoa!
Uh, easy, whoa! Ah.

713
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,790
Oh, no.

714
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:53,820
- So, ah... what’s happening?
- [Cow] Oh, no.

715
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,940
Shh. Easy, easy.

716
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,710
- Good pig. Good pig.
- Huh? Huh?

717
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:06,110
Hold still.
Hold still.

718
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,980
Huh?

719
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,700
[Laughing]

720
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,620
[Narrator] There are many
perfectly nice cats in the world.

721
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:18,180
But every barrel
has its bad apples.

722
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,540
And it is well to heed
the old adage,

723
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,940
"Beware the bad cat
bearing a grudge."

724
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,540

[Loud Thunderclap]

728
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,140
- How are you feeling?
- A bit tired.

729
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,070
You’ll need a good sleep to put you
in top condition tomorrow.

730
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,460
Don’t stay up too late.
Good night.

731
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,500
[Yawns]
Good night, Mom.

732
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,140
Oh, do forgive me
for scratching you, dear.

733
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,790
I got a bit carried away.
It’s a cat thing.

734
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:15,220
Oh. Well... [Chuckles]
But oh...

735
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,460
Feeling good about tomorrow,
are you?

736
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,980
Mm-hmm. It should be all right,
I think.

737
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:26,380
I probably shouldn’t say this,
but l`m not sure if you realize...

738
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:30,870
how much the other animals are laughing
at you for this sheepdog business.

739
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,940
Why would they do that?

740
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:37,700
Well, they say that you’ve forgotten
that you’re a pig. Isn’t that silly?

741
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,220
They even say that you
don’t know what pigs are for.

742
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,180
What do you mean?

743
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:47,860
- You know... why pigs are here.
- Why are any of us here?

744
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:50,540
Well, the cow’s here
to be milked.

745
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,430
The dogs are here to help
the boss’s husband with the sheep.

746
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:56,580
And l`m here to be beautiful
and affectionate to the boss.

747
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,820
- Yes?
- [Sighs]

748
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:03,150
The fact is that pigs
don’t have a purpose.

749
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,020
Just like ducks
don’t have a purpose.

750
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,540
- I don’t...
- All right, for you own sake,
l`ll be blunt.

751
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,870
Why do the bosses keep ducks?
To eat them.

752
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,190
So why do the bosses
keep a pig?

753
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:23,620
The fact is that animals that
don’t seem to have a purpose
really do have a purpose.

754
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:28,030
The bosses have to eat. It’s probably
the most noble purpose of all...

755
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,230
when you come
to think about it.

756
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,150
They eat pigs?

757
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,740
Pork, they call it.
Or bacon.

758
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,390
They only call them pigs
when they’re alive.

759
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,740
But, uh, l`m a sheep pig!

760

[Chuckles]

761
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,350
The boss’s husband’s just
playing a little game with you.

762
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,060
Believe me, sooner or later,
every pig gets eaten.

763
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,620
That’s the way
the world works.

764
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:57,420
Oh! I haven’t upset you,
have I? [Chuckles]

765
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,140
[Whimpers]

766
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,820
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

767
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:30,060
- Mom!
- Good heavens!

768
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:33,580
What on earth are you doing
out in the rain?

769
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,940
You should be looking after yourself
with such a big day ahead of you.

770
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,100
- Are pigs for eatin`?
- [Gasps] Who told you that?

771
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,660
The cat told me. Pigs don’t have
a purpose except to be eaten.

772
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,380
Is it true?

773
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,540
It’s true.
For many pigs, it’s true.

774
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,260
So my mother, my father,
my brothers and my sisters,

775
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,420
- All...
- Probably, dear.

776
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:02,660
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No, it’s all right.

777
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,660
I understand.
l`ll be all right.

778
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:14,220
Even... the boss?

779
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,780
Yes, dear.

01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:47,300
He’s got a cold, but that doesn’t
explain a pig not eating.

He’s got me stonkered, Arthur.
But I can tell you this.

you’re gonna lose him.

work by these talented dogs.

Stay there.

836
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,220
Excuse me, sheep.

837
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:44,860
Hello! Hello!
Good morning to you all!

838
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,180
[Bleats]

839
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,630
l`ve never met a sheep
with such a strong, dark face.

840
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:54,110
- Are they feeding you well?
- [Bleats]

841
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,740
Babe, l`ll try.

842
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,940
All right, blockheads!
Pay attention over here!

843
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:04,310
Now, you pay attention
to what this pig has to say...

844
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:08,860
or l`ll come in there
and rip you to shreds!

845
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:13,230
Hadn’t thought of this. Keep talking
to them. L`ll see what I can do.

846
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:21,950
- Doesn’t it look a picture?
Our show ground on the telly!
- Apart from the weather.

847
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:26,190
- Look! There’s your Bert!
- [TV Commentator] Bert Ford
and Sweep doing very well.

848
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:31,100
- Sweep’s having a little trouble
with this gate, Clive.
- A lot of trouble actually.

849
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:35,500
- That’s going to set Bert back.
- Don’t worry, Valda.
Just a little slipup.

850
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:38,180
Look, he’s doing
much better now.

851
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:42,150
[Commentator] Too many loose sheep.
And Sweep’s usually such a reliable dog.

852
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,020
Hey, whoa.
Stop!

853
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,340
If those sheep won’t talk to Babe,
the boss is going to look like an idiot.

854
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:06,340
- I don’t know what to do.
- There is one thing.

855
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:10,310
I gotta go!
l`ll try to be back in time.

856
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:20,750
Ahem. It must’ve been
terrible weather for you,

857
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:25,700
- Out in the field with
all this rain we’ve been having.

858
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,230
Hey, that dog’s
in a hurry.

859
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:34,580
Come on, Nick,
I got a beer and a TV waiting.

860
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:49,260
[P.A. Announcer] The last entry
is Pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.

861
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,470
- Was that "Hoggett"?
- I think it was!

862
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:56,300
- Huh?
- He said Hoggett.
It was clear as a bell.

863
01:12:56,390 --> 01:13:00,140
Must be another Hoggett. We only have
the two dogs, and they certainly...

864
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,060
aren’t...

865
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:08,540

Shut up, you morons!

869
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:23,420
The little pig’s in trouble.

870
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:26,790
What trouble has come
to our Babe, wolf?

871
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,590
The sheep at the trials
won’t talk to the little fellow.

872
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,740
They won’t listen.
He doesn’t know what to do.

873
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,870
Don’t know what
we could do to help.

874
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,620
- It’s not right to give help to a wolf.
- You wait here, wolf.

875
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:43,310
You’ll have to speak up.
l`m a... little hard of hearing.

876
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:47,140
I asked you
to wait here, wolf.

877
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:49,870
Do what you’re told
by an old sheep for a change.

878
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,590
We’ll see
what we can do for you.

879
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:57,260
Work completed.
Restore power.

880
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,710
[Commentator] Very frustrating
to be sitting up here...

881
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,830
wondering
what’s causing the delay.

882
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:06,030
We have someone on their way
to the judges` rooms now.

883
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,700
We’ll tell you what’s causing
the problem as soon as we find out.

884
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:11,260
- Perhaps it’s a drug test?
- Yeah, it could be.

885
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:14,070
- [Moos]
- L`ve never heard of a drug test
at a sheepdog contest before.

886
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:19,270
We’ve got somethin` here
that might be of use to our pig.

01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,780
Before we gives you anythin`,

889
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:27,700
- You’ll be makin` us a solemn promise.
- [Rex] Yes?

890
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:31,300
- Treat us civil!
- Yes! You gotta treat us nice-like.

891

892
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:37,180
- No bitin`!
- That’s right.
Wolf must avoid bitin` us sheep...

893
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,740
- At all costs!
- All right! L`ll try that too.

894
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:44,740
It’s preposterous!
We’d be the laughingstock of
every sheepdog organization...

895
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,550
- In every civilized country
in the world!
- There’s no rule...

896
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:51,220
We’ll see about that when
the adjudication committee
have finished their meeting.

897
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:56,500
What will we have next year,
a laughing hyena doing show jumping?

898
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:59,780
But the most important of all,
you must promise...

899
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:03,420
never ever to let this password
we be about to give...

900
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,660
to be used against
any sheep anywhere.

901
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,140
I promise you that.
l`ll make sure the pig knows it too.

902
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,670
- We have the promise!
- `Tis for Babe.

903
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,220
Maa would have wanted it.

904
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,070

Is that it?
Is that the password?

01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:40,230
[Clapping In Unison]

910
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:53,270
Mr. Hoggett, the judges
would like me to convey to you...

911
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:56,710
their disappointment
that a man such as yourself,

912
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:01,020
with a long and honorable
association with the work of
National Sheepdog Association,

913
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,910
should see fit to flout...

914
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,020
the historic conventions
which have long ruled our sport.

915
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:11,190
However we find there
is no rule, as such,

916
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:15,950
which would prevent your...
animal... being entered.

917
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:32,430
The committee has ruled
that if you wish to proceed,

918
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:35,310
there is nothing we can do
to stop you.

919
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:38,540
What do you wish
to do?

920
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:41,910
[Clapping Continues]

921
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:48,820
[Commentator] There appears
to be some movement down there now.

922
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,260

no further problems,

923
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,940

- Pig.

stand there until his time runs out?

950
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,430
Or could this be
some sort of protest?

951
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,510
Maybe we should line up an
interview with the sheep pig?

952
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,980
Or the sheep pig’s trainer.

953

in all the celebration,

01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:24,060
in all the hubbub
of noise and excitement,

967
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:27,470
there were two figures
who stood silent and still...

01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:30,430

every single human in the stands
or in the commentary boxes...

973
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,380
was at a complete loss
for words,

the man, who in his life had uttered
fewer words than any of them...

975
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,860
knew exactly what to say.

976
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,070
That’ll do, Pig.

977
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,990
That’ll do.
