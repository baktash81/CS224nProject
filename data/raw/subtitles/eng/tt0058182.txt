00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,726
# It's been
a hard day's night #

2
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:39,892
# And I've been workin'
like a dog #

3
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:43,086
# It's been
a hard day's night #

4
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:46,568
# I should be sleepin'
like a log #

5
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,611
# But when I get home to you #

6
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,973
# I find
the things that you do #

7
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,368
# Will make me feel
all right #

8
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:56,725
# You know I work all day #

9
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,092
# To get you money
to buy you things #

10
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:03,372
# And it's worth it
just to hear you say #

11
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:06,691
# You're gonna give me
everything #

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,446
# So why on earth
should I moan?  #

13
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:10,173

I get you alone #

00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:13,376

Aah!

28
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,620

[Crowd screaming]

46
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:30,030
Hey, pardon me for askin',
but who's that little old man?

47
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,754
- What little old man?
- That little old man.

48
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,547
Oh, that one.
That's my grandfather.

49
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,629
- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,072
- That's not your grandfather.
- It is, you know.

51
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,710
But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.

52
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,875
Oh, that's my other grandfather,
but he's my grandfather as well.

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,352
How do you reckon that one out?

54
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,117
Well, everyone's entitled
to two, aren't they?

55
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,230
And this is my other one.

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,031
We know that,
but what's he doin' here?

57
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,150
Well, my mother thought
the trip would do him good.

58
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,114
- How's that?
- He's nursin' a broken heart.

59
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,234
JOHN:
Ah, poor old thing.

60
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,594
Hey, mister,
are you nursin' a broken heart?

61
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,994
He's a nice old man, isn't he?

62
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,960
He's very clean.

63
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,360
- Hello, grandfather.
- Hello.

64
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,722
He can talk then, can he?

65
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,794
Of course he can talk.
He's a human being, isn't he?

66
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,201
Well, if he's your grandfather,
who knows? Ha ha ha.

67
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,443
And we're lookin' after him,
are we?

68
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:31,359
- I look after meself.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

69
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,597
He's got you worried, then?

70
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:35,436
Him, he's a villain,
a real mixer...

71
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,603
and he costs you a fortune
in breach of promise cases.

72
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,320
- GEORGE: Get on.
- No, straight up.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,519
Hiya.

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,598
- Hello, Shake.
- Hello, Shake.

75
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,802
- You got on all right, then?
- No.

76
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:49,085
Oh? Well, we're here.

77
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,677
SHAKE: Norm'll be along
in a minute with the tickets.

78
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:52,643
Hey, who's the little old man?

79
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:55,118
It's Paul's grandfather.

80
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:59,003
- Oh, aye, but I thought...
- No, that's his other one.

81
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,921
Oh, that's all right, then.

82
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,607
Clean, though, isn't he?

83
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,362
Oh, aye. He's very clean.

84
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:08,364
- NORM: Mornin', lads.
- Hi, Norm.

85
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:11,644
Thank God you've all got here.
Look, I've had a marvelous idea.

86
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,409
Just for once,
let's all try to behave...

87
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,328
like ordinary
respectable citizens.

88
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,563
Let's not cause any trouble,
pull any strokes...

89
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:19,404
or do anything
I'm gonna be sorry for...

90
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,927
especially tomorrow in that
television theater, because...

91
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:25,524
Are you listening to me,
Lennon?

92
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,442
You're a swine.
Isn't he, George?

93
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,929
Yeah, a swine.

94
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,691
Thanks. Hey!

95
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,811
ALL:
Who's that little old man?

96
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:37,091
- Well, who is he?
- He belongs to Paul.

97
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:39,249
Oh, well. I'm going down
for a cup of coffee.

98
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,966
- Anyone coming?
- We'll follow you down.

99
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,367
I want me coffee.

100
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,208
You can come with Shake and me,
if you like.

101
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,693
PAUL: Look after him. I don't
want to find you've lost him.

102
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:51,172
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him
to me with promises.

103
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:55,095
Very clean, isn't he?
Come out, granddad.

104
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,375
Make up your mind, will you?

105
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,894
Hello. Morning.

106
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,577
All right?

107
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,296
Whoa.

108
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,974
Do you mind if we have it open?

109
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:45,413
Yes, I do.

110
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,255
Well, there are four of us,
and we'd like it open...

111
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:50,861
not if it's
all the same to you, that is.

112
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,863
It isn't. I travel
on this train regularly...

113
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,098
twice a week, so I suppose
I have some rights.

114
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,422
So have we.

115
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,105
[Playing rock and roll]

116
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,580
And we'll have that thing
off as well. Thank you.

117
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,018
- [Turns off]
- But...

118
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,783
An elementary knowledge
of the Railway Acts...

119
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,385
would tell you that I am
perfectly within my rights.

120
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,543
Yeah, but we want to hear it.
There's more of us than you.

121
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:16,625
We're a community,
a majority vote.

122
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,862
Up the workers
and all that stuff.

123
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,579
Then I suggest
you take that damn thing...

124
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,747
into the corridor, or
some other part of the train...

125
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,540
where you obviously belong.

126
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,900
Give us a kiss.

127
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,221
Look, mister, we paid
for our seats, too, you know.

128
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,983
I travel on this train
regularly, twice a week.

129
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,748
Knock it off, Paul.
You can't win with his sort.

130
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,341
After all, it's his train,
isn't it, mister?

131
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,460
And don't take that tone
with me, young man.

132
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,264
I fought the war for your sort.

133
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,702
I bet you're sorry you won.

134
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,388
- I shall call the guard.
- Ah, but what?

135
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:44,421
They don't take kindly
to insults, you know.

136
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,826
Let's go have some coffee
and leave the kennel to Lassie.

137
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,423
[Door closes]

138
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,150
PAUL: Hey, mister,
can we have our ball back?

139
00:07:57,428 --> 00:08:01,428
PAUL: Look, mister! Mister!
Can we have our ball back?

140
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:04,305
- JOHN: Hey!
- PAUL: Please, mister!

141
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:10,674
- You want to watch it.
- Well, it's not my fault.

142
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,873
You stick to that story, son.

143
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:14,309
I can't help it.
I'm just taller than you are.

144
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,710
They always say that.

145
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,110
Well, I've got me eye on ya.

146
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,709
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help
being taller than you.

147
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,395
Well, don't rub it in! I've
a good mind to thump you, Shake.

148
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,949
If you're gonna have a barney,
can I hold your coat?

149
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,510
- He started it.
- I did not. You did.

150
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,632
Well, what happened?

151
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,754
The old fella said that...

152
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:31,028
could he have these pictures,
and Norm said, "No."

153
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,310
And all I said was,
"Well, why not be big about it?"

154
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,315
- And?
- Your grandfather pointed out...

155
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,953
that Shake was always being
taller than me just to spite me.

156
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,392
I knew it. He started it.

157
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:40,993
- PAUL: I should've known.
- NORM: You what?

158
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:43,113
You two have never had
an argument in your life...

159
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,156
and in two minutes flat,
he's got you at it.

160
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,470
He's a king mixer.

161
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,271
He hates group unity,
so he gets everyone at it.

162
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,151
Well, I suggest
you just give him the photos...

163
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:52,273
and have done with it.

164
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:55,717
Oh, all right, you old devil.
Here you are.

165
00:08:57,434 --> 00:09:00,071
Hey, Pauly, would you ever
sign one of them for us?

166
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,354
Ah, come out, Shake.

167
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:13,202
JOHN: Hey, look at the talent.
Let's give 'em a pull.

168
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,958
- Should I?
- Aye, but don't rush.

169
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,557
None of your five bar gate
jumps and over sort of stuff.

170
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,236
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

171
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,240
I thought it just sounded
distinguished-like.

172
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,677
JOHN: George Harrison,
the scouse of distinction.

173
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:24,799
Excuse me, madame.

174
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,844
Excuse me, but these young men
I'm sitting with...

175
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,117
wondered if two of us
could come over and join you.

176
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:34,400
I'd ask you myself,
only I'm shy.

177
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,163
I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't
fraternize with me prisoners.

178
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,081
- Prisoners?
- Convict in transit.

179
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,239
Typical old lads,
the lot of them.

180
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:44,126
Get out, ladies!
Get out while you can!

181
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,044
He's been gone a long time.

182
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:51,963
- Who?
- Paul's grandfather.

183
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,727
Oh, I didn't notice.
Where'd he go?

184
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,240
- Down the, uh...
- Oh, down the, uh...

185
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,526
Yeah, down the, uh...

186
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:59,962
Oh, well, give him
a couple of minutes, then.

187
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,602
Hey, have you seen
Paul's grandfather?

188
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,722
Of course.
He's concealed about me person.

189
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:13,525
Now, he must've slipped off
somewhere.

190
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,165
- Have you lost him?
- Now, don't exaggerate.

191
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,287
You've lost him!

192
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:19,251
Look, put it this way, Pauly...
he's mislaid him.

193
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,246
Honest, you can't trust you
with anything, Norm.

194
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,810
If you've lost him,
I'll cripple ya.

195
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,848
- He can't have got far.
- Let's look up the sharp end.

196
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:28,689
What's the matter
with you, then?

197
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,291
It's his grandfather.

198
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,651
I can tell he doesn't like me.
It's 'cause I'm little.

199
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:35,010
You've got an inferiority
complex, you have.

200
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,612
Yeah, I know.
That's why I play the drums.

201
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,693
It's me active
compensatory factor.

202
00:10:58,577 --> 00:10:59,968
Goin' in, then?

203
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,618
No, she'll only
reject me in the end...

204
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:02,769
and I'll be frustrated.

205
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,898
You never know.
You may be lucky this time.

206
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,337
No, I know
the psychological pattern.

207
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:08,457
It plays havoc
with me drum skins.

208
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,415
Excuse me. Have you seen that
little old man we were with?

209
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,334
We've broken out...
the blessed freedom of it all.

210
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,096
Have you got a nail file?
These handcuffs are killing me.

211
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:25,098
I was framed! I'm innocent!
I don't want to go!

212
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,815
Sorry for disturbing you,
girls.

213
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:29,856
I bet you can't guess
what I was in for.

214
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,855
Should we go in here?

215
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,534
No, it's probably
a honeymoon couple...

216
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,376
or a company director
or something.

217
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,620
Well, I don't care.
I'm gonna broaden my outlook.

218
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,896
Congratulate me, boys.
I'm engaged.

219
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,536
PAUL: Oh, no, you're not.
Not this time.

220
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,581
PAUL: Oh, no, you're not.
Not this time.

221
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,775
And to think me own grandson...

222
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,540
would've let them
put me behind bars.

223
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,900
Don't dramatize. Let's face it,
you're lucky to be here.

224
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,060
If they'd have had
their own way...

225
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,024
you would have been
dropped off already.

226
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,741
Well, you've got to admit
you upset a lot of people.

227
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,141
PAUL: At least I can
keep my eye on you...

228
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,465
while you're stuck in here.

229
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,824
Shove up.

230
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,026
- Odds or evens?
- Odds.

231
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,186
JOHN: Don't worry, son.

232
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,421
We'll get you the best lawyer
green stamps can buy.

233
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,301
PAUL: Oh! It's
a laugh a line with Lennon.

234
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,423
Anyway, it's your fault.

235
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:21,862
- RINGO: Why me?
- Why not you?

236
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,260
JOHN: God, it's depressing
in here, isn't it?

237
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,703
Funny. They usually reckon dogs
more than people in England.

238
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,708
You'd expect something
more palatial.

239
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,545
- Let's do somethin', then.
- Like what?

240
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,904
Hmm.

241
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:37,305
OK.

GEORGE:
Cor, there's the girls.

RINGO: I'll deal 'em.

245
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:46,590
JOHN: Aye aye,
the Liverpool shuffle.

246
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,784
Two for you, two for me,
three for them.

Yeah, you're
a window rattler, son.

Do I snore, Paul?

like yours...

303

don't mock the afflicted.

512
00:27:58,072 --> 00:27:59,789
I always have the handkerchief
in me trouser pocket.

513
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:01,678
You can't blow your nose on it
up there, can you, mister?

that question.

00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:49,004
JOHN: I never noted his nose
till about six months ago.

519

GEORGE: And me mother asked me
before we left for America...

520
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:53,157
if we wanted any sandwiches.

521
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:55,478
JOHN: And when I plugged her
in, she just blew up.

522
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,281
Tell me...
how did you find America?

523

Turn left at Greenland.

524
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,607
- Has success changed your life?
- Yes.

525
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:11,362
I'd like to keep Britain tidy.

526
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:15,209

- Um, no, I'm a mocker.

Have you any hobbies?

No. Actually,
we're just good friends.

530
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:29,164
Do you think these haircuts
have come to stay?

531
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:30,690
Well, this one has, you know.

532
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,809
It's stuck on
good and proper now.

533
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,047
Frightfully nice.

534
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:37,049
What would you call
that hairstyle you're wearing?

No, they're brown, aren't they?

538
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,329
What do you call that collar?

539
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,485
- Oh. A collar.
- Oh.

540
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,250
Do you often see your father?

541
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,966
No. Actually,
we're just good friends.

542
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:55,206
How do you like
your girlfriends to dress?

543

a jam butty, did you?

Anything left?

Hey, George, give us
your John Henry on that picture.

549
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:34,292
Hey, look at that.
Is that our set down there?

550
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,412
- Shall we go down, have a go?
- RINGO: Yeah.

551
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:40,220
- Trees and everything.
- A lot of fellas for one set.

Look, it's a bird.

00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,778

just have a little touch.

You so much as
breathe heavy on them...

560
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,098
and I'm out on strike.

561
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:12,017
Aren't you being
rather arbitrary?

562
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:14,060
There you go,
hiding behind a smoke screen...

563
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,585

I don't go messing about
with your earphones, do I?

- Spoilsport.
- Well?

00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:24,342
He's very fussy
about his drums, you know.

567
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,699
They loom large in his legend.

expecting a musical arranger...

just to upset me.

702

You're letting it
prey on your mind.

00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:40,842
No. This is a battle of nerves
between John and me.

- Nerves.

No.
That's just the trouble.

708

I've toyed with the idea
of a ball and chain...

709
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:52,726
but he'd just rattle them
at me... and in public, too.

710
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,999

seeing me suffer.

- No, I'm not.

- Do I?

- Well, I would've said so.

Oh, you know him better, though.

723
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,412
I do not.
He's only a casual acquaintance.

724

- That's what you say.
- What have you heard?

725

- It's all over the place.
- Is it? Is it really?

726
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:35,045
Mmm, but I wouldn't have it.
I stuck up for you.

Actually, I think he'll be
very pleased with you.

you ought to see him.

Oh, not bad, Dolly...
not really bad.

Oh, yes, he's a definite poss.

755
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:02,224
He'll look good
alongside Susan.

00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:04,421
All right, Sonny Jim, this is
all going to be quite painless.

GEORGE:
I'm terribly sorry...

759
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,063
but there seems to be
some sort of misunderstanding.

760
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:10,579
Oh, you can come off it
with us.

Oh, my God. He's a natural.

765
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:20,141
Well, I did tell them
not to send us real ones.

766
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,424
They ought to know the phonies
are much easier to handle.

767

- Of course I can.

Some people have it dead easy.

you're past it.

No, not really.
They don't need any.

They'll just powder them off
for the shine.

00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,372
Ringo,
look after him, will you?

1025
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:07,451
- Oh, hey, Norm.
- Do I have to raise my voice?

1026
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:10,491
All right. Come on, granddad.

1027
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,928
I'm a drummer,
not a wet nurse, you know.

1028
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:36,696
GRANDFATHER:
Would you look at him...

1029
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:39,851
sitting there with his hooter
scraping away at that book.

1030
00:54:39,851 --> 00:54:42,134
Well, what's the matter
with that?

1031
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:44,734
Have you no natural resources
of your own?

1032
00:54:44,734 --> 00:54:46,575
Have they even robbed you
of that?

1033
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,980
- You can learn from books.
- You can, can you?

1034
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,254
Ahh. Sheeps' heads.

1035
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:54,335
You could learn more by
getting out there and living.

1036
00:54:54,335 --> 00:54:57,021
- Out where?
- Any old where.

1037
00:54:57,021 --> 00:55:00,138
But not our little Richard.
Oh, no.

1038
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,980
When you're not thumping
them pagan skins...

1039
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,502
you're tormenting your eyes
with that rubbish.

1040
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:07,658
- Books are good.
- Parading's better.

1041
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:09,336
Parading?

1042
00:55:09,336 --> 00:55:12,060
Parading the streets...

1043
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,418
trailing your coat,
bowling along... living!

1044
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:19,024
- Well, I am living.
- You? Living?

1045
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,540
When was the last time
you gave a girl...

1046
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,822
a pink-edged daisy?

1047
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:24,942
When did you last
embarrass a Sheila...

1048
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:28,625
with your cool
appraising stare?

1049
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,784
You're a bit old for
that sort of chat, aren't you?

1050
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,942
Well, at least
I've got a backlog of memories.

1051
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:35,464
All you've got is that book.

1052
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:37,785
Ah, stop picking on me. You're
as bad as the rest of them.

1053
00:55:37,785 --> 00:55:40,299
Ah, so you are a man
after all.

1054
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:42,063
What's that mean?

1055
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:44,058
Do you think I haven't noticed?

1056
00:55:44,058 --> 00:55:46,984
Do you think I wasn't aware
of the drift?

1057
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:49,104
You poor, unfortunate scruff.

1058
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:52,547
They've driven you
into books...

1059
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:54,389
with their cruel,
unnatural treatment...

1060
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:56,700
exploiting your good nature.

1061
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,062
I don't know.

1062
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:01,583
Ah, that lot's never happier
unless they're jeering you.

1063
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,705
And where would they be...

1064
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:04,863
without the steady support
of your drum beat?

1065
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,426
That's what I'd like to know.

1066
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:07,827
Yeah. That's right.

1067
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,344
And what's it all come to
in the end?

1068
00:56:12,344 --> 00:56:14,627
Yeah.
What's in it for me?

1069
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:15,711
A book.

1070
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:18,464
Yeah, a bloomin' book.

1071
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:19,788
When you could be out there...

1072
00:56:19,788 --> 00:56:21,553
betraying
a rich American widow...

1073
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:25,792
or sipping palm wine in Tahiti
before you're too old like me.

1074
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:28,909
Yeah, funny, really,
'cause I never thought...

1075
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:30,185
but being
middle-aged and old...

1076
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:31,547
takes up most of your time,
doesn't it?

1077
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:33,513
You're only right.

1078
00:56:36,554 --> 00:56:37,667
Where are you going?

1079
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:40,026
I'm going parading
before it's too late.

1080
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:52,150
Hey, Ringo, you know
what just happened to me?

1081
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,272
No, I don't.

1082
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:56,514
You ought to stop
looking so scornful.

1083
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,953
It's twisting your face.

1084
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,994
Tell him of the story about...

1085
00:57:00,994 --> 00:57:03,075
Hello, here he is,
the middle-aged boy wonder.

1086
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:04,677
I thought you were
looking after the old man.

1087
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:09,319
We've only got half an hour
to the final run-through.

1088
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:10,518
He can't walk out on us now.

1089
00:57:10,518 --> 00:57:12,360
Can't he?
He's done it, son.

1090
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,633
- Hey, you know what happened?
- We know.

1091
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:16,235
Your grandfather.
He's stirred him up.

1092
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:17,357
He hasn't.

1093
00:57:17,357 --> 00:57:20,398
Yeah, he... he filled his head
with notions seemingly.

1094
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:23,074
The old mixer. Come on,
we'll have to put him right.

1095
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:25,836
P.A. ; Coming up, all dancers
onstage for rehearsal, please.

1096
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:32,474
JOHN:
Split up and look for him.

1097
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:39,399
We've become a limited company.

1098
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,276
I'll look in here again.

1099
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:46,919
[This Boy playing]

1100
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,002
- Aah!
- Aah!

1101
00:58:28,844 --> 00:58:31,607
- Hello there.
- Get out of it, shorty.

1102
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,015
Hey, you should
have more sense...

1103
00:59:36,015 --> 00:59:37,694
than to go around
chucking bricks about.

1104
00:59:37,694 --> 00:59:38,979
Southerner.

1105
00:59:42,173 --> 00:59:44,417
Here, mate. That's my hoop.
Stop playing with it.

1106
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,096
Hoop? That isn't a hoop.
It's a lethal weapon.

1107
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:48,974
- Have you got a license for it?
- Oh, don't be so stroppy.

1108
00:59:48,974 --> 00:59:50,815
Well, a boy your age
rolling hoops at people.

1109
00:59:50,815 --> 00:59:52,254
- How old are you, anyway?
- Eleven.

1110
00:59:52,254 --> 00:59:54,815
- I bet you're only 101/2.
- 102/3.

1111
00:59:54,815 --> 00:59:56,896
There you are, then,
and don't be rolling at people.

1112
00:59:56,896 --> 00:59:59,620
Oh, you can have it. I'm
packing it in. It depresses me.

1113
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,539
- Y'what?
- You heard. It gets on my wick.

1114
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:03,457
That's lovely talk, that is.
And why aren't you at school?

1115
01:00:03,457 --> 01:00:05,136
- I'm a deserter.
- Are you now?

1116
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:07,217
- Yeah, I've blown school out.
- Just you?

1117
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:10,258
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon,
and Ding Dong.

1118
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:13,058
- Oh, Ding Dong bell, eh?
- Yeah, that's right.

1119
01:00:13,058 --> 01:00:14,977
They was supposed to come
with us, but they chickened.

1120
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:16,502
RINGO: Yeah? And they're
your mates, are they?

1121
01:00:16,502 --> 01:00:17,624
Yeah.

1122
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:19,063
RINGO: Not much cop
without 'em, is it?

1123
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,981
- Oh, it's all right.
- Yeah? What are they like?

1124
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:23,945
BOY: Ginger's mad.
He says things all the time.

1125
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:25,787
And Eddy's good
at spitting and punching.

1126
01:00:25,787 --> 01:00:26,986
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?

1127
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:29,547
Oh, he's a big head.
He fancies himself, you know.

1128
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:31,062
He's all right, though,
'cause he's one of the gang.

1129
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,347
Hmm.

1130
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:35,148
- Why aren't you at work?
- I'm a deserter, too.

1131
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:37,220
- Oh.
- Hey, Charlie!

1132
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:40,308
See ya!

1133
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:58,542
MAN: Come in, number seven.
Your time's up.

1134
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:04,825
I'm sorry, boys.
I didn't mean it, honest.

1135
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:10,187
If he says that again,
I'll strike him.

1136
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:12,431
Oh, don't worry. They're
good lads. They'll be back.

1137
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:15,625
Well, we've only twenty minutes
to the final run-through.

1138
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:19,587
I meant no harm.

1139
01:01:19,587 --> 01:01:22,867
I was only trying to encourage
little Ringo to enjoy himself.

1140
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:26,473
God knows what you've unleashed
on the unsuspecting south.

1141
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:29,188
It'll be wine, women, and song
all the way with Ringo...

1142
01:01:29,188 --> 01:01:30,272
when he gets the taste for it.

1143
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:42,597
That was fresh this morning.
Two and nine.

1144

[Parrot screeching]

1145
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:30,038
- Right. On your way.
- You what?

1146
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,800
You heard. On your way.
Troublemaker!

1147
01:02:39,562 --> 01:02:40,963
Hey, watch it!

1148
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:47,360
- Shake.
- What?

1149
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,605
Worry, will you?

1150
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:53,240
Well, that's it. Two minutes
to the final run-through.

1151
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,801
- They're bound to miss it now.
- I'll murder that Lennon.

1152
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:58,084
We could survive a missed
run-through as long as they...

1153
01:02:58,084 --> 01:02:59,839
SHAKE: As long as
they end up for the show?

1154
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,048
Oh, you're right there.
I mean, it wouldn't do...

1155
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:02,208
to miss the show,
like, would it?

1156
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,686
NORM: Shut up, cheerful.

1157
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:06,007
You don't think...
Oh, oh, oh no.

1158
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:08,606
- Now, look, don't worry.
- They can't do this to me, no.

1159
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:11,244
It's all your fault.
Oh, yes, it is.

1160
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:13,201
If they don't turn up
I wouldn't be in your shoes...

1161
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:15,004
For all the tea in China.

1162
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,682
Oh, you're right there.
Neither would it.

1163
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:19,167
- You dirty traitor.
- Well, of course.

1164
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:20,845
Yes, of course.

- Hi, John. John!

01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:27,732
- Did you want something?
- I could eat the lot of you.

1168

You'd look great
with an apple in your gob.

1169

Do you realize you could have
missed the final run-through?

1170
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:32,969
Oh, we're sorry about that.

There's only three of 'em.

Oh, we were
looking for Ringo...

but we realized
he must've come back here.

Well, do you realize
that we are on the air live...

1175
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:42,369
in front of an audience
in forty-five minutes...

1176
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:43,808
and you're one short?

or you'll spurt.

1178
01:03:45,486 --> 01:03:46,810

Aye, well, we'll look
in the dressing room.

- Yes, the dressing room.

Don't worry about him, Paul.

1187
01:04:01,332 --> 01:04:04,929
Be the envy
of your less fortunate sisters!

1188
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:07,288
GRANDFATHER: Oh, me bones.

1189
01:04:07,288 --> 01:04:10,137
All right, break it up.
Break it up. Move on.

1190
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,698
Hey, what's going on here?
Right, move over. Move over.

1191
01:04:12,698 --> 01:04:13,849
- Come on, move along.
- Here you are.

1192
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:16,851
Why don't you go back home?
You're making a disturbance.

1193
01:04:16,851 --> 01:04:19,096
Will you just move along now?

1194
01:04:19,096 --> 01:04:21,331
[Indistinct arguing]

1195
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:22,971
Come on, ya. Aah! Yeahh!

1196
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:33,455
[Ringo humming]

1197
01:04:36,255 --> 01:04:37,579
Thank you.

1198
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:40,859
[Humming]

1199
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,583
- [Whistles]
- Gotcha!

1200
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:56,897
You nasty little person, you.

1201
01:04:56,897 --> 01:05:00,024
RINGO:
Come on! Ooh, yeah.

1202
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,261
I'm Ringo Starr.

1203
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:03,141
I've got a show to do.
I'm on in a few minutes.

1204
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:04,896
You've got to let me go.
I'm Ringo.

1205
01:05:04,896 --> 01:05:06,383
Yeah, that's what
they all say these days.

1206
01:05:06,383 --> 01:05:07,544
Look, I don't care who you are.

1207
01:05:07,544 --> 01:05:09,145
You can save that
for the stipendiary.

1208
01:05:09,145 --> 01:05:11,821
- Here you are, sarge.
- All right. What is he?

1209
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,183
Yeah, I got a little list here.

1210
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:15,658
Wandering abroad,
malicious intent...

1211
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:17,222
acting
in a suspicious manner...

1212
01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:19,025
conduct liable to cause
a breach of the peace.

1213
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:20,425
OFFICER:
You name it, he's done it.

1214
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:21,739
Oh, a little savage, is he?

1215
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:23,427
Yeah, a proper
little aborigine.

1216
01:05:23,427 --> 01:05:26,708
- I demand to see my solicitor.
- What's his name?

1217
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:29,307
Well, if you're gonna
get technical about it.

1218
01:05:29,307 --> 01:05:30,420
GRANDFATHER: Dragging me
through the streets...

1219
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,261
Hello, it's gonna be
one of those nights, is it?

1220
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,304
Sit Charlie Peace down
over there, will you?

1221
01:05:34,304 --> 01:05:37,105
Well, you got me here,
so do your worst...

1222
01:05:37,105 --> 01:05:39,666
but, by God,
I'll take one of you with me.

1223
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,390
- Ow!
- I know your game!

1224
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:46,783
Get me into that tiled room and
then out come the rubber hoses.

1225
01:05:46,783 --> 01:05:48,951
Oh, there's a fire, is there?

1226
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:51,752
You ugly great brute.
You have sadism...

1227
01:05:51,752 --> 01:05:54,150
stamped all over
your bloated British kisser.

1228
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,068
- Eh?
- I'll go on hunger strike.

1229
01:05:56,068 --> 01:05:57,910
I know your caper.

1230
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,828
The kidney punch
and the rabbit clout.

1231
01:05:59,828 --> 01:06:02,869
The third degree and
the size twelve boot ankle tap.

1232
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:04,231
What's he on about?

1233
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:06,149
GRANDFATHER: I'm a soldier
of the republic.

1234
01:06:06,149 --> 01:06:08,873
You'll need the mahogany
truncheon on this boyo.

1235
01:06:08,873 --> 01:06:11,587
# A nation once again #

1236
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:13,669
# A nation once again #

1237
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,271
Get Lloyd George over there...

1238
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,786
next to the mechanic
in the cloth cap...

1239
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:18,311
while I sort this lot out,
will you?

1240
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:21,112
OFFICER: Come on, dad.
Sit down over here.

1241
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:22,551
Ringo, me old scout!

1242
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,594
So they grabbed your leg
for the iron, too, have they?

1243
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:26,148
I'm not exactly
a voluntary patient.

1244
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,913
Shh, shh.
Have they roughed you up yet?

1245
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:29,035
What?

1246
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:31,116
Oh, they're a desperate crew
of drippings...

1247
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:33,274
and they've fists
like matured hams...

1248
01:06:33,274 --> 01:06:35,269
for pounding poor
defenseless lads like you.

1249
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:36,478
Right, that's it, then.

1250
01:06:36,478 --> 01:06:38,157
GRANDFATHER:
One of us has got to escape.

1251
01:06:38,157 --> 01:06:39,269
I'll get the boys.

1252
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:41,197
- Hold on. I'll be back for you.
- For me?

1253
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:44,314
If they get you on the floor,
watch out for your brisket.

1254
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:45,830
They seem all right to me.

1255
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,758
Ah, sure, that's what
they want you to think.

1256
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:49,513
All coppers are villains.

1257
01:06:49,513 --> 01:06:51,278
SERGEANT: Would you two
like a cup of tea?

1258
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:54,319
See? Sly villains.

1259
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,314
Um, no, thank you,
Mr. Sergeant, sir.

1260
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:58,155
No, not for me. Please don't.

1261
01:06:58,155 --> 01:06:59,920
So you just
brought the old chap...

1262
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,359
out of the crowd
for his own good, eh?

1263
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,798
Well, he was getting
a bit nasty, you see...

1264
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:04,073
so we had to bring him in.

1265
01:07:04,073 --> 01:07:05,675
Well, he can't stop here.

1266
01:07:05,675 --> 01:07:07,277
This is the stuff
he's been hawking around, eh?

1267
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:09,675
- Yes, sergeant... photographs.
- Photographs.

1268
01:07:09,675 --> 01:07:13,042
Well, son, it's now or never.

1269
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:15,440
All right, you paid assassins!
Johnny McCartney...

1270
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,195
will give you a run
for your thruppence halfpenny.

1271
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:18,557
Hey, you forgot
your photographs.

1272
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,724
Only half an hour,
and you're on.

1273
01:07:28,724 --> 01:07:30,959
- Can I say something?
- Yes. Anything.

1274
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:33,357
It seems highly unlikely
we'll be on.

1275
01:07:33,357 --> 01:07:36,004
I mean, the law of averages
are against it.

1276
01:07:36,004 --> 01:07:38,325
I think if you could
get the juggler on...

1277
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,400
with a couple more clubs...

1278
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,481
that would fill in
a bit of time.

1279
01:07:54,564 --> 01:07:55,840
Come on, let's go!

1280
01:07:58,526 --> 01:08:00,885
I'll have the hides
off of you lot.

1281
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:02,688
[Laughing]

1282
01:08:02,688 --> 01:08:04,568
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself. Go home.

1283
01:08:04,568 --> 01:08:05,681
I must see Pauly.

1284
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,408
Go home, then,
and see him on the telly.

1285
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,685
- Can you fix him for me?
- Yeah.

1286
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:13,009
Sixpence.

1287
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:14,927
- Each.
- In advance.

1288
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,843
Mercenaries.

1289
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:27,684
[Laughing]

1290
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:41,007
It's all right.
Leave him alone.

1291
01:08:41,007 --> 01:08:42,168
P.A. ; What's up, Richard?

1292
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,288
GRANDFATHER:
Paul? Where are you? I'm...

1293
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:48,652
PAUL:
Granddad. Where's Ringo?

1294
01:08:48,652 --> 01:08:51,654
The police have the poor lad
in the bridewell.

1295
01:08:51,654 --> 01:08:54,292
- The police station.
- He'll be pulp by now.

1296
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,210
- NORM: Go get him!
- PAUL: We'll get him out.

1297
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,414
- JOHN: We'll fix it, Norm.
- [Beatles barking]

1298
01:08:59,414 --> 01:09:01,457
We've only got twenty minutes.

1299
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:05,131
# Can't buy me love #

1300
01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:06,934

a lot to give #

1311

I'll give to you #

What is all this?

1325
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,625
[Panting] Hold on
till we catch our breath.

1326
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:18,066
Fine.
Are you all right now?

1327
01:10:18,066 --> 01:10:20,099
[Pants] Yeah.

1328
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:22,027

- See.

[Screaming]

1345
01:11:08,509 --> 01:11:08,710
I had to laugh even when
they kick the stool away.

1346
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:11,310
I had to laugh even when
they kick the stool away.

[Giggles]

1348
01:11:13,113 --> 01:11:16,067
Lads. Lads! You're back!
Thank goodness. Where's Ringo?

1349
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:18,072
- There he is. We got him.
- Great, great, great.

1350
01:11:18,072 --> 01:11:19,875
You don't know
what this means to me.

1351
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,669
If you hadn't come back,
it would have meant...

1352
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:25,074
the epilogue
or news in Welsh for life.

1353
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:27,318
Hey, aren't you
supposed to be in that box?

1354
01:11:27,318 --> 01:11:29,870
- Yeah, where's the old mixer?
- Here, Pauly.

1355
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,191
Got a few words to say to you,
two-faced John McCartney.

1356
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,793
Aw, leave him alone.
He's back, isn't he?

1357
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:36,114
- It's not his fault he's old.
- What's old got to do with it?

1358
01:11:36,114 --> 01:11:38,675
He's a troublemaker and a mixer.
That's good enough for me.

1359
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:40,871
You're right. He's only asking
for attention, aren't you?

1360
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:42,799
You see, you know your trouble.

1361
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,631
You should've gone west
to America.

1362
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:46,559
You would've been
a senior citizen of Boston.

1363
01:11:46,559 --> 01:11:47,998
But you took a wrong turn,
and what happened?

1364
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:49,753
You're a lonely old man
from Liverpool.

1365
01:11:49,753 --> 01:11:52,401
- But I'm clean.
- Are you?

1366
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:53,916
- Hey, Norm.
- What?

1367
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,115
I've been thinking.

1368
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:56,918
- It's not my fault.
- What isn't?

1369
01:11:56,918 --> 01:12:00,793
I'm not taller than you are.
You're smaller than I am.

1370
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:02,482
Anyone at home?

1371
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:04,122
Hey, Shake, where's me boot?

1372
01:12:04,122 --> 01:12:05,877
Will you get us some tea
while you're there?

1373
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:07,038
- All right, George.
- Ta.

1374
01:12:07,038 --> 01:12:09,723
- Come on, lads. Get changed.
- Come on, get some tea.

1525
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:47,836
# And I've been working
like a dog #

1526
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,682
# It's been
a hard day's night #

1527
01:21:51,682 --> 01:21:55,039
# I should be sleeping
like a log #

1528
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:57,082
# But when I get home to you #

1529
01:21:57,082 --> 01:21:59,883
Come on,
you're hanging up the parade!

1530
01:22:01,197 --> 01:22:02,319
Get rid of those things!

1531
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,120
# You know I work all day #

1532
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,237
# To get you money
to buy you things #

1533
01:22:08,237 --> 01:22:11,882
# And it's worth it
just to hear you say #

1534
01:22:11,882 --> 01:22:15,287
# You're gonna give me
everything #

1535
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:16,927
# So why on earth
should I moan #

1536
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:18,721
# 'Cause
when I get you alone #

1537
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:21,800
# You know I feel OK #

1538
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,519
# When I'm home #

1539
01:22:22,519 --> 01:22:24,361
# When I'm home #

1540
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:27,248
# Everything
seems to be right #

1541
01:22:28,447 --> 01:22:31,161
# When I'm home #

1542
01:22:31,161 --> 01:22:34,202
# Feeling you
holding me tight #

1543
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:35,650
# Tight, yeah #

1544
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,969
# It's been
a hard day's night #

1545
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:42,403

1546

1549
01:22:50,844 --> 01:22:52,609
# I find
the things that you do #

1550
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:55,486
# Will make me
feel all right #

1551
01:22:55,486 --> 01:22:56,733
# Aah #

1552
01:23:09,528 --> 01:23:11,370
