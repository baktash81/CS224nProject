1
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,449
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,263
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,731
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,532
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,072
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,441
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:10,013
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:11,414
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:14,112
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:20,689
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:24,993
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,468
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:32,904
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,203
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:37,277
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:02,501
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,163
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:11,609
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,874
You should be proud.

20
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:29,255
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,383
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,551
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:57,088
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,821
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:04,559
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,428
You do good in school?

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,576
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:16,338
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,447
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:31,219
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:34,091
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:35,892
Good.

33
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,591
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,535
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,700
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:50,005
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:52,479
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,210
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:58,878
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:01,217
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:02,985
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,025
You have to take it.

43
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,464
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,099
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,966
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,906
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:23,078
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:33,582
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,994
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:42,463
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,899
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:50,599
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,539
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:57,273
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:01,414
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,387
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:09,689
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:12,558
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,825
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,630
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:22,672
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,004
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,304
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,916
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,644
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,719
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:48,697
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:52,565
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,530
Pencils.

70
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,575
Begin.

71
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,313
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:16,527
Forget it.

73
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:20,325
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:26,603
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,567
They are.

76
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:32,303
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,917
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,917
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,111
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:44,654
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:47,384
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,826
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:54,497
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:57,762
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:01,704
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:07,245
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,348
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,610
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:26,825
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,766
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:41,705
School's out.

92
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,418
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,210
You earned it.

94
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:50,447
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,149
All right.

96
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,851
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,930
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,224
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,097
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,635
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,205
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,435
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,773
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,693
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:31,354
- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,399
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:38,402
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:43,071
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:45,235
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,442
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:51,984
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,386
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,190
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:14,101
You can sit.

115
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,780
So...

116
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,716
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:29,684
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:31,552
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,218
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,322
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,024
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,227
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,804
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:47,908
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,537
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,239
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,056
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:06,523
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:10,426
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,533
That's right.

131
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,095
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,502
Closed casket?

133
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:22,940
That's right.

134
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:25,480
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:28,776
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,351
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,292
I got a question.

138
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,519
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,933
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:59,342
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:04,319
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,450
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,752
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,590
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:19,500
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,765
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,772
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,773
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:33,314
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,509
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:40,020
- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,953
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,296
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:53,027
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:56,297
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:56,473 --> 00:12:00,739
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,970
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:05,876
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:08,812
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:11,147
And we will do it.

161
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,779
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,253
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,486
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,593
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,225
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:28,930
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:31,803
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,068
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:38,203
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,112
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,447
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,748
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,687
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,157
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:54,297
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:56,932
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,569
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,605
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:06,676
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:09,141
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:13,182
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,581
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,687
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:22,121
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,262
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,921
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,863
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,928
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,337
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,478
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:45,139
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:50,380
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:54,881
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,687
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:02,154
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,500
We have a question.

197
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:13,338
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:14,809
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,642
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,444
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,418
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,854
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,117
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,261
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:31,793
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,535
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:42,232
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:45,241
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:48,244
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:52,009
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,845
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,112
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:03,020
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,126
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,794
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,809
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,912
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:25,482
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,486
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:34,650
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:38,062
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,257
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:45,130
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:50,004
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:54,942
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:02,087
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:08,119
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:13,724
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,528
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,934
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:24,065
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:27,647
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,380
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:34,384
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,889
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,557
No.

238
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:43,156
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,354
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:50,227
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,701
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,336
Sure.

243
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:00,644
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,339
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,714
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:10,084
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,055
Amen.

248
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,481
So what do I do?

249
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:40,618
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,882
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,390
Tax-free.

252
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:51,296
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:55,196
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,427
Given your nature.

255
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,607
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,299
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:04,171
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,673
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:11,208
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:14,253
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:18,380
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,892
Do it again.

263
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:24,725
For me.

264
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,969
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:05,038
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:08,540
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,373
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,228
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:33,333
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:36,494
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,839
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,274
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,676
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:49,211
So you know.

275
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:52,218
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,190
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:58,486
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,290
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,858
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:08,595
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,773
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,204
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,540
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,040
I got, like...

285
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:25,676
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,619
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,454
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:35,325
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,864
You know what you...

290
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,366
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:45,634
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:49,710
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,506
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:02,555
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,520
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,258
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:14,962
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:18,608
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,869
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:25,014
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:28,617
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:32,244
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,856
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,754
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,919
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:41,929
...concerned.

308
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:47,971
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,505
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,438
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,078
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,974
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,641
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:03,786
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,455
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,716
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,056
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,428
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,533
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,175
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,978
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:36,044
Do you know me?

323
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,083
No. No.

324
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,457
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,618
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,787
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,228
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,063
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,263
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:00,635
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:05,741
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,876
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,886
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,352
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,619
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,529
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,960
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,938
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,408
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,684
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,254
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,096
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,238
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,075
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:07,177
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,938
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,345
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,746
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,479
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,090
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,090
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,195
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,629
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,064
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,069
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,138
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,640
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,371
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,810
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,816
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,817
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,821
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,551
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,662
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,889
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,432
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,763
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,495
Southie projects.

369
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,335
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,535
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,441
- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,674
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,047
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,949
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,558
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,194
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,888
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,534
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,101
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:40,707
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:44,605
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,377
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,243
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:51,748
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,819
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,613
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:56,423 --> 00:26:00,086
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,160
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,395
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,298
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:13,304
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:15,634
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,801
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,812
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:23,814
Allegedly.

396
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:25,980
Allegedly.

397
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:28,621
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,758
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,983
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,288
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,329
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,440
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:50,043
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,012
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:09,025
You making a house call?

406
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:11,654
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,325
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:19,166
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,935
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:26,945
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,776
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,408
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,680
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,949
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,253
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:41,725
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,763
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:48,426
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:51,368
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,201
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,173
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:27:57,346 --> 00:28:02,443
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:04,847
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,046
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:09,714
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:23,332
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:26,338
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:29,635
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,939
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:34,412
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,413
Cut him here.

432
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:39,654
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:44,917
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,756
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,457
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:54,603
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,261
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:00,465
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:01,871
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:05,480
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:09,106
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:12,744
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,756
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:18,359
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,394
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,793
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,197
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:29,462
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:31,162
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:33,400
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,100
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:49,118
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,052
Fuck!

454
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:54,390
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,670
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:12,008
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:16,243
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,893
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:26,620
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,354
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:31,933
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,437
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,545
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:44,077
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:54,187
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,222
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:59,022
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:02,730
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,299
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:04,468 --> 00:31:06,800
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:10,367
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,940
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,274
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:19,080
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:24,716
Don't you?

476
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,357
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,959
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:32,686
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,130
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:40,434
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:43,768
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,932
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,271
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,607
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:55,949
Fair enough.

486
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:59,818
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,020
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:04,457
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:08,357
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,361
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,630
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:17,741
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,836
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:25,048
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:29,243
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:34,323
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:38,359
Schuyler.

498
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:54,341
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:57,582 --> 00:32:59,106
No.

500
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:07,455
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:20,127
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,703
No.

503
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,282
Come with me.

504
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,086
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:45,755
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:49,800
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:58,708
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:01,039
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:03,947
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:07,711
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,913
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,490
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,727
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,094
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,769
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,237
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:32,138
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:34,180
Shoes.

519
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,311
I knew your father.

520
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:48,622
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:52,464
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:56,292
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,200
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,205
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,035
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:09,679
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,250
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:15,855
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,888
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,320
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,017
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:24,527
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,865
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:37,942
He's clean.

535
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:41,376
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:45,348
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,479
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:54,957
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,063
I just can't know.

540
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:02,730
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:07,132
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:10,644
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:13,645
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:19,485
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:22,782
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:25,985
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,958
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:32,364
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:37,996
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:42,902
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,543
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,052
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,656
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,063
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,290
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,830
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,164
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:13,432
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,936
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:18,806
Well, these days...

561
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:21,106
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:23,617
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,779
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,425
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:39,667
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:42,497
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,136
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:51,203
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,478
She wasn't.

570
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,651
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,783
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,986
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,891
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:11,157
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:35,549
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:39,422
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:42,360
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:43,999
Thanks.

579
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:50,497
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:52,470
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:53,904
All right, see you then.

582
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:00,111
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,116
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:15,357
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:17,261
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:21,733
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:24,100
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:27,433
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,378
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:36,850
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,085
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:55,237
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,400
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,073
Lennon said:

595
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:06,510
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:11,087
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,690
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,125
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,903
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,741
Too bad.

601
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:36,242
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:38,148 --> 00:40:39,137
Now what?

603
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,619
Choir practice.

604
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:44,985
Choir practice...

605
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:52,261
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:57,163
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:58,995
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,637
For instance...

609
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:03,205
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:06,542
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,541
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:12,205
French.

613
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:14,852
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,715
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:20,853
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,993
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:25,391
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:27,498
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:31,333
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:42,208
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:45,073
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,514
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:50,086
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:50,255 --> 00:41:52,553
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:55,592
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,695
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,263
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,697
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:04,858
...you let us know.

630
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:11,036
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:13,707
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,869
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:19,343
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:21,849
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,217
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,221
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:28,494 --> 00:42:30,428
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:33,591
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:37,030
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:40,228
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,474
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:48,806
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,915
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:55,212
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:58,788
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,483
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,594
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:11,528
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:12,728
Hey.

650
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,004
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,910
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,711
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:27,682
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,754
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:33,221
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:33,392 --> 00:43:36,020
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,289
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:40,989
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,294
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:44,471 --> 00:43:47,338
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:51,739
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,638
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,008
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:57,309
- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:59,577
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:59,753 --> 00:44:02,586
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,018
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,421
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:09,027
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,255
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,695
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:15,198
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:17,996
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,405
Bottom line...

675
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,668
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:25,710
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,780
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,248
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,014
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,621
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,917
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,223
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:46,889
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:49,966
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,797
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:54,908
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:56,703
Good.

688
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:00,076
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,044
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,569
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:25,468
You know...

692
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:29,107
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:31,336
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,776
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,746
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,148
And he could do it...

697
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:43,622
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:52,993
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,659
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,135
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:01,835
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,776
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:11,377
And I think about this.

704
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,987
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:20,795 --> 00:46:23,696
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,890
School?

707
00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:30,633
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:32,899
...school is out.

709
00:46:33,642 --> 00:46:36,406
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,475
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:43,650
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:46,481
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:48,881
Little boys...

714
00:46:49,324 --> 00:46:53,488
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:56,496
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:03,903
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:08,100
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:13,581
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:17,150
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:20,114
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:21,984
Pay them.

722
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,353
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:36,296
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:38,838
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:40,942
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,669
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:46,508
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:46,682 --> 00:47:49,310
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:51,452
Beeper number.

730
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:54,453
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:57,823
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:04,533
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,827
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:10,430
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,665
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,104
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:14,277 --> 00:48:16,939
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:19,441
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:23,073
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:26,245
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:28,083
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,787
I beeped you.

743
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:36,089
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:39,667
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:44,306
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:46,773
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:51,482 --> 00:48:55,009
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:48:58,288 --> 00:49:01,621
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,386
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,921
So make the call.

751
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,028
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:18,442 --> 00:49:21,104
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:42,389
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,500
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:48,971
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:53,238
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,173
Bye.

758
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,577
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,928
Thank you.

760
00:50:18,236 --> 00:50:19,669
So who are you?

761
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:23,273
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:25,102
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:28,609
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:31,475
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,742
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:37,285
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,265
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,868
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:04,516 --> 00:51:08,043
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,559
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:17,320
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,369
Do you lie?

773
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:32,266
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:34,139
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:35,214 --> 00:51:37,614
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,876
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:41,212
You lie.

778
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,045
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:46,282
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:51,885
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:57,325
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:02,935
Did you?

783
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:04,735
No.

784
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:08,809
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:11,575
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:15,683
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:15,855 --> 00:52:17,755
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:40,340
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:48,552
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,518
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:55,358
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:57,758
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:57,997 --> 00:52:59,726
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:59,899 --> 00:53:03,096
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,899
And your hand...

796
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:08,973
...steady.

797
00:53:11,378 --> 00:53:15,678
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:18,044
...does not shake.

799
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:20,342
Ever.

800
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,322
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,791
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:38,171
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:43,139
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,471
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:48,842
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:52,246
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,780
Should I?

808
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:58,422
So do they all come in here...

809
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:00,822
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:04,296
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:07,661
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:07,835 --> 00:54:09,962
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:11,971
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,437
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:17,076
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:20,145
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:23,340
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:23,517 --> 00:54:25,314
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,660
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:38,357
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:38,532 --> 00:54:40,056
Yeah.

822
00:54:40,335 --> 00:54:42,360
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:47,002
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:49,005
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:50,809
No.

826
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:57,473
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:57,651 --> 00:55:01,052
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:04,123
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:06,658
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:06,828 --> 00:55:08,420
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,724
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,028
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:17,569
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:21,300
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:23,501
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:25,441
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,048
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:31,447
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,215
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,517
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:39,922
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:45,465
- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:49,536
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,398
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:52,574 --> 00:55:55,873
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:57,603
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:00,145
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,112
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:06,414
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:06,588 --> 00:56:09,887
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:11,753
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:11,928 --> 00:56:14,863
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:18,728
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:20,596
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:22,532
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:25,071
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,468
You know that.

858
00:56:27,777 --> 00:56:29,642
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,244
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,842
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:39,148
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:41,318
No bullshit.

863
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:45,020
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,454
You serious?

865
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:51,429
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:55,438 --> 00:56:57,998
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:56:58,174 --> 00:56:59,835
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,875
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,844
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:08,313
We are this close:

871
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,115
All right?

872
00:57:13,422 --> 00:57:15,151
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:15,324 --> 00:57:18,122
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:21,219
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:21,497 --> 00:57:23,294
...what do you want?

876
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,133
You want the truth?

877
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:28,995
Valium.

878
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:32,466
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:32,642 --> 00:57:36,043
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:39,910
- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:44,417
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,179
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:47,880
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:48,058 --> 00:57:50,754
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:52,758
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:56,557
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:57:56,732 --> 00:57:59,326
- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:57:59,503 --> 00:58:03,633
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:04,796
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:04,975 --> 00:58:09,036
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:11,945
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,520
Two pills?

893
00:58:22,392 --> 00:58:24,553
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:24,728 --> 00:58:26,889
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:27,064 --> 00:58:30,056
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:32,633
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:37,240
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:40,235
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:51,614
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:53,586
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:55,657
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:55,827 --> 00:59:00,924
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:03,965
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:07,561
What's this?

905
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,872
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah?

907
00:59:12,776 --> 00:59:14,403
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:14,979 --> 00:59:17,470
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:19,809
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:23,715
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:23,888 --> 00:59:27,517
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:28,954
Thank you.

913
00:59:30,194 --> 00:59:32,754
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,921
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,660
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:48,377
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:49,911
Come on in.

918
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:55,008
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:56,779
Yes, those.

920
00:59:56,954 --> 01:00:00,685
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:03,383
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:05,826
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,591
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:11,632
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:14,864
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,405
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:20,909
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:23,273
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:27,407
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:28,252 --> 01:00:31,187
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:31,356 --> 01:00:33,881
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:36,823
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:39,327
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:39,498 --> 01:00:41,523
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,262
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,503
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,840
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:58,506
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,251
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:04,920
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,251
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:13,562
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,229
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:18,266
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:21,061
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,708
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,640
Thank you.

948
01:01:29,882 --> 01:01:31,816
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:31,985 --> 01:01:35,148
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:38,051
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:41,159
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:42,953
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:47,934 --> 01:01:50,664
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:53,334
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:53,506 --> 01:01:56,270
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:01:58,778 --> 01:02:02,578
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:05,785 --> 01:02:06,945
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:42,155 --> 01:02:44,385
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:49,359
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:51,358
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:53,563
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:02,607
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:06,736
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:06,914 --> 01:03:09,906
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:35,699
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:37,777
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:37,945 --> 01:03:40,675
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:43,908
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:53,286
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:57,323
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:11,046 --> 01:04:13,571
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,882
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:17,285 --> 01:04:20,982
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:24,557
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:26,622
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:36,437
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:39,232
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:42,706
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:45,669
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:45,847 --> 01:04:48,042
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:08,968
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:09,137 --> 01:05:11,298
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,002
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,576
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:18,211
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,940
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:23,016
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,154
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,199
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,240
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:48,899
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:52,175
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:53,810
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,478
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,956
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:08,392
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,972
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,269
...is one guy...

999
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,635
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,108
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,710
...pays him.

1002
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:31,510
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,351
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,892
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,009
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,781
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:13,020
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,536
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,606
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,543
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,115
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:39,478
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:42,922
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:43,094 --> 01:07:46,359
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:46,697 --> 01:07:48,892
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,295
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:54,461
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:56,664
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,468
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:02,477
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,114
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:07,341
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:10,681
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:10,855 --> 01:08:14,882
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:18,586
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:18,763 --> 01:08:23,223
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:25,869
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:26,037 --> 01:08:27,902
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:31,132
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:34,403
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,581
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:43,755 --> 01:08:46,155
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:46,324 --> 01:08:48,349
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:51,263 --> 01:08:53,629
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:57,093
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:03,002
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:04,699
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:06,878 --> 01:09:09,346
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:10,878
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:11,049 --> 01:09:14,746
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:15,354 --> 01:09:17,379
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:20,014
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:22,888
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:25,393
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:29,527
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:36,035
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:44,413
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:48,110
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:48,286 --> 01:09:50,379
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:55,927 --> 01:09:57,895
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:09:58,463 --> 01:10:00,488
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:02,466
Yeah.

1053
01:10:03,902 --> 01:10:05,494
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:05,904 --> 01:10:07,132
Sure.

1055
01:10:09,775 --> 01:10:12,403
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:12,577 --> 01:10:14,738
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:16,681
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:16,848 --> 01:10:19,009
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:20,777
We might have company.

1060
01:10:20,952 --> 01:10:22,943
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:27,090
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,957
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,319
Yeah?

1064
01:10:32,497 --> 01:10:35,432
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:39,128
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:40,906 --> 01:10:44,273
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:45,044 --> 01:10:47,512
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:48,246 --> 01:10:50,806
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:52,678
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:54,319
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:56,714
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:10:56,889 --> 01:10:59,084
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,789
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:02,962 --> 01:11:05,760
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:06,232 --> 01:11:07,529
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:09,225
What?

1077
01:11:09,702 --> 01:11:11,829
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:12,004 --> 01:11:15,997
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:19,338
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,545
Something for work.

1081
01:11:22,715 --> 01:11:26,583
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:29,051
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:31,850
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:32,024 --> 01:11:33,719
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:33,893 --> 01:11:37,624
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:39,628
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:43,200
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:47,101
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,175
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:51,345 --> 01:11:52,972
So earn it.

1091
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:55,906
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:56,082 --> 01:11:57,982
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:11:58,285 --> 01:12:00,685
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:00,854 --> 01:12:03,652
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:04,915
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:08,687
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:10,056
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,097
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:13,267 --> 01:12:14,825
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,870
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,497
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:24,610
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:24,778 --> 01:12:28,942
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:32,381
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:32,553 --> 01:12:35,750
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:35,923 --> 01:12:40,451
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:40,627 --> 01:12:42,424
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:45,031
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:47,393
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:49,298
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:52,632
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:56,105
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:56,276 --> 01:12:58,767
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:05,587 --> 01:13:07,953
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:16,619
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:16,798 --> 01:13:19,596
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:22,428
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:26,597
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:28,901
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:29,077 --> 01:13:32,979
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:33,147 --> 01:13:35,138
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:38,283
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:38,453 --> 01:13:41,911
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:45,053
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,788
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:50,124
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:50,298 --> 01:13:53,631
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:55,337 --> 01:13:58,170
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:13:58,841 --> 01:14:01,503
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:01,676 --> 01:14:05,635
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:10,781
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:12,978
...or your life.

1133
01:14:13,956 --> 01:14:16,948
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:17,593 --> 01:14:19,322
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,775
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:23,412 --> 01:14:25,573
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:25,748 --> 01:14:27,511
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:28,483 --> 01:14:30,644
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,449
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:36,859
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,893
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:41,164 --> 01:14:44,725
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:49,270
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:14:57,313 --> 01:14:58,302
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:14:59,248 --> 01:15:00,715
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,677
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:08,457 --> 01:15:10,322
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:12,518
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:12,695 --> 01:15:15,528
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:15,698 --> 01:15:20,101
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:20,269 --> 01:15:22,760
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,734
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:30,071
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:32,181
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:35,339
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:35,519 --> 01:15:39,285
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:41,717
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:45,794
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:47,619
Fuck!

1160
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:51,096
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:55,227
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:55,405 --> 01:15:57,896
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:15:58,275 --> 01:16:00,971
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:04,238
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:04,414 --> 01:16:07,406
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:14,925 --> 01:16:17,155
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,659
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:24,629
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:29,101
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:29,273 --> 01:16:31,639
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:36,040
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:37,214 --> 01:16:39,842
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:43,554 --> 01:16:46,921
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:51,995 --> 01:16:53,690
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:53,998 --> 01:16:57,126
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:16:57,302 --> 01:17:00,669
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:00,837 --> 01:17:02,327
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:02,507 --> 01:17:06,102
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:06,277 --> 01:17:07,904
Come on.

1180
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:44,677
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:50,221 --> 01:17:52,121
There it is.

1182
01:17:52,757 --> 01:17:55,248
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,209
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:14,546 --> 01:18:16,377
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:20,074
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:22,344
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:25,718
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:25,891 --> 01:18:29,827
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:29,995 --> 01:18:31,826
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:32,664 --> 01:18:35,394
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:48,906
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:54,784
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:54,954 --> 01:18:57,616
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:18:58,123 --> 01:19:00,591
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:07,555
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:07,733 --> 01:19:09,894
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:11,330
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:12,800
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:13,572 --> 01:19:15,563
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:17,239
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:17,609 --> 01:19:20,134
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:20,312 --> 01:19:21,677
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:26,012
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:45,338 --> 01:19:47,363
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:51,468
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:19:58,384 --> 01:20:00,249
Look...

1207
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,183
- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:02,355 --> 01:20:04,983
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:07,827 --> 01:20:09,795
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:10,563 --> 01:20:12,724
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:21,908 --> 01:20:23,569
That's me.

1212
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:28,137
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:37,918
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,691
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:42,521
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:42,696 --> 01:20:46,097
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:48,531
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:48,701 --> 01:20:51,295
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:55,139
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:05,953 --> 01:21:11,186
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:16,397 --> 01:21:18,058
Is it real?

1222
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:23,698
I think so.

1223
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,475
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:31,645 --> 01:21:33,203
No.

1225
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,944
I like that.

1226
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:49,450
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,988
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:55,164 --> 01:22:58,327
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:22:58,501 --> 01:23:02,733
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:02,905 --> 01:23:07,069
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:10,508
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,013
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:14,183 --> 01:23:15,650
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:16,918 --> 01:23:18,783
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:21,388
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:24,324
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:24,492 --> 01:23:26,619
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:26,796 --> 01:23:29,697
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:29,865 --> 01:23:32,527
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:32,702 --> 01:23:36,763
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:40,007
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:43,173
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:31,261 --> 01:24:34,924
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,295
Yeah...

1245
01:24:44,508 --> 01:24:47,238
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:51,136
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:51,313 --> 01:24:54,214
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:54,384 --> 01:24:58,445
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:24:58,822 --> 01:25:00,517
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:04,018
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:04,194 --> 01:25:06,094
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:09,426
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:11,694
I own the place.

1254
01:25:14,004 --> 01:25:16,598
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:21,672
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:22,379 --> 01:25:23,846
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:24,014 --> 01:25:26,312
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:26,484 --> 01:25:30,045
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:31,813
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:32,422 --> 01:25:34,822
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:39,188
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:39,362 --> 01:25:41,421
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:41,599 --> 01:25:46,036
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:46,204 --> 01:25:48,035
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:48,205 --> 01:25:50,605
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:53,437
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:53,611 --> 01:25:55,841
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:57,604
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:02,753 --> 01:26:05,551
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:05,723 --> 01:26:07,384
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:07,557 --> 01:26:11,152
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:15,859
Okay.

1273
01:26:19,704 --> 01:26:22,571
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,767
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:26,944 --> 01:26:31,176
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:32,116 --> 01:26:34,607
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:34,786 --> 01:26:39,951
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:42,558
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:43,095 --> 01:26:45,461
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:46,698 --> 01:26:51,260
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:53,096
Right?

1282
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:55,899
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:56,073 --> 01:27:00,703
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:07,218 --> 01:27:08,776
Christ.

1285
01:27:10,923 --> 01:27:13,448
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:14,226 --> 01:27:18,890
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:05,109
Shit!

1288
01:28:44,017 --> 01:28:45,450
Fuck.

1289
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:05,086
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:05,265 --> 01:30:07,426
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:13,470
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,335
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,627
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:48,502
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:51,169
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:54,775
No.

1297
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,008
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:00,118
It depends.

1299
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:05,952
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,689
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:11,893
Cop.

1302
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:17,333
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,666
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:21,276 --> 01:31:23,904
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,247
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:29,284 --> 01:31:31,218
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,579
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,891
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,427
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:42,598 --> 01:31:44,293
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,866
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:56,475
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:59,646
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:02,412
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:02,585 --> 01:32:04,678
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:05,487 --> 01:32:08,422
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:09,091 --> 01:32:12,254
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:17,493
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,025
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,102
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,336
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:32,604
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:34,112
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:37,651
...I quit.

1325
01:32:38,254 --> 01:32:42,657
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:42,825 --> 01:32:45,760
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:32:56,905 --> 01:33:00,568
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:02,712 --> 01:33:06,739
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:07,616 --> 01:33:09,914
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:12,418
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:14,886
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:18,652
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:18,828 --> 01:33:20,955
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:25,260
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:25,435 --> 01:33:28,700
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:30,173 --> 01:33:32,004
But I like it.

1337
01:33:33,176 --> 01:33:35,940
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:38,944
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:43,414
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:45,985
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:50,149
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:51,393 --> 01:33:53,224
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:59,933
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:03,366
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,475
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:06,643 --> 01:34:09,441
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:12,012
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:12,182 --> 01:34:14,116
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:14,284 --> 01:34:17,583
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:17,754 --> 01:34:19,153
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:20,256 --> 01:34:22,588
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:23,493 --> 01:34:25,017
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:25,195 --> 01:34:28,722
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:30,991
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:35,661
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:40,677 --> 01:34:42,201
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,780
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:47,918
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:48,084 --> 01:34:51,053
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:54,748
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:55,592 --> 01:35:00,086
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:01,031 --> 01:35:04,194
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:05,469 --> 01:35:08,905
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:11,408 --> 01:35:13,433
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:17,148 --> 01:35:19,810
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:19,984 --> 01:35:21,474
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:22,787 --> 01:35:25,847
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:26,023 --> 01:35:28,287
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:29,293 --> 01:35:34,230
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:34,733 --> 01:35:36,166
Yeah.

1371
01:35:37,001 --> 01:35:39,469
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:39,637 --> 01:35:43,733
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:46,244 --> 01:35:49,111
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,145
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:55,551
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:35:57,789 --> 01:36:00,121
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:01,092 --> 01:36:03,925
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:04,094 --> 01:36:07,257
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:11,435 --> 01:36:16,668
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:17,509 --> 01:36:19,773
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:22,147 --> 01:36:23,705
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:26,544
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:26,718 --> 01:36:27,707
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:30,689 --> 01:36:33,021
Eat something.

1385
01:36:41,666 --> 01:36:42,655
Problem?

1386
01:36:42,834 --> 01:36:46,361
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:48,871
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,167
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:54,870
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:55,046 --> 01:36:58,607
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:36:58,784 --> 01:36:59,773
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:00,185 --> 01:37:03,177
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:03,355 --> 01:37:05,687
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:06,025 --> 01:37:09,358
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:10,129 --> 01:37:12,723
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:17,260
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:19,004 --> 01:37:21,905
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:24,242 --> 01:37:27,507
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,443
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:30,616 --> 01:37:31,844
No.

1401
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,221
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:41,687
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:41,861 --> 01:37:43,726
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:45,498 --> 01:37:47,864
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:55,508 --> 01:37:58,136
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:37:58,344 --> 01:38:02,576
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:02,749 --> 01:38:07,550
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:08,988 --> 01:38:10,979
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:13,927 --> 01:38:17,158
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:17,798 --> 01:38:20,733
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:23,495
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:24,804 --> 01:38:26,704
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:31,010 --> 01:38:33,843
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:35,081 --> 01:38:36,810
Another city.

1415
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,382
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:40,887 --> 01:38:44,015
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:44,558 --> 01:38:47,823
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:50,163 --> 01:38:51,960
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:52,132 --> 01:38:56,592
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:38:57,904 --> 01:39:02,238
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:11,018 --> 01:39:14,852
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:33,106 --> 01:39:35,870
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:36,043 --> 01:39:39,069
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:39,246 --> 01:39:42,511
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:43,673
Yeah.

1426
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:47,547
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:48,188 --> 01:39:51,021
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:39:56,964 --> 01:39:58,932
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:04,232
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:08,339
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:10,807
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:22,323 --> 01:40:26,350
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:28,096 --> 01:40:32,726
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:37,098
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:40,432
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:41,442 --> 01:40:43,535
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:43,711 --> 01:40:46,009
- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:50,043
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:50,519 --> 01:40:51,850
What?

1440
01:40:52,019 --> 01:40:54,146
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:58,920
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:41:00,361 --> 01:41:03,489
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:03,664 --> 01:41:05,598
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:15,501
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:15,676 --> 01:41:18,873
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:19,046 --> 01:41:22,345
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:22,518 --> 01:41:23,951
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:26,485
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:26,654 --> 01:41:30,112
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:34,058
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:35,931 --> 01:41:37,558
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:39,496
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:52,014 --> 01:41:54,380
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:56,075
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:56,251 --> 01:42:00,654
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,385
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:06,229 --> 01:42:10,165
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:12,233
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:15,564
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:15,737 --> 01:42:19,503
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,666
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:21,845 --> 01:42:25,372
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:25,548 --> 01:42:28,278
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:30,749
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,957
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:13,429 --> 01:43:14,657
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:14,831 --> 01:43:16,799
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:18,202 --> 01:43:20,670
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:20,837 --> 01:43:22,702
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:23,206 --> 01:43:24,605
No.

1471
01:43:26,243 --> 01:43:29,076
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:30,414 --> 01:43:34,043
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:34,218 --> 01:43:36,482
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:12,423 --> 01:44:15,620
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:18,318
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,127
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:28,706 --> 01:44:31,368
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:32,876 --> 01:44:36,175
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:37,014 --> 01:44:38,504
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:38,682 --> 01:44:39,808
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:39,984 --> 01:44:42,509
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:49,094 --> 01:44:51,528
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:52,162 --> 01:44:55,131
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:55,299 --> 01:44:58,826
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:44:59,003 --> 01:45:01,335
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:08,179 --> 01:45:11,148
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:11,315 --> 01:45:13,010
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:13,184 --> 01:45:15,982
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:16,154 --> 01:45:19,419
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:20,492 --> 01:45:21,550
Yeah?

1491
01:45:21,726 --> 01:45:24,422
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:24,596 --> 01:45:26,928
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:27,098 --> 01:45:28,531
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,730
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:33,905 --> 01:45:36,203
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:36,674 --> 01:45:38,665
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:38,843 --> 01:45:41,437
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:41,613 --> 01:45:43,046
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:44,809
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:44,983 --> 01:45:46,575
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:46,751 --> 01:45:48,184
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:48,353 --> 01:45:51,083
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:52,057 --> 01:45:53,581
Come on!

1504
01:46:00,231 --> 01:46:02,699
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:03,802 --> 01:46:06,635
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:07,539 --> 01:46:09,973
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:10,142 --> 01:46:13,441
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:18,384 --> 01:46:21,217
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:27,088
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:27,258 --> 01:46:29,089
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:32,287
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:49,915 --> 01:46:52,475
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:55,677
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:55,855 --> 01:46:57,948
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:46:58,124 --> 01:47:00,149
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:16,475 --> 01:47:19,467
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:23,816 --> 01:47:25,841
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:26,652 --> 01:47:28,711
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:32,779
Fuck.

1520
01:47:32,959 --> 01:47:34,859
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:35,027 --> 01:47:37,723
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:46,438 --> 01:47:48,338
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:48,508 --> 01:47:51,272
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:53,368
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:53,547 --> 01:47:55,344
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:55,515 --> 01:47:56,880
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:58,711
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:47:58,884 --> 01:48:00,408
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:00,587 --> 01:48:03,522
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,749
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:05,926 --> 01:48:08,053
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:08,228 --> 01:48:09,593
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:09,763 --> 01:48:11,253
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:13,194
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:21,274 --> 01:48:22,901
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:24,411 --> 01:48:27,346
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:27,514 --> 01:48:29,141
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:35,589 --> 01:48:37,784
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:37,959 --> 01:48:41,360
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:41,529 --> 01:48:43,554
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:49:00,915 --> 01:49:04,078
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:04,252 --> 01:49:06,083
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:06,254 --> 01:49:08,415
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:08,589 --> 01:49:11,319
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:11,492 --> 01:49:13,892
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:14,794 --> 01:49:16,455
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:18,121
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:18,299 --> 01:49:19,664
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:19,834 --> 01:49:22,997
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,331
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:25,506 --> 01:49:27,736
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:27,908 --> 01:49:31,309
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:31,479 --> 01:49:32,571
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:32,747 --> 01:49:36,308
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:36,484 --> 01:49:38,076
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:38,253 --> 01:49:41,279
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:41,455 --> 01:49:43,582
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:43,758 --> 01:49:46,556
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:46,727 --> 01:49:49,594
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:49,765 --> 01:49:52,700
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:52,867 --> 01:49:55,233
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:55,403 --> 01:49:58,804
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:49:58,973 --> 01:50:00,440
Good.

1564
01:50:02,277 --> 01:50:03,869
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:05,814 --> 01:50:07,645
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:07,815 --> 01:50:09,942
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:13,055 --> 01:50:14,784
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:16,458 --> 01:50:19,018
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:19,193 --> 01:50:23,391
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:23,565 --> 01:50:25,032
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:25,634 --> 01:50:28,535
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:28,704 --> 01:50:30,695
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:30,871 --> 01:50:33,897
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:34,076 --> 01:50:36,135
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:42,517 --> 01:50:44,041
Yeah?

1576
01:50:46,255 --> 01:50:48,246
Yeah?

1577
01:50:48,724 --> 01:50:50,885
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:52,694 --> 01:50:54,389
What's that?

1579
01:50:55,397 --> 01:50:58,855
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:02,337 --> 01:51:03,702
Yeah?

1581
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:08,540
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:10,445 --> 01:51:12,675
When I called you...

1583
01:51:12,849 --> 01:51:15,079
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:19,050
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:23,055
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:23,525 --> 01:51:25,425
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:26,695 --> 01:51:29,255
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:30,532 --> 01:51:31,863
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:54,757 --> 01:51:58,158
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:51:58,326 --> 01:52:00,123
He's dead.

1591
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,923
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:02,098 --> 01:52:04,896
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:05,067 --> 01:52:07,092
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:08,737
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:08,905 --> 01:52:12,102
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:12,275 --> 01:52:14,937
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,578
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:16,746 --> 01:52:20,807
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:20,983 --> 01:52:22,416
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:22,585 --> 01:52:26,248
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:26,422 --> 01:52:28,481
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:32,321
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,658
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,027
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:38,634 --> 01:52:40,033
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:40,537 --> 01:52:43,802
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:44,274 --> 01:52:46,265
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:46,442 --> 01:52:48,876
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:51,878
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:02,657
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:07,626
I know.

1612
01:53:34,025 --> 01:53:37,927
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,966
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:53,170
Yeah...

1615
01:53:57,749 --> 01:53:59,376
...I know.

1616
01:56:08,013 --> 01:56:09,503
Yeah.

1617
01:56:10,315 --> 01:56:13,546
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:13,987 --> 01:56:15,545
Who are you?

1619
01:56:15,788 --> 01:56:18,052
So it is you.

1620
01:56:19,258 --> 01:56:22,250
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:23,662 --> 01:56:25,289
Who are you?

1622
01:56:26,198 --> 01:56:28,223
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:28,401 --> 01:56:30,164
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:30,869 --> 01:56:32,894
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:33,073 --> 01:56:34,404
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:34,573 --> 01:56:37,770
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:37,944 --> 01:56:40,139
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:43,544
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:44,517 --> 01:56:47,418
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:48,888 --> 01:56:49,877
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:29,063 --> 01:57:31,361
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:33,499
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:33,667 --> 01:57:36,659
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:36,837 --> 01:57:39,328
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:39,506 --> 01:57:42,475
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:42,642 --> 01:57:44,200
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:44,378 --> 01:57:46,778
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:46,946 --> 01:57:50,404
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:54,108
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:54,287 --> 01:57:56,221
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:59,018
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:57:59,192 --> 01:58:01,353
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:01,529 --> 01:58:03,656
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:03,831 --> 01:58:06,061
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:06,432 --> 01:58:07,729
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:08,402 --> 01:58:11,064
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:11,238 --> 01:58:15,766
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:16,143 --> 01:58:18,338
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:19,613 --> 01:58:21,240
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:21,415 --> 01:58:26,375
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:26,554 --> 01:58:29,489
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:30,524 --> 01:58:33,823
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:33,995 --> 01:58:36,088
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:36,864 --> 01:58:39,025
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:39,867 --> 01:58:42,768
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:46,707 --> 01:58:48,470
Proceed.

1657
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:12,398
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:12,567 --> 01:59:15,331
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:15,503 --> 01:59:19,064
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:19,241 --> 01:59:20,367
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:20,542 --> 01:59:23,636
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:23,812 --> 01:59:26,042
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:30,986 --> 01:59:32,544
All right.

1664
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:42,057
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:45,028
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:04,683
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:04,854 --> 02:00:07,220
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:07,389 --> 02:00:10,051
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:10,258 --> 02:00:11,623
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:11,793 --> 02:00:14,455
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:14,629 --> 02:00:17,564
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:17,767 --> 02:00:20,235
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:20,403 --> 02:00:22,564
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:22,737 --> 02:00:25,171
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:25,341 --> 02:00:28,333
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:48,698 --> 02:00:50,757
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:50,933 --> 02:00:53,527
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:17,828 --> 02:01:19,352
Load it.

1679
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:29,668
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:32,908
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:33,076 --> 02:01:36,136
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:39,348 --> 02:01:41,145
Load.

1683
02:01:48,725 --> 02:01:50,556
Go, go!

1684
02:01:52,996 --> 02:01:54,554
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:56,633 --> 02:01:58,760
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:01:58,935 --> 02:02:02,393
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:11,415 --> 02:02:13,849
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:19,856 --> 02:02:22,416
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:25,863 --> 02:02:27,524
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:30,934 --> 02:02:33,198
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:33,371 --> 02:02:35,464
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:39,176 --> 02:02:40,302
Get down!

1693
02:02:43,313 --> 02:02:44,871
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:03,601 --> 02:03:05,068
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:44,509 --> 02:03:48,275
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:49,681 --> 02:03:52,275
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:52,450 --> 02:03:54,645
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,815
Grow up.

1699
02:03:58,523 --> 02:04:01,458
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:01,627 --> 02:04:03,117
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:05,063 --> 02:04:09,432
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:10,468 --> 02:04:12,902
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:14,505 --> 02:04:15,995
Frank.

1704
02:04:16,308 --> 02:04:19,209
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:19,378 --> 02:04:21,369
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:25,606
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:25,784 --> 02:04:28,617
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:29,354 --> 02:04:32,118
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:33,025 --> 02:04:36,392
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:37,362 --> 02:04:41,696
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:03,722 --> 02:05:06,156
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:27,747 --> 02:05:29,339
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:29,515 --> 02:05:31,005
Yeah?

1714
02:05:32,752 --> 02:05:33,980
Who's this?

1715
02:05:35,888 --> 02:05:37,515
Gwen?

1716
02:05:38,657 --> 02:05:40,750
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:41,827 --> 02:05:43,624
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:46,465 --> 02:05:48,865
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:05:57,243 --> 02:05:58,870
I got him!

1720
02:05:59,045 --> 02:06:01,479
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:05,618 --> 02:06:08,109
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:08,888 --> 02:06:10,446
No, it's...

1723
02:06:11,858 --> 02:06:13,450
For you.

1724
02:06:14,527 --> 02:06:17,587
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:21,101 --> 02:06:24,332
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:24,537 --> 02:06:26,971
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:29,938
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:32,275
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:32,446 --> 02:06:35,313
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:42,755 --> 02:06:44,416
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:44,591 --> 02:06:47,253
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:47,427 --> 02:06:48,985
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:52,293
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:52,466 --> 02:06:54,366
Long time.

1735
02:06:54,534 --> 02:06:56,365
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:56,770 --> 02:07:01,707
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:04,545 --> 02:07:07,878
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:08,048 --> 02:07:09,743
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:10,684 --> 02:07:13,050
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:15,089 --> 02:07:16,886
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:17,057 --> 02:07:19,855
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:20,027 --> 02:07:22,018
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:22,196 --> 02:07:25,097
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:25,265 --> 02:07:28,860
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:29,136 --> 02:07:32,105
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:32,272 --> 02:07:36,231
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:38,879 --> 02:07:41,177
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:41,349 --> 02:07:43,078
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:43,817 --> 02:07:46,581
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:52,421
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:52,861 --> 02:07:55,557
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:55,729 --> 02:07:58,892
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:07:59,066 --> 02:08:02,900
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:05,664
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:05,839 --> 02:08:08,399
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:08,576 --> 02:08:10,737
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:10,911 --> 02:08:13,311
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:14,880
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:15,483 --> 02:08:19,943
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:22,122 --> 02:08:23,146
It's my name.

1761
02:08:23,958 --> 02:08:26,324
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:26,494 --> 02:08:29,759
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:30,331 --> 02:08:32,265
It's your name.

1764
02:08:34,369 --> 02:08:35,768
All right.

1765
02:08:35,937 --> 02:08:38,633
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:38,807 --> 02:08:41,037
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:41,209 --> 02:08:43,473
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:43,645 --> 02:08:47,411
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:20,744 --> 02:10:24,578
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:55,545 --> 02:10:57,308
I know.

1771
02:10:58,848 --> 02:11:01,339
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:01,617 --> 02:11:03,209
I'm not.

1773
02:11:05,422 --> 02:11:08,687
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:08,858 --> 02:11:11,292
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:11,461 --> 02:11:13,053
For me.

1776
02:11:15,332 --> 02:11:16,924
Okay?

1777
02:11:20,537 --> 02:11:24,837
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:25,009 --> 02:11:28,968
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:29,146 --> 02:11:31,706
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:33,317 --> 02:11:34,909
Please.

1781
02:11:38,455 --> 02:11:40,855
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:41,025 --> 02:11:43,721
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:43,894 --> 02:11:47,159
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:50,760
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:51,535 --> 02:11:54,265
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:54,871 --> 02:11:56,839
You know, I have...

1787
02:11:57,008 --> 02:11:59,442
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:01,805
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:01,978 --> 02:12:05,505
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:35,279 --> 02:12:37,213
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:38,582 --> 02:12:42,780
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:43,721 --> 02:12:46,952
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:58,462
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:12:59,503 --> 02:13:00,970
Really?

1795
02:13:01,639 --> 02:13:03,163
Yeah.

1796
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,901
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:07,078 --> 02:13:09,273
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:12,551 --> 02:13:14,416
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:14,585 --> 02:13:17,383
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:20,881
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:11,443 --> 02:14:13,434
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:17,810
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:17,983 --> 02:14:21,646
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:24,653
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:24,824 --> 02:14:30,126
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:30,295 --> 02:14:33,492
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:33,665 --> 02:14:36,031
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:36,202 --> 02:14:39,603
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:39,772 --> 02:14:43,640
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:47,313 --> 02:14:48,871
What?

1811
02:14:52,485 --> 02:14:53,975
What?

1812
02:14:56,289 --> 02:14:58,587
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:14:58,758 --> 02:15:02,717
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:02,895 --> 02:15:04,226
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:04,397 --> 02:15:07,992
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:08,167 --> 02:15:12,729
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:12,906 --> 02:15:15,841
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:21,014 --> 02:15:23,039
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:23,216 --> 02:15:27,778
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:27,954 --> 02:15:29,444
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:29,622 --> 02:15:31,385
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:31,557 --> 02:15:33,548
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:34,227 --> 02:15:37,424
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:40,524
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:40,701 --> 02:15:42,726
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:43,035 --> 02:15:46,869
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,974
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:01,088 --> 02:16:02,851
Open the door.

1829
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:10,853
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:14,193
This is my job.

1831
02:16:39,459 --> 02:16:41,450
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:41,628 --> 02:16:43,152
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:46,561
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:46,733 --> 02:16:48,291
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:48,469 --> 02:16:50,494
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:50,671 --> 02:16:54,266
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:54,441 --> 02:16:57,410
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:16:57,577 --> 02:17:01,069
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:01,249 --> 02:17:03,240
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:03,418 --> 02:17:05,283
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:05,452 --> 02:17:07,852
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:08,022 --> 02:17:10,855
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:11,025 --> 02:17:12,925
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:13,094 --> 02:17:16,359
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:16,531 --> 02:17:19,659
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:19,834 --> 02:17:22,496
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:25,138
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:25,306 --> 02:17:28,002
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:28,176 --> 02:17:32,636
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:32,814 --> 02:17:35,578
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:40,549
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:40,722 --> 02:17:42,417
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:42,857 --> 02:17:44,757
Get up.

1854
02:17:45,927 --> 02:17:48,953
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:49,131 --> 02:17:51,656
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:51,833 --> 02:17:55,200
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:58,339
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:17:58,506 --> 02:18:00,633
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:00,809 --> 02:18:03,039
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:03,211 --> 02:18:06,908
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:07,081 --> 02:18:11,745
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:14,155 --> 02:18:16,089
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:16,258 --> 02:18:18,385
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:18,559 --> 02:18:21,528
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:21,696 --> 02:18:24,665
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:24,833 --> 02:18:26,926
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:27,102 --> 02:18:29,297
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:32,608 --> 02:18:34,439
You know who I am.

1869
02:18:59,568 --> 02:19:01,433
Shut up.

1870
02:19:02,471 --> 02:19:05,497
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:05,674 --> 02:19:06,868
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:07,042 --> 02:19:09,567
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:20,723 --> 02:19:23,021
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:24,627 --> 02:19:26,788
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:29,065 --> 02:19:31,124
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:07,337 --> 02:20:10,067
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:10,306 --> 02:20:12,604
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:12,775 --> 02:20:14,470
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:14,644 --> 02:20:17,511
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:31,127 --> 02:20:32,719
Give me that.

1881
02:20:48,145 --> 02:20:51,512
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:20:59,723 --> 02:21:01,918
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:21:02,091 --> 02:21:06,619
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:06,797 --> 02:21:08,958
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:09,133 --> 02:21:11,567
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:11,735 --> 02:21:13,930
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:14,104 --> 02:21:17,267
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:20,444 --> 02:21:22,708
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:23,447 --> 02:21:27,406
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:38,395 --> 02:21:40,727
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:40,899 --> 02:21:43,800
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:43,968 --> 02:21:46,766
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:46,937 --> 02:21:49,269
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:54,275
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:54,445 --> 02:21:56,037
Amen.

1896
02:22:25,476 --> 02:22:27,706
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,071
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:31,316 --> 02:22:32,943
Fire.

1899
02:22:33,118 --> 02:22:35,609
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:36,521 --> 02:22:39,547
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:39,991 --> 02:22:43,290
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:22:56,709 --> 02:22:59,075
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:06,351 --> 02:23:08,182
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:25,904 --> 02:23:27,531
Hi, pup.

1905
02:23:59,071 --> 02:24:00,698
Okay.
