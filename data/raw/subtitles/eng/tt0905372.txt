2
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,920
I remembered a joke.

3
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,640
It's funny.

4
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
Seorg and his wife
were having sex one night,

5
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,720
when their young son
suddenly enters the room.

6
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,120
Hang on a sec.
We are going in the right direction?

7
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Olav!

8
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,480
What are we looking for?

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,760
Just keep going.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,120
A little bit more or else
we will be flagged on the site.

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Okay.
Continue the joke.

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
The boy gets scared and leaves
running from the room, crying.

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,400
The mother says, "Honey! Now,
what should we do? "

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,840
You know women...

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,440
The father says:
"Let me handle this."

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Then he leaves
and goes to the child's bedroom

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,200
to say he was joking.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,040
He opens the door and sees
the small bastard

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,840
is lying on top of his grandmother,
having sex with her!

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Very animated too, rises and falls,
up and down.

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
Then he looks
for the father and says:

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
What's wrong, Dad?

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
You play with mine
so I play with her, right?

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
Stop!

25
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Is it here?

26
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
It's right here.

27
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,400
Don't move!

28
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,320
Turn on the light.

29
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
Good God!

30
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
Kate!

31
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
- Shit.
- Sorry, Kate.

32
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,760
These fellas said that you've been
expecting them?

33
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
- Of course, thanks, Hanks.
- Thanks.

34
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Hey, uh...You forgot, didn't you?

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
No, no, I just--

36
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
Yeah.

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,000
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him.

38
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

39
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
Kate Lloyd.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.
Do you know who I am?

41
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,840
I do.

42
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Adam told me
a little bit about you as well.

43
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,040
He said you specialized
in vertebrate paleontology.

44
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,600
Primarily, yes.

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,760
And obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice.

46
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,760
I've worked on several cold weather digs.

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
Good.

48
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,320
An old friend of mine,
a colleague of Oslo,

49
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,160
runs a geological research station
in Antarctica.

50
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
48 hours ago, his team found something

51
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
quite remarkable.

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,080
Really?

53
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
What'd they find?

54
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
We're flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site.

55
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,320
And I need a paleontologist.

56
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,080
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,240
I need to know a little bit about what
it is I'm being asked to dig up?

58
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
There is a structure.

59
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,520
A structure?

60
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,200
- Yes.
- In Antarctica?

61
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
And a specimen.

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
That's all I can tell you.

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
And I guess I don't have any time
to think about this.

64
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,960
No, I'm sorry. I need
your answer right now.

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Well...

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
I'm in.

67
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
Great.

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,920
Adam will get you the details
of our departure.

69
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,320
- Right, I'll see you in the car.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
Adam.

71
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
What the hell is it?

72
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
You now officially know as much as I do.

73
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,360
But I'll tell you one thing, I
worked for that guy for three years

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,120
and I've never seen him this excited.

75
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
She US?

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Look at this guy.

77
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,960
I mean, how is that even
humanly possible?

78
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,400
I was hoping maybe you could
help me with something?

79
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
I can't seem to get ahold of a newspaper
three weeks old

80
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,240
and I'm a man in desperate need
for certain information.

81
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,920
Carter, don't do this to
yourself, man.

82
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
And what information would that be?

83
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,120
I want to know how the
Cavaliers are going.

84
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,480
I don't follow football.

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
It's a basketball team.

86
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
They play basketball.

87
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,960
Barely.
They're the Cavaliers, man.

88
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,880
- Sorry, I couldn't help you.
- Nah, that's all right.

89
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,400
Listen, just so you guys know,
whatever y'all are doing,

90
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days.

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah, why's that?

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,480
There's a storm moving in.
A nasty one.

93
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,520
Good morning, Griggs.
Yeah, he's right.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
And the last place
where you want to be

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
is cooped up with a dozen
Norwegian guys.

96
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
Trust me.

97
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,720
Base in sight of my 1 o'clock.

98
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,120
This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule.
Do you copy?

99
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,600
Hello, H3 Sea King.
Please, approach from the west.

100
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,480
Landing pad is cleared

101
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Bravo, coming back.

102
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
Good to go, Griggs.

103
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
- Dr. Halvorson?
- Yes?

104
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,840
- Welcome to Thule.
- Thank you.

105
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,160
Edvard asked you to go
to the site, right now.

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,120
Lars is going to drive you.

107
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

108
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
- Please go in the Spryte .
- Thanks.

109
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,440
Hello, sir.

110
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
Watch your step.

111
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,080
Brighten.

112
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,000
Edvard!

113
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
- You got it.
- Sure, I did.

114
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,640
Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

115
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,160
- Columbia paleontology.
- Welcome.

116
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
Adam Finch,
my research assistant.

117
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,400
-Welcome.
- Hi.

118
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
This is Edvard, my good friend.

119
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,600
This is some of my team.
Karl and Juliette. Both geologists.

120
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,160
- Hi.
- Welcome.

121
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,560
Okay.

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,160
Let me show you why you flew
10,000 miles.

123
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
Holy shit!

124
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,040
We estimated this has been here
approximately 100,000 years.

125
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,560
We picked up a signal transmitting.

126
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,240
Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

127
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,440
Incredible.

128
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,400
We think the signal
was triggered

129
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,600
when the survivor
exited the craft.

130
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,520
Survivor?

131
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
My God.

132
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,480
How long will it take to get it out,
do you know, Kate?

133
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Assuming you've the right equipment,
I'd say...

134
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
maybe half a day.

135
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,120
Good.

136
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,080
The ice, should I ask you how fragile
is it?

137
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,960
It's not in a fracture zone.

138
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,800
So there's very little risk of fissuring.

139
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
And the ice is quite dense.

140
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,160
So we think we can get it out in one piece.

141
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,560
Good.

142
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,600
I mean, rough estimates about 6 by 12 feet,
3 and a half feet high.

143
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,960
- Probably some place right around--
- That's great...

144
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,600
Make sure that everyone stays off
the radio.

145
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,720
I do not want any information out.

146
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
And the crane...do we have
something appropriate for this?

147
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
Yes, it's already there.
It's all set up.

148
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
I'm Peder, by the way.

149
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,920
- Peder.
- Nice to meet you.

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,680
So, you've gotten it all taken care of.
I don't think you really need me.

151
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,920
What about him?
He's secretly disinterested or--?

152
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,280
Oh, that's Lars.

153
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,040
He does not understand English,
but he works like a bear.

154
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
And, as you can see from the scans,
the ship carved a 200m tunnel into the ice.

155
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,920
So, let me get this right.
You crashed into a glacier...

156
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,320
And then without enough information

157
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
you leave the cozy confines of your ship?

158
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,800
Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
someplace warm.

159
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,960
Well, I guess it didn't find it.

160
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,560
The first night is hard.

161
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,980
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you up.
- No, no, it's fine.

162
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,100
I'll never look at them the same again.

163
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
What do you mean for transport weight?

164
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,200
To cut it down to a portable weight, we have to
take it from here to here.

165
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,920
Start with 4 inches.

166
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,200
I never believed in this shit.

167
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,840
I always did.

168
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,120
- We're all set?
- Nearly there.

169
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,760
Good.

170
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
Good.

171
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
But before we do,
I'm going to take a tissue sample.

172
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,280
Do you really that's a good idea?

173
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,080
Yes, I do.

174
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,240
I mean the conditions are so unpredictable

175
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
and we don't have the proper equipment.

176
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
Sterilization is an issue.

177
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
Edvard, what do you have in the way of
a small diameter drill?

178
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,840
Up to 30mm.

179
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,000
Very good.

180
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,680
I think somewhere around here.

181
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,720
Kate.
Just a second.

182
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,080
In the future, don't contradict me
in front of those people again.

183
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
- I just thought...
- You're not here to think.

184
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,440
You're here to get that thing safe out of the ice.

185
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,000
I hope we understand each other.

186
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,960
So, have you ever tasted this before?

187
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,040
- No, I haven't.
- It tastes very bad.

188
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,560
Gentlemen.
Ladies.

189
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,200
After a short but thorough investigation

190
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
of our visitor,

191
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,080
I can say, unequivocally,

192
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,800
that I've never seen anything
on any cellular level,

193
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,160
like what we have
in that other room.

194
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,200
Now, the impact of this find

195
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,280
will be felt
for thousands of years.

196
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,720
From this point on,

197
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,960
the world as we know it
has forever been altered.

198
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,280
You, my friends,
will all be immortalized,

199
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
as the people
who made this discovery.

200
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
Thank you.

201
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Do you think they're going to pay a bonus
for bringing over an alien

202
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,040
instead of coal samples?

203
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,960
You've got anything better than
this cough syrup?

204
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,840
- Hey, Griggy.
- Yeah?

205
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,080
You want to go out and get the cabinet stash?

206
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Sure, no problem.

207
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm on it.

208
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,480
Where did I put this bottle?

209
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,800
Jesus Ch...

210
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,240
Screw you, man.

211
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,320
Son of a...

212
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
It broke out!

213
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
What?

214
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
It ain't a damn joke, man!

215
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,120
The freaking thing's alive!

216
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,200
I was in the room, man,
looking at the ice

217
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,920
then the freaking thing jumped out!

218
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,440
We search
in groups of two and three.

219
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,320
The entire camp. If you find it, pull out,
don't attempt anything on your own.

220
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,980
And be careful...

221
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,200
We don't know what condition it's in.

222
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,330
Griggs, did you leave that open?

223
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,250
- I don't remember.
- Shit.

224
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,880
Hey, just be careful, man. That thing jumped
through the fucking roof.

225
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Jesus Christ.

226
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,880
Help! Over here!

227
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,880
Help! Somebody! Over here!

228
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,880
- It attacked Henrik.
- Come on.

229
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,880
- Jesus!
- In there!

230
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
- God, somebody do something!
- Oh my God.

231
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker, man!

232
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,580
We got to burn that fucker, man! Burn it!

233
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,580
Throw it, throw it!

234
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,780
His blood pressure's low.

235
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
Henrik and...his small children.

236
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,680
Yes, it's horrible. It's a horrible tragedy.

237
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,680
We're all shocked. At what happened to Henrik.

238
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,780
But with due respect, we need to examine the remains
before it all disintegrates.

239
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,780
- Hey, that was a man. Not remains.
- No, I know, I'm talking about the creature.

240
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,880
And I'm sure we're all aware of the importance
of this discovery.

241
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,880
This may be the first and only time
mankind has been visited by an alien lifeform.

242
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:48,350
- And as scientists, we're obliged to study it.
- Didn't work out so well the last time, did it?

243
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,880
I think you should destroy it.

244
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,160
Completely.

245
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,350
- I think you've contributed enough to this matter now.
- Oh, really?

246
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,460
Listen, your guy, Olav, back there,
he's in bad shape.

247
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,760
Now, we're going to fly him back to McMurdo
at sun-up and take him to the military hospital.

248
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,960
And what're you going to tell them, hmm?

249
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy
as it sounds.

250
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,240
Kate?
Can you help here?

251
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,160
Come on.

252
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,880
Pull that side up.

253
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,800
His face is encased in some type
of amniotic sac.

254
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,320
The tissue. Looks almost new.

255
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,200
What was it doing to him?

256
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,640
It appears that it was absorbing him.

257
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,520
Some type of digestion.

258
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,920
It's fascinating.

259
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,000
It is fascinating.

260
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,080
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

261
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,800
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

262
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,480
- Do you need something?
- No, no. I'm okay.

263
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,920
What is this?

264
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,720
Looks like a titanium plate.

265
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,400
Used to reinforce bones and compound fractures.

266
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,360
Yeah, that's right.

267
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,840
Henrik broke his arm last year.

268
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,800
He had to go to Argentina
to get it set.

269
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,720
So if this was in his arm,
what's it doing out of him now?

270
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,720
That's a good question.

271
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,280
What are you doing?

272
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
Took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

273
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,400
I want to find out what this thing
was doing to him.

274
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,760
I think you should take a look at this.

275
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,160
These cells aren't dead.

276
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,160
That's not possible.

277
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,840
Looks like the alien cells
are somehow

278
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,360
attacking Henrik's cells
and then they--

279
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,680
What is that? It looks like
they are transforming...

280
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,720
They're imitating his cells.

281
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,680
Okay, I don't know if that's what I'm seeing, but...

282
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,600
They're imitating him.

283
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,160
It's going to be okay, Olav.

284
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
A doctor will see you in McMurdo.

285
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,160
Kate.

286
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

287
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,920
We're leaving.

288
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,470
Once the weather holds up, we'll be back with help

289
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,560
as soon as we can.

290
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,680
Okay.

291
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,200
Alright.

292
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,320
- Keep him warm.
- I will.

293
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,080
C'mon, let's go.

294
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,480
Sit down there.

295
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,400
There you go.

296
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,440
Ah, let's get the hell out of here.

297
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,200
Carter!
Carter, wait!

298
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,480
She's flagging us down.

299
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,920
- What's wrong?
- They shouldn't leave.

300
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,280
Carter.

301
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,360
Let's just get out of here, man.

302
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,240
Alright, fuck it, we're landing.

303
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,640
Shit.

304
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,320
Let's take her down.

305
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,720
Is there something wrong?

306
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,880
No, everything's fine.

307
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,240
Probably just forgot something.

308
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,800
We'll be in the air in no time, okay?

309
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,840
Don't worry.

310
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,840
Hang in there.

311
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
Something's wrong.

312
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,440
Hailing McMurdo, or any ears on
the emergency channel.

313
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,760
Do you copy? Over.

314
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,020
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

315
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,520
They crashed here,
right behind this ridgeline.

316
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,840
It's impossible to reach them.

317
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,880
This doesn't make any sense.

318
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,470
I mean, they have plenty of visibility, right?

319
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,980
We're not going after them?
Shouldn't we try?

320
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,120
We need a chopper to even get close to them.

321
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,780
And there's refueling and hailing.

322
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,120
All this can't be a coincidence.

323
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,240
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

324
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,360
The incoming storm.

325
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,680
Fuck.

326
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
There's too much interference.

327
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,360
We have four missing persons.
We have no helicopter or radio.

328
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,480
You made a mistake
for bringing these people here.

329
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,960
More people may die.

330
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,580
But, Sander, we don't know
even if they are dead or not.

331
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,460
Colin, Lars, get your gear.

332
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,260
We'll take a snowcat
to the next base.

333
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,740
Lars, do it now.

334
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,040
I don't think that's a good idea.

335
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,920
And why is that?

336
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,280
Because no one can leave this camp...

337
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
until we know more about what's going on here.

338
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,040
- I make decisions about this camp.
- I know, Edvard, but...

339
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,880
Why did you flag down that helicopter?

340
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,640
Because I thought it was in danger.

341
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,040
Why?

342
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,120
I took a sample of Henrik's blood...

343
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,800
and I saw that the alien cells
were still alive.

344
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,400
They were alive and they were copying
Henrik's cells.

345
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
Replicating them.

346
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,840
Adam saw it too.

347
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,840
Is that true?

348
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,920
I don't know.

349
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I mean, I don't know what we saw.

350
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I mean, we saw something.

351
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,840
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

352
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,840
That this thing can,
and probably has,

353
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,800
replicated a person.

354
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,600
- What?
- That can't be.

355
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,280
- Who?
-This is insane.

356
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,320
Okay, Okay. Kate? Kate?
Okay! Kate.

357
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,280
This is not the time to be yelling fire.

358
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,480
Let's stop, gather our thoughts,

359
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,320
and discuss this in private.

360
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,560
We don't need any private meeting, Doctor.

361
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,040
We all want the fucking information!

362
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,560
There's more.

363
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,280
What are those?

364
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
I think they are fillings from someone's teeth.

365
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,520
I found them by a puddle of blood in the shower.

366
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,880
Puddle of blood?

367
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,400
It can clone cells,
but not inorganic material.

368
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,560
It couldn't copy these, so
it spit them out.

369
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,120
- We're wasting too much time already. Lars?
- Listen!

370
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,880
When I went back to check it,
someone had cleaned up the blood.

371
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,120
Someone had wiped it away.

372
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,400
Alright, so whatever it is...

373
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,760
It is still here.

374
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,800
I've heard enough.

375
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,000
Lars, Colin, get the gear.
Ten minutes.

376
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,680
Please, Edvard.

377
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,680
You can't leave.

378
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,320
You can't leave!
You don't know what we're dealing with.

379
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,280
Well done.

380
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,040
Kate?

381
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,080
I don't know if I should be speaking about this.

382
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,240
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

383
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,960
Speaking about what?

384
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,800
You were saying...

385
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,520
about someone cleaning up the
blood from the shower.

386
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
- And that someone here may not be themselves.
- Juliette, please...

387
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,840
What did you see?

388
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,480
After the crash, I think...I saw
Colin coming from the showers.

389
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,000
He was holding something.

390
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,720
It could've been a towel, a rag,
something to clean up.

391
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Kate, I can't say for sure, but
it's just that I s--

392
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,880
He's leaving with Edvard.

393
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,800
We can't let them go.

394
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,160
We can't let any of them go.

395
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
I know where they keep
the keys for the vehicles.

396
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,600
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

397
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,080
- This one?
- Yes.

398
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,760
- How many am I looking for?
- Five.

399
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,840
Three and four.

400
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
You said there were five?

401
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,760
Run!

402
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,000
Kate, what happened?

403
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,360
Karl. It got Karl. It got...Karl.

404
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,680
Kate.

405
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,080
Burn it!

406
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Enough, that's enough.

407
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,480
Burn in hell.

408
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,780
What the fuck's happening to us?

409
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,940
It attacks its prey,

410
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,380
copies it perfectly...

411
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,980
and then hides inside it.

412
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,340
Waiting.

413
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,860
Is it still among us?

414
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,660
It could be any of us.

415
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,260
We got to get out of here.

416
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,900
Yeah, right now.

417
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,540
And it could be getting a vehicle with it.

418
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,740
You'll be alone.

419
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,780
Vulnerable.

420
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,780
That's exactly what it wants.

421
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,860
Not to mention you'll be giving it
a way out of here.

422
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,380
A way to spread.

423
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,900
It's like a virus.

424
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,700
So what do we do with any virus?

425
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,620
Quarantine.

426
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,420
We isolate it and then we kill it.

427
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,900
Yeah.

428
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,900
We have to rely on science.

429
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,420
Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
cells of the creature

430
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,540
might create a reaction...of some kind.

431
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,020
So we take blood samples from everybody.

432
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,580
Yeah, and we test each one of them.

433
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,500
Yes, Adam and I can do that.

434
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,460
Okay.

435
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,580
Lars and I'll disable the vehicles.

436
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,660
We have to trust in this plan.

437
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,460
It's our only chance of making it through this.

438
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,020
- Is that it?
- Yes.

439
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,780
- No more vehicles?
- Only these.

440
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,500
Okay.

441
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,060
What?

442
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,540
Grenades.

443
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,300
Is everything alright?

444
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,860
Yes, yes, everything's fine.

445
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,220
Good.

446
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,140
- Lars, you're okay?
- Yes.

447
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,100
Kate, we should go.

448
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,420
The storm is getting worse.

449
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,020
Who is that?

450
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,620
Hurry up. They're coming.

451
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,780
The Americans.

452
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,860
It is impossible for a human
to survive in that crash.

453
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,020
We should burn them.
Right here, right now.

454
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,020
- Let's finish them off!
- Peder?

455
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,500
It could be murder.

456
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,700
- It could be survival, Kate.
- Yes, but we don't have to kill them.

457
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,100
Right? We can just lock them up...

458
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,420
until the Sander's test is ready.

459
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,580
Please.

460
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,580
Please.

461
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,580
So this is a good idea?

462
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,220
Locking us up?

463
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,300
You need our help.

464
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,900
Warn your scientists they can't handle
with what we saw in that chopper.

465
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,340
For all I know, you could be one of those things.

466
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,420
It is pretty hard to believe you both
walked away from that crash.

467
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,860
- Yeah, I get that, I do, but...
- We're preparing a test.

468
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,500
And then we figure out who's who.

469
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,940
It's all I can offer you right now.

470
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,180
Damn!
There's a fire here!

471
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,440
Someone sabotaged it.
There's nothing left. Nothing.

472
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,840
Now there's no test.

473
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,880
How could this happen?

474
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It was no accident.

475
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,440
You.

476
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,440
You were in there with him.

477
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,240
You were the last one.

478
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,680
- How are you accusing me?
- Why not?

479
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,560
- He's got something to hide.
- What are you, an asshole?

480
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,880
I was the one working on the test.
I left for 2 minutes!

481
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,720
- You just don't want us to know the truth, do ya?
- Bullshit!

482
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,150
This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!

483
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,920
There might be another way.

484
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,440
I think there might be another way
to tell.

485
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,760
Peder, give me your flashlight.

486
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Now tell Lars
to open his mouth.

487
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,560
Tell him to open his mouth.

488
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,920
Open your mouth.

489
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,680
Good.

490
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,160
Lars has fillings.
So he's human.

491
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,960
It can't imitate
inorganic material.

492
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,640
See?

493
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,400
Yes.

494
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,360
Good.

495
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,880
Good.

496
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,080
Open.

497
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,080
Come on!

498
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,720
You're next!

499
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,520
Open your mouth!

500
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,320
Okay.

501
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,280
Good.

502
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,160
Right now, it's at least something.

503
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,960
A way to eliminate
some of us.

504
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,320
So I'm gonna get killed because
I floss?

505
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,520
Nobody's getting killed.

506
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,920
Kate?

507
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,800
Kate, come on.

508
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,560
Kate.

509
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,000
Just do it.

510
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
Kate.

511
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,960
Open.

512
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,560
Just go stand over there.

513
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,320
You know as well as I do, there are
too many variables.

514
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,840
Open your mouth.

515
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,600
Open your mouth!

516
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,520
They are porcelain.

517
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,440
Go stand with Adam.

518
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,120
Anyone else with porcelain fillings?

519
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,000
Or clean teeth?

520
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,640
It's bloody absurd.

521
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,440
This is wrong.

522
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,320
Jonas, you and Lars go out.

523
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,200
Get Carter and Jameson,
bring them in here, we'll check them too.

524
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,320
But why don't we just leave them where they are?
They can't do anything.

525
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,080
We need to know.

526
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,200
- What?
- She wants us to find the Americans.

527
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,640
Let's do it, then.

528
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,160
Come on!

529
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,880
She is smart.

530
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,600
Yes.

531
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,840
She is in control now.

532
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,240
Shit.

533
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,960
They escaped.

534
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,880
Lars.

535
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,440
Let's go back inside.

536
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,240
No. We have to find them.

537
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,320
Lars, be careful.
They are not human!

538
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,720
Lars!

539
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,560
Lars!

540
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,800
Lars!

541
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Lars. Wait.

542
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,200
Lars.

543
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,880
Peder.

544
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,880
Stay calm!

545
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,800
The threat isn't here.

546
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,240
It's out there.

547
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,160
The Americans are the real enemy.

548
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,440
He's right, Peder.

549
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,600
Whatever they're saying right now,
it doesn't matter.

550
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,520
You can't trust them.

551
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,760
Watch them.

552
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,320
Kate!

553
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,920
Come on!

554
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,600
Come on!

555
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,080
Where are they?

556
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,880
- Where are the rest?
- They attacked them.

557
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,360
- Who?
- They got Lars!

558
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,000
-Peder!
-They took Lars!

559
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,600
- What happened?
- Peder, keep them back.

560
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,560
- We have to help him.
- Stay on them, Peder.

561
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,720
- What happened?
- Peder, they took Lars.

562
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,360
- The enemy is out there.
- We don't know if we can trust them!

563
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,960
Peder, don't listen to them.

564
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,360
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

565
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,920
They're inside.

566
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,120
Where is Lars?

567
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
Calm down!

568
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,440
I said calm down!

569
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,160
- Where the fuck is Lars?
- Drop it!

570
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,640
- Somebody tell him.
- Peder, don't listen to them.

571
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,480
- Put it down!
- They killed Lars!

572
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,320
Lars is killed.
Burn them! Burn them!

573
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,760
Peder? Peder?

574
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,960
Okay!

575
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,000
I just want to check my friend, okay?

576
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,960
It's okay.

577
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,680
He was going to fire.

578
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,640
- It's going to catch fire! It will explode!
- Come on! Let's go!

579
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,200
Edvard?

580
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,640
Edvard?

581
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,120
- Pick him up.
- Okay.

582
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,520
You.

583
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,200
Yeah, you. Help him!

584
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,240
Alright, show yourselves!

585
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,480
Right fucking now!

586
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,960
Everybody in the rec room.

587
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,920
Pick him up, come on.

588
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,680
Sit down.

589
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,320
Not all of us are human.

590
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,600
Just put him over there on the couch.

591
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,600
Help! Help me!

592
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,000
My God!
Get it off him!

593
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,080
What the fuck is this shit, man?

594
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,760
Carter, Carter!

595
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,520
Carter, burn it, man!

596
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,120
There is something wrong with it!
Hold on!

597
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,800
Goddamn it, Carter, burn it!

598
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,240
Look out!

599
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,200
Adam!

600
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,040
Shit!
Carter, take it!

601
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,040
Carter!

602
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,880
There is something wrong with the pressure.

603
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,480
Put some air in the pipe.

604
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,280
Watch out!

605
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,840
Carter!

606
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,960
We gotta get the air up.

607
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,240
No.

608
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,120
God!

609
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,520
Carter!

610
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,560
No! No!

611
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,920
I'm with you, buddy.

612
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,680
Carter.

613
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,120
You're okay?

614
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,360
Yeah.

615
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,440
And you?

616
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,960
Not yet, no.

617
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,880
We find it and then we kill it.

618
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,680
I think that was Sander.

619
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,880
Yeah.

620
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,280
- Shit!
- God! Watch out!

621
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,360
Kate, do you see it?

622
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,200
Where did it go?

623
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,400
There!

624
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,920
Get back!

625
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,400
Don't. Don't touch it.

626
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,240
Do you hear that?

627
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,840
Yeah.

628
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,120
Kate!

629
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,840
- Sander.
- Wait.

630
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,520
So what?

631
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,760
He'll freeze out there.

632
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,320
And if he doesn't?

633
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,440
If it makes it out of here...

634
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,080
millions of people could die.

635
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,520
- It's got nowhere to go.
- Yes, it does.

636
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,640
Alright.

637
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,640
What?

638
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,880
What happened to Lars?

639
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,600
We didn't kill him.

640
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,080
Come on.

641
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,720
Run, run!

642
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,600
Kate!

643
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,480
Kate!

644
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,920
Kate!

645
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,520
Kate?

646
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,520
Kate?

647
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:47,600
Kate!

648
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,280
So what we do now?

649
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,120
There's a Russian station...

650
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,360
about 50 miles from here.

651
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,520
Should have enough gas.

652
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,560
We're gonna make it back, okay?

653
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,480
Okay.

654
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,320
Let's go.

655
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,240
I'm going to put this in the back.

656
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,720
You know how I knew
you were human...

657
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,000
when you showed up back at base?

658
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,480
No.

659
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,440
Your earring.

660
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,880
It was on your other ear.

661
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,120
Kate?

662
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,520
Kate, what are you doing?

663
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,040
Let's talk about it.

664
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,040
Talk to me.

665
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,440
Kate?

666
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,960
Kate!

667
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,120
Kate!

668
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,720
No!

669
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:10,020
Oh my God.

670
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:22,240
Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?

671
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,040
Edvard?

672
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:04,140
Lars? Lars, it's Matias.
It's Matias!

673
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:04,830
- Open your mouth.
- What?

674
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:12,230
- Do what I say, now!
- It's Matias. Lars, it's me, Matias.

675
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,700
That's no dog. Start the helicopter, now!

676
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,700
Get it up, get it up! Now!
Come on!
