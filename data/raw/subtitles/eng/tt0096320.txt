1
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:28,428
On his 35th birthday,

2
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:31,565
I decided to tell Julius Benedict...

3
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:34,451
the truth about himself.

4
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,720
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,125
of a scientific experiment...

6
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,394
conducted by the American government.

7
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,350
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically,

8
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:55,094
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

9
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:01,493
He knew that,
unlike other little boys,

10
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:05,241
he had not one, but six fathers...

11
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:07,544
All very distinguished men...

12
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,428
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

13
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,396
And of course,

14
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:17,528
he knew about Mary Ann Benedict,

15
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,075
the remarkable young woman...

16
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,861
who was selected to be his mother.

17
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,863
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

18
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:49,539
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.

19
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:55,972
Now, what Julius did not know,

20
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,856
not until this very moment,

21
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:03,014
was that about a minute
after he was born...

22
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:07,655
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

23
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:56,077
I have a brother?

24
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,291
Ya.

25
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,849
He was sent to an orphanage
in Los Angeles...

26
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:04,086
at the same time
I brought you here to the island.

27
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:09,591
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island,

28
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,042
helping me with my research.

29
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,346
I always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

30
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,420
How wrong I was.

31
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,461
I must find him.

32
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,750
Julius, Julius!
Wait, wait.

33
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,258
I couldn't believe he was going.

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,191
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

35
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,575
All of his knowledge was from books.

36
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,482
Julius could speak 12 languages.

37
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:46,916
He excelled in history, science,

38
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,468
mathematics, literature.

39
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,259
He was pure in body and in spirit.

40
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,373
Ahhh!

41
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,317
But for the first time,

42
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,496
Julius would not listen to me.

43
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,950
He's probably just like me.

44
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,082
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away.

45
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,905
But Julius did not care.

46
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:23,494
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

47
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:26,916
that his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

48
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:30,155
and desperately needed his help.

49
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,978
Honey, I'm home!

50
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,155
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

51
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,593
- Get going!
- I'm going.

52
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,902
Oh, hello, hello!

53
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,311
Oh, my goodness!

54
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:17,200
Good-bye.

55
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,300
- We're gonna be late for work.
- I need my horoscope.

56
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:32,604
- Yeah, horoscope.
- "Your judgment is at its peak today.

57
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,705
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow."

58
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:39,225
- Ooh, good one.
- I hope so.

59
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,402
Ladies!

60
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:44,474
- Vince!
- I thought you broke up with him.

61
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:46,434
I did, I did!

62
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:53,794
- You don't mind if I talk
to your sister, do you?
- She doesn't mind.

63
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,966
Don't give him any money.

64
00:05:56,037 --> 00:06:00,642
Uh, no, no, I promised Marnie
I wouldn't give you any money.

65
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,586
Don't look at me like...

66
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:10,340
Don't do that thing
with your eyes.

67
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,858
I'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

68
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:17,247
You are here,
and so am I.

69
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:19,811
Maybe millions
of people go by,

70
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,055
but they all
disappear from view.

71
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:25,703
I only have eyes
for you, Linda.

72
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:28,588
I only have
eyes for you.

73
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:33,353
Mmm.

74
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:37,285
- It's the baby Klane!
- What?

75
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,670
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,166
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

77
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,762
Where's the little shit?

78
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,256
You'll have to be
more specific...

79
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,665
concerning the clientele.

80
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:53,641
Benedict.

81
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:56,750
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

82
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,828
- Isn't that right, Marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

83
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:03,956
That weasel? That creep?

84
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,536
I wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

85
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:13,462
Take out the papers
and the trash

86
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,912
Or you don't get
no spending cash

87
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,538
If you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

88
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,866
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

89
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,194
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

90
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,741
I knew you were trouble
the second I laid eyes on you.

91
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:35,189
Excuse me. I just have never
heard this kind of music before.

92
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:39,672
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

93
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:41,816
Take out the papers

94
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,189
Take out the papers

95
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,941
Take... out...
the... papers

96
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,425
Take out the papers
Take out the papers

97
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,112
Take... out...
the... papers

98
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:56,568
And the trash
Trash

99
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,813
La-la-la
La-la-la

100
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,799
La-la-la
La-la-la

101
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,798
Mada-dada

102
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,505
Thank you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

112
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:23,384
Hey, Vince!

113
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,424
Listen, Al,

114
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,538
you gotta help me out.

115
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:30,034
I'm into the Klane
brothers for $20,000.

116
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:33,239
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

117
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,472
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

118
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,930
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

119
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:41,045
I'll give you something.

120
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:44,151
I got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

121
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,733
Vince, I'll take all
of these you can get.

122
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:23,492
All right, Tony.

123
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,862
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

124
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,784
Yeah.

125
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,705
Whoa, Tony!

126
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,081
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

127
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,709
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

128
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,431
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,672
No, I just could've
used some more.

130
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,262
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,603
Your bowels troubling you?

132
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,249
What an amazing country.

133
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,975
Hey.

134
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,897
Gotta light, pal?

135
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,793
Oh, excuse me.
I don't smoke, pal.

136
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,843
Yeah. Ha-ha.

137
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:11,698
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

138
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:15,246
- Pickin' up something
for the girlfriend?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

139
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,652
Do women really
wear those things?

140
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,573
If you're lucky, they do.

141
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,494
I can't believe it.

142
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,501
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

143
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:27,406
As a matter of fact, I come from
an island in the South Pacific.

144
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,099
Whoa!

145
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,770
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

146
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:38,672
I did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

147
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:42,523
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

148
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,247
Uh-oh.

149
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,521
- I carry him to a hospital.
- No!

150
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,826
I think you should
just take off, man.

151
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,804
Find your horse
you came in on.

152
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,701
I'm so sorry about this.

153
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:55,669
- I feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

154
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:57,685
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

155
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,274
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

156
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,288
Yeah, have a nice day.

157
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:06,428
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

158
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:09,980
These are quality socks.

159
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:13,347
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

160
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,485
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

161
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:19,452
$53! Are you
out of your mind?

162
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,821
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

163
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:25,123
So, do I look
normal to you?

164
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,330
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

165
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,367
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,350
Handicapped, my ass!

167
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,109
I'll need your
driver's license, sir.

168
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,665
Look, I'm sorry
I lost my temper.

169
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,594
Driver's license,
please.

170
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,442
- Look, I had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

171
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:46,053
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.

172
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:49,159
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

173
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,139
Happy birthday.
Watch your head.

174
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,189
Thanks.

175
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,638
Come along, now.

176
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:04,133
So this is where
my brother grew up.

177
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,710
I'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

178
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,214
And that's where
he must have slept!

179
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:16,805
Yes, it was.

180
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,782
How did you know?

181
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:21,792
It's the one I'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

182
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:23,721
In case of a fire,

183
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:27,048
I could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

184
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,366
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

185
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,633
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

186
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:40,422
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

187
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:43,212
Was he a great athlete?
Interested in chess and poetry?

188
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,963
I'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict,

189
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:48,716
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

190
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,695
Oh, I'm sorry.

191
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:55,501
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

192
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:59,247
That is Vince?

193
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,225
He looks so happy.

194
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,082
He should.
That's Sister Maria,

195
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,637
- his biology teacher.
- I always liked biology.

196
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,532
So did Vincent.

197
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,867
He disgraced Sister Maria,

198
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,876
who had to leave the order.

199
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,563
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

200
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:18,487
I must find my brother.

201
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,887
Do you know
where he might be?

202
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:23,735
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

203
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:27,796
You're full of goodness, Julius.
I pray you never find him.

204
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,033
Benedict, visitor.

205
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:24,741
- I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

206
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,647
I have rowed halfway
across the world...

207
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:55,687
Wrong, I just rowed a day...

208
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:02,956
I've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

209
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:05,415
I've been on my island,
I'm telling you.

210
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:08,339
This is incredible that...
I have looked for...

211
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,317
You've gotta talk
into the phone, Bozo.

212
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,703
Vincent.
Yes, Vincent...

213
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,972
I know you don't
know who I am.

214
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,561
- But believe me, I came...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,121
I've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

216
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:34,227
Tell the Klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

217
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:36,470
is beneath even them,
all right?

218
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,638
I don't know any Klane brothers.
I'm your brother, Julius.

219
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:43,643
Huh? Come again?

220
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,124
My name is Julius,
and I'm your twin brother.

221
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,835
Oh, obviously.

222
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,614
The moment I sat down, I thought
I was looking into a mirror.

223
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,047
We are not
identical twins.

224
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,119
- Oh, no?
- No.

225
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,883
I wouldn't be
too sure, pal.

226
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,775
I don't lie.
I am your brother.

227
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,209
You must let me help
you get out of here.

228
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:08,664
You want to
help me get out?

229
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,168
Yes, right now.

230
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,921
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

231
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:20,547
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

232
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:22,141
Yeah.

233
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:24,070
I'm in fast company here.

234
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:26,557
Take a look over there.
See that man?

235
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,599
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

236
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,039
I'll be anything you want,
your aunt, uncle, sister...

237
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:33,960
your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

238
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:37,190
- All right?
- Okay, I pay right now.

239
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:38,785
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

240
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,866
Okay. Go pay.

241
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,849
All right, pay him.

242
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,366
What is this,
"Candid Camera"?

243
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,139
Ahhh, oof!

244
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,039
Twinny, I hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets,

245
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:59,756
because I'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

246
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,766
- I have more money.
- You do?

247
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,808
I'm glad to help you.
Vincent, I'm your brother.

248
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,052
- I love you.
- Whoa!

249
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:09,992
Look, ease up
on the love talk,

250
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:13,002
because I'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

251
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,180
Tossing your cookies?

252
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:17,139
Oh, that's more slang!

253
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:19,757
Where the hell is it?

254
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:24,910
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

255
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,438
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

256
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,545
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

257
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:33,999
I'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together,

258
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,920
talk philosophy together,
read books together.

259
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,352
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

260
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,985
Vincent!

261
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,441
He's so full of energy.

262
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:57,661
Blue Sedan DeVille.

263
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,094
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,982
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

265
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:05,048
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

266
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,062
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

267
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,370
I'll call you
next Saturday.

268
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,779
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

269
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,700
Takin' back this
furniture, man.

270
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,995
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

271
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,290
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

272
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,596
There's no trust
in the world anymore.

273
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,120
I tried to stop them,
Mr. Benedict.

274
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,168
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

275
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,361
Vincent Benedict Incorporated.

276
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:18,409
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

277
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:22,577
- Mr. Benedict?
- Yeah?

278
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,426
- It's Al.
- It's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

279
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,176
Look, Miss Busby, uh...

280
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,002
Al, hang on a second.

281
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,038
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

282
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,169
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, I'll call you.

283
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,542
Whatever you think is best.

284
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,518
- All right.
- I'll take this.

285
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:43,448
Yeah, go ahead.
Take that.

286
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:46,547
Before I forget,
happy birthday.

287
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,702
Oh, how sweet.

288
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,713
That's very,
very nice of you.

289
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:57,650
- Aqua Velva?
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,500
You shouldn't have.
Stacey.

291
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,277
I'll give you
a call, okay?

292
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:07,831
All right, all right.

293
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:10,009
Al, save me!

294
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,928
Brand-new Caddy on level 4.

295
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,840
I'll be there!
Don't move! Bye.

296
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,954
Whoa!

297
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,456
Time's up, Vincent.

298
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:37,693
Did you hit me?
Because I didn't feel a thing.

299
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:40,550
I felt that.

300
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,129
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

301
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,110
I like my work.

302
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:50,695
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

303
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:52,802
I don't know
what the problem is,

304
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,947
but I'm sure it
can be resolved...

305
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,223
- without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

306
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:58,885
Okay?

307
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,226
Okay.

308
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:07,364
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

309
00:22:07,438 --> 00:22:08,453
Ahhh!

310
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:12,334
A little chest pain?

311
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,783
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

312
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,922
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

313
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:20,848
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

314
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:22,888
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

315
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,686
You don't know what
kind of an enemy I am.

316
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:28,367
- Who are you?
- I'm Vincent's brother.

317
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:30,508
- We're twins.
- That's right.

318
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:33,739
- You're firewood!
- Axe, Axe, Axe!

319
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,872
You have no respect
for logic.

320
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,276
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

321
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:47,023
And I have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

322
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,118
You're a very stupid person.

323
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,653
You tell your brother,

324
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,822
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

325
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:07,635
I love it when you
hit people, Julius.

326
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,018
Boom!

327
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,549
That was great!

328
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,469
Actually,
I hate violence.

329
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,390
But you're so good at it!

330
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:17,659
I've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

331
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,964
You could be a boxer.
I could be your manager.

332
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,329
- I don't think I could fight for money.
- No problem!

333
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:26,655
You do all the fighting,
I'll keep all the money.

334
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:29,177
I'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

335
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:32,930
How much money
do you owe?

336
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,811
Don't lie to me.
We're twins.

337
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:39,652
- I can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

338
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:41,627
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

339
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:43,557
We're nothin'!

340
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:49,954
Twenty thousand.

341
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:53,409
Due this morning.

342
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:00,937
Come on.

343
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:12,983
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

344
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,695
As long as I'm with you,
I won't let anyone harm you, okay?

345
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:23,453
Well, you're
a good guy, Julius.

346
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,819
Now, hang on
to your seat!

347
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,240
You know what?
I completely forgot.

348
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:40,761
I promised this
friend, Sammy,

349
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,005
that I'd pick his car up
from the airport.

350
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:44,929
Put it in the slot.

351
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:47,002
Would you do me
a big favor?

352
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:50,109
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

353
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,035
Oh, I would love to.

354
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,141
Good, that would
really be a big help.

355
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:57,596
Do you have a manual, please?

356
00:24:58,982 --> 00:25:01,153
- A manual?
- Yeah.

357
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:05,223
- It's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:07,263
There it is.

359
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:17,218
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

360
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,014
Whoa!

361
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:21,800
It's not up here.

362
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,138
Maybe it's under
the back tire.

363
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:28,395
Look... I mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tire.

364
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,087
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

365
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:33,672
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

366
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:35,598
No. Oh, well.

367
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:39,407
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

368
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,480
Handicapped children?

369
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,902
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

370
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,345
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

371
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,516
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

372
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,582
Do you really think
we should do that?

373
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,245
It's for children.

374
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,276
You got a point.

375
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:05,069
I saw a guy from
the Auto Club do this once.

376
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,663
What do you know,
beginners luck!

377
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,694
These cars have
terrific alarms!

378
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:15,096
I'll get it in a minute.

379
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,449
Just a second, Jules.

380
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:21,337
Whoa!

381
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:23,858
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

382
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,915
If you lift the rear end at an angle
greater than 45 degrees...

383
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:40,830
the mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system,

384
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:43,165
so that the alarm's
computer thinks...

385
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,470
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.

386
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,402
Can I have the keys
to your car?

387
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,306
You know,
the keys to your car?

388
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,544
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No yodeling.

389
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:00,867
Lovely day.

390
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,161
Come on, Julius.

391
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,137
Step on it!

392
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,237
Yeeeoow!

393
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,133
Oh, my God!

394
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,363
- I am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

395
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:42,952
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

396
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:46,854
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

397
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:48,838
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! I will do it!

398
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:10,003
Pick up the phone,
the phone.

399
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,853
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

400
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,849
This is Vincent's car.
Can I help you, please?

401
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,434
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

402
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,027
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

403
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:30,001
That's me.

404
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,799
Hello, yeah. Hello!

405
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:35,123
What are you
doing back there?

406
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:39,125
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

407
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:42,329
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

408
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,748
Apply it to the brake.
It's the thing next to the gas.

409
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:46,717
The brake pedal.

410
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:48,889
- Very gently.
- You got it.

411
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,157
Bye, Vincent.

412
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:54,265
All right.

413
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:00,409
Okay, it's a supermarket.

414
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:09,917
Ohhh!

415
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:11,811
Ohhh!

416
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,151
That's what I call fun.

417
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,265
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

418
00:29:27,338 --> 00:29:29,794
I can teach
you that, Vincent.

419
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:32,255
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

420
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:35,332
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

421
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:37,345
So, what do you think?

422
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,395
Angel's food
or devil's food?

423
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:41,323
Devil's.

424
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:43,778
- You know what
I really love about Vince?
- What?

425
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:46,473
He's a force of nature.

426
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:48,332
- You're outta control.
- No, I'm not.

427
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,050
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

428
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,935
I know. Geez,
you think I don't know that!

429
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,888
- I don't think you know that.
- Well, I do.

430
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:59,565
It's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

431
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,950
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

432
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:07,784
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- I can't hear this anymore.

433
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,708
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like I have,

434
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:13,107
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

435
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:15,116
and you'd get laid.

436
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,934
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

437
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:33,686
Excuse me.

438
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:36,848
She's not bad.

439
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:40,339
I had no idea
that these magazines...

440
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:44,537
had things like
this inside, inside them.

441
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:47,323
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

442
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,220
I come from a tropical island
in the South Pacific.

443
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:54,873
It's around 300 nautical miles,
south, southwest of Fiji.

444
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,262
I just got here yesterday
and I already found my brother.

445
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,020
Your brother?

446
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,031
That's right.

447
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:04,994
My twin brother, Vincent.

448
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:08,190
- Twins?
- Vince!

449
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:10,977
- Linda.
- Hi.

450
00:31:11,044 --> 00:31:13,794
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

451
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,868
- You do.
- Really?

452
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:23,228
Hi. Who's this guy?

453
00:31:23,303 --> 00:31:25,158
This is Vincent's brother.

454
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:28,486
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

455
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,243
You know each other?

456
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:32,801
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

457
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:36,584
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

458
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,400
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, Marnie.

459
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,362
Sisters?

460
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:46,501
Twins?

461
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,029
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

462
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,556
He's okay.
He's helping me out.

463
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:54,696
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

464
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:57,549
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

465
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,234
Catch ya later.

466
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:03,152
Great seeing ya.
Catch ya later.

467
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:05,104
Oops!

468
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,433
I've only been
driving an hour.

469
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:16,946
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

470
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:20,144
- Is Marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

471
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:23,826
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

472
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:26,066
- Me?
- Yeah.

473
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:29,714
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

474
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:32,206
You see,
women love men...

475
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,517
who are mysterious
and devious.

476
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,473
Keeps them on their toes.

477
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,637
- It excites them. You know what I mean?
- No.

478
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:42,292
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

479
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,251
They're strange
and sensitive.

480
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:46,617
They have compassion.

481
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:49,586
I have the highest
respect for women.

482
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,897
You're a virgin!

483
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,625
That's private.

484
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,884
A 230-pound virgin.

485
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:08,953
It's all right.
It's something...

486
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:11,743
It's just one
of those things.

487
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,259
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

488
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,897
Such a baby cat.
Look, did I neglect you?

489
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:22,176
Not anymore. Come on.

490
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:25,212
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

491
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:27,293
Okay, here you go.

492
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:29,635
You named
your cat Julius?

493
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,623
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

494
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:42,307
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

495
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:44,582
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

496
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,538
There you go.

497
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:50,630
I know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

498
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:54,246
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland,

499
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,772
we just nuke it.

500
00:33:56,845 --> 00:34:00,163
That's it. Here we go.

501
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:04,811
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

502
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:08,197
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

503
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,571
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

504
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,841
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out...

505
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,139
Look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

506
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:31,792
- Julius!
- Oh, I like nuked food.

507
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,645
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

508
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:00,376
Now let me get
this straight.

509
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:02,867
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

510
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:04,797
- Yes!
- And another one was...

511
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:08,605
- a physicist at M.I.T.?
- Yes, he won the Nobel Prize.

512
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,869
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

513
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:13,879
And Mom...

514
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:16,823
was like... superwoman.

515
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:22,075
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

516
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:24,635
And I was sent
to an orphanage,

517
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,293
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

518
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:29,950
by a scientist who
you do research for,

519
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,956
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

520
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,267
Did I leave anything out?

521
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:39,110
I think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

522
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:41,859
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

523
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:44,100
to the sperm milk shake.

524
00:35:44,168 --> 00:35:46,470
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

525
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:49,385
Do you know how many times
I've heard stories like this?

526
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,003
It's every
orphan's fantasy.

527
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,409
My real mom and dad
were rich...

528
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:56,417
and beautiful.

529
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,110
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

530
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,028
and I got switched
with another baby.

531
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,614
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

532
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,628
and there they'll be...

533
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:11,143
with open arms,
crying, "My darling.

534
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:14,282
"My treasure.
We didn't know.

535
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,491
How can we make
it up to you?"

536
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,081
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

537
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,071
It's a crock.

538
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:26,670
I liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

539
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,304
Here it is.
Read it and weep.

540
00:36:31,377 --> 00:36:34,694
"Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

541
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,640
- "for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
- Denied, yeah.

542
00:36:37,715 --> 00:36:41,807
"According to our files,
his mother did not die...

543
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,698
- "during birth.
- She's not dead.

544
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:46,099
"We have a current
address for her at...

545
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:48,141
"172 Canyon Glen Drive,
Los Angeles.

546
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:50,964
"Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment,

547
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,813
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid."

548
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:57,229
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

549
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,317
This letter was written
30 years ago.

550
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:05,720
We were five years old.

551
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:07,793
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

552
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:10,322
You knew all this time
where she was...

553
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,501
and you never
contacted her?

554
00:37:12,572 --> 00:37:16,883
I don't know about your mother,
"Miss Perfect, 1952,"

555
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:20,089
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive,

556
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,100
I hope she's
in a lot of pain.

557
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:24,029
She dumped me once.

558
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,517
There is no way I'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

559
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:29,407
If they have lied to us about Mama
for all these years,

560
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,539
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

561
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:35,195
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

562
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:37,241
I got a cash-flow problem.

563
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:40,893
- Hello.
- Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

564
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:43,297
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

565
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,568
Or else what, you blimp?

566
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:58,656
Oh, we're rollin'.

567
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:01,510
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

568
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:03,431
- Mr. Garfield, there's a man...
- Not now.

569
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,319
- Who are you?
- I'm Webster.

570
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:18,307
- It's okay!
- Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

571
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,421
We were never
supposed to meet.

572
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:23,657
- You're supposed to be...
- Driving that car down to Texas.

573
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,075
I got my driving gloves.
I got my driving glasses.

574
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,973
I got my driving hat.

575
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,461
But I got no car.

576
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:34,254
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

577
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,328
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

578
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,118
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

579
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:42,732
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

580
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,232
Sit down.

581
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,947
I got a reputation
to uphold.

582
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,566
People put their trust in me.

583
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:53,547
They know I always
deliver the goods...

584
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,924
and I always come
back with the money.

585
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,576
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

586
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:01,996
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

587
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:04,592
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

588
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:06,999
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

589
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:09,432
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

590
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:12,946
You know,
I just realized that...

591
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,834
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

592
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:17,754
has ever seen my face.

593
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:20,503
I don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

594
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,956
No, please, please!

595
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,408
- Hi.
- Hi.

596
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:49,949
- Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?
- Grandpa,

597
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,289
this man wants
to talk to you.

598
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:55,323
Thank you.

599
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:59,941
Hello?

600
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,894
Yes, can I help you?

601
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,966
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

602
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,894
I know this may
sound strange,

603
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,189
but I'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

604
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:12,104
Mary Ann Benedict.

605
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:19,591
She was my mother.

606
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:25,578
You're Mary Ann's son?

607
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:30,315
That looks just
like you, Grandpa.

608
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:32,487
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

609
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:35,308
and help Grandma
with lunch, okay?

610
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,193
Dad?

611
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:52,081
Uh... no!

612
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:56,108
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

613
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,188
Dad!

614
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,497
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! It is you!

615
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:02,606
This is a big surprise.

616
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:04,882
Dad, this is incredible.
I don't know what to...

617
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,285
We could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

618
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:10,134
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

619
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,230
Uh, Mr. Webster, I hope you are
happy with the vehicle...

620
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,650
we chose for
your little journey.

621
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:37,655
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

622
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:41,208
and ask for uh, uh,
Beetroot McKinley.

623
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:45,077
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

624
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:47,095
Thank you.

625
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:50,017
Mary Ann Benedict.

626
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:54,556
I haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

627
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:57,148
Your mother was...

628
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,489
an amazing woman.

629
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:03,900
Oh, the times I've wondered what would
have happened if I'd have married her.

630
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:06,210
Why didn't you?

631
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:09,857
Oh, I asked her to.
She turned me down.

632
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:13,440
She said she was afraid...

633
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:15,967
to have any more children.

634
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,910
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

635
00:42:18,985 --> 00:42:21,538
Who told her we died?

636
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:28,326
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

637
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:31,298
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

638
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:35,563
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

639
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:37,866
I'll have to pay
him a visit.

640
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:40,073
Watch out for him.

641
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,722
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what I mean.

642
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:47,337
Dickhead?

643
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:49,830
No, I don't.

644
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:53,004
But... I'm learning.

645
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:00,654
I'm concerned about the time frame.

646
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:03,473
That's my private line, honey.
I'll take care of that.

647
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,875
You boys, excuse me.

648
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:14,290
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

649
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:18,071
Uh, Webster.

650
00:43:18,136 --> 00:43:21,966
I'm callin' from California.
I happen to have something...

651
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,490
Some merchandise
that you might want.

652
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,181
Well, bring it to me, son.

653
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:30,160
Let me enrich you.

654
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,504
Well, uh, Mr. Beetroot,

655
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,743
it's the amount
of enrichment...

656
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,918
that I wanted
to talk about.

657
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,437
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

658
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:42,899
Now look, Beetroot,

659
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:46,073
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

660
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:48,599
Look, there's no way,
Mr. Beetroot,

661
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:52,251
that I am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

662
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,729
unless I know for sure
that I have...

663
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,137
twenty for my cut.

664
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:02,236
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

665
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,217
You're out of your
goddamn, greedy mind!

666
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:08,799
- I guess that seems
a little high for you.
- Yeah!

667
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:14,106
I'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

668
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:18,493
- The deal is five!
- Five?

669
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,672
I could do better
than five here.

670
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:26,302
If you can do better
than five million dollars,

671
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,695
well, then, son,
you take it.

672
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:46,702
Beetroot,
I'll see you in Houston.

673
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:48,839
After all, fair is fair.

674
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:52,621
I'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

675
00:44:52,688 --> 00:44:55,820
Well, good.

676
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:07,468
Five million!

677
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,678
Five million dollars!

678
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:11,887
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

679
00:45:11,957 --> 00:45:13,964
Five million dollars!

680
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:17,266
Five, five million dollars!

681
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:20,084
Five million dollars!

682
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,283
Five m-m-million!

683
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,215
Cash, lots of cash.

684
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,420
Whoa!

685
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:34,134
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

686
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:38,064
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- I met one of our fathers.

687
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,212
He told me about
a man in New Mexico...

688
00:45:40,283 --> 00:45:43,579
- who probably knows where Mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

689
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:46,012
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

690
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,566
You know what I mean?
She didn't abandon you.

691
00:45:48,638 --> 00:45:50,580
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

692
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:53,851
- They told her that I died.
- No kidding?

693
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:56,537
Look, Julius,
I'm in a hurry.

694
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,870
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

695
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:02,970
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

696
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:06,239
- So I'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

697
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:07,254
Hous...

698
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,233
- Hou... No!
- You know something?

699
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:13,177
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

700
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:17,246
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

701
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,099
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

702
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:23,068
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

703
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:26,045
We have to see this man, Traven,
in New Mexico.

704
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,989
- No, we don't have to see
this man in New Mexico.
- Yes, we do!

705
00:46:29,064 --> 00:46:31,934
And I'm coming with you.

706
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,553
We'll go see the man.

707
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,693
- I take a shower. I get my bags.
- Get your bags.

708
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:45,033
Be right out. Oh, boy!

709
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,134
I'll be here, bro.
Okay.

710
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:57,768
This place is a zoo!

711
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,004
Wait, wait.

712
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,321
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

713
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:09,136
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- God.

714
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,945
- It's not my birthday.
Better late than never.
- Oh.

715
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,980
Look what Marnie
made for Julius.

716
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:18,695
- You baked?
- Yeah. Is Julius around?

717
00:47:18,765 --> 00:47:23,338
- He's taking a shower.
- I'll go give these to him.

718
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:24,716
So-o-o!

719
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:28,329
- Where'd you get this car?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

720
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:32,426
- Where you going?
- Inside. Have some coffee?

721
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:36,327
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say good-bye.

722
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:38,857
Take out your papers and your trash

723
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,833
Or you don't get
no spending cash

724
00:47:41,907 --> 00:47:44,625
If you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

725
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:46,732
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

726
00:47:46,804 --> 00:47:49,292
Yakety-yak yakety-yak
Don't talk back

727
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,892
Marnie!

728
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:55,924
Excuse me, but I was
just taking a shower.

729
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,845
Good singing.

730
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,180
I baked you some cookies.

731
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:03,096
- Cookies?
- I guess it was a dumb idea.

732
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:07,188
No, not at all. I'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

733
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,882
- I should put on some clothes.
- I'm sorry, I'll turn around.

734
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:17,112
Linda and I just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

735
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,930
- for his birthday.
- I had birthday, too.

736
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,971
Oh, that's right.

737
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:25,046
You're twins.

738
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:31,542
Huh?

739
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:33,504
Whoa.

740
00:48:33,568 --> 00:48:37,017
What is it?

741
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:39,959
I don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

742
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,489
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!

743
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:44,418
Excuse me!

744
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,423
Excuse me.

745
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,793
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money,

746
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:53,855
never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

747
00:48:53,925 --> 00:48:57,854
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince?

748
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:01,026
I cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

749
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:04,325
Vincent,
I'm comin' with you.

750
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:06,564
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

751
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:08,706
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not coming.

752
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:12,039
You could get killed and die and
I wouldn't know what happened.

753
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:14,375
- No!
- You say "no" one more time,

754
00:49:14,442 --> 00:49:18,055
- I'm gonna tell everybody that there's...
- Shut up! Shut up!

755
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,359
All right. Oh, God.

756
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,502
All right, you're coming.

757
00:49:26,573 --> 00:49:30,600
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

758
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,060
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

759
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,274
like in "Roots" or something.
All right?

760
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:37,417
- Does this one look okay?
- It looks fine.

761
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:40,838
It's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

762
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:44,296
- Marnie, guess what?
- Linda, what?

763
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,240
Vince just asked us to go to New Mexico
and Texas with him.

764
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:49,584
This is a great idea.

765
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:53,165
- Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?
- Yeah.

766
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:56,466
I thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

767
00:49:56,533 --> 00:49:58,388
and spent a few days
on the road together.

768
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,493
Nice shirt.

769
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:05,554
- Feels great. It's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

770
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:09,391
It's okay. Come out.

771
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,115
All right. Here, Linda.

772
00:50:12,185 --> 00:50:15,448
Oh, can I ride
in front with Vincent?

773
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:17,587
- Sure.
- Thanks.

774
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,773
Now, let me see.

775
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:37,214
I'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

776
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,352
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

777
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:42,043
Have a nice day.

778
00:50:44,993 --> 00:50:49,085
Now, where do I find
this very special person,

779
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:52,668
Mr. Vince Benedict?
