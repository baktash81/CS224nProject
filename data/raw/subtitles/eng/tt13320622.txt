1
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,362
You were incredible.

2
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,227
My heart is still racing.

3
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,437
I felt it too.

4
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,474
All thanks
to your brute strength, Dash,

5
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:03,718
and your knowledge
of ancient Aramaic mathematics.

6
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:06,721
Please. This has nothing to do
with my two doctorates

7
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,896
and my master's
in Gender Studies

8
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:12,762
and everything to do
with you, Dr. Love more.

9
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,109
The truth is,

10
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,594
I never thought I would find
the Lost City of D.

11
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:20,632
I would choose your
words carefully.

12
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:22,496
They will be your last.

13
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,362
You led me right
to King Kalaman's tomb

14
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:30,055
and his queen's
legendary Crown of Fire.

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,058
And now I will be very rich,

16
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:35,854
and you will be very dead.

17
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:40,169
Hold up. Are these...
Are these your snakes?

18
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:41,894
No, they were just here.

19
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:44,449
There were just hundreds
of snakes in this temple

20
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,416
just waiting for us to show up?

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,625
Who feeds them? You feed them?
No, what do they eat?

22
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,017
Why is that one not biting that guy?
Why is that happening?

23
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,906
- Are they trained not to bite henchmen or something?
- - Yeah, well...

24
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,288
I mean, the snake-to-temple
ratio alone...

25
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,842
This is ridiculous.
Delete.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,018
I... I think my character
can still work.

27
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,847
Delete.

28
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:06,126
Loretta, you still have
a story to write.

29
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,128
Delete.

30
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,373
Hey, it's me, Beth.

31
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:14,972
I don't want to pull the whole
"I'm your publisher" card, but I am.

32
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,344
And I'm really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter.

33
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:19,484
But no pressure.
No, there actually is pressure.

34
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:23,764
The exact amount of pressure that
motivates you but doesn't paralyze you.

35
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,248
You got this.

36
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:27,801
Thank you.

37
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,908
Me again.

38
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:31,875
Okay, so everything
is set for the book tour,

39
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,809
but, uh, the only thing we need
is a book to tour with.

40
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:37,133
I can't help but get the feeling
that you're not finishing

41
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,607
because you don't want
to leave your house.

42
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,888
Listen, I know these last five years
have been hard after John's passing,

43
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:48,375
and it feels easier
to live in your bathtub,

44
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:51,136
drinking Chardonnay on ice.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,035
But, girl, there is a great
big world waiting for you

46
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,142
and a book tour that I can't cancel,
so just make it happen, all right?

47
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,488
Love you, bye!

48
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,026
We have to keep going.

49
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,547
Let's see what's on the
other side of that door.

50
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,756
But what if
there isn't anything?

51
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,586
There's only one way
to find out.

52
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,417
Then Love more realized

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,798
the treasure she wanted
was lost forever

54
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,284
and her adventures
were coming to an end.

55
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,526
That doesn't feel right.

56
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,425
Yeah, but that's it.

57
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,978
That's the end.

58
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,575
Well, John,

59
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,266
here I go.

60
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,648
Dulcius ex as per is.

61
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:03,933
Okay, honey, it's showtime.
Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,626
Because I have a wedgie in the
back and in the front in this thing.

63
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,973
I feel like
a nerdy figure skater.

64
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:12,769
Sexy. Stunner. I'm all
about it. No, it's not. It's not.

65
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,806
- How do I move in this?
- Don't touch it.

66
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:17,198
I'm not touching it. I'm holding
it out. Stop it. Will you stop?

67
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,397
Get it out now
'cause you can't do that onstage.

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,192
And we're done.
And we're done. Okay, good.

69
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,194
Do I need to be wearing
a glitter onesie?

70
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,827
You only have to wear this
for two hours.

71
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,898
Do not mess this up, do
you hear me? This is on loan.

72
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,924
Everyone's wearing
sequins right now.

73
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,514
Why is she taking my photo?
This is Allison.

74
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,930
She is our new
social media manager.

75
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,864
And she's gonna be helping us
target that younger demographic.

76
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:41,453
Meaning women in their 30s
who wish they were in their 20s.

77
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,075
Hey, what's up?

78
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:46,527
Um, I took over your socials,
so this morning you tweeted,

79
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:51,808
"Where are my ladies at?
Meet me at Ballroom G at 5:00 p.m.

80
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:53,362
#ShawnMendes.

81
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,330
#GaggingToMeetYouAll."

82
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,988
Okay, we are having fun.
Let's go.

83
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,060
We need to remind people
that you are still alive.

84
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,579
People know I'm alive.

85
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,650
And to remind them
why this used to be

86
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,824
the best selling franchise.
In Romance.

87
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,551
Yes, which is the top
revenue-generating literary category.

88
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,520
Revenue-generating isn't how
I would describe our presales right now.

89
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,763
Just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth.

90
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,569
Oh, you want word of mouth?
Here we go. How's this?

91
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:20,389
"The only thing more lost than
the city is the author herself."

92
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,252
"Loveless."
"Passionless."

93
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,256
Uh, "Way past her prime." And,
oh, "This is fake history at its worst."

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,535
A book tour could
change everything, okay?

95
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,951
We have to remind the fans
why they love you so much.

96
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:34,644
Real history. I merely season
it with a smidge more nudity.

97
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,957
History had a ton of nudity.

98
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,891
Deep exploration.

99
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:42,480
Steamy wondering.

100
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:47,623
Will Love more and Dash find
Queen Taha's priceless Crown of Fire?

101
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,521
Join them on their search.

102
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,637
So, listen, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

103
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:52,904
There's so many people.

104
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,147
I know how much you hate
doing these things,

105
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,978
so I've invited Alan to do
the Q and A with you today.

106
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,083
- What?
- And the rest of the book tour.

107
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:03,155
Beth, I expressly asked not to do
any more events with Dash... Alan, Alan!

108
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,089
- He's gonna humiliate me.
- He's not gonna humiliate you.

109
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:09,230
Thank you. You're very good at your
job. Thank you so much. Thank you.

110
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,542
Let me help you with that.

111
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,544
He is... He's
a body wash commercial.

112
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,512
He's always glistening
all over the place.

113
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,515
There hasn't been an event where
his shirt didn't come flying off.

114
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,137
- You wish.
- Well, he's already here,

115
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,440
so put on your big-girl panties
and let's get out there.

116
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,660
Remember, no grumpy face,
big words or boring academic talk.

117
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:28,042
Yes! Yes!

118
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,079
Come on, RTP!

119
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,667
Ha-ha!

120
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,014
Yes, my Love more-heads!

121
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,569
I am so excited
to introduce to you

122
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:41,504
the award-winning author,
Loretta Sage!

123
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:44,162
Beth, I can't do this. I'm not
ready. Are you kidding me?

124
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:45,991
Listen, I've got your back.
You got this.

125
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,614
Go give the people
what they want.

126
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,581
It's not me they want.
Get out there now!

127
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,967
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thank you.

128
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,043
Yep. Mount it.

129
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:08,393
Mount it. Mount it.
Okay.

130
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,188
Find your center.

131
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,847
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

132
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,711
The sexiest...
All right!

133
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:19,818
Most influential hero
of a generation.

134
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,130
That's a bit strong.

135
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,857
His 20th cover
of an Angela Love more novel.

136
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,584
Dash McMahon!

137
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,557
Oh, my God! Dash!

138
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,582
Take a bow. I already
did mine. I did mine.

139
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:02,654
Okay, come on.
One more. I got you.

140
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,326
Did you guys rehearse that?
Oh, my God.

141
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:23,261
I'm loving this chemistry
between you two, and I got to say,

142
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:25,505
I love this book.

143
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:26,688
Oh, thank you, Ray.
Thank...

144
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,128
Spoiler alert.

145
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:29,509
A really bold choice

146
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,545
to not have them go
into the tomb at the end.

147
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,271
Talk about
what went into this one.

148
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:36,826
I mean, this one's such a
special book for me personally.

149
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,760
I... I don't know how to say
how much it means to me

150
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,969
that Loretta,
word writer extraordinaire,

151
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:45,110
has, you know,
named the book after me.

152
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,043
The Lost City of Dash.

153
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,251
The Lost City of D.

154
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,599
Um, but that's not what
the D stands for.

155
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,291
It's D for "dick," right?
No dick, no.

156
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:56,501
It's based on the name of an ancient
tribe, Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

157
00:08:56,605 --> 00:09:01,161
And, um, it was too difficult for the
European colonizers to pronounce,

158
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,544
so, in true colonial fashion they
abbreviated it. No one cares about this.

159
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:06,373
That's so interesting.
Okay.

160
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,789
How about we take some questions
from the audience?

161
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,688
Right here, handsome!
Yes.

162
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,933
- Dash, what's your favorite romantic moment?
- Ooh.

163
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:19,559
What I would really like to know is what
is Loretta's favorite romantic moment?

164
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,595
Ooh, spicy.

165
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:23,632
Oh, uh...

166
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:26,427
Well, being a sapiosexual...

167
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,740
Oh, is that when they do
the snakes around the...

168
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:32,917
No. That's someone
who finds, uh, intellect

169
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,921
or intelligence,
uh, very sexy, you know.

170
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,129
Same.

171
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,855
Really?

172
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,374
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

173
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:46,206
No, no, no. We're not gonna do that
today. We're here for Loretta's book.

174
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,173
Do we have questions
for Loretta?

175
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:53,454
Uh, yes, studious-looking young
lady? What would you like to ask me?

176
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,595
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

177
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,978
No, no. We're not gonna
do this again. Sorry.

178
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,602
Rip it off! Rip it off!

179
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,018
Rip it off! Rip it off!
Rip it off!

180
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,849
Of course. Of course, yes.
Can do.

181
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,093
Is this happening?

182
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,922
You don't have to do this.
Oh, we have to.

183
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:15,097
We have to give the people
what they want. Yes, yes.

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,927
We have to give the people
what they want, yes.

185
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,275
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy.

186
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:26,039
Because The Lost City of D
is Dash's final adventure.

187
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,213
If there even is a next book,

188
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:31,423
it will open with Love more
receiving the tragic news

189
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,874
of his untimely death.

190
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,358
What?

191
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,991
Shit. I'm sorry. My smart
watch is stuck. Ow. Hold on.

192
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,085
I know. Don't pull it.

193
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,708
It's okay. Just be real still.

194
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,306
No. That's pulling it.
You're pulling it.

195
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,919
You're gonna rip my wig off.
No, you can't...

196
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,337
Oh, my!

197
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,822
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

198
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:52,548
God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,309
- I'm so sorry.
- You're a bad person.

200
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:59,659
Stick around for the
costume contest at 6:00 p.m.

201
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,765
"If there is another book"?

202
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm investing everything
we've got into this tour, okay?

203
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:11,325
I just don't think I have another
Dash and Love more adventure in me.

204
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,810
How does Dash die?

205
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,053
Was it the snakes?
No.

206
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,504
Okay, so I have something
that I have to take care of.

207
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,058
You guys have an interview
in the next suite in ten minutes.

208
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:22,578
So can you please do me a favor
and be grown-ups

209
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,200
and get yourselves there
on your own?

210
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:25,512
Okay. Thank you so much.

211
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,377
Does he die from
a staph infection?

212
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,415
It is a staph infection.
I knew it.

213
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:34,970
I-I... All right.

214
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:38,145
Look, I get it if you need
a break or something,

215
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,251
but you can't just kill me, okay?
Okay.

216
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:44,738
I hate that I have to ask this, but
you do know you're not Dash, right?

217
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,016
Dash is a character I made up.

218
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,362
Dash?

219
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,435
Thanks.

220
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,747
Thank you.

221
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,510
Loretta, it's this way.
No, I think it's this way.

222
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,961
Can't you see that Dash
means so much to people?

223
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,929
Means so much to you.
Not to me.

224
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,712
Well, yeah, to me,
but to other people too.

225
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:07,761
What about Beth? You know
what? Beth is gonna be fine.

226
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:11,696
She's gonna find plenty fresh,
young writers full of great ideas.

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,802
You can transition gracefully

228
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:16,252
into the shirt-on phase
of your modeling career,

229
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,702
and I can be left alone.

230
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,531
Everybody is happy.

231
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,430
No, it's this way.

232
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,442
Beth says you don't even
leave the house anymore.

233
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,503
I don't feel like
that's very happy.

234
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,585
You should be going out in the world,
filling yourself up on new experiences.

235
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:30,853
I'm already filled up.
I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

236
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:34,305
Why would you want to be stuck at
home alone when you could see the world?

237
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:35,927
You could be visiting
ancient Greece.

238
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:38,930
Okay. How could I visit
ancient Greece?

239
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,070
I get it. Because
you're afraid of flying.

240
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,591
No. Because ancient Greece
is in the past.

241
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:46,248
Just like Dash.

242
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:49,561
Okay. You want to know who else
is stuck in the past? You are.

243
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,426
You're so afraid of life hurting
you again that you've stopped living.

244
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,843
You're like a human mummy.

245
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,363
I didn't, um...

246
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,814
Oh.

247
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,058
Mummies are human.

248
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,310
Stupid... Oh, crap.

249
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,348
I'm so sorry.
I-I will clean this up.

250
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,937
I am not a litterer,
I-I assure you that.

251
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,526
Do you, um... Do you think you
could, uh, call a car for me, please?

252
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,149
Thank you. Thank you.

253
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,084
Bring the car around.

254
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,637
God, is that someone's retainer?

255
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,088
I've never said the right thing
one time around her.

256
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,124
I get nervous
because she opens her mouth,

257
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:39,680
and just an encyclopedia of beautifulness
comes out, and I just never say...

258
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,096
You know
she's trying to kill me?

259
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,374
I just need those tomatoes.

260
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,825
You're right.
No, you're right.

261
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,412
I should apologize.
Thank you, man.

262
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,759
I appreciate that very, very much.
You're welcome.

263
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:02,186
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

264
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:08,502
Uh...

265
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:11,022
Hiya.

266
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,610
Uh, I did not order an UberPool.

267
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,682
Someone wants to meet you.
We'll have you right back.

268
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:16,959
Um...

269
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:21,722
Loretta!

270
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,345
Loretta! Loretta?

271
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,108
Uh, Loretta?

272
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,800
Did you say "Loretta"?
Yeah.

273
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,112
Follow that SUV, man.
No.

274
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,976
Come on, please!
No, no, no.

275
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,152
I'm not helping any more handsome
strangers. Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

276
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,569
What is this, Taken?
Am I "tooken"?

277
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,088
Am I sold already?

278
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:45,194
Am I...
Am I sold to him?

279
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,957
Ow. Stop.
Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

280
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,683
I said
don't make it creepy, guys.

281
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,616
I'm so sorry about the setting.

282
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,309
I just flew in.
I was in a real panic to meet you.

283
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,483
I didn't have time
to dress the place up much.

284
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,383
I read you love cheese,
so I just got them all.

285
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:05,559
Are you the one who's been
emailing me for photos of my feet?

286
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,527
No. Um...

287
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,945
And I promise what I'm about to show
you is gonna make you very happy.

288
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,913
But first, a little bit

289
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:17,226
about the mysterious rogue
you see before you.

290
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,608
Uh, my name is Abigail Fairfax.

291
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,645
Abigail? It's a gender-neutral
name, like Leslie or Beverly.

292
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:26,442
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax
of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

293
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:30,584
Didn't you just
take over your company or...

294
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:34,623
No, that was my brother, actually.
That was Leslie. We're all very proud.

295
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,833
Ah. Yes, I should say so,
at such a young age to...

296
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,869
Some might even say too young.

297
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,700
But that world
never really interested me.

298
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:45,392
My passions, as you may know,

299
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:48,602
lie in the hidden things
in the world,

300
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,329
things which defy possession.

301
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,470
Um, some might call me
a collector.

302
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:58,267
But there is one obsession
in particular

303
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,476
that has held me captive.

304
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,134
The Crown of Fire

305
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,619
and its cascading red diamonds.

306
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:09,382
Is this a... Is this
a hidden-camera thing?

307
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:13,075
So imagine my surprise
when, in your new book,

308
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:16,458
amidst the pages
of coital reverie,

309
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:17,390
was something...

310
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,564
Oh, God... quite magnificent.

311
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:23,983
I get it. I get it.
I so get it right now.

312
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,398
Oh, my gosh.

313
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,676
I literally thought
you guys kidnapped me.

314
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,265
I mean, this is marketing,
right? Beth set this up?

315
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:33,268
This was so good, you guys.
This was amazing.

316
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:36,616
You, with your gun
and your mustache

317
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:39,688
and your, "You'd better
get in there" and you know...

318
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,415
Oh, my God.

319
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:46,281
You, with the G.I. Joe
tone-on-tone outfit.

320
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:51,389
Your fictional archaeologist was making
real translations of a dead language.

321
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:54,392
Mm-hmm. Something nobody
else has been able to do.

322
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,912
Well, nobody else
had ever tried.

323
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,845
Is that right?
Am I saying the right thing?

324
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,605
Except you, right?

325
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,676
Except me!

326
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,506
Yes. See, it turns out

327
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,923
Loretta Sage was once a young
college girl doing her dissertation

328
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,891
on the dead language of the D
with her future husband,

329
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:14,102
dreaming of finding Kalaman's tomb
and the Crown of Fire.

330
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:17,312
I was sorry to read you gave up
your search after he died.

331
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,038
But what that means is,

332
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:22,213
you're all I have left.

333
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,492
All-All you have left
for... what?

334
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:26,631
Hmm.

335
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,669
Oh.

336
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,153
Here we go.

337
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,996
What is this?

338
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,793
I believe it is describing the
exact location of Kalaman's tomb,

339
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:54,349
in which Taha and her
priceless headdress are buried.

340
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:56,592
Well, if this were authentic,

341
00:17:56,696 --> 00:18:02,046
you would still have to
uncover an entire city

342
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,187
that nobody
has been able to find.

343
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,947
I found it.

344
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,192
On a tiny, forgotten island
in the Atlantic called Isla Hundida.

345
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:13,851
What I have not been able to
find is Kalaman's final resting place.

346
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:18,235
This piece of parchment is the
only clue we found among the ruins.

347
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:21,479
I need someone
who can decipher these symbols.

348
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,654
I need you.

349
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,243
Well... Miss Sage,

350
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:29,729
surely this isn't how
you want your story to end.

351
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:32,421
We both had our dreams crushed
by bad luck,

352
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,768
or in my case,
an arse-kissing little brother,

353
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,978
but this is our chance
to show them all.

354
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,670
Come with me...
to the island.

355
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:44,916
Translate these symbols and
help me find the Crown of Fire.

356
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,643
You can name your price.

357
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:53,097
I must respectfully decline.

358
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,172
Well...

359
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,762
I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

360
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,145
But I understand how you feel.

361
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,253
Will you at least let us
give you a ride?

362
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:15,637
Oh, no, thank you. I'll call
for my own car, and I'll just...

363
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,972
I don't feel like you're listening to me.
This is urgent, and we...

364
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:44,010
Okay, so the police are saying
that they put out an APB...

365
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:45,770
APB... on an SUV,

366
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:48,117
and there's
this 24-hour rule... Why is there a rule?

367
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,717
And they won't do anything until...
What about the FBI or the CIA?

368
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,788
- They said to call the police.
- I'm sure Loretta's fine.

369
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:55,401
When I was in college,
my friend Nicki went missing.

370
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,126
Everyone was, like,
freaking out.

371
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,577
But then she was just
in her car.

372
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,856
She was dead, but we found her.
She wasn't gone.

373
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,309
Um, what about...
Maybe we could get a PI

374
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,932
or, like, you know,
private security or...

375
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:11,934
What about an extraction team,
like the movie?

376
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,523
Yes! But who does that?
The ex-military, right?

377
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,216
Oh, yeah. I think I actually have
somebody that could help us.

378
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:20,288
- Oh.
- I did this meditation retreat,

379
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,462
and there was this
trainer guy there.

380
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,084
You should
see this guy meditate.

381
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,603
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

382
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,504
He... He's a special ops trainer.
What was his name?

383
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,333
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

384
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:33,059
So he's a trainer
named Jack Trainer?

385
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,417
That's how I have everybody in
my phone. See, "Janice Mom."

386
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,890
"Larry Doorknob."
"Stacy Butt Stuff."

387
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:39,686
Look, this is what this guy does.
He finds people.

388
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,068
If there's anybody
that can help us, it's him.

389
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:51,526
Jack Trainer.
Oh, so his name is actually Jack Trainer.

390
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:55,530
Hi, uh, this is Alan
from "Touching Your Inner Self."

391
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,843
The meditation retreat?

392
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:03,641
Anyway, uh, okay. Our friend
Loretta has been kidnapped,

393
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,194
and no one's helping us.

394
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,782
How long she been missing?

395
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,128
Maybe two hours now.

396
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:09,544
Who is that?

397
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:13,686
Um, this is B...
This is Beth. I'm Beth.

398
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,205
And Allison is on too, sir.

399
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,518
Did she have any
Wi-Fi-enabled devices?

400
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:21,521
- She's got her phone, right?
- No, I have her phone.

401
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,248
Oh! She has a smart watch.
It ripped my wig off.

402
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,286
What was that scenario?
Never mind. Open the phone.

403
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:28,942
Go to the smart watch app.
All right.

404
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:31,359
Then hit "Find My Smart watch."

405
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:34,396
Oh, my... That is so good.
That's why we called.

406
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,950
"Anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy."

407
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:40,747
Is that Oprah or Deepak?
Laozi from Tao-te Ching.

408
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,059
Oh, my God.

409
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,854
It's in the Atlantic.

410
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:46,305
- She's on a plane?
- How can you tell that?

411
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:48,583
'Cause she can't swim that fast.

412
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:50,136
Doesn't sound like
a ransom scenario.

413
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,863
My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.

414
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,797
Possibly some coke-fueled
dark web scavenger hunt.

415
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,937
Real clown shit.
We'll have to move fast.

416
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,974
- How do we pay you?
- Cryptocurrency. Cash App.

417
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,564
I'll have her back within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free.

418
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:06,152
How many people
need a next rescue?

419
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,774
More than you'd think.

420
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,787
- I'm gonna need that phone.
- I'll bring it to you.

421
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,572
Let me know where she lands.
I'll meet you there, Alan.

422
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,623
Hello.

423
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:34,353
Where am I?

424
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:36,458
Um, you're on my plane.

425
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:37,770
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

426
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,703
The seats are made of
mama llama leather.

427
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:42,913
Well, I'm getting off
your plane.

428
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:44,397
Unchain me!

429
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,054
That's your seat belt.

430
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,505
Did you chloroform me?

431
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,817
People actually do that?

432
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,857
Well, you know,
it's a classic for a reason.

433
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:57,790
My body feels drunk.

434
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,792
It'll wear off in a bit.
I am sorry.

435
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,311
I just couldn't wait around
for you to change your mind.

436
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,866
Stop playing jelly.
Time is not on our side.

437
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,696
You see, the volcano
we're excavating around

438
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,767
has developed
a bad case of indigestion.

439
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,735
I'm rather worried
that when it blows,

440
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:13,989
everything that's left
of the Lost City will be destroyed.

441
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:15,911
Oh, my God.
My legs don't work.

442
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:21,434
So, this is our last chance to
find both the tomb and the crown.

443
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,574
- Oh, God.
- Oh!

444
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:25,956
Don't worry.
That's just our final descent.

445
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,065
But it is the beginning of the
greatest adventure of your life.

446
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,757
Welcome to the Lost City.

447
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:53,802
How did you find it?

448
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:56,046
So, the city was built
on a lava dome.

449
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:58,842
As the volcano became active,
the dome filled with lava,

450
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:01,569
and sunken things
rose to the surface.

451
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:03,571
The D exposed itself.

452
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:06,712
- The entire city?
- No, no. Just the tip.

453
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:10,025
As soon as I heard rumors of the
ruins, I flew over and bought the place.

454
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:13,408
The site? No. The
island. The southern half.

455
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,859
I got a good deal
'cause this is where the lava flows.

456
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:18,206
We've been excavating
for a year now.

457
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:21,830
One doesn't kidnap a
romance novelist on day one.

458
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,970
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

459
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:27,077
Rafi doesn't like it.
Do you, Rafi?

460
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,356
He says
we're disrespecting his heritage.

461
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:33,704
But not a lot of other job options
on the island, are there, Rafi?

462
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:35,879
Beggars can't be choosers.

463
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:47,546
No more charcuterie, I take it.

464
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,755
Mmm. Please.
I'm not a monster.

465
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:51,688
Whatever you need, just shout.

466
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:58,073
Uh, leave one hand free.
She has some translating to do.

467
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,524
And then what?

468
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:03,147
Loretta, I really wish
you would try and see

469
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,391
what an exciting opportunity
this is for us.

470
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:09,395
I believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb.

471
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:12,018
It's a logographic system.

472
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:15,366
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

473
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,267
Now, if you have other documents
that possibly I can compare...

474
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,648
Yeah, no luck there.

475
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,547
We found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall,

476
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,548
but it was useless.

477
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,205
Just pictures of women.

478
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:30,899
Look, I, too, wish your dear
old dead archaeologist husband

479
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:33,730
was here to help,
but he's not, so,

480
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:36,940
time to shine, Loretta,
sex-book writer.

481
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,081
They will come for me.

482
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:42,393
Who, exactly?

483
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:44,223
Your... Your many cats?

484
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:46,121
Oh, I don't have cats.

485
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,537
Somehow even more sad.

486
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,610
I have a hamster, asshole!

487
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:53,370
You have a hamster's asshole?

488
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:57,236
No, there was a... there was
a comma between... Forget it.

489
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:00,757
I bet your brother never had
to kidnap anyone!

490

491
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:40,175

Good to see you, man.

495
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,811
Phone.
Right.

496
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,927
What?

497
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:10,619
Yeah, I was thinking
that I could, you know,

498
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,311
maybe just sort of
come with you.

499
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:14,175
Why?
To help.

500
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,420
I know CPR. I know some
light karate. CrossFit certified.

501
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:20,043
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

502
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,597
I just... It's my fault.

503
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,806
Not the kidnapping and stuff,

504
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,982
but, like, I said some really
mean stuff to her, and I regret it,

505
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:29,708
and I just need to take it back.

506
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,192
I called her a human mummy.

507
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:33,953
Mummies are human.

508
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:37,025
I'm aware of that now, yes.

509
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:40,166
That is true.

510
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,271
Please.

511
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:45,240
All right, Alan,
I can't be responsible for you.

512
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,208
Okay. Yeah.

513
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:50,280
I need you to stay in the car.
Yeah.

514
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:52,489
In the car.
In the car.

515
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:55,043
The whole time.
The whole time?

516
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,389
Whole time.

517
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:57,736
Mm-hmm.

518
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,773
Yes!

519
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,057
This is me.

520
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,233
Really? Is this what
the SEAL teams use?

521
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,994
"Only a fool chooses a horse
by its color."

522
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,894
Right, right.
The Tao-te Ching?

523
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:21,138
No, it was on the sign
back there at the rental place.

524
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:30,872

I was hoping to invite you
to breakfast,

you still have work to do.

Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

537
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,609
I believe this says

538
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:20,715
"rest" or "resting."

539
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,718
So it would be,
"Kalaman and his treasure..."

540
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,309
And then there are some missing
pieces, and then "rest," "resting,"

541
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:31,830
and something about
"tears," so...

542
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,625
Resting where?

543
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,937
Hmm? Oh!

544
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,802
Didn't say.
It doesn't say.

545
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:43,151
Miss Sage,
I need you to do better.

546
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:46,706
Then next time maybe don't
kidnap a romance novelist, hmm?

547
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,019
My God,
this shouldn't be this hard!

548
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:51,056
It is not some pauper's grave
we're looking for.

549
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,437
It is a monument to a great man!

550
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,474
King Kalaman was ambitious,
he was powerful,

551
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:58,028
he was the first man
to build a city in the Atlantic.

552
00:30:58,132 --> 00:31:00,789
The eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him.

553
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:04,138
He would have had a pyramid,
a ziggurat, a tower

554
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,209
to hold his Crown of Fire.

555
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:09,212
All I need to know
is where it is.

556
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:12,560
I don't know if you recall,
but you only said translate it.

557
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,803
I-I translated it.

558
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,185
Translate it again.

559
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,849
One day, we're gonna
laugh about this.

560
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,093
Such an adventure we're having.

561
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:35,548
I should go with you,
just for backup and awesomeness.

562
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,172
This is pretty awesome.

563
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:40,933
You got nature, the radio.

564
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:45,696
Yeah, you're right,
but it's very, very important to me

565
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,664
that she knows
that I came to rescue her.

566
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,459
Why?
Do you like this woman?

567
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,669
No, I just brought snacks
and stuff.

568
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:54,947
And she gets a little grumpy
when she's hungry.

569
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:58,468
Blood pressure drops. And I get that
because I'm a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

570
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:01,367
Do you keto, by the way?
You look like you keto.

571
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,162
No.
No. Yeah.

572
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,992
You don't need it.

573
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:06,579
What is it?

574
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:10,273
I just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model.

575
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:14,622
But, Alan, you are so much
more. You're my lookout.

576
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:18,074
Okay, can I at least do the part
where I put her in the car

577
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:21,905
and I just go,
"Shh. You're safe now"?

578
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,977
Sure, champ.
She'll love that.

579
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:26,945
Oh, you're just going?
Going to start?

580
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,464

Still not in!

00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,402
Forward, forward!
Okay. Okay.

681
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:25,820
- I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
- Drive!

682
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:30,584
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

683
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,621
Ow.

684
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,865
Shh. You're safe now.
No, I'm not. Not safe.

685
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:37,729
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

686
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,835
- I don't think that's yours.
- Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

687
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,976
Cheese and rice!

688
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,564
Are those his brains?
What?

689
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:47,635
I think his brains
are on my face!

690
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:51,363
Definitely his brains are in my mouth.
I can taste his thoughts!

691
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,675
Focus on the road.

692
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,918
He just liked
training people. Trainer.

693
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:57,887
- What are you talking about?
- He loved me.

694
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,579
Can you just scooch the car
over to the left?

695
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:04,411
Get it off. Get it off.
Oh, God.

696
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:05,791
Watch out!

697
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,902
Oh! Oh! Oh!

698
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,906
Oh, did you see...

699
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:20,910
No.

700
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,641
Oh.

701
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,403
Oh, no. Oh, no.

702
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,440
Oh, no.

703
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:43,415
Oh, no.

704
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,900
Alan?

705
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:49,594
Oh, holy Christmas.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

706
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,768
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

707
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:53,425
Yeah. Okay.

708
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:56,428
You just flew out of the car.
I did. I did, indeed.

709
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:57,981
Okay. I got you.
I got you.

710
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,536
Can you get me out of the chair?
Get me out of the chair.

711
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,469
You're right.
You're right. You're right.

712
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:05,644
Is that... Is that
a nail filer? Yeah.

713
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:07,232
Can you just rip it?
It's working.

714
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,130
And maybe next time
I toss a gun at you,

715
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,132
you can catch it
instead of ducking.

716
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:14,446
How about the next time you toss a
gun at me, you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

717
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,414
Then maybe do that
before you throw it?

718
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,623
Well, "here"
is a synonym for "catch."

719
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:20,324
No, "here" is not a cinnamon
for "catch."

720
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:22,420
In a colloquial kind of way,
yes, it is.

721
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:24,629
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a sweatshirt.

722
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:26,734
You say, "Here,"
I toss you a pen.

723
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:29,910
How 'bout just,
"Hey! Catch! Gun!"

724
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:33,016
Anything that you want to throw,
I'll catch it because you said, "Catch."

725
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,880
And I'll catch it
because you said it.

726
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:37,400
That is also an option, and then
we would have a gun with us.

727
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:38,608
That's a thing.

728
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:40,990
Be careful.
Okay, we need to call...

729
00:40:41,093 --> 00:40:42,750
Be careful.

730
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,414
We need to call for help,
get to the airport and get out of here.

731
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,479
And I am driving.
Okay.

732
00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:52,553
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

733
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:04,669
Okay, call for...
call for help.

734
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:06,567
Where's your phone?

735
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,985
Okay.

736
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,440
- Tell me you caught them.
- I tagged the blond one.

737
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,927
Oh, Loretta.

738
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:24,102
What are you thinking?

739
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:27,312
You might've killed one of them,
but his partner's still with her.

740
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:31,074
And he is clearly skilled,
highly trained

741
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,732
and very dangerous.

742
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:47,608
So, Miss Sage said
she was gonna leave the event,

743
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:52,371
then got in a car
and left the event?

744
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,167
- Did you try calling her?
- She doesn't have her phone.

745
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:56,686
Stolen phone.
Didn't say that.

746
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,550
Where's my magnifier?

747
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:00,656
Listen, can you please
help with Nana?

748
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:03,220
I don't want her hearing about
Loretta 'cause it's going to upset her.

749
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:06,316
- What about Loretta?
- Nothing, Nana. She just went on a trip.

750
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,697
- Good.
- Yeah.

751
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,251
That girl needed
to get out of the house.

752
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:14,532
So, this is the thing. Loretta's
phone is not stolen. I took it.

753
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:19,088
I gave it to Alan. Alan then gave
it to the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

754
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:21,469
And that is how we found
her wearable.

755
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,264
- And who's Alan?
- Dash.

756
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:26,198
- What's that?
- He's the hero in all of her books.

757
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:29,339
- Nana. Hey, slut.
- Mm-mmm.

758
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:32,377
Let's go in the other room and talk
about whichever war you lived through.

759
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,622
Okay. Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

760
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:37,658
Listen, Loretta Sage is missing.

761
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:40,050
When I looked at her smart watch,
it said that she had flown

762
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:41,754
to some island
I've never even heard about.

763
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:43,640
That means y'all need
to do something about this.

764
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:46,046
And if you can't, I will,
and that won't look good for you.

765
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,876
Pretty sure that's
outside our jurisdiction.

766
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,017
- You'd have to call the Feds.
- Okay.

767
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:54,502
And if you do go to the Feds,
put in a good word for me.

768
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,988
For me.
For us.

769
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,133
Oh, oh.

770
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,418
What are you gonna do,
put the car back together?

771
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,731
Well... we could...

772
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,335
Where did you say the phone was?
Passenger glove.

773
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,199
What?
Passenger glove compartment.

774
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:37,545
Goodness.

775
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,169
Oh, my God.

776
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:42,516
Oh, my God. No phone, no car.
We're so gonna die out...

777
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,345
Here.
What is this?

778
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:46,106
Boots for the jungle.

779
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:48,798
It's not exactly
hiking boots, but...

780
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:51,639
I figured your feet would be killing
you after wearing heels for this long.

781
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:54,010
It was the best we could do.
They're Allison's. Sorry.

782
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,875
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

783
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,774
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

784
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:00,672
Oh, my God.
You got to stay hydrated.

785
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,743
Thank you so much.
They didn't have glass bottles,

786
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:04,849
so we'll definitely
hold onto it and recycle.

787
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:12,132
Okay, so what we need to do is find a
phone, we need to call the authorities,

788
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:15,135
and we need to wait here until
somebody comes and rescues us.

789
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:18,759
Uh... This...
This is the rescue.

790
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,140
No one else is coming.

791
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,211
I'm sorry?
I'm the rescue.

792
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:25,248
It was originally just gonna be me,
then I was like, Trainer should come.

793
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:27,078
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

794
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:31,427
So, our best bet is to get to the
airport. See this road right here?

795
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,223
From this area, just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road.

796
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:36,225
Did you just say "shortcut
through the jungle"?

797
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:37,847
Yeah.
Okay, do you see us?

798
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:40,470
Uh-huh. You are not Dash,
and I'm not Love more. Okay?

799
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:41,989
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

800
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,405
And jungles eat people
like us, okay? Eat people.

801
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:47,823
And I don't want to mess up the jumpsuit.
It's on loan. So we're gonna stay put.

802
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:49,859
We're not just gonna
stand around here, okay?

803
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:51,343
We're gonna go
through the jungle,

804
00:44:51,447 --> 00:44:53,552
we're gonna go to the airport
and find a phone,

805
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:56,659
- so you can have your cake and get what you want.
- "And eat it too"?

806
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:59,213
If that's what you want to do
with your cake, fine. Let's go.

807
00:44:59,317 --> 00:45:01,329
- That's the only thing you do with cake.
- Not mine.

808
00:45:01,353 --> 00:45:03,804
I don't know what your
people do, but my people eat it.

809
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:06,117
You could give it
to someone as a gift.

810
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,429
Those people
are still going to eat the cake.

811
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,086
Everybody eats cake.

812
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,019
What about the kind
people jump out of?

813
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:15,057
They don't eat it, when they're in it.
Oh, my God.

814
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,947
What did they
kidnap you for anyhow?

815
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,914
Is it some weird sex stuff
like Taken?

816
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:46,571
Oh, my God, thank you.

817
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:49,401
I thought so too, but the guy's
one of the Fairfaxes.

818
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,334
Beverly?
No, the older one.

819
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:54,890
The really odd one that had the
vlog on finding Montezuma's treasure.

820
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,433
The dude that was on the news
for trying to raise the Titanic?

821
00:45:57,513 --> 00:45:59,308
Yes, he's looking for
the Crown of Fire.

822
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:03,381
Wait a minute. Like the actual
Crown of Fire? Like the one...

823
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:06,833
So those ruins were... They were
the Lost City of D, yes.

824
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:09,249
What? Are you kidding
me right now? Shh.

825
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:10,802
This is like your book.

826
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:13,736
So we're basically on a Love
more and Dash adventure right now?

827
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,842
What is that?

828
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:18,430
What if Fairfax
actually finds the crown?

829
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:19,915
He won't. He won't.

830
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:23,194
Where do we go?
Uh...

831
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,265
Oh, oh, oh.

832
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:30,477
Okay, uh, we need
to get in the water.

833
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,686
W-What?
We need to go by river.

834
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,619
No, no, I don't really do water.

835
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:37,149
What do you mean, "do water"?
I'm not asking you to procreate with it.

836
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:39,624
Uh, my body and water
don't really go together.

837
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,075
How do you feel about dying?
Oh, God.

838
00:46:42,178 --> 00:46:44,058
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're okay. You're okay.

839
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:46,976
I got you. Fine. I can swim. I
can swim. Thank you very much.

840
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,151
Where are you going?
I'm crossing.

841
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:51,222
No, we have to stay
in the water.

842
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,856
I researched aquatic counter-tracking
for my book, A Year in the Bush.

843
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,882
They'll lose our tracks
in the water.

844
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:58,781
Why is it warm here?
Wait, are you peeing?

845
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:00,887
Just go around it.

846
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,193
Okay, I think...

847
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:33,195
I think we lost them, right?

848
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:36,301
Yeah. That wasn't so bad.
Yeah.

849
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:38,062
Okay, uh...

850
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:40,581
Don't panic.
What do you mean, don't panic?

851
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:41,893
- Just don't panic.
- No.

852
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:43,757
Stop saying "panic."
I'm panicking now.

853
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,724
You have something on your back.

854
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:48,037
No!

855
00:47:48,141 --> 00:47:49,625
Stop screaming.
What is that?

856
00:47:49,728 --> 00:47:50,971
What is that?
Stop screaming.

857
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:52,524
Do you have any on you?
No. No.

858
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:54,078
Why don't you have any on you?

859
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:56,056
Maybe the jumpsuit
scared them off. I don't know.

860
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,598
Get 'em off.
Oh, my God.

861
00:47:57,702 --> 00:48:00,222
Okay. No, I can't touch
those blood-gorged mucous sacks.

862
00:48:00,325 --> 00:48:01,775
Can you fling it?
Right now.

863
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,259
Get it.
Just pick it and fling it.

864
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:05,341
Just pick it and fling it.
You pick it and fling it!

865
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:07,436
Can you spin it off?
Please, get it off.

866
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:09,576
I don't like touching it.
I'm feeling faint.

867
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,786
They're sucking my soul out.
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

868
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,686
Don't make that sound.

869
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:21,760
How many of them are there?

870
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:23,383
Oh, there's not many.

871
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:25,488
It feels like there's so many.
What are you...

872
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:26,904
I feel so many.
Oh!

873
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:29,561
Holy mother of God!
Why are you praying?

874
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:32,702
Is it that bad? It can't be that
bad. Is it that bad? How many?

875
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,049
It's not great.

876
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:35,809
They're gonna suck
every bit of me out.

877
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,570
Just please stop speaking. I
just need to... need to get low.

878
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:40,400
Hold on a second.

879
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:43,299
Oh, God! I can feel them just...
they're just sucking out so much.

880
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:46,268
I'm gonna be like a shriveled-up
skin sack when they're done.

881
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:48,339
You cannot tell my dad
I died this way, okay?

882
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:52,481
You gotta tell him I was wrestling an
anaconda with a sword or something.

883
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:55,380
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice.
They're just sucking it all out.

884
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:57,106
Why are they all
on my butt though?

885
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,833
Kind of like picking anchovies
off my Caesar salad.

886
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,662
- It's actually not so bad.
- Anchovies?

887
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,354
Why do you go to food right now?

888
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:06,322
Just find the queen,
and let's be done with this.

889
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:08,773
Think you're good.
I need to just check your front.

890
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:11,120
Okay. I can't look.

891
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:14,675
Is it bad?

892
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:17,885
Uh, wow.
What is it? Just say it.

893
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:21,337
I mean, you expect it to,
you know, not...

894
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:24,168
Then suddenly there it is,
and it is, uh...

895
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:26,515
You know, you get
excited for a person. What?

896
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:29,242
I mean, I'm excited for all people.
Why are you excited?

897
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:31,658
Well, you know, people
wonder, they wonder,

898
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,384
but they don't know, right?

899
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:35,973
They don't,
until suddenly they do know,

900
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:40,391
and then they... they know
something that wasn't known before.

901
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:42,358
Just...
Do I have any leeches or not?

902
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:46,569
Oh, your plucky warrior hangs
in tranquil solitude.

903
00:49:46,673 --> 00:49:47,777
What?

904
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,021
No, you're good.
You're good.

905
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,886
We were so brave just then.

906
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,233
Why do they go for the butt
so much?

907
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,395
What's that song you're singing?

908
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:22,502
A song my abbi used to sing to me
when I was a kid.

909
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:26,126
"If you suck life
from the island... Yeah?

910
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,026
The island
will suck of you."

911
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:33,064
Your grandma sang you songs about
getting sucked off by an island?

912
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,515
It doesn't translate super well.

913
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:39,243
Is phantom leech syndrome,
like, a thing?

914
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:41,348
They don't lay eggs, do they?

915
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:31,674
Queen Taha?

916
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:49,658
"King Kalaman
and his treasure laid to rest..."

917
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,249
laid to rest
in the well of endless tears.

918
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:56,285
"Laid to rest in
the well of endless tears."

919
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:58,253
- What does that mean?
- Loretta!

920
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:00,669
You gave me a heart attack.

921
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,016
Where'd you go?

922
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:08,642
What is this?

923
00:52:08,746 --> 00:52:11,990
I'm not sure,
but maybe they gathered here?

924
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:17,203
Can you imagine
being right here,

925
00:52:17,306 --> 00:52:19,964
right in this very spot
back then?

926
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,793
The stories that they told?

927
00:52:21,897 --> 00:52:24,658
So much history I'm sure
happened right here.

928
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:31,355
They've got us cornered.

929
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,150
Okay. We've got to
go up. Come on. What?

930
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:36,360
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

931
00:52:36,463 --> 00:52:39,432
There's nowhere to go but up.
Come on. Let's go.

932
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:43,090
Oh! I should not be doing this.
I'm too old for this.

933
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,378
No, you're not.
You're beautiful.

934
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:46,059
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

935
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,061
I said I'm too old
to be doing this.

936
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,789
My skill is sitting and thinking
and eating when I can't think.

937
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:54,309
Yeah, you definitely could be
wearing better shoes for this.

938
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:56,311
You brought me these shoes.

939
00:52:56,414 --> 00:52:58,968
I can't go any further.
I can't go any further.

940
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:00,798
I'm not doing so great here.

941
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:02,317
You got it. Come on.

942
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,284
I know you think
that you're safer holding on,

943
00:53:04,388 --> 00:53:05,665
but you have to keep going.

944
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,667
I can't. I can't, I can't.
Okay?

945
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:09,910
Do you smell that?
Smell what?

946
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:11,854
I smell something. Is it
a predator? What is it?

947
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:13,878
A downward cascading fire?
You got to smell deeper.

948
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:15,088
I don't smell anything!

949
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:21,750
Take a big, deep breath.

950
00:53:21,853 --> 00:53:23,165
All right.

951
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:24,891
Good job.Okay.

952
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:28,619
That was manipulative.
Thank you. Yeah, it was.

953
00:53:28,722 --> 00:53:31,208
Here we go. I'm gonna help you
out a little bit, all right?

954
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,431
- One, two, three... Here we go!
- What are you doing?

955
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:34,866
Get out of there. Come on.

956
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,041
No, no, don't flex.
That's my hoo-hoo.

957
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:40,078
Just ride the head. Keep the
hands moving and ride the head.

958
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:41,494
Oh, God.
You're doing great.

959
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,255
Sorry about the scratchy haircut.
Come on.

960
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:06,588
Dulcius ex as per is.

961
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:08,555
What was that?

962
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,177
Oh, nothing.

963
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:12,525
It was just something
that John and I would say

964
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,769
after we finished
something big, like a...

965
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:17,840
like an archaeological dig
or a manuscript.

966
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:21,258
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

967
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:23,777
What's...

968
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,814
What's Latin
for "Loretta's a bad ass"?

969
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:30,405
I am a bad ass.
I climbed a mountain.

970
00:54:30,508 --> 00:54:33,477
Oh, my God. I wish Beth
could've seen us do this.

971
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,411
Oh, God. Beth.
Don't worry about Beth.

972
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:40,000
She's probably got the
whole navy after us right now.

973
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:43,176
I get that you think you have to
go to the island authorities yourself,

974
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,697
but don't worry, I'm keeping
Loretta's socials super active.

975
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,182
Just tweeted,
"Did I just get kidnapped?

976
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,806
#FML, @ShawnMendes,
#ShawnMendes."

977
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,567
And you're traveling alone?

978
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,501
Yes, I'm traveling alone.
Mm-hmm. I'm single.

979
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,296
Then this might work.

980
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,228
Okay! Talk to me.
You'll hit New York.

981
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:04,853
From there, you'll fly to Guinea,
where you can pick up a puddle jumper.

982
00:55:04,956 --> 00:55:06,026
A what?

983
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,443
- Small plane.
- Yeah, no leg room.

984
00:55:08,546 --> 00:55:09,720
That's fine. I'll take it.

985
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,860
Or you could just come home.
Thank you.

986
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,215
We need something more flammable.
Everything is just so wet.

987
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,837
What's in here?
What's in your bag?

988
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:25,805
Uh... Oh, a lot. Okay.

989
00:55:25,908 --> 00:55:27,358
What are you doing?

990
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:29,326
Okay. Face masks.

991
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,924
Yeah, that was like
a gift-basket thing.

992
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:32,915
You brought a scented candle
into the jungle?

993
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:34,296
My mom gave me that.

994
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,032
It was like a weird gift
for Mother's Day.

995
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:38,335
Your mom gives you gifts
for Mother's Day?

996
00:55:39,646 --> 00:55:40,440
Noir...

997
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:42,511
Eucalyptus rosemary oil.
Ooh.

998
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:44,375
Oh, that smells good.

999
00:55:44,479 --> 00:55:46,653
Um... Oh, okay. All right.

1000
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:48,379
Whoo! Yes!

1001
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:50,933
Yes, I made fire!

1002
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:54,592
- That's pretty impressive. You have to...
- It is a beautiful fire.

1003
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:56,629
Who would have thought?

1004
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:59,217
Oh, you're just, um,
taking your shirt off?

1005
00:56:00,322 --> 00:56:02,359
That looks really uncomfortable.

1006
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:04,361
Are you okay? The back?

1007
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:08,537
Yeah. That is why
I don't do water.

1008
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,919
Okay. My body becomes
an eighth-grader's face.

1009
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:13,887
Do you have anything for it?
Like some ointment or something?

1010
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:15,889
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

1011
00:56:15,993 --> 00:56:18,064
It was in a little,
tiny little bottle.

1012
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,135
It was this. I'm sorry.

1013
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:22,275
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1014
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,725
It's okay.

1015
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:26,141
- Hold on. Yes. Come here. Come here.
- What?

1016
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:28,661
- Come here. Sit down.
- Let me see.

1017
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:30,248
Just sit down.
Right here?

1018
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:31,560
Yeah.

1019
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:34,391
Okay.

1020
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,438
Oh, no, you don't have to
touch it. It's okay. It's fine.

1021
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:38,464
I touched
your engorged sacks, so...

1022
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:42,399
The leeches.
Oh, okay.

1023
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:45,298
Okay, this might be
a little bit cold.

1024
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:48,197
Sorry.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1025
00:56:48,301 --> 00:56:49,578
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1026
00:56:49,682 --> 00:56:51,649
Maybe this is how
Dash should die.

1027
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:54,790
Horrible eczema outbreak.
That's so sexy.

1028
00:56:54,894 --> 00:56:56,413
I could make it work.

1029
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:57,897
Yeah?

1030
00:56:58,553 --> 00:57:00,002
All right, then.

1031
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:03,005
How would you write this?

1032
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:04,593
Okay.

1033
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:09,805
"Warmed
by the fragrant fire..."

1034
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:12,359
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,361
Starting strong.
Mm-hmm.

1036
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:17,572
"Lovemore's hands
explored the..."

1037
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:21,817
The contoured scenery

1038
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,509
of Dash's body.

1039
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:28,341
Familiar terrain made

1040
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,792
new and exciting with every...

1041
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:34,071
"with every scarlet rim."

1042
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,867
And that didn't, uh...

1043
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:39,214
didn't turn her off?

1044
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:40,526
No.

1045
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:43,183
"Because with every
cardinal ridge,

1046
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:46,601
Love more discovered
another letter in the language

1047
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,810
"that only their bodies spoke."

1048
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,882
And what were
their bodies saying?

1049
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,402
"Take me..."

1050
00:57:57,301 --> 00:57:58,923
Take me,

1051
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,201
"take me."

1052
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:02,617
How's that?

1053
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:04,722
It was good.

1054
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:06,552
Your back. I mean,
how is your back? Good.

1055
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:08,070
Okay. You sure?
Yeah.

1056
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:12,730
I also meant my back.
Right there, yeah. Okay.

1057
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,015
Supplies.

1058
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:28,435
Okay, I'm chilly. I think I'm
gonna probably turn in in a little bit.

1059
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:29,747
Okay.
You good?

1060
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:32,509
Yeah, I'm fire... fine.
I'm fine.

1061
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:35,546
I'm not "fire."
I'm fine by the fire.

1062
00:58:36,236 --> 00:58:37,962
Okay. All right.

1063
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:49,180
Uh, it's up to you,
but if you're cold,

1064
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:53,495
maybe we could probably
both fit in here, if you wanted to.

1065
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:55,877
Both of us?

1066
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,018
Only if you want to. I mean,
it's just... Yeah, no, that sounds...

1067
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:00,606
Uh...

1068
00:59:00,709 --> 00:59:02,090
Okay. How do you...

1069
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,161
You can go first,
then I'll figure it out.

1070
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:07,405
No, no, you go. It's definitely
a "ladies first" type of situation.

1071
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:10,167
Keep hands out of the bag at all times.
That's what I was gonna do.

1072
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,927
Butt to butt.
Hands out and butt to butt.

1073
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:15,344
Yeah. What do I do?
Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

1074
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:18,140
I sit first?
Okay. I'm in.

1075
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:22,294
You're too heavy. You're gonna
flip this thing like a cruise ship.

1076
00:59:22,386 --> 00:59:25,044
You watch yourself.
Hold on. I'm not in.

1077
00:59:25,147 --> 00:59:28,323
Why is this engaging
my core so much?

1078
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:31,015
How 'bout you shimmy?

1079
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,224
I can't breathe. I'm not
breathing. Are you good?

1080
00:59:33,328 --> 00:59:34,640
My face.

1081
00:59:35,226 --> 00:59:36,469
Yeah. Okay.

1082
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,060
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

1083
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:42,199
Okay.

1084
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,990
Well!

1085
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:16,233
Come on.

1086
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:17,993
Come on! Let's hear it!

1087
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:21,583
Let's give a nice round of applause
to Loretta!

1088
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:23,309
She earned it.

1089
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:27,278
A geriatric shut-in left you
holding your dicks in the jungle.

1090
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:28,763
Good job, Loretta.

1091
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:31,386
Boss, come on.
People are dying now.

1092
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:35,148
Don't you think that maybe
this has all gone too far?

1093
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:38,117
Is it really worth it?

1094
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,603
I am on the cusp
of attaining the unattainable.

1095
01:00:41,707 --> 01:00:44,710
Something singular,
something no nation,

1096
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:48,403
no emperor, no brown no sing
brothers ever have.

1097
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:51,613
The legendary Crown of Fire.

1098
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:53,201
So, yes.

1099
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:55,617
Yes, I would definitely say
it's worth it.

1100
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:06,870
Excuse me!

1101
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:09,873
Excuse me, sir. I need to get
to my next connecting flight.

1102
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:11,322
No flight.

1103
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:14,015
The pilot is sick.
Come tomorrow.

1104
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:16,338
No, no, sir. I cannot come
tomorrow. I need to do this today.

1105
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:21,091
I need to get to the island Isla
Hundida tonight. Lives are at stake.

1106
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:22,679
Come tomorrow.

1107
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,201
Excuse me, miss?
Yes?

1108
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:32,378
I couldn't help but overhear
you say that you like steak.

1109
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:35,761
Okay, this is
a little bit crazy,

1110
01:01:35,864 --> 01:01:37,659
but I also like steak.

1111
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:40,110
What?
I also like steak.

1112
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:43,665
Would you like to, maybe,
I don't know...

1113
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:46,599
- Maybe there's a...
- No. "Lives are at stake."

1114
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,463
I need to go
to the island tonight.

1115
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:49,982
Ah.
Yes.

1116
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:51,673
Even more serious.
Extremely.

1117
01:01:51,777 --> 01:01:54,780
Well, I believe that I may be able
to assist you.

1118
01:01:54,883 --> 01:01:56,816
I have a cargo plane.

1119
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,683
Maybe after I make my delivery,
we could swing by your island.

1120
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:04,582
I'm about to ask you something,
and you better tell me the truth.

1121
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,550
Have you ever
murdered anyone before?

1122
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:09,898
No!

1123
01:02:13,488 --> 01:02:16,215
I don't know if I really buy it,
but let me tell you something.

1124
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:20,564
If you ever think about murdering
me, I promise, I will murder you first.

1125
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,014
My pleasure.

1126
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:24,257
You are weird. Let's go.

1127
01:03:19,657 --> 01:03:23,075
"King Kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well

1128
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,146
of endless tears."

1129
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,011
What is that?

1130
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:32,636
Oh, it's a... it's a thing.
I mean, it's not, uh...

1131
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,983
You know, it's not
what you think it is.

1132
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:38,884
So it's not Fairfax's fragment
of an ancient parchment?

1133
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:42,784
Okay.
It's what you think it is.

1134
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:44,417
Loretta, I thought
you were smarter than that.

1135
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:47,237
Fairfax is never
gonna stop hunting us now.

1136
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,341
What were you thinking?

1137
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:50,412
We have a volcano
that could bury the tomb

1138
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:54,071
before we get to it, before we see
it, before we preserve its memory.

1139
01:03:54,175 --> 01:03:56,108
This is... I'm sorry.
Is that what we're doing?

1140
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,731
'Cause no one told me.
When were you gonna tell me?

1141
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,250
Why would I tell you?

1142
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:02,262
We're in this together.
I came here to rescue you.

1143
01:04:02,286 --> 01:04:03,978
You know you're not Dash, right?

1144
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,325
You don't ride in on a
white horse to rescue people.

1145
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:10,708
You... spray yourself with bronzer
and you stand in front of wind machines,

1146
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:12,331
which is great for you.

1147
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:15,092
How would you have any idea
what I'm actually like?

1148
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:18,130
I know you. You're
a pretty open book, Alan.

1149
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,028
- Okay, then who am I?
- Really?

1150
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:21,167
Yeah.

1151
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,447
O... Okay, uh...

1152
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:28,657
You were a homecoming king and
you coasted on your good looks to LA,

1153
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:31,360
but then realized that being the most
handsome kid in the middle of nowhere

1154
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:33,110
doesn't mean
you're going to be a star.

1155
01:04:33,214 --> 01:04:35,123
Until one day, when a woman
who couldn't publish her book

1156
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:38,736
on Spanish colonization in the Atlantic
decided to write a romance novel,

1157
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,773
uh, chose you at random
to be on the cover.

1158
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,294
Lucky for you and her,
the novels were a smashing success.

1159
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:47,400
She kept writing her schlock,
you kept posing,

1160
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:52,958
um, you know, neither one of us
becoming who we'd hoped we would be.

1161
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:57,169
Uh, and then one day,
we both die in the jungle

1162
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:01,173
on one of those Atlantic islands
I wrote about all those years ago.

1163
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:02,312
Right?

1164
01:05:03,658 --> 01:05:04,970
Mm-hmm.

1165
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:17,983
It was Sarasota, by the way.

1166
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,088
It's not nowhere.

1167
01:05:20,192 --> 01:05:22,435
I grew up there with
my mom and two sisters.

1168
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:23,574
And yeah...

1169
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:27,268
I started modeling
'cause I wanted to get away.

1170
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:29,304
It was the only job
that I could think of

1171
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:32,652
that could take me to all of the places
that I always dreamed of going.

1172
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:34,068
Then finally to Los Angeles,

1173
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:36,933
where I posed on the cover
of your romance novel.

1174
01:05:37,036 --> 01:05:39,936
And I was so embarrassed that
one of my friends might've seen me

1175
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:42,179
in that wig
on the cover of your book

1176
01:05:42,283 --> 01:05:44,941
that I avoided talking to them
for months.

1177
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:47,391
And then one day,

1178
01:05:48,116 --> 01:05:49,980
I'm walking home,

1179
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:52,879
and I hear this lady yell,
"Dash!"

1180
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:55,503
She runs up, and she is so happy.

1181
01:05:55,606 --> 01:05:59,369
Then I thought,
"How could I be this embarrassed

1182
01:05:59,472 --> 01:06:02,165
about something
that makes people this happy?"

1183
01:06:05,513 --> 01:06:07,204
Loretta, you can do
whatever you want.

1184
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:09,413
If you don't want to
write anymore, don't write.

1185
01:06:09,517 --> 01:06:14,004
But don't minimize the people that
love your work by calling it schlock.

1186
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:16,662
That's not fair to them.

1187
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:20,769
You know what's ironic? I thought
you of all people would know

1188
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:23,324
not to judge a book
by its cover.

1189
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:29,986
Judge a book by its cover model.

1190
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:02,639
Alan?

1191
01:07:02,742 --> 01:07:04,020
Alan.

1192
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:17,343
There's two of them.

1193
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:26,145
Loretta! I'm over here!
Alan!

1194
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:30,287
Alan! Motorcycles and guns,
motorcycles and guns!

1195
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:32,531
Come on, this way!

1196
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:34,257
Stop shooting!

1197
01:07:39,503 --> 01:07:41,471
Just give 'em the parchment!
I can't.

1198
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:44,232
Yes, you can, actually. You just
say, "Here," and throw it at 'em.

1199
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:46,648
Right. And then I'm sure
they'll happily let us go.

1200
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:48,754
Okay, keep down.
How do they keep finding us?

1201
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:51,422
You're basically a walking disco ball.
We need to come up with a plan.

1202
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:52,516
I have an idea.

1203
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,149
We're gonna dig a hole,
throw our voices.

1204
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,106
"We're over here."
Can you sound like a bird?

1205
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,522
No, I have a plan.
Alan, please, I'm thinking.

1206
01:07:58,626 --> 01:08:02,319
I know, but I have a plan.
Please, just let me think about...

1207
01:08:02,423 --> 01:08:06,047
Wait a minute. They're shooting at
you. Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

1208
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:08,463
No. No, no, no.
They're shooting only at you.

1209
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:11,087
They won't shoot me.
It's my brain that's valuable.

1210
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,056
What? I don't think you actually
hear the things you say sometimes.

1211
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,852
Maybe I can shield you.
You are not shielding me.

1212
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:20,199
I should be shielding you.
Why? Because I'm a woman?

1213
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:23,423
That's supremely sexist. Well, look, I
don't think using women as human shields

1214
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,205
is exactly the change that
Gloria Seinfeld had in mind, do you?

1215
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:29,139
Gloria Steinem? Whatever.
Her too. You know what? Fine.

1216
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:32,315
Please mansplain sexism to me
right now. Oh, my God. I am a woman.

1217
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:34,524
I can't mansplain anything.

1218
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:39,356
Uh, I'm a feminist, and I think a
woman can do anything a man can do.

1219
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,940
We just need to stay here until
they get tired. I have an idea.

1220
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:43,705
Please can I tell you my plan?
Alan!

1221
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:47,123
This is not a situation you can get
out of by ripping your shirt off.

1222
01:08:47,226 --> 01:08:49,159
Not my shirt.

1223
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,916
Three!

1224
01:09:22,019 --> 01:09:23,607
- Yes!
- Oh!

1225
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:29,579
Oh.

1226
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:32,927
That was different
than I had in my head.

1227
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:37,103
I just wanted us to stop them. Could it
have been the wind that made it do that?

1228
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:39,313
No, I think it was us.
I think... we did it.

1229
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:41,832
We did the one guy, right?
But that was, like...

1230
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:45,284
We just wanted him to stop. But I
think the other guy could've moved, really.

1231
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:47,528
So, that was...
that one was on him.

1232
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:50,496
Even if we weren't here,
that could've happened.

1233
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,326
Why are you gonna stop
next to a cliff?

1234
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,880
They were wearing helmets,
so maybe they're...

1235
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:57,158
But the rest of their body
didn't have a helmet.

1236
01:09:57,262 --> 01:09:58,470
So there'd just be a head.

1237
01:09:58,573 --> 01:10:00,851
They were driving
recklessly, right?

1238
01:10:00,955 --> 01:10:02,681
Don't be mean on a bike.

1239
01:10:03,371 --> 01:10:05,131
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

1240
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:11,172
I mean, perhaps they're fine.

1241
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:13,692
Yeah, probably not.
But that's okay.

1242
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:18,075
That's all right. You know,
things happen. Let's go.

1243
01:10:20,285 --> 01:10:23,460
- You gonna put it back together?
- It's on loan.

1244
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,579
Look at me.
Okay.

1245
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:41,513
What more can I do, you know?

1246
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:43,549
You've done so much already,
Beth.

1247
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:46,690
My poor, sweet, little Nana
has lost her sight.

1248
01:10:46,794 --> 01:10:49,521
The book release
is a complete disaster,

1249
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:51,281
which I've leveraged
everything on,

1250
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:53,732
so I'm probably, most definitely
broke right now.

1251
01:10:53,835 --> 01:10:57,080
And most importantly,
I've lost a writer.

1252
01:10:57,183 --> 01:10:58,737
Who does that?
Who loses a writer?

1253
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,362
Okay, Beth, you remind me
of my best friend, Randy.

1254
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:05,951
Always looking out
for other people,

1255
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,402
never taking care of herself.

1256
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:10,818
Isn't that right, Randy?

1257
01:11:13,338 --> 01:11:15,201
She's like my therapist,
this one over here.

1258
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,411
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

1259
01:11:17,514 --> 01:11:19,482
After you take care
of your friend,

1260
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:21,725
how about we go to a beach?

1261
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:24,314
What?
Look, I have a pickup in Hawaii.

1262
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:26,385
She doesn't have to come.

1263
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:29,285
Okay! Okay, you can come!

1264
01:11:29,388 --> 01:11:31,390
She's hilarious.

1265
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:34,013
Let me ask you something.

1266
01:11:34,117 --> 01:11:36,302
We're all sitting here chitchatting,
but who's flying the plane?

1267
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,259
Autopilot.
What?

1268
01:11:38,363 --> 01:11:41,089
Sir, go to the cockpit,
fly the plane.

1269
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:42,539
Okay.

1270
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,059
I'm going to go land the plane.

1271
01:11:45,162 --> 01:11:46,612
Okay.

1272
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:48,636
No, no, no. Take the goat.
Please, take the goat.

1273
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:51,376
She's on break.
Enjoy the flight!

1274
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,136
Hi.
Hola.

1275
01:12:32,589 --> 01:12:35,281
This English dude came in
and basically kidnapped her.

1276
01:12:37,422 --> 01:12:40,735
Hey, it's Beth. Please leave a
message, and I'll get right back to you.

1277
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:43,704
Uh, hi, Beth.

1278
01:12:43,807 --> 01:12:44,808
It's me.

1279
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:46,741
Uh, I'm alive!

1280
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:49,503
Uh, listen, um...

1281
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:51,850
Uh...

1282
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:57,407
I'm sorry that I
blew up the book tour.

1283
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,236
Um...

1284
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,722
I was just afraid

1285
01:13:02,861 --> 01:13:04,518
and selfish. Uh...

1286
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:07,348
Oh, here comes Alan.
I'll call you back.

1287
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:13,527
So, uh, police
are searching for Fairfax,

1288
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,081
and they're gonna provide us
protection while we're here.

1289
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:18,014
Did they say
how long we'd be here?

1290
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:20,775
They're gonna try to get us on a
puddle jumper later this evening.

1291
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,167
But, uh, they said in the
meantime, the inn is really nice,

1292
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:25,780
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes.

1293
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:27,299
Okay.

1294
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,304
Okay. Yeah.

1295
01:14:25,081 --> 01:14:26,531
Thank you.

1296
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:30,362
Come on.

1297
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,708
Dance with your husband.

1298
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:33,607
No, no, no.
He's not my husband.

1299
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,436
- It's okay.
- Dance with him.

1300
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:38,025
No, no. She doesn't want to.
She doesn't have the right shoes.

1301
01:14:38,128 --> 01:14:40,648
Actually, it's the only thing
these shoes are right for.

1302
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:42,995
You don't have to do this.

1303
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:44,859
It's okay. It's okay.

1304
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:46,757
Yeah?

1305
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,045
I wonder what she's saying.

1306
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:10,911
It's folklore.

1307
01:16:12,326 --> 01:16:14,362
Love song about a woman

1308
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:17,780
whose lover died, and she
didn't want to leave his side.

1309
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,646
So she laid down
and refused to get up.

1310
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:23,993
Must be scary.

1311
01:16:24,096 --> 01:16:27,997
Having to face your future without
the person that you planned it with.

1312
01:16:40,354 --> 01:16:41,907
What was that?

1313
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:47,706
Excuse me. Excuse me. The,
um... the last line that you sang.

1314
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,157
¿Quién llorará junto a mí?

1315
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,921
"The island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears."

1316
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:59,407
What is that, the well of endless
tears? Is that a real place, or...

1317
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:01,133
Sinkhole place.

1318
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:04,654
Thank you. Gracias, gracias.

1319
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:06,829
Come here, come here.
What is it?

1320
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:10,280
Hey, on the parchment, it said,

1321
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:14,457
"King Kalaman and his treasure
laid to rest in the well of endless tears."

1322
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,666
I thought
maybe it was a metaphor.

1323
01:17:17,184 --> 01:17:18,737
It's not.

1324
01:17:18,841 --> 01:17:21,706
The Well of Endless Tears
is a place.

1325
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:23,811
It's a sinkhole.

1326
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:26,089
There's a sinkhole on the map.

1327
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,196
I think the tomb is there.

1328
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:31,681
This is so much better
than your books. What?

1329
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,348
There's like...
No, I don't mean any offense.

1330
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:35,271
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
It's, like, equal.

1331
01:17:35,374 --> 01:17:37,663
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Look
at you. You want to go there.

1332
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,551
What? No.
I can see. Yes, you do.

1333
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,761
That would be insane. That
would be insane. I just... I just...

1334
01:17:42,865 --> 01:17:47,248
It's just that we're so close to it,
but, you know, we can't...

1335
01:17:47,352 --> 01:17:48,664
No.

1336
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:51,459
This is your story.
How do you want to write it?

1337
01:17:52,253 --> 01:17:54,566
I'd like to know
that it's there,

1338
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,326
that all this meant something.

1339
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,294
Okay. Then let's go.

1340
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,317
We'll stay one more day.
As soon as the sun's up,

1341
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:02,165
we're gonna go find
the Well of Endless Tears.

1342
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:05,094
But what if it's nothing?
So what? Then we say we tried.

1343
01:18:05,197 --> 01:18:06,440
And Fairfax?

1344
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:08,960
The cops are after Fairfax.
Don't worry about him.

1345
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:10,858
This is crazy.

1346
01:18:10,962 --> 01:18:12,653
Yeah, but look at you.
What?

1347
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:15,725
It's the very first time I've ever
seen you totally unafraid.

1348
01:18:16,346 --> 01:18:18,072
And alive.

1349
01:18:18,176 --> 01:18:20,736
I'm gonna go tell them our plans
have changed and find us a ride.

1350
01:18:20,799 --> 01:18:22,249
Where are you going?

1351
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:27,979
I see you met my friend here.

1352
01:18:28,082 --> 01:18:32,466
He told me you were just
about to jump on a plane,

1353
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:35,020
without so much as
saying goodbye.

1354
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:38,541
I said, "No way.
Not my Loretta.

1355
01:18:38,644 --> 01:18:43,097
Not when she's the only one
who can lead me to the tomb."

1356
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,585
Stop squeezing so hard.

1357
01:18:49,414 --> 01:18:52,210
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

1358
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:54,937
Ow! Let go!

1359
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,628
I-I need a car.

1360
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,664
A car, an auto.
Does anybody have an auto?

1361
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:08,226
No, no. No.

1362
01:19:08,951 --> 01:19:10,262
I-I-I need an auto.

1363
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:11,712
I'll trade you my watch.

1364
01:19:11,816 --> 01:19:13,310
It's a really expensive watch.
Do you have a car?

1365
01:19:13,334 --> 01:19:14,933
It's a Bulgari.
This thing glows in the dark.

1366
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:16,752
It's waterproof.
I have motorcycle.

1367
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:32,112
Cool, isn't it?

1368
01:19:32,215 --> 01:19:35,322
I always thought, why can't your
personal tank also have a minibar?

1369
01:19:35,425 --> 01:19:36,910
Have a drink.

1370
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:38,566
Do you mind?

1371
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:40,085
Uh, yes.

1372
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,329
He has a bit of a grudge
against you, I'm afraid.

1373
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:45,228
Something about a motorbike
accident his friends had?

1374
01:19:45,332 --> 01:19:46,505
Why are you doing this?

1375
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:48,369
I want something
nobody else has.

1376
01:19:49,267 --> 01:19:51,096
When my father gifted...

1377
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:55,687
As I was saying,

1378
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,724
when my father gifted his empire

1379
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:01,279
to my baby brother...

1380
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,839
Who is that?

1381
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:20,781
Is that a Ken doll on a moped?

1382
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:23,094
I know him from somewhere.

1383
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:24,854
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

1384
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:27,167
Because what you are looking at

1385
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,170
is a highly trained
combat specialist,

1386
01:20:30,273 --> 01:20:33,863
forged in the furnaces
of Afghanistan, Iraq,

1387
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:36,555
Kuwait, Sa... Sarasota...

1388
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,730
Incredible skin.
No eczema problems.

1389
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,527
And he will not stop
until I am safe!

1390
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,840
So you pull
this space tank over,

1391
01:20:44,943 --> 01:20:48,084
unless you would like to perish
like his friends did.

1392
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:51,605
And he is responsible
for their perishment.

1393
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,401
He might not have meant to,

1394
01:20:54,504 --> 01:20:57,783
but they... perished, so...

1395
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:13,972
Okay, who-who is this?

1396
01:21:14,076 --> 01:21:15,974
I have seen him
somewhere before.

1397
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:19,702
No, no, no.

1398
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:21,531
That's your cover model,
isn't it?

1399
01:21:21,635 --> 01:21:23,913
Yes. I knew
I knew him from somewhere.

1400
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,881
Get up there.

1401
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:27,365
And kill him creatively.

1402
01:21:27,468 --> 01:21:29,574
I love watching hunks fail.

1403
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,165
I guess I-I will
have that drink.

1404
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:37,133
Oh, shit.

1405
01:21:37,237 --> 01:21:39,791
Is it okay
if I just top 'er off?

1406
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,068
Yeah, that's fine, but...

1407
01:21:41,172 --> 01:21:43,139
Oh, my God,
have you used a glass before?

1408
01:21:43,243 --> 01:21:44,589
Sorry.

1409
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:46,177
What would Jack Trainer do?

1410
01:21:48,386 --> 01:21:49,456
It's hot in here.

1411
01:21:49,559 --> 01:21:52,562
Anyone else feeling
how hot it is?

1412
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:53,736
Are you trying to be sexy?

1413
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:55,634
This is very weird.
Please, stop.

1414
01:21:55,738 --> 01:21:57,636
I could set your world on fire.

1415
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:10,546
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

1416
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:12,375
Go to sleep! Sleep!

1417
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:16,621
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1418
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,002
Time-out.

1419
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,105
Time-in!

1420
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:27,701
No! Don't shoot her!
I need her!

1421
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:31,222
Oh, Jesus!

1422
01:22:31,325 --> 01:22:32,740
Ow, ow, ow.

1423
01:22:36,675 --> 01:22:39,092
Move your foot! Move your foot!

1424
01:22:42,164 --> 01:22:44,373
Go to sleep, asshole.

1425
01:22:44,476 --> 01:22:46,133
Get out there! Look!

1426
01:22:50,724 --> 01:22:52,036
A bigger guy?

1427
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,347
Oh, no.

1428
01:22:54,693 --> 01:22:55,936
What?

1429
01:22:58,421 --> 01:22:59,421
Move it!

1430
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:03,392
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1431
01:23:04,289 --> 01:23:06,188
Hey! Get in.

1432
01:23:06,705 --> 01:23:07,810
Him or me?

1433
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:16,715
This is not one of your cheap, vapid
lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

1434
01:23:16,819 --> 01:23:18,786
This is real life.

1435
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:21,582
And we will kill him.

1436
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:23,412
Tell us where the tomb is.

1437
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:39,393
Hi.
So, whoever's in charge,

1438
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:42,120
I need you to send
officials to go here.

1439
01:23:42,224 --> 01:23:43,328
Here.

1440
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:46,297
We are closed.

1441
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,746
You're closed?

1442
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,786
You know I've been trying to take
a nap for a year and a half?

1443
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:54,443
A year and a half.

1444
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:58,481
I have been burning the candle
at both ends,

1445
01:23:58,585 --> 01:23:59,931
the midnight oil,

1446
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,003
since way before
my friend got kidnapped.

1447
01:24:03,107 --> 01:24:04,970
And all I want to do

1448
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:07,663
is kick my feet back

1449
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:09,009
and drink some wine

1450
01:24:09,113 --> 01:24:11,494
that I'm probably
too tired to drink.

1451
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:13,531
And I want a massage.

1452
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:18,294
I want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet,

1453
01:24:18,398 --> 01:24:20,434
and I want it at the same time.

1454
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:24,231
And I don't care if logistically
that doesn't make sense.

1455
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:26,992
Because I have worked hard.

1456
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,306
The same way that
I know that you have.

1457
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:33,413
So I hate to ask you

1458
01:24:33,516 --> 01:24:35,898
to leave this place open
a few more minutes,

1459
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:37,934
because if we don't,

1460
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:41,593
a very close friend of mine
and her cover model

1461
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:43,457
are going to die.

1462
01:25:06,308 --> 01:25:07,861
No good way in, boss!

1463
01:25:07,964 --> 01:25:10,105
What about the caves?

1464
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:12,210
That's too dangerous!

1465
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:15,317
Well,
we'll be very careful then.

1466
01:25:28,882 --> 01:25:30,194
Well, come on!

1467
01:25:34,888 --> 01:25:36,717
- This way.
- I have a rule about

1468
01:25:36,821 --> 01:25:38,340
not going into
super creepy caves.

1469
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,630
- Julian?
- His name is Julian?

1470
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:55,598
He seems more like
a Buck or a Bruce.

1471
01:25:55,702 --> 01:25:57,186
Lead the way.

1472
01:26:00,879 --> 01:26:03,261
Go on. Don't be scared.

1473
01:26:33,015 --> 01:26:34,810
Watch your step there.

1474
01:26:34,913 --> 01:26:36,087
Bruce!

1475
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,192
Julian. Oh, no!
Julian!

1476
01:26:37,295 --> 01:26:38,917
Whoa.

1477
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:40,540
Whoa.

1478
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,680
Well...

1479
01:26:43,508 --> 01:26:45,234
Let's not have
his death be in vain.

1480
01:26:45,338 --> 01:26:48,099
- Onward and upward.
- What do you mean onward?

1481
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,653
We're not gonna go
and get him now, are we?

1482
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:52,172
Oh, man.

1483
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:06,221
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

1484
01:27:06,324 --> 01:27:09,016
Yeah. Look, let's just
go back to the boat.

1485
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,984
This is over.
Nobody else has to die.

1486
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:13,262
No, no, no. Ha-ha!
It's a breeze.

1487
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:15,816
There's a tunnel.
This could lead to the tomb.

1488
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,800
That's not person-sized.
Ah, speak for yourself.

1489
01:27:17,887 --> 01:27:20,165
Come on.
It's practically a kiddie slide.

1490
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:22,582
More like a rock sphincter.
Or a troll anus.

1491
01:27:22,685 --> 01:27:25,067
All right, well, you are
going through the anus...

1492
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:26,482
the hole... the tunnel!

1493
01:27:26,586 --> 01:27:28,588
Why her?
You are our canary in the coal mine.

1494
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:30,106
No, that's impossible.
I can't.

1495
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,690
Please let us know
if you get through.

1496
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:34,076
If we don't hear from you,
Fabio's got to die.

1497
01:27:34,179 --> 01:27:36,354
Wait,
I'm the damsel in distress?

1498
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,287
It's okay. I'm fine.

1499
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,774
I can't.
I'm so sorry. I can't.

1500
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:18,603
- Hey.
- What?

1501
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,296
Hey, you smell that?

1502
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:24,333
You mean centuries worth of bat
feces? Yes, I definitely smell that.

1503
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:26,646
You gotta take
a big breath for me.

1504
01:28:31,754 --> 01:28:33,135
There you go.

1505
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:35,102
You can do it, Loretta.

1506
01:28:48,046 --> 01:28:50,808
I think I see a way out.

1507
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:56,572
Oh, cheese and rice!

1508
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:02,613
I made it!

1509
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:04,200
I made it!

1510
01:29:04,304 --> 01:29:06,789
See? Totally safe.

1511
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:08,860
Go on. Your turn.

1512
01:29:10,552 --> 01:29:13,451
I'm coming through!
Be right there, okay?

1513
01:30:17,619 --> 01:30:19,759
Why would they build this here?

1514
01:30:20,863 --> 01:30:22,589
But how is anyone
supposed to worship

1515
01:30:22,693 --> 01:30:24,384
or remember you
if they can't even see it?

1516
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:26,351
They aren't.

1517
01:30:26,455 --> 01:30:29,424
This isn't a monument
to Kalaman's power.

1518
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,117
It's a hiding place
for a grieving woman.

1519
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,672
Taha came here
to be with her fallen lover.

1520
01:30:38,329 --> 01:30:39,779
She just wanted to be alone.

1521
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,954
Taha doesn't want us here.

1522
01:30:43,058 --> 01:30:44,404
God, shut up, Rafi.

1523
01:30:44,508 --> 01:30:46,371
It's just the volcano.

1524
01:30:48,028 --> 01:30:49,340
Come on.

1525
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:56,140
We have to keep going.

1526
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,977
All right.
Let's go, Muscles.

1527
01:31:06,771 --> 01:31:08,601
Open it up.

1528
01:31:08,704 --> 01:31:11,155
- Don't disturb them.
- She will be wearing the headdress.

1529
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:13,847
Come on. We didn't come all
this way just to pay our respects.

1530
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:15,608
I can't, um...

1531
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:20,578
Uh... I'm sorry, abuela.

1532
01:31:41,806 --> 01:31:43,118
What is that?

1533
01:31:45,258 --> 01:31:47,674
Are those... seashells?

1534
01:31:48,433 --> 01:31:51,298
The crown is made of seashells?

1535
01:31:51,402 --> 01:31:52,955
Where's the treasure?

1536
01:31:53,956 --> 01:31:55,406
She's holding him.

1537
01:31:58,202 --> 01:31:59,962
You mean the dead guy?

1538
01:32:06,486 --> 01:32:07,694
Look.

1539
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:11,422
It's their courtship.

1540
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,426
Kalaman is searching the island
for something.

1541
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:19,844
Rare red seashells.

1542
01:32:19,948 --> 01:32:24,953
To prove his love, he gave her
one shell every day for a year

1543
01:32:25,056 --> 01:32:26,610
and made them into a crown,

1544
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,509
bright red like
the flame of their love,

1545
01:32:29,613 --> 01:32:32,995
until the day came
where she accepted his proposal.

1546
01:32:33,099 --> 01:32:34,859
It was never about jewels.

1547
01:32:34,963 --> 01:32:38,691
Kalaman and Taha's riches
weren't material.

1548
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:42,557
It was their love.

1549
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:45,007
That's what it meant.
That was enough.

1550
01:32:45,111 --> 01:32:46,319
So that's it?

1551
01:32:47,216 --> 01:32:50,116
All of that time and money

1552
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:54,534
spent on, what,
just a cheap metaphor?

1553
01:32:54,638 --> 01:32:57,433
It's a pretty rich metaphor.
Oh, shut up!

1554
01:32:57,537 --> 01:32:59,574
We got to go. We got to go now.

1555
01:32:59,677 --> 01:33:02,853
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, no, no. You are staying here.

1556
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:05,027
You think it's all
so sweet and poetic.

1557
01:33:05,131 --> 01:33:07,616
Well, then you can stay here
and spend your last moments

1558
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,654
pondering the richness
of that metaphor.

1559
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:13,622
- Get in.
- What? Come on, man.

1560
01:33:13,726 --> 01:33:16,176
- Oh, God. Just get in. Get in the tomb.
- Okay, okay.

1561
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,903
It's better to be buried alive
than buried dead, I guess.

1562
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:22,286
- It's really not.
- You know, it is a shame, really.

1563
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:23,908
This is a hell of a story.

1564
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:26,704
Pity you won't be around
to tell it. Come on.

1565
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:28,395
- But they'll die.
- So will you

1566
01:33:28,499 --> 01:33:31,088
if you don't stop being such a snowflake!
Get over here!

1567
01:33:40,684 --> 01:33:42,686
This is fine.
This is not an active nightmare

1568
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,446
I've had since
I was 14 years old.

1569
01:33:46,206 --> 01:33:47,691
Ow!

1570
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:51,522
Why are you going so fast?
It's not a race.

1571
01:33:56,527 --> 01:33:58,840
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Come back here!

1572
01:33:58,943 --> 01:34:03,638
You may have bought the island,
but now the island owns you!

1573
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,985
You can't just leave me here!

1574
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:10,403
Rafi! Come back!

1575
01:34:12,577 --> 01:34:13,993
I need a boat!

1576
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:25,521
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

1577
01:34:27,523 --> 01:34:29,387
Help! Help!

1578
01:34:29,491 --> 01:34:31,596
One of the locals
just stole my boat!

1579
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,460
Have you seen a woman?

1580
01:34:33,564 --> 01:34:36,671
She's a brunette
in a sequined jumpsuit.

1581
01:34:36,774 --> 01:34:40,778
No. Is she in some sort
of trouble?

1582
01:34:52,445 --> 01:34:54,171
It's kind of funny.

1583
01:34:55,586 --> 01:34:57,381
I used to think this...

1584
01:34:57,484 --> 01:34:59,383
this sort of thing
was so romantic.

1585
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:00,867
Yeah?

1586
01:35:00,971 --> 01:35:04,319
Being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava,

1587
01:35:04,422 --> 01:35:07,011
or... cuddling dead people?

1588
01:35:07,805 --> 01:35:10,877
Just laying down
with a lost love.

1589
01:35:10,981 --> 01:35:12,189
Like Taha did.

1590
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:15,951
God.
Oh...

1591
01:35:16,538 --> 01:35:17,919
Oh, God.

1592
01:35:18,022 --> 01:35:20,231
I'm sorry.

1593
01:35:20,335 --> 01:35:22,786
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you.

1594
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:24,857
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

1595
01:35:25,443 --> 01:35:26,721
You're right.

1596
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:29,309
You're nothing like Dash.

1597
01:35:29,413 --> 01:35:32,450
You didn't ride in on a
white horse to save me.

1598
01:35:32,554 --> 01:35:37,939
You rode in on a...
borrowed scooter with a broken muffler.

1599
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:40,735
Yeah.

1600
01:35:40,838 --> 01:35:43,738
I never could've written
a Dash like you.

1601
01:35:45,636 --> 01:35:47,569
'Cause I never knew

1602
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:50,054
a Dash like Alan.

1603
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:52,608
I was so afraid
of being hurt by life again

1604
01:35:52,712 --> 01:35:54,093
that I just stopped living.

1605
01:35:54,196 --> 01:35:56,198
Couldn't see the good things
in front of me.

1606
01:35:56,302 --> 01:35:59,788
I'm just so sorry
I didn't see you sooner.

1607
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,480
I have a confession too.

1608
01:36:02,584 --> 01:36:06,484
See, I was really liking where this
new story of ours was headed.

1609
01:36:06,588 --> 01:36:09,798
I just wanted to see how
it was gonna turn out, I guess.

1610
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:13,664
The Adventures
of Loretta and Alan.

1611
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,702
No, it would need
a better title than that.

1612
01:36:17,806 --> 01:36:19,774
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

1613
01:36:20,913 --> 01:36:24,709
Sorry. Just...
Taha's femur is poking me.

1614
01:36:28,403 --> 01:36:30,163
Rafi must have left that.

1615
01:36:30,267 --> 01:36:32,787
How do you forget your crowbar?
It's gonna help us escape.

1616
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:34,512
No, he left it on purpose.

1617
01:36:34,616 --> 01:36:36,307
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

1618
01:36:36,411 --> 01:36:37,826
One... Okay.

1619
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:39,759
Two, three!
Okay.

1620
01:36:39,863 --> 01:36:43,798
I would've preferred him to not leave us
here in the first place, but...

1621
01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:45,488
Okay.

1622
01:37:06,372 --> 01:37:08,581
Dulcius ex as per is.

1623
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:14,829
Sweeter after difficulty.

1624
01:37:21,456 --> 01:37:22,906
Go up!
Run for the trees!

1625
01:37:24,114 --> 01:37:27,013
Wait. Nope. Never mind.
Trees are on fire.

1626
01:37:27,462 --> 01:37:29,153
Okay.

1627
01:37:30,741 --> 01:37:32,605
We can go back
through the tunnel.

1628
01:37:33,571 --> 01:37:34,849
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

1629
01:37:39,957 --> 01:37:41,925
Um, okay.
I'm open to other ideas.

1630
01:37:42,028 --> 01:37:45,583
There's a current.
We can follow it into the ocean.

1631
01:37:45,687 --> 01:37:47,309
How do we know
what's on the other side?

1632
01:37:47,827 --> 01:37:48,897
We don't.

1633
01:37:50,726 --> 01:37:52,867
There's only one way
to find out.

1634
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,077
Worth the rash.
Yeah?

1635
01:38:17,063 --> 01:38:18,064
Alan?

1636
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:27,763
Alan!

1637
01:39:05,215 --> 01:39:06,216
Alan?

1638
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:09,012
A... Alan?

1639
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,221
Alan!

1640
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,226
Oh, my God! You're alive!

1641
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:18,573
I'm alive. Oh, my God.
I thought I killed you.

1642
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,541
Is that Beth?

1643
01:39:22,611 --> 01:39:23,854
Loretta!

1644
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:25,649
Beth!

1645
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,409
- Beth!
- Beth!

1646
01:39:27,513 --> 01:39:28,755
Beth!

1647
01:39:34,416 --> 01:39:35,797
Beth, you're here!

1648
01:39:36,453 --> 01:39:37,661
Why are you here?

1649
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:40,560
I told you I got your back,
girl!

1650
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:42,942
I'm so sorry!

1651
01:39:43,046 --> 01:39:45,151
I destroyed the jumpsuit!

1652
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,601
What?

1653
01:39:46,704 --> 01:39:49,224
Never mind! Later.

1654
01:39:49,328 --> 01:39:51,330
I found a British guy in a cave.

1655
01:39:51,433 --> 01:39:53,918
I thought he was a little boy,
but he has a full beard.

1656
01:39:54,022 --> 01:39:57,301
Beth, that's Fairfax!
He kidnapped us!

1657
01:39:57,405 --> 01:40:00,166
He's a bad guy, Beth!
He killed my trainer!

1658
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,271
Get him!

1659
01:40:01,788 --> 01:40:02,962
Stop him!

1660
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,007
I got your back, girl.

1661
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:17,114
Where were you running?
It's a boat.

1662
01:40:17,218 --> 01:40:18,736
This guy's hilarious.

1663
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,566
Got you.

1664
01:40:20,669 --> 01:40:21,946
Swim over to the rock!

1665
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,121
I don't got you. No,
I got you. I got you.

1666
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:26,123
We're gonna get you.
It's gonna be okay.

1667
01:40:26,227 --> 01:40:28,815
"Finding refuge
on a nearby rock,

1668
01:40:28,919 --> 01:40:31,025
he lifted her from the water,

1669
01:40:31,128 --> 01:40:34,304
his powerful arms
pulling her body close.

1670
01:40:34,407 --> 01:40:35,546
Alan whispered..."

1671
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:38,204
Shh. You're safe now.

1672
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:45,280
"In that moment, Loretta could feel
a new adventure was just beginning."

1673
01:40:46,557 --> 01:40:49,215
"The heart-pounding passion
of the narrow escape

1674
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:52,253
only inflamed Loretta's
desire for him.

1675
01:40:52,356 --> 01:40:56,567
She was thirsty for the hot lava
soon to be pulsing from his..."

1676
01:40:56,671 --> 01:41:00,261
Don't you go stopping
right at the good part.

1677
01:41:01,607 --> 01:41:03,436
It's nothing she hasn't
read before.

1678
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,920
Didn't I tell you?

1679
01:41:05,024 --> 01:41:08,027
The most beautiful beach
in the world.

1680
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:11,444
Maybe later, I'll show you
the Cove of Enchantment?

1681
01:41:11,548 --> 01:41:13,136
No, you can take Randy.

1682
01:41:13,239 --> 01:41:16,898
Remember, you are
my platonic man friend.

1683
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:20,039
Platonic?
I like the sound of that.

1684
01:41:20,143 --> 01:41:22,800
Not sure what it means,
but I like the sound of it.

1685
01:41:22,904 --> 01:41:25,113
Here you go, Randy.

1686
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:29,186
My dear. You are
an angel. Thank you.

1687
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,257
How did you know?

1688
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:45,961
Nice way to end a book tour, right?
Mm-hmm.

1689
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:48,343
Um...

1690
01:41:48,447 --> 01:41:52,692
You know, I have a phrase I like to use
in moments like these, actually.

1691
01:41:52,796 --> 01:41:54,038
Um...

1692
01:41:55,523 --> 01:41:56,938
Quid deinde?

1693
01:41:58,077 --> 01:42:01,253
It's Latin.
It means, uh, "What's next?"

1694
01:42:03,151 --> 01:42:04,670
Quid cogitas?

1695
01:42:04,773 --> 01:42:06,154
Mmm.

1696
01:42:06,879 --> 01:42:08,052
Buca di Beppo.

1697
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,127
Yeah. I know zero other Latin.
No. Yes.

1698
01:42:13,230 --> 01:42:16,164
I looked it up
for this moment right now.

1699
01:42:16,992 --> 01:42:19,133
So, what does come next?

1700
01:42:19,236 --> 01:42:21,721
How would you write this?
I don't know.

1701
01:42:21,825 --> 01:42:24,379
How would you write it?
Do we really want me to write this?

1702
01:42:24,483 --> 01:42:26,830
Just try. Take a stab at it.
Okay. I'll write it.

1703
01:42:26,933 --> 01:42:28,280
Okay.

1704
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:31,386
"We were... They were, uh...
standing on a beach."

1705
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:33,502
Sets the stage for the audience.
They know where we are.

1706
01:42:33,526 --> 01:42:35,401
You're already laughing.
Why are you laughing at me?

1707
01:42:35,425 --> 01:42:37,220
I'm not laughing.
I'm smiling. You are.

1708
01:42:37,323 --> 01:42:41,327
"There are palm trees
above a brown

1709
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:44,813
bark-like hair of the maiden.

1710
01:42:44,917 --> 01:42:46,781
"There is a dead jellyfish..."

1711
01:42:46,884 --> 01:42:49,415
All you're doing is describing what
you're actually seeing right now.

1712
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:52,269
"He's nervous
because he really likes her."

1713
01:42:53,132 --> 01:42:55,169
It's nice writing.

1714
01:42:55,272 --> 01:42:56,584
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1715
01:42:56,687 --> 01:42:57,792
I'll keep going.

1716
01:42:57,895 --> 01:42:59,483
"He looked deep in her eyes."

1717
01:42:59,587 --> 01:43:03,038
The only thing that could compare
to the pulse of that ocean

1718
01:43:03,832 --> 01:43:04,982
"was the throbbing in the..."

1719
01:43:05,006 --> 01:43:08,112
Okay, no, you can't throb.
Why not?

1720
01:43:08,216 --> 01:43:09,942
Can't come out of the gate
with a throb.

1721
01:43:10,045 --> 01:43:12,438
You throb all the time.
I don't come out of the gate with it.

1722
01:43:12,462 --> 01:43:14,440
You have to earn the throb.
Who made you the queen of throb?

1723
01:43:14,464 --> 01:43:18,157
It's usually a chapter four thing. You
want it brought up appropriately in four.

1724
01:43:18,261 --> 01:43:20,366
I think you throb in all the chapters.
"Pulsating."

1725
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,403
It's a precursor to throb.

1726
01:43:22,506 --> 01:43:24,612
"Undulating."
You just jumped to five.

1727
01:43:24,715 --> 01:43:27,580
How 'bout they just kiss?
Why not? Just like a regular kiss?

1728
01:43:27,684 --> 01:43:29,548
Yeah. Like a
beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

1729
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:31,239
I'm good at starting...

1730
01:43:35,105 --> 01:43:36,589
How was that? Any notes?

1731
01:43:37,349 --> 01:43:40,731

1767
01:45:13,652 --> 01:45:14,652
Mother...

1768
01:45:14,722 --> 01:45:16,448
You were dead.

1769
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:19,416
Your brains came out of your face
and hit the back of my throat.

1770
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,074
- He was in my mouth.
- Don't say he was in your mouth.

1771
01:45:22,177 --> 01:45:23,857
- I could taste you.
- Don't ever say that.

1772
01:45:23,903 --> 01:45:29,081
We only use 10% of our brain,
so I just switched to another 10%.

1773
01:45:29,184 --> 01:45:32,015
So, you're okay?

1774
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:33,810
One hundred percent.

1775
01:45:33,913 --> 01:45:35,398
Meaning 10%.

1776
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:37,261
We thought you were dead.

1777
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:40,092
Naturally, I have some anger issues
I need to let go of.

1778
01:45:40,195 --> 01:45:42,543
Of course.
And resentment.

1779
01:45:44,441 --> 01:45:45,787
So good to see you, man.

1780
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:47,962
Okay,
let's keep the chatter down.

1781
01:45:48,065 --> 01:45:52,449
We're closing our eyes
and reconnecting to our breath.

1782
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:54,624
Great.

1783
01:45:55,452 --> 01:45:56,453
Great.
