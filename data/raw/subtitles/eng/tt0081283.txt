We've made love 113 times.

21
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,965
I figured it out
on my Bowmar calculator.

22
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,417
To know someone
that well is wonderful.

Two lumps?

00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:52,256
[Woman]
No, one.

25
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,133
I don't know your favorite actors.

26
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,046
I can't remember the name
of your favorite perfume.

27
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,693
That's funny.
It's "My Sin."

[Man] In the last 24 years,
I've always loved you.

Well. Did we like it?

30
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:20,030
Ben Walsh was wonderful.

31
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:21,488
It was funny.

32
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:24,365
It was a comedy. Wasn't it?

33
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:28,047
Clyde Banner's getting fat.

34
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:29,965
He should never turn profile.

35
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,267
Most of us shouldn't turn profile.

36
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,720
What were you thinking about?

37
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,326

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,408
Yeah.
How was the show?

43
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,057
- Trouble sleeping?
- No.

44
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:39,208
You're sure?

45
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,743
Mm-hmm.

00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,771
Okay.

49
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,878
Have you thought about
calling that doctor?

50
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,144
No.

00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,563

52
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,596
What about the plan?

53
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:54,898
That was if I needed him.

54
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,852
Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about it.

55
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,463
Get some sleep.

56
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,225
I'll get those Michigan State tickets.

57
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:03,261
Okay.

[Wife]
Did you call the Warrens?

59
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,776
They said they'll make it
some evening soon.

00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,425
Look at these people.
Everybody I grew up with...

61

is in the paper these days.

"Joey Georgella. New
football coach for Trinity."

63
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,788
What about those
Michigan State tickets?

64
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:53,860
Jane's checking with John.

65
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,737
Where's Conrad?
This will get cold.

68
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,875
They won't be back by Saturday.

69
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:04,333
That's okay. Connie!

Good morning.

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,301
Did you sleep?

76
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,720
Yeah.

77
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,830
Hungry?

78
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:37,055
Uh... hungry?

79
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,781
It's French toast.

80
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,776
It's your favorite.

81
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,694
Yeah.

82
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:44,689
I'm not really hungry.

83
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:47,528
Breakfast. Pal. Remember?
Main meal. Energy.

84
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:49,292
So you're not hungry.

85
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,210
Hang on. He'll eat.

86
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,129
Con. It's French toast.

87
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,313
There's fresh fruit later.

88

What are you doing?

89
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,302
You can't save French toast.

90
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,220
I've got to run.

91
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,790
Will you call Mr. Herman
about the shutters?

92
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,629
You have to charm him.

93
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:09,739
Did you charm him?

94
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,762
You have to eat. Con.

95
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,718
You must get stronger.

96
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,598
Dad. I'm not hungry.

97
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,171
Are you okay?

98
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,667
Yeah.

99

I got to go.

100
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:29,610
Lazenby's picking me up.

101
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:30,915
Oh. Is he? Great.

102
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:34,559
Why is it great?

103
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:38,242
Well. I don't see
the old gang much anymore.

104
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,700
I miss them.

105
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:41,694
Bring them around...

106
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,075
Phil. Don. And Dick.

107
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,070
We'll play some touch football.

108
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:46,528
See you later.

Come on. We're late. Let's go!

113
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,014
Jarrett. Come on!

114
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:45,029
We're late 'cause Dickie's mom
was packing his lunch.

115
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:49,326
I studied all night
for this Poly Sci exam.

116
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:53,162
That guy wants a damn
personal analysis of it all.

117
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,080
How can you understand that?

118
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,499
You read it.

119
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,418
Yeah. Right!

120
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:01,141
We swim.
When can we study?

121
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,750
I swim. And I study.

122
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,169
What you reading?

123
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,704
Hardy.

124
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,507
You should try meditation.

125
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,964
That's just like thinking.

126
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:13,609
Have you got
all junior classes this year?

127
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,946
Didn't they pass you on anything?

128
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:20,284
They don't pass you
on breathing...

129
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,550
without taking the final.

130
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,506
Hey. Quit with that radio.

131
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,460
I'm trying to study.

132
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:27,649
Hope it's a long train.

133
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,877
I'm going to flunk.

00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,663

something. Jarrett?

Hey. Cleary!

145
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:16,368
Hey. Cleary!

146
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,739
[Woman]
Let's discuss theory.

147
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:24,578
Conrad, what's your
theory on Jude Fawley?

148
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:26,150
Conrad?

149
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,529
What's your theory
on Jude Fawley?

150
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:33,171
Was he powerless in
the grip of circumstances...

151
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,738
or could he have
helped himself?

152
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:39,424
I don't... Powerless?

153
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,342
He thought he was.

154
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,336
He was a jerk.

155
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,137
He was hung up on morals.

156
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:47,786
It was senseless.

157
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:50,126
That's too easy. Joel.

158
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,354
Paul?

159
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:55,152
I found the book hard to follow.

160
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:57,914
Come on!

00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,315
Hello.

Hello.

165
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,612
Yes?

166
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,028
Hi. This is Conrad Jarrett.

Conrad Jarrett.

169
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:20,240
Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro Hospital
gave me your number.

170
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,619
I'm with a patient now.

171
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:25,496
Can you call back at 2:15?

172
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:28,373
I don't think I'll be free.

173
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,253
Give me your number.

174
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,171
I'll call you tonight.

175
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,590
Hello?

176
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,048
Hello?

177
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,772
I'll call you back. Thanks.

178
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,378
Go!

179
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,521
Come on.
Move it. You guys!

180
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,515
Keep it going!

181

Keep plugging!

182
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,316
Use those legs!

183
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,658
Lazenby, get with it!

184
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,615
Jarrett, head down!

185
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:54,612
Work it!

186
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:57,106
Come on. Now!
Push off!

187
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,564
Get your head down. Jarrett!

188
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,750
Come on!
Keep it going!

Dig in there!
Come on!

190
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,855
Push off. Jarrett!

191
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,159
Push off!

192
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:20,928
Is he actually inclined to lose?

193
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,386
Well. Regionally.

194
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:23,806
It's too bad.

195
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,263
I mean...

196
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,683
it's tragic. Really.

197
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,023
Look at him now.

198
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,480
He's lost everything.

199
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,900
Fish too dry?

200
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,818
It's not too dry.

201
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,112
C&S has a new mechanic.

202
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,030
What happened to Harry?

203
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,907
I think he moved to Skokie.

204
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:46,784
This new mechanic is so awkward.

205
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,242
Is that shirt ripped?

206
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,966
Leave it on the table
in the hallway.

207
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,843
Wasn't that girl
in the hospital from Skokie?

208
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,300
What was her name?

209
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,720
Karen.

[Beth]
Will you play round robin at the club?

211
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:03,740
I haven't played in a year.

212
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:06,771
Well. Isn't it time to start?

213
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,399
We're going to Clark Murray's
birthday party Saturday.

214
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,775
I bought him
that book on wine.

215
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,540
Not the Murrays.

216
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:25,644
Cut the rope. Now. Bucky!

217
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,560
We're going in!

218
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,741
Give me your hand!

219
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,046
Bucky!

220
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:35,005
Bucky.

221
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:36,462
Bucky.

222
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:14,479
Hi. How are you?

223
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:15,898
Oh. I'm fine.

224
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,161
Couldn't be better.
Terrific. Yeah.

225
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,266
Come in.
They all do that.

227
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,212
Come in.

228
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,631
Sit down.

229
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,771
I just have to...

230
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,689
wire some...

231
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,608

[Music Blares]

233
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,390
Sorry. Sit down.

234
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,993
You have trouble finding the place?

235
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,259
Not yet.

[Telephone Rings]

237
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,400
Uh. Jarrett.

238
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:18,082
How long since you've been
out of the hospital?

239
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,036
A month and a half.

240
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,494
Feeling depressed?

241
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:23,952
No.

242
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,371
On stage?

243
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,829
Pardon me?

244
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,248
People nervous...

245
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:31,931
treating you like
you're a dangerous character?

246
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,348
Yeah. I guess a little.

247
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,419
Are you?

248
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,838
I don't know.

249
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,398
How long were you
in the hospital?

250
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,355
Four months.

251
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,043
What did you do?

252
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:50,997
I tried to off myself.

Is everybody glad
to see you home?

You're back in school.

No problems?

Uh-uh.

265
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:19,883
So why are you here?

Uh...

00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:31,353
I'd like to be more in control.

268
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,811
Why?

269
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,148
So people can quit
worrying about me.

270
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:38,066
Who's worried about you?

271
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:39,524
My father. Mostly.

272
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,442
This is his idea.

273
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,900
And your mother?

00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,818
Isn't she worried. Too?

275
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,237
I don't know.

00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:49,114
Look. I'll be straight with you.

As long as you're straight.

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,743
Yes. He called me.

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,119
He told me to look for you.

282

He said you had
a brother who died.

00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,142
Boating accident. Wasn't it?

Want to tell me about it?

285
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:25,980
You talked this over
with Crawford. Right?

286
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,284
Right.

287
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,895
How did that go?

288
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:30,852
It didn't change anything.

289
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,731
What needed changing?

I'd like to be more in control.

291
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,332
Why?

292
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,094
So people can quit
worrying about me.

293
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,202
Well. I'll tell you something.

294
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,117
I'll be straight with you. Okay?

295
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,802
I'm not big on control.

296
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,523
But it's your money.

297
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,403
So to speak.

So to speak.

00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,927
Okay.

300
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:07,756
How's Tuesdays...

301
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:09,674
and Fridays. Same time?

302

Twice a week?

303
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,699
Well. Control's a tough nut.

00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,423
I've got swim practice every night.

305
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:20,722
Well. That's a problem.

How do we solve that?

307
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,627
Guess I'll skip practice
twice a week.

308
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:29,085
Well. It's up to you.

309
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,501
I don't like being here.

310
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,918
I don't like it at all.

311
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,026
Mm-hmm.

312
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,432
I saw Mort Swain.
His sister died.

313
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,695
The one from Idaho?

314
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:48,189
The one with the restaurant.

315
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,184
She died in Idaho?

316
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,641
I guess so.

317
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:53,943
Why?

318
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,050
You said she was always traveling.

319
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:58,508
I don't know.

320
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,273
Maybe in Idaho.

321
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,536
Maybe Kansas City.

322
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:11,091
I went to see Dr. Berger.

323
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,009

324
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,697
Yeah.

325
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,346
You didn't say anything. Good!

326
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,957
I went today.

327
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:20,834
I didn't know
you made an appointment.

328
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,100
How was it?

329
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:23,788
It's a lot of money.

330
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,706
It's okay.

331
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:28,814
It's $50 an hour.
Twice a week.

332
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,729
It's okay.
It is necessary.

333
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:34,414
What did you talk about?

334
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:35,642
Not much.

335
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,100
What about your schedule?

336
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:40,667
Well. It'll cut
into swim practice.

337
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:42,739
Where's his office?

338
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,197

Head straight!

340
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:53,250
I don't want to tell you again.

341
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,393
This is what I see.

342
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,615
I see you yawning
and you coming late.

343
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,301
I don't see you having fun.

344
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,063
Are you getting enough sleep?

345
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,444
Yeah.

346
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,359
Are you having fun?

347
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,664
Fun?

348
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:15,116
There's no point
if you're not having fun.

349
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,034
Yeah. I guess so.

350
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:18,415
You guess so.

351
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:22,788
Are you on medication?

352
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,208
Tranquilizers?

353
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,474
Anything?

354
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,967
No. No. Sir.

355
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:30,537
Did I ask you
if they gave you shock?

356
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:32,034
Yeah.

357
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah what?

358
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:35,371
Yeah. You asked me.

359
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:36,829
Yeah. They did.

360
00:21:39,015 --> 00:21:40,818
Don't look at us. Lazenby.

I'm no doctor. Jarrett.

363
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:54,283
I wouldn't let them
put electricity in my head.

He drives me nuts!

365
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,805
Everybody drives you nuts.

366
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,871
Don and Fenetch looked good.

367
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,712
They looked very good.

368
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,590
Is he giving you a hard time?

369
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,508
Want a clarinet?

370

371
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,884
Who's selling it?

372
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,802
My brother.
He needs a motorcycle.

373
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,218
You stand behind me
in the choir.

374
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,789
Oh. I do?
Is that you?

375
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:24,129
You have a lot of energy.

376
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:25,164
I do?

377
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,891
I mean. That's good.

378
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:28,847
My name's Jeannine Pratt.

379
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:30,267
Nice. Hi.

380
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:31,724
You're Conrad Jarrett.

381
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:32,875
Right.

382
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,519
Yeah. Um. Bye.

383
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:37,939
Bye-bye.

384
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,775
"You've got a lot of energy."

385
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:46,570
[Children]
Trick or treat!

386
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:49,946
You're the scariest
ghost I've ever seen!

387
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:51,404
You look wonderful.

388
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:53,322
Thank you.

389
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,281
There you go.

390
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,700
Be careful.

391
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,618
Thank you.
Good-bye.

392
00:22:58,654 --> 00:23:00,994
The Cabots.
Julie's first time.

393
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,912
She's so cute!

394
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,132
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

395
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:10,278
Know what I've been thinking?

396
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,196
That Christmas in London...

397
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:15,572
would be like something
out of Dickens.

398
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,950
We've never done that before.

399
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:22,285
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

400
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:24,203
We talked about it.

401
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:26,121
We decided on that.

402
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,039
Yeah. I know that.

403
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,916
But the timing
doesn't seem right.

404
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,793
We've always gone away
at Christmas.

405
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,402
It'd be good for him. Too.

406
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:38,819
Let's get back to normal.

407
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:41,466
He's just started
with this doctor.

408
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,384
He'll miss three weeks.

409
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,841
Why interrupt it?

410
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,719
Because I want to get away.

411
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:50,596
I think we should.
It's important.

412
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:54,931
Not if he doesn't
go through with this now.

413
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,309
He might change his mind.

414
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,726
If he changes his mind...

415
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,874
it wasn't right for him.

416
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:04,137
Does he want to go?

417
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,014
He doesn't know what he wants.

418
00:26:09,004 --> 00:26:10,692
Ahh!

419
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,380
Don't do that!

420
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:13,838
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,715
I didn't think you were here.

422
00:26:16,753 --> 00:26:18,633
I just got in.

423
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,551
No golf today.
Too cold.

424
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:21,971
How was golf?

425
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,428
I didn't play.

426
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:24,848
It's colder today.

427
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:28,224
I mean. For the year.
It's colder.

428
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:30,755
Weren't you swimming?

429
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:33,134
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.

430
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:34,592
How'd it go?

431
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,510
Good. I swam well.

432
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:37,469
Good.

433
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:40,844
I could swim the 50 if my...

434
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,763
my timing got better.

435
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,681
I'm a little off.

436
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,059
You must work at that.

437
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,018
Yeah.

438
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:51,969
I got 74 on a Trig quiz.

439
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,427
74?

440
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:56,304
Gee. I was awful at Trig.

441
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,762
Oh. Yeah? Did you...

442
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,910
You took Trig?

443
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,670
Wait a minute.

444
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,467
Did I take Trig?

445
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,526
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

446
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:19,897
Who'll be there?

447
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:23,848
Well. The Murrays.
The Gunthers. And the Caines.

448
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:26,572
Let's go to the movies instead.

449
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:29,218
Don't be negative.

450
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:31,520
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

451
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:33,822
Let's go to the movies.

452
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,241
Okay.

453
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,776
Really?

454
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:39,499
Okay. Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

455
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,957
What's our excuse?

456
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,599
Beth wanted to go
to the movies.

457
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:46,711
Good.

458
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,246
Very good.

459
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:55,458
All right now. Smile.

460
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:58,258
Remember. Not too many martinis.

461
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:06,007
Will you put that
with the others?

462
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,925
Look. We're in time.

463
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:09,383
Look who's here!

464
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,219
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

465
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,639
Come on in.

466
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:17,055
Happy birthday!
You look wonderful.

467
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:18,513
Is that new?

468
00:28:18,551 --> 00:28:21,390
Yes. It is.
Do you like it?

469
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:23,692
You did the mousse?

470
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,035
It turned out well?

471
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,528
Hey. Partner.
How are you?

472
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,216
Hi there.

473
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,096
Hi. Beth.

474
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,630
Good to see you.

475
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:33,973
Borrow the money.

476
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,431
I'll go public.

477
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,420
I wouldn't do it now
because the market's low.

478
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:41,185
Your hair looks wonderful.

479
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,678
It's shorter. You like it?

480
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,208
I said.
"Please put out your cigar."

481
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:50,929
He says. "Huh?
I don't have another one."

482
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,381
Good to see you!

483
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,645
You look beautiful. As ever.

484
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,064
In school...

485
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:03,051
they think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

486
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,122
What are these hushed tones?

487
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,156
He told the funniest joke!

488
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,644
I'm not talking to you.

489
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,948
Why?

490
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:16,554
I have my fingers crossed
on this merger.

491
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,743
Let's have lunch.

492
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,007
I don't know my schedule.

493
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,232
I'm free most days.

494
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:24,802
Bob McLean's leaving
Coles and Johnson.

495
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,720
Where is he going?

496
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:28,676
He doesn't know.

497
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:29,904
Jesus.

498
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,400
No. You didn't.

499
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:34,661
Isn't he the meanest man
you've met?

500
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,924
When a ball is in play.

501
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:40,799
If a player or caddy
accidentally move it...

502
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,909
#Jolly good fellow #

503
00:29:42,985 --> 00:29:45,325
# For he's a jolly good fellow ##

504
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,389
# Won't regret. Can't forget #

505
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,691
# What we did #

506
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,184
# For #

507
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:59,826
# Love ##

508
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:06,386
Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to?

509
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:07,844
Oh. Who knows?

510
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,608
How's Conrad doing?

511
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,526
He's great. Just great.

512
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,631
I asked Donald.
He says they haven't talked much.

513
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,240
I said maybe he's self-conscious.

514
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,199
Oh!

515
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,953
No. No. No.

516
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,871
No. He's...

517
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:30,324
There's a doctor
in Highland Park...

518
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,625
that he sees twice a week.

519
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:34,889
He's great. Just great.

520
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,996
Is he still having some problems?

521
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,837
No. Nothing like that.

522
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:42,254
Just somebody to talk to...

523
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,556
to polish off the rough edges.

524
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:46,129
How are you. Darling?

525
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:48,545
Is he falling asleep on you?

526
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,272
Nah. He's great.

527
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,225
[Mimicking "Mr. Wonderful"]
# Mr. Great. That's me #

528
00:30:58,097 --> 00:30:58,980
Hey.

529
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,624
You drank too much.

530
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,082
I'm not drunk.

531
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,573
Why did you tell Annie
about Conrad's psychiatrist?

532
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,030
Why not?

533
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:12,061
People don't hear
that thing easily.

534
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:15,437
For most people.
It's a status symbol.

535
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,815
Well. Your blurting it out...

536
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,733
was a violation of privacy.

537
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,191
Whose privacy?

538
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,994
The family's privacy!

539
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:25,871
I think it is
a very private matter.

540
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:35,500
I tell you my dreams?

541
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,878
I don't believe in dreams.

542
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:41,254
What kind of
a psychiatrist are you?

543
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,633
What's happening?

544
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:45,973
What's going on?

545
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:47,891
I just feel...

546
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,886
I feel so...

547
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,801
What?

548
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,604
Jumpy. I don't know.

549
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,100
Look. Kiddo...

550
00:31:57,136 --> 00:31:58,632
I lied.

551
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,547
I believe in dreams.

552
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,384
Sometimes I want to know
what's happening when you're awake.

553
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:07,685
Something's making you nervous.

554
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:10,102
Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

555
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,215
Tranquilizer?

556
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,516
What do you think?

557
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:16,892
You look like something
out of The Body Snatchers.

558
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:20,076
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer.

559
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,490
What is this?

560
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,217
A clock.

561
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:28,592
You can tell the time.
But I can't.

562
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,623
So you know when
the hour's up?

563
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,927
Right.

564
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,538
50. 55 minutes?

565
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,546
Maybe I don't want
to swim anymore.

566
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,962
My timing is for shit.

567
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,338
Two guys better than me
swim the 50.

568
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:55,215
They're a bunch of boring jocks.

569
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:58,131
And him...
I can't stand him.

570
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,857
Thought about quitting?

571
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:00,893
You telling me to?

572
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,427
Nope.

573
00:33:02,504 --> 00:33:04,537
It wouldn't look good.

574
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:05,918
How does it feel?

575
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,752
How does it feel?

576
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:13,130
Yes.
How does it feel?

577
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:18,194
It's the same damn thing
I did last year.

578
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:20,879
Are you the same
person now?

579
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:23,910
That's why you need
a tranquilizer?

580
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:24,984
You're a doctor.

581
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:28,206
I'm supposed to
feel better. Right?

582
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:29,702
Not necessarily.

583
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,216
Is it getting any easier
with your friends?

584
00:33:39,293 --> 00:33:41,249
No. It's still hard.

585
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:43,167
Is anyplace easy?

586
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:48,193
The hospital was.

587
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:49,996
It was? Why?

588
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:55,136
Because nobody
hid anything there.

589
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:58,704
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

590
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,816
Uh-huh.

591
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:02,233
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?

592
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,691
Uh-huh.

593
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:11,939
Whoa!

594
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,473
Hi.

595
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,432
Karen!

596
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:15,890
How are you?

597
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,002
Good.

598
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,422
Sit down. Please.

599
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,455
Thank you.

600
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,631
Wow.

601
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:50,454
When did you get back?

602
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,372
The end of August.

603
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,331
Good.

604
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,249
It's great to see you.

605
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:57,205
Oh. You. Too.

606
00:34:57,282 --> 00:35:00,543
Listen. I've got a meeting
over at the school.

607
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,000
Drama Club meeting.

608
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,379
We're doing
A Thousand Clowns.

609
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,837
You know it?

610
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,366
Anyway. We're going crazy
getting it together.

611
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,591
Don't let me hang you up.

612
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:15,158
No. I wanted to see you.

613
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:18,036
I didn't know what to expect.

614
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,913
You sounded funny on the phone.

615
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:23,790
It was just a gray day.

616
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,744
Everything's great.
I'm on the swim team.

617
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,355
Oh. You're swimming?

618
00:35:28,432 --> 00:35:30,350
Terrific. Conrad.

619
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:31,884
That's really wonderful.

620
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,263
I could be benched all year.

621
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,564
You'll do great.

622
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:40,784
I'll bet your folks
are real proud of you.

623
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:41,743
Yeah.

624
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,006
What can I get you?

625
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,426
Are you hungry?

626
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,883
Just a coke.

627
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,224
Two cokes. Please.

628
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,988
Did we offend him?

629
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,139
Something I said?

630
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,205
A low self-image day.

631
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,658
So. Uh...

632
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:00,962
- Are you...
- What did...

633
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,755
I can't believe
how beautiful you look.

634
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,056
You really look beautiful.

635
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,281
So do you.

636
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:12,931
Do you miss it?

637
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:14,120
Miss what?

638
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,309
The hospital.

639
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,304
No.

640
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,992
Thank you.

641
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:20,718
You don't miss it?

642
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:21,869
No.

643
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,555
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

644
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,002
Are you seeing a doctor?

645
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,879
Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?

646
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:35,910
Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.

647
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,288
I went for a while.

648
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,206
It didn't work.

649
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,582
He told me the things
I already knew.

650
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,040
Finally. I decided...

651
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,032
the only one who
can help me is myself.

652
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:53,633
At least. That's what
my dad says.

653
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:56,203
If it's something
you want to do.

654
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,927
That's what you
should be doing.

655
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:02,609
I don't know
how long I'll keep it up.

656
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,021
Your hair grew in.

657
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:11,241
Oh. That was such
a dumb thing to do.

658
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:12,852
I like it.

659
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,310
You do?

660
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,729
Yeah.

661
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:20,064
I don't know.
I just...

662
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:21,982
I miss it sometimes.

663
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,440
The hospital.

664
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:25,089
I really do.

665
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,731
Things have to change. You know?

666
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:31,918
But that's where we laughed.

667
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:34,219
But that was a hospital.

668
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:37,633
This is the real world.

669
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,475
I guess you're right.

670
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,835
I really have to go.

671
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:50,101
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:53,400
I have a meeting at the school.

673
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:55,817
We're doing A Thousand Clowns.

674
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:57,735
You told me.

675
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:01,226
Did I?

676
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:03,489
Yeah.

677
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:04,909
I better hurry.

678
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:07,325
Don't want to be late.

679
00:38:09,972 --> 00:38:11,814
Thanks for seeing me.

680
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:14,998
Conrad?

681
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:18,450
Let's have a great Christmas.

682
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,708
Okay?

683
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:24,013
Let's have...

684
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:26,468
a great year.

685
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:30,611
Let's have the best year
of our lives.

686
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:35,061
This could be
the best year ever.

687
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:36,518
Yeah.

688
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:37,708
Yeah.

689
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:39,818
Yeah.

690
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:44,037
Will you call me?

691
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:44,996
Yeah.

692
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,416
You mean it?

693
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,375
Yep.

694
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:51,211
You. Uh...

695
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,976
You look good. Conrad.

696
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:54,088
Yeah.

697
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,045
Bye.

698
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,310
Bye-bye.

699
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:01,108
Hey!

700
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,676
Would you cheer up?

701
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:44,265
It's cold.

702
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,562
You should put that on.

703
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,480
Do you want a sweater?

704
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,822
Do I need one?

705
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:59,610
What are you doing?

706
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:01,067
Nothing.

707
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:02,602
Thinking.

708
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:06,131
About what?

709
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,589
Not about anything.

710
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,302
Your hair is starting to grow out.

711
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,220
It's looking... looking better.

712
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:24,660
I was thinking
about the pigeon...

713
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:27,038
that hung around the garage.

714
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:31,680
How it used to get
on top of your car.

715
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:33,176
Oh. Yeah.
I remember.

716
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:37,588
I remember
how scared I got...

717
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:39,506
That wsssshhhhh!
Flap. Flap. Flap...

718
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,383
Every time I started the car.

719
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,370
That was the closest
we came to having a pet.

720
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,666
Buck tried to talk you
into getting a dog.

721
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:56,001
He said. "If it's the size
of a football?"

722
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,878
You know.
That animal next door...

723
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,873
that Pepper or Pippin...

724
00:41:00,912 --> 00:41:02,638
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.

725
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:04,402
He's not friendly...

726
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,858
whatever Mr. McGreary says.

727
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,929
He wanted the retriever.

728
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:11,730
Each time that dog comes here.
I try to get him out.

729
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:12,880
Arf!

730
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:14,415
Arf! Arf!

731
00:41:17,752 --> 00:41:20,975
Put that on
if you're staying out here.

732
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,449
Can I help?

733
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:01,906
With this?

734
00:42:01,945 --> 00:42:03,978
No.

735
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,014
I will.

736
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:07,737
You can go to your room...

737
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:09,617
and clean the closet.

738
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:11,497
Mom.

739
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,492
Okay?

740
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:16,215
Because it's really a mess.

744
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:31,867
Hello.

745
00:42:31,944 --> 00:42:33,325
Oh. Hi.

746
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,243
I didn't get there.

747
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:37,161
How did it go?

748
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,539
No. I'm not doing anything.

749
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:40,959
Just getting dinner ready.

750
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:42,647
Uh-huh.

751
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:44,104
Did she really?

752
00:42:47,135 --> 00:42:51,316
Mary Ann Ramon started
just to scream. Right?

753
00:42:51,393 --> 00:42:54,193
We got so drunk.
We couldn't talk.

754
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,339
It was the last day of school.

755
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:00,446
We walked out
of the building.

756
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:01,827
Oh, Bucky.

757
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,472
No. Stop!

758
00:43:07,773 --> 00:43:09,998
What do you expect from her?

759
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:11,533
We just don't connect.

760
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,453
Why not?

761
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,873
We just don't.

762
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,420
What are you thinking?

763
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:31,136
That I jack off a lot.

764
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:33,092
So what else is new?

765
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:34,511
Does it help?

766
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,969
For a minute.

767
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:45,560
What now?

768
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,853
John-Boy.

769
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,273
Who?

770
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,191
John-Boy on
The Waltons.

771
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:56,416
Yeah.
What about him?

772
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:01,902
After Buck died.
Dad came to my room.

773
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,932
He didn't
know what to say.

774
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:09,075
He put his
arm around me.

775
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:11,914
We just sat there.

776
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,832
I remember watching his shoe.
And thinking...

777
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:20,047
His shoe was turned
over on its side.

778
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:24,266
I was thinking. He's so uptight!
It's gonna crack off.

779
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,368
I knew I should've
felt something.

780
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:33,013
I didn't know what to feel.

781
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,348
On TV. They say stuff
like. "Oh. No!"

782
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,266
But I didn't say that...

783
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:42,143
because I didn't feel sad...

784
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,601
so much as...

785
00:44:47,974 --> 00:44:50,314
So much as what?

786
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:53,191
I kept thinking John-Boy
would've said something...

787
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:54,956
about how he felt.

788
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:57,257
What would he say?

789
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:01,822
I don't know.

790
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,242
Come on.

791
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,610
Come on.

792
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,796
Come on what?

793
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:13,446
Don't hold back.

794
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:23,305
Well. At least
she's an improvement.

795
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:25,223
That's what you get...

796
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:28,100
when your partner
does the hiring.

797
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:29,519
That's my fault.

798
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,936
I can't tell anybody...

799
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,854
that they're not making it.

800
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:38,228
Wait a minute.

801
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:41,603
That's not the problem.

802
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,023
Where are you?

803
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,480
What?

804
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:47,358
I've been losing you these days.

805
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:50,733
Oh. I'm sorry.

806
00:45:50,772 --> 00:45:52,652
That's okay.
That's okay.

807
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,570
You off the track?

808
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:55,989
Huh?

809
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:58,866
Come on.
I've known you for 20 years.

810
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:00,324
Is something wrong?

811
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:01,743
How's Connie?

812
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,469
Connie's all right.

813
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
He is. He's okay.

814
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:10,336
It's none of my business...

815
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:12,753
but you worry too much.

816
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:17,049
You've been on the rack
about him long enough.

817
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:20,425
I'm not on the rack about him.

818
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:23,302
In a year. He'll be gone.

819
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:27,599
Off to Michigan
or wherever he wants to go.

820
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:29,517
Maybe he'll tour Europe.

821
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:32,432
Who knows?

822
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:34,811
I can't argue with "Who knows."

823
00:46:34,888 --> 00:46:37,688
I'm giving you the benefit
of my experience.

824
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,146
Thanks.

825
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:42,483
Valerie isn't just
living away from home...

826
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,941
she's gone.

827
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:46,818
Got her own friends.
Her own life.

828
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:50,654
She breezes in
a few days on vacations.

829
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:54,030
I don't know.
Maybe girls are different.

830
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:56,907
Or maybe she
was too aware...

831
00:46:56,946 --> 00:47:00,743
of what was happening
between Nance and me.

832
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:06,076
But they leave. And that
worrying's just wasted energy.

833
00:47:12,444 --> 00:47:14,707
[Young Conrad]
Give me back my sweater!

834
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,622
Hang on.

835
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:18,697
[Bucky]
Dad, what's possession?

836
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:21,535
Give it to me!

837
00:47:21,612 --> 00:47:23,760
It's already on me.

838
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:25,218
Whose sweater is it?

839
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:27,059
It's my sweater!

840
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,517
I'll give it back...

841
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:30,896
if you give me my skis.

842
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:32,545
All right.

843
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,686
Conrad! Conrad!

844
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:38,760
What?

845
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,639
[Man]
Watch your back.

846
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,749
Cuts are vertical.

847
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,207
He really meant business.

848
00:47:44,284 --> 00:47:46,048
Let's go.

849
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,851
[Conductor]
Lake Forest is next.

850
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,424
Lake Forest.

851
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:20,382
[Laughing]

852
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,317
What do you want?

853
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:48,655
I don't know
what else to do.

854
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:51,071
I'm not asking for anything.

855
00:48:51,148 --> 00:48:52,529
You're kidding me.

856
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:54,907
I don't get it.

857
00:48:54,984 --> 00:48:56,826
You're excused from practice...

858
00:48:56,902 --> 00:48:58,667
to see some shrink;

859
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:02,043
I work with you
at your convenience.

860
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,344
What more should I do?

861
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:06,378
Nothing.

862
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:09,140
A bright kid like you.

863
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,096
I don't get it.

864
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:14,012
Why keep messing up your life?

865
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:17,234
I don't think that
quitting swimming...

866
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,727
will mess up my life.

867
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:26,441
Okay.

868
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:29,586
Okay. Now. This is it.

869
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:30,699
Yeah.

870
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:32,502
You're a big kid.

871
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:34,382
Actions have consequences.

872
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,491
I'm not taking you back.

873
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:37,911
I won't ask you to.

874
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:49,496
[Laughing]

875
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,002
What happened?
You all right?

876
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,306
Yeah.

877
00:50:03,345 --> 00:50:04,841
You quit the swim team.

878
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,298
Yeah.

879
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,756
Why?

880
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,176
It was a bore.

881
00:50:09,252 --> 00:50:12,053
That's no reason!

882
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,510
What's going on?

883
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:14,930
Nothing.

884
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:16,388
Talk to me.

885
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:18,306
Swimming's a bore. That's all.

886
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,265
I talked to...

887
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:21,029
Quit talking to people!

888
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:22,602
Okay?

889
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:24,559
Holy shit.

890
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:26,477
Yeah. Sure.

891
00:50:26,515 --> 00:50:28,395
Fuck you. Jarrett.

892
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:30,313
Ooh! Ohh!

893
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:31,732
Shut up.

894
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:34,149
Leave it alone.

895
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:37,026
I told you. The guy's a flake.

896
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,622
- What did your dad say?
- I haven't told him.

897
00:50:44,698 --> 00:50:46,194
How come?

898
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:48,266
The timing isn't right.

899
00:50:48,343 --> 00:50:49,800
He sweats everything.

900
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:51,910
He'll just get worried.

901
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,828
Can you tell your mother?

902
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:55,209
My mother?

903
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:57,588
I told you we don't connect.

904
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:00,964
What do people have
in common with mothers anyway?

905
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,383
It's all surface junk.

906
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,841
You know?

907
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,759
"Clean your room.
Brush your teeth...

908
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:07,293
get good grades."

909
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,551
I'm not feeling anything today.

910
00:51:11,628 --> 00:51:13,086
I'm sorry.

911
00:51:13,163 --> 00:51:14,659
No. Sorry's out.

912
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:16,730
Something's on your mind.

913
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,226
What time is it?

914
00:51:18,303 --> 00:51:19,684
Never mind. There's time.

915
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,945
Remember the contract?
Control?

916
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:24,978
Maybe there's some connection...

917
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,085
between control
and lack of feeling.

918
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:30,003
I said I feel things.

919
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,193
When?

920
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:32,650
Come on.

921
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:35,527
When?

922
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,177
Sometimes. I don't know.

923
00:51:37,254 --> 00:51:40,783
I thought you didn't
like fooling around.

924
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,509
What do you want?

925
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:45,233
Don't say. "I don't know."

926
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,688
Should I make up answers?

927
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,680
Make one up about
there's no feelings there.

928
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,138
I have feelings.

929
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,673
Get it together. Jarrett.

930
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:56,780
You're trying to make me mad.

931
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:58,238
Are you mad?

932
00:51:58,314 --> 00:51:59,925
No!

933
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:01,844
You don't like being pushed.

934
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,301
Do something about it!

935
00:52:03,378 --> 00:52:04,260
What?

936
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:06,178
No. I can't do this.

937
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,866
Why not?

938
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:09,554
Getting mad takes too much energy.

939
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,933
It takes more holding it back.

940
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:15,308
When I let myself feel.
I feel lousy.

941
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,224
# I never promised you
a rose garden #

942
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:19,490
Fuck you. Berger.

943
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:20,948
Fuck you.

944
00:52:21,024 --> 00:52:21,907
Yeah?

945
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,595
That's it.

946
00:52:23,671 --> 00:52:26,472
What do you feel?
Do you jack off?

947
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,428
What do you think?

948
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:30,653
You married a fat lady...

949
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,070
and you fuck
the daylights out of her!

950
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,643
Sounds good to me.

951
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:49,949
Little advice
about feeling...

952
00:52:50,026 --> 00:52:52,366
Don't expect it always to tickle.

953
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:57,813
Do you know how
to aim that?

954
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,498
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

955
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:01,995
Be quiet.

956
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:03,951
Is it in focus?

957
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,869
Smile. Smile.
Okay. Good.

958
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:09,782
I want to take
the three young ones.

959
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:12,237
Dad. Get out of there.

960
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:13,541
All right.

961
00:53:13,618 --> 00:53:14,999
Connie.

962
00:53:15,076 --> 00:53:16,495
Be quiet.

963
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:18,413
Conrad. Where are you?

964
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,868
Between your mother and father.

965
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:23,784
You're taller than
your mother is!

966
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:26,124
Will you be quiet?

967
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,505
This is beautiful.

968
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,155
Shut up.

969
00:53:29,231 --> 00:53:30,612
Wonderful.

970
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,569
Now Cal and Beth.

971
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:33,566
Sure.

972
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,407
Go on.

973
00:53:35,484 --> 00:53:38,476
You can do better than that.

974
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:41,622
I want one of Connie and Beth.

975
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:45,036
Let's get the three men in there.

976
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:47,491
Move closer to your mother.

977
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:48,489
Prize winner.

978
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,253
Yeah. That's great.

979
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,634
Do it.

980
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,092
Isn't it marvelous?

981
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:54,512
Yes. It is.

982
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:56,430
It isn't cocked.

983
00:53:56,468 --> 00:53:57,811
Calvin.

984
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,997
Hold it. Connie. Smile.

985
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,800
Calvin!

986
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:02,989
Smile.

987
00:54:03,066 --> 00:54:05,061
Give me the camera.

988
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:06,595
Give me the camera.

989
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:09,703
I want a really good picture.

990
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:12,964
I want a shot of you three men.

991
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,879
Not until I get you two.

992
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:18,526
Give her
the goddamn camera!

993
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,172
Smile.

994
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,847
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

995
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:49,023
[Crash]

996
00:54:55,276 --> 00:54:56,657
Beth!

997
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,611
It can be saved.

998
00:55:02,642 --> 00:55:05,059
That was so dumb.

999
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,925
I don't think
he's happy in school.

1000
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:16,836
Have you talked to his teachers?

1001
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,828
People don't want
to be with him.

1002
00:55:19,904 --> 00:55:21,324
He provokes people.

1003
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:23,779
Well. It's an awkward age.

1004
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:25,237
Thank you.

1005
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,689
Maybe he needs a change.

1006
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:30,684
Is he eating enough?

1007
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,525
Yes. Mother.

1008
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:34,482
He'll be all right.

1009
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,899
If you're firm with him.

1010
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:40,735
I think he should
go away to school.

1011
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:43,152
I can't deal with him.

1012
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,262
Who'd make that decision?

1013
00:55:45,338 --> 00:55:49,366
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.

1014
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:51,514
What sort of doctor...

1015
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:53,816
would make that decision for you?

1016
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:55,274
A psychiatrist.

1017
00:55:55,312 --> 00:55:57,652
I thought that was finished.

1018
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,187
No.

1019
00:55:59,263 --> 00:56:01,105
What's his name?

1020
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:03,023
Berger.

1021
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,941
Jewish doctor?

1022
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:06,897
I suppose he's Jewish.

1023
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:09,276
Maybe just German.

1024
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:12,153
What does Cal say
about all this?

1025
00:56:14,148 --> 00:56:15,529
This can be saved.

1026
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:18,176
It's a nice clean break.

1027
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:21,360
# Amen. Amen. Alleluia #

1028
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:23,815
# Amen #

1029
00:56:23,853 --> 00:56:30,797
# Amen ##

1030
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:32,254
Okay.

1031
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:35,630
That last "E" natural
could be higher.

1032
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:38,469
Officers. Don't forget
your meeting tonight.

1033
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:45,374
# Mmm mm mmm #

1034
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,331
# Mmm mm mmm #

1035
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,057
# Mmm mmm #

1036
00:56:49,134 --> 00:56:50,821
# Mmm mm mmm #

1037
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,261
Hi. Jeannine.

1038
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:01,716
You're really a terrific tenor.

1039
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:05,130
In fact. You should be
doing the solo.

1040
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:07,087
No. L...

1041
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:08,583
No. I'm serious.

1042
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:10,041
You sing well.

1043
00:57:10,117 --> 00:57:12,994
I'm getting to know your voice.

1044
00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:16,409
How can you hear me
if you're singing?

1045
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:17,905
Well...

1046
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:19,823
I don't always sing.

1047
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,818
Sometimes I just listen.

1048
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:25,731
For instance. Marcia Blair
can't sing a note.

1049
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:29,605
Janet Fox mouths the words
and never sings.

1050
00:57:29,682 --> 00:57:31,140
A detective.

1051
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:32,674
[Jeannine]
Do you like Vivaldi?

1052
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:35,052
Telemann?

1053
00:57:35,129 --> 00:57:36,664
[Conrad]
Telemann? Um...

1054
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,617
What kind of music do you like?

1055
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:40,960
Oh. Uh...

1056
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:43,914
Modern jazz. I like.

1057
00:57:43,952 --> 00:57:47,290
Folk rock. Spoon on a glass.

1058
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:50,244
Spoon on a glass?

1059
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,338
Oh. You mean.
Like. Table spoons?

1060
00:57:59,872 --> 00:58:01,292
Oh. Dear.

1061
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:06,125
Why do I ask dumb questions?

1062
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:08,082
I'm just showing off.

1063
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:14,910
Why is it so hard...

1064
00:58:14,987 --> 00:58:17,787
the first time you talk
to somebody?

1065
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:19,705
You make it look easy.

1066
00:58:22,314 --> 00:58:23,695
Really?

1067
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:29,296
That's my bus.
I got to go.

1068
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,252
I'll see you later!

1069
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:35,050
You're really a terrific tenor.

1070
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,733

1084
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:34,472
Hello.

1085
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,930
Is Karen there?

1086
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,388
Who's calling?

1087
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:40,303
A friend of hers from Hillsboro.

1088
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,953
Oh.

1089
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:44,868
She's not home from school yet.

1090
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:46,479
Oh. Um...

1091
00:59:46,556 --> 00:59:48,934
Hmm. Tell her I called.

1092
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:50,392
This is Conrad.

1093
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:52,847
Tell her I'm feeling great...

1094
00:59:52,886 --> 00:59:55,763
and I wanted to talk to her.

1095
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,220
Yes. I will.

1096
00:59:57,297 --> 00:59:58,256
Thank you.

1097
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,109
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1098
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:43,178
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1099
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:54,341
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1100
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:56,029
Conrad.

1101
01:00:56,106 --> 01:00:57,371
Conrad?

1102
01:00:57,448 --> 01:00:59,174
What a dumb name.

1103
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:02,857
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Bill.

1104
01:01:02,896 --> 01:01:04,123
Uuuuugh!

1105
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:10,491
Hello.

1106
01:01:10,568 --> 01:01:12,870
Hello. This is...

1107
01:01:12,946 --> 01:01:14,788
Hello. This is Conrad calling.

1108
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:16,207
Jarrett.

1109
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:17,588
Oh.

1110
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:19,506
Oh. Hi!

1111
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,964
Listen. I was...

1112
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,841
I was wondering
if maybe you'd like...

1113
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:25,260
to go out sometime.

1114
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:27,217
Like on a date?

1115
01:01:27,255 --> 01:01:30,554
We wouldn't have
to call it a date.

1116
01:01:30,631 --> 01:01:32,971
We could see how it goes.

1117
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:36,807
That was dumb.
Now start over.

1118
01:01:36,846 --> 01:01:38,227
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1119
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:39,953
I'd love to. When?

1120
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,670
I didn't see you.

1121
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:16,435
What do you think?

1122
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:17,739
Fine.

1123
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,463
Rawlins used to have
great scotch pines.

1124
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:24,107
They look like
skeletons this year.

1125
01:02:24,145 --> 01:02:26,562
Hi. What do you think?

1126
01:02:28,634 --> 01:02:30,820
It's very nice.

1127
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:33,659
What is wrong?

1128
01:02:33,736 --> 01:02:35,117
Ask him what's wrong.

1129
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:38,761
Maybe you won't have to
hear it from Carol Lazenby.

1130
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,142
Hear what?

1131
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,088
I quit the swim team.

1132
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:48,198
Carol thought I knew.

1133
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:51,152
It happened over a month ago.

1134
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,533
Quit? When?

1135
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,139
Where have you been every night?

1136
01:02:56,177 --> 01:02:58,057
Nowhere.
The library mostly.

1137
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:00,742
I didn't think it mattered.

1138
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,121
That was meant for me.

1139
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:06,305
It's important to hurt me. Right?

1140
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,185
You have that backwards.

1141
01:03:08,261 --> 01:03:12,059
Do I embarrass you
in front of friends?

1142
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:15,972
"Poor Beth believes
every lie her son tells."

1143
01:03:16,049 --> 01:03:17,468
I didn't lie.

1144
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:21,381
You did when
you came home at 6:30!

1145
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:25,371
If the lying's starting again.
I can't stand it!

1146
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:27,596
Then go to Europe!

1147
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:32,813
She only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first!

1148
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:36,073
She never came
to the hospital...

1149
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:39,526
because she's busy going
to goddamn Spain and Portugal!

1150
01:03:39,603 --> 01:03:43,938
She doesn't care if I'm hung up
by the balls out there.

1151
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:46,700
They may talk like this
at the hospital...

1152
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:49,155
but we're not at the hospital.

1153
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:51,572
You never came to the hospital!

1154
01:03:51,648 --> 01:03:54,218
She had the flu
and couldn't come inside.

1155
01:03:54,295 --> 01:03:57,134
She would've visited Buck
in the hospital!

1156
01:03:57,211 --> 01:04:00,011
Buck never would've been
in the hospital!

1157
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,661
That is enough!

1158
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,346
I won't do it again.

1159
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,916
What in hell has happened?

1160
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:09,410
Somebody better go up there.

1161
01:04:09,486 --> 01:04:11,750
He walks all over us...

1162
01:04:11,788 --> 01:04:14,857
then you apologize to him.

1163
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:16,583
You've been apologizing to him...

1164
01:04:16,622 --> 01:04:19,614
since he returned from the hospital!

1165
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:22,990
I'm trying to
goddamn understand him!

1166
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:24,639
Don't talk to me...

1167
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:27,171
the way he talks to you.

1168
01:04:27,248 --> 01:04:29,588
Let's not fight. Okay?

1169
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,161
No fighting. Okay?

1170
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:33,040
Please.

1171
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:34,690
Let's go upstairs.

1172
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:55,328
I want to talk to you.

1173
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:57,860
I didn't mean any of it.

1174
01:04:57,937 --> 01:05:00,009
Please don't be mad.

1175
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:02,847
I'm trying to
understand what happened.

1176
01:05:02,924 --> 01:05:05,303
I don't know what happened.

1177
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:07,221
I didn't mean it.

1178
01:05:07,297 --> 01:05:10,328
Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?

1179
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:11,440
Why don't you?

1180
01:05:11,517 --> 01:05:13,205
God. I can't!

1181
01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:15,660
I can't talk to her!

1182
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,118
Why not?

1183
01:05:17,195 --> 01:05:19,074
It doesn't change anything.

1184
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:23,524
It doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

1185
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:27,437
She was hurt because
you quit the team.

1186
01:05:27,514 --> 01:05:29,892
I don't mean just now.

1187
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,347
I don't mean just today.

1188
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:34,342
Explain it to me.

1189
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:37,258
I can't. You don't see things.

1190
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,754
What things?

1191
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,365
What things?

1192
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:43,319
I want you to tell me.

1193
01:05:43,396 --> 01:05:46,349
Can't you see she hates me?

1194
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:48,268
She doesn't hate you.

1195
01:05:48,306 --> 01:05:50,723
You're right.
She doesn't.

1196
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,717
Please leave me alone.

1197
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:08,331
Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?

1198
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:10,210
It's not his fault.

1199
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,957
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

1200
01:06:23,215 --> 01:06:27,013
Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.

1201
01:06:27,089 --> 01:06:28,470
You're the doctor.

1202
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:34,186
Don't take refuge
in one-liners. Okay?

1203
01:06:34,225 --> 01:06:36,104
Because that pisses me off.

1204
01:06:36,143 --> 01:06:38,483
Okay. Okay.

1205
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,941
Everything was fine...

1206
01:06:40,017 --> 01:06:42,818
till you had the fight
with your mother?

1207
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:44,237
I don't blame her.

1208
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:46,654
She's got her reasons.
It's impossible...

1209
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:48,572
after all the shit I've pulled.

1210
01:06:48,649 --> 01:06:50,490
What shit have you pulled?

1211
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:55,208
I'm talking about proportion.

1212
01:06:55,285 --> 01:06:57,127
Now. What shit?

1213
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,878
You can find one example.

1214
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,796
Don't say you tried suicide.

1215
01:07:05,873 --> 01:07:07,714
What have you done lately?

1216
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:11,244
I'll never be forgiven for that.

1217
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,740
Never.

1218
01:07:12,816 --> 01:07:16,768
You can't get out
the blood in her towels...

1219
01:07:16,844 --> 01:07:18,763
and in her rug.

1220
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:21,256
Everything
had to be pitched.

1221
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,785
The bathroom tile
had to be regrouted.

1222
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:26,512
She fired the maid...

1223
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:29,312
because she couldn't dust right.

1224
01:07:29,389 --> 01:07:31,805
If you think I'll forgive...

1225
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,302
she's gonna forgive me...

1226
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,086
What?

1227
01:08:01,382 --> 01:08:04,988
I think I just figured
something out.

1228
01:08:05,065 --> 01:08:06,446
What?

1229
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,321
Who it is who can't forgive who.

1230
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:18,683
[Berger]
A real problem has a real solution.

1231
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,678
[Conrad]
I've heard this before.

1232
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:23,632
Doesn't make it any less true.

1233
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:25,128
I'm so tired.

1234
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:28,120
That's some secret
you've been keeping.

1235
01:08:28,197 --> 01:08:31,074
So what do I do now?

1236
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:34,565
Recognize her limitations.

1237
01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:38,018
Like she can't love me.

1238
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:41,892
No. Like she can't
love you enough.

1239
01:08:41,969 --> 01:08:44,999
Don't blame her
for not loving you...

1240
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,956
more than she's able.

1241
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,951
She loves my father.

1242
01:08:49,027 --> 01:08:50,945
She loved my brother.

1243
01:08:51,022 --> 01:08:52,595
It's me.

1244
01:08:52,672 --> 01:08:55,626
We're back to
the rotten kid routine.

1245
01:08:55,702 --> 01:08:59,385
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

1246
01:08:59,462 --> 01:09:02,416
How come your Dad loves you?

1247
01:09:02,492 --> 01:09:04,871
He feels responsible.

1248
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:06,827
Besides. He loves everybody.

1249
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:09,321
The guy's got no taste.

1250
01:09:09,397 --> 01:09:12,274
He loves you. But he's wrong.

1251
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:13,771
Look...

1252
01:09:13,809 --> 01:09:16,686
maybe she can't express it...

1253
01:09:16,763 --> 01:09:18,643
the way you'd like.

1254
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,865
Maybe she's afraid
to show her feelings.

1255
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:24,052
What do you mean?

1256
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:26,353
There's someone
besides your mother...

1257
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:27,964
you've got to forgive.

1258
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:29,729
You mean me?

1259
01:09:31,532 --> 01:09:33,949
For trying to off myself?

1260
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:37,900
Don't stare.
What for?

1261
01:09:37,977 --> 01:09:41,775
Why don't you let yourself
off the hook?

1262
01:09:41,813 --> 01:09:44,728
What did I do?

1263
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,340
What did I do?

1264
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:47,797
We'll talk Thursday.

1265
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:48,756
Come on!

1266
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,483
Time's up.

1267
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:52,899
What did I do?

1268
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:54,319
You know the rules.

1269
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,815
What rules?

1270
01:09:55,853 --> 01:09:57,503
Think about it.

1271
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,076
Just think about it.

1272
01:10:02,106 --> 01:10:03,334
Jesus!

1273
01:10:07,362 --> 01:10:09,817
Say. After going to a new high...

1274
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:12,157
it falls to 1121/4...

1275
01:10:12,234 --> 01:10:15,111
and then rallies on good volume.

1276
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,489
I order to buy 4.000.

1277
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:21,671
If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.
I know something's wrong.

1278
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:25,507
But suppose I order
to buy the 4.000 shares...

1279
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,307
and I plug in at 1133/4...

1280
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:32,105
I get 2.000 at 114.
500 at 1141/4...

1281
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:34,905
and the rest on the way up.

1282
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:36,900
Then I know I'm right.

1283
01:10:36,977 --> 01:10:39,739
I'm going to peel off here.

1284
01:10:39,816 --> 01:10:41,657
See you later.

1285
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:48,716
[Voice Echoing]
Suppose the order to buy...

1286
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,672
[Beth's Voice]
You let him walk all over us...

1287
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,938
and you apologize.

1288
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,587
[Man's Voice]
500 at 114...

1289
01:10:53,664 --> 01:10:55,544
[Conrad's Voice]
Dad, you don't see things.

1290
01:10:55,621 --> 01:10:57,347
[Beth]
You've been apologizing...

1291
01:10:57,424 --> 01:11:00,569
since he returned from the hospital.

1292
01:11:00,646 --> 01:11:02,487
Tell her to stop it!

1293
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:05,480
Buck never would've
been in the hospital!

1294
01:11:05,556 --> 01:11:06,861
She hates me!

1295
01:11:28,228 --> 01:11:29,878
I want to be clear.

1296
01:11:29,954 --> 01:11:31,681
That's good.

1297
01:11:33,484 --> 01:11:37,895
In the car.
I was thinking. "be clear."

1298
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:43,534
I suppose that's what
psychiatry's about.

1299
01:11:43,573 --> 01:11:45,874
Being precise and clear.

1300
01:11:45,951 --> 01:11:47,831
And honest, of course.

1301
01:11:49,173 --> 01:11:52,971
I'm not a great believer
in psychiatry.

1302
01:11:53,048 --> 01:11:54,698
Okay.

1303
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:58,265
What happens here
is between you and him...

1304
01:11:58,342 --> 01:12:00,260
and I respect that.

1305
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:02,638
He's better.
I can see that.

1306
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:05,400
I just don't believe in psychiatry...

1307
01:12:05,477 --> 01:12:08,584
as a panacea for everybody.

1308
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:10,081
Neither do I.

1309
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:17,292
I wish I knew what
I was doing here.

1310
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:21,167
You said you could shed
some light on some things.

1311
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:24,658
I meant in terms of Conrad.

1312
01:12:24,735 --> 01:12:27,113
I knew something was wrong...

1313
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:29,568
even before he tried suicide.

1314
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,563
But I thought that...

1315
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:35,476
It's clear that he's very smart.

1316
01:12:35,553 --> 01:12:38,430
He's always been
an "A" student.

1317
01:12:38,506 --> 01:12:40,885
Naturally. I thought
intelligent people...

1318
01:12:40,962 --> 01:12:43,263
could work out their problems.

1319
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,834
But you still feel responsible?

1320
01:12:45,872 --> 01:12:47,828
Yeah, sure I do.

1321
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,861
It's hard not to.

1322
01:12:49,938 --> 01:12:54,311
It was just luck that
I happened to be there...

1323
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,268
when he tried it.

1324
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:58,915
We both could've been away.

1325
01:12:58,992 --> 01:13:02,789
You think of yourself
as a lucky man?

1326
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:04,324
No. No. No.

1327
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:09,196
I used to think that
I was a lucky person...

1328
01:13:09,272 --> 01:13:10,884
before the accident.

1329
01:13:15,372 --> 01:13:18,249
I guess the whole of life...

1330
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:20,704
is nothing but an accident...

1331
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:22,546
what happens to you.

1332
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:25,423
That sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter.

1333
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:27,264
Yeah. Maybe.

1334
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:29,566
Maybe I am drifting a little.

1335
01:13:29,642 --> 01:13:33,018
I can see the two of them...

1336
01:13:33,095 --> 01:13:35,013
drifting away from me...

1337
01:13:35,051 --> 01:13:37,507
and I just stand watching.

1338
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:41,573
What would you want
to do about that?

1339
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:44,028
Something.
I don't know what.

1340
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:47,404
I feel like
I'm sitting on a fence.

1341
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:50,396
They're on opposite sides
of this fence?

1342
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:53,081
Yeah... No.

1343
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:54,309
I don't know.

1344
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:58,759
I see her not being able
to forgive him.

1345
01:13:59,756 --> 01:14:01,252
For what?

1346
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:03,171
I don't know exactly.

1347
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:05,626
Being too much like her.

1348
01:14:05,702 --> 01:14:10,536
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

1349
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,449
But it's really she and Conrad.

1350
01:14:14,526 --> 01:14:16,904
They were the only two...

1351
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:19,858
that didn't cry at the funeral.

1352
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:23,809
It's not easy for me to admit this...

1353
01:14:23,886 --> 01:14:25,267
but. Um...

1354
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:26,763
she didn't...

1355
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,975
His mother doesn't
show him much affection.

1356
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:37,542
I'm not trying
to put her down.

1357
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:40,995
Did she give Buck
much affection?

1358
01:14:41,072 --> 01:14:43,412
God. Yes.
She loved Buck.

1359
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:45,368
Bucky got so much.

1360
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:48,821
What she felt for him was special.

1361
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:51,314
He was her first-born.

1362
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:53,079
And you?

1363
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,575
I loved Buck.

1364
01:14:54,613 --> 01:14:56,685
I mean your wife's affection.

1365
01:14:56,762 --> 01:14:58,181
For me?

1366
01:14:58,258 --> 01:14:59,485
Yes.

1367
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:02,247
She's very...

1368
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:06,237
No. There's no problem
with her for me.

1369
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:09,843
We've been married
nearly 21 years.

1370
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:12,298
Everybody loves Beth.

1371
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:15,636
For Conrad. It's been difficult.

1372
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:18,398
He didn't talk about that?

1373
01:15:18,474 --> 01:15:21,351
We don't know what happens here.

1374
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,308
It doesn't come up.

1375
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:30,443
I guess that's what it is.

1376
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,745
It's private here. Isn't it?

1377
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:34,164
Mm-hmm.
Very private.

1378
01:15:37,809 --> 01:15:41,568
I think I know why I came here.

1379
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,785
I think I came here
to talk about myself.

1380
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:49,509
Okay. Why don't we?

1381
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,028
Hi.

1382
01:15:57,143 --> 01:16:00,941
[Car Buzzer Alarm]

1383
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:01,861
Calvin?

1384
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:04,777
[Buzzing Continues]

1385
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:06,273
What's the matter?

1386
01:16:12,142 --> 01:16:14,559
This will sound strange.

1387
01:16:16,055 --> 01:16:19,891
What I'm going to say
will sound strange.

1388
01:16:19,968 --> 01:16:21,387
What happened?

1389
01:16:21,426 --> 01:16:22,807
Come inside.

1390
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:26,758
Could we talk about
Buck's funeral?

1391
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:28,331
What?

1392
01:16:28,408 --> 01:16:32,244
It'll seem trivial.
But it's on my mind.

1393
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,159
I'd like to talk about it.

1394
01:16:35,236 --> 01:16:38,995
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1395
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:42,371
What could getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1396
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:44,826
have to do with anything?

1397
01:16:44,903 --> 01:16:47,397
I was wearing a blue shirt.

1398
01:16:47,473 --> 01:16:51,846
You said. "Wear a white shirt
and other shoes."

1399
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:56,795
It was nothing. But
it seemed to stay with me.

1400
01:16:56,872 --> 01:16:59,250
What difference did it make...

1401
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:02,242
what I wore to Buck's funeral?

1402
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:04,199
Hear me out. Beth!

1403
01:17:04,276 --> 01:17:07,191
No one would listen to that.

1404
01:17:07,268 --> 01:17:10,030
I just want to talk about it.

1405
01:17:10,068 --> 01:17:12,869
Why do you want to remind me?

1406
01:17:12,907 --> 01:17:17,549
Because I've wondered what
it mattered what I wore.

1407
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:20,004
I was crazy that day.

1408
01:17:20,081 --> 01:17:23,993
We were going
to our son's funeral.

1409
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:29,978
You were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

1410
01:17:30,055 --> 01:17:32,740
It sticks with me...

1411
01:17:32,817 --> 01:17:36,269
and I wanted to
tell you about it.

1412
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,310
It's all right.

1413
01:18:04,196 --> 01:18:06,115
Beth! How are you?

1414
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:08,071
Fine. How are you?

1415
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:10,066
I haven't seen you.

1416
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:12,521
I'll call you. How's Brad?

1417
01:18:12,598 --> 01:18:14,976
Fabulous! Is everything okay?

1418
01:18:15,053 --> 01:18:16,511
Isn't this madness?

1419
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:18,966
It gets worse every year.

1420
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:20,462
Good-bye.

1421
01:18:27,789 --> 01:18:31,165
May I show you this in your size?

1422
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:32,162
What?

1423
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,617
May I show you this?

1424
01:18:34,694 --> 01:18:37,072
Oh. No. No. Thanks.

1425
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:46,816
Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.

1426
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:50,269
Conrad should get something
for my parents.

1427
01:18:50,345 --> 01:18:54,757
He's not getting something
for his doctor. Is he?

1428
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:57,941
We should go see Dr. Berger.

1429
01:18:58,018 --> 01:18:59,207
What?

1430
01:18:59,245 --> 01:19:02,122
We could all go see him.

1431
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,503
Why?

1432
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,419
He thinks it's a good idea.

1433
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:08,874
What's he know about me?

1434
01:19:08,912 --> 01:19:11,483
I've never even met him.

1435
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:16,048
Wouldn't it be easier
if we all talked about it?

1436
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:18,503
What will we talk about?

1437
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:20,996
Don't try to change me.

1438
01:19:21,035 --> 01:19:22,454
Hasn't enough happened?

1439
01:19:22,531 --> 01:19:25,983
Let's hold on to what we've got.

1440
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,362
That's what this is for.

1441
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,781
Maybe you'll be surprised.

1442
01:19:29,858 --> 01:19:31,469
I don't want surprises.

1443
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:36,149
I know I'm not perfect.

1444
01:19:36,226 --> 01:19:39,678
If I can't hug everybody
like you. I'm sorry.

1445
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:41,980
You're missing the point.

1446
01:19:42,057 --> 01:19:44,972
I don't want to see counselors.

1447
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:47,428
This is my family.

1448
01:19:47,504 --> 01:19:49,384
We will solve our problems...

1449
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:52,836
in the privacy of our own home...

1450
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:55,330
not by running to some...

1451
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:56,903
Ready to order?

1452
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:00,355
Could you give me
a few minutes?

1453
01:20:00,432 --> 01:20:04,307
Running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1454
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:12,056
I know you mean well.

1455
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:15,623
I want this to be
a nice Christmas.

1456
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:19,037
I want them all to be nice.

1457
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:22,298
You and I need time together.

1458
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,715
We must get away.

1459
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:27,976
New Years'. We'll spend
time in Houston...

1460
01:20:28,014 --> 01:20:29,433
with my brother.

1461
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,965
Play some golf. Relax.

1462
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:34,804
I've talked to Mother.

1463
01:20:34,881 --> 01:20:37,259
Conrad can stay with them.

1464
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:39,791
Please don't worry about it.

1465
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,975
Please. For his sake.
Don't indulge him.

1466
01:20:43,052 --> 01:20:45,430
We need time together.

1467
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,041
Okay?

1468
01:20:48,116 --> 01:20:49,688
Okay.

1469
01:20:49,765 --> 01:20:51,798
Okay.

1470
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,448
I love you.

1471
01:20:56,095 --> 01:20:57,859
I love you. Too.

1472
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:04,918
Let's just give things time. Okay?

1473
01:21:04,995 --> 01:21:06,261
Okay.

1474
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,385
Conrad.

1475
01:21:17,462 --> 01:21:18,460
Hmm?

1476
01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:20,109
I don't bowl.

1477
01:21:20,186 --> 01:21:21,797
I'm a horrible bowler.

1478
01:21:21,874 --> 01:21:23,255
That's all right.

1479
01:21:23,332 --> 01:21:25,441
Yeah. Well...

1480
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,472
I got it.

1481
01:21:28,549 --> 01:21:31,848
The thing is.
I'm a funny bowler.

1482
01:21:31,886 --> 01:21:34,763
Listen. We don't
have to go bowling.

1483
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:37,103
I'm not a bowling nut.

1484
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,676
How funny are you?

1485
01:21:38,753 --> 01:21:42,896
On a scale from 1 to 10...
About a 10.

1486
01:21:42,973 --> 01:21:44,315
That's pretty funny.

1487
01:21:44,392 --> 01:21:46,694
I promise you won't look silly.

1488
01:21:46,732 --> 01:21:48,343
Guarantee it?

1489
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,686
Guarantee it.

1490
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,846
Can you break the ball?

1491
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,258
Can't break anything
in a bowling alley.

1492
01:22:21,334 --> 01:22:24,096
That's what I like
about bowling alleys.

1493
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,245
Can't even break the record.

1494
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:35,106
Anyway...

1495
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:36,909
Hmm? What?

1496
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:39,172
It's a conversation starter.

1497
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:40,477
Catchy.

1498
01:22:40,553 --> 01:22:41,743
You like it?

1499
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:45,349
I've been working on it all day.

1500
01:22:45,425 --> 01:22:48,763
Are people punished
for things they do?

1501
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,221
By God?

1502
01:22:50,297 --> 01:22:51,218
Yeah.

1503
01:22:51,295 --> 01:22:53,673
I don't believe in God.

1504
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,169
Not at all?

1505
01:22:55,246 --> 01:22:57,509
Either you do or don't.

1506
01:22:57,548 --> 01:23:00,617
I believe in God.

1507
01:23:00,693 --> 01:23:03,877
You afraid he'll punish you
for something?

1508
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:07,752
I've done many things
I'm ashamed of.

1509
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,626
Yeah? So have I.

1510
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:21,063
Did it hurt?

1511
01:23:26,894 --> 01:23:28,736
I don't remember really.

1512
01:23:28,812 --> 01:23:32,111
You don't want
to talk about it?

1513
01:23:32,188 --> 01:23:35,142
I've never really
talked about it.

1514
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:39,630
To doctors.
But not to anyone else.

1515
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:41,050
You're the first who's asked.

1516
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:43,620
Why did you do it?

1517
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:45,001
Uh...

1518
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:53,287
I don't know.
It was like...

1519
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:55,243
falling into a hole.

1520
01:23:56,318 --> 01:23:59,655
It was like falling into a hole.

1521
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:01,650
It keeps getting bigger...

1522
01:24:01,727 --> 01:24:03,606
and you can't escape.

1523
01:24:03,683 --> 01:24:06,905
All of a sudden, it's inside...

1524
01:24:06,982 --> 01:24:08,517
and you're the hole.

1525
01:24:08,555 --> 01:24:11,547
You're trapped.
And it's all over.

1526
01:24:11,624 --> 01:24:13,427
Something like that.

1527
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:15,383
It's not really scary...

1528
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,954
except when
you think back on it.

1529
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:22,212
'Cause you know
what you were feeling...

1530
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,593
# Like McDonald's can #

1531
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:25,971
# Nobody can do it #

1532
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:27,621
# Like McDonald's can #

1533
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:31,342
# You deserve
a break today #

1534
01:24:31,418 --> 01:24:34,219
# So get up
and get away #

1535
01:24:34,296 --> 01:24:35,983
Hey. Jarrett.

1536
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,014
How you doing?
How about some fries?

1537
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:40,894
What are you doing?

1538
01:24:43,732 --> 01:24:45,152
Hey. Lighten up.

1539
01:24:45,229 --> 01:24:48,182
Hey. I don't like your attitude.

1540
01:25:13,194 --> 01:25:15,304
Energetic. Those guys.

1541
01:25:15,342 --> 01:25:17,184
They were pretty funny.

1542
01:25:17,261 --> 01:25:18,642
No.

1543
01:25:18,718 --> 01:25:20,636
You thought they were.

1544
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:22,094
No. L...

1545
01:25:30,994 --> 01:25:32,452
I'm sorry.

1546
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,909
What for?

1547
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,318
Anyway...

1548
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,003
Do you want to talk?

1549
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,499
About what?

1550
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:01,913
Are you okay?

1551
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,371
Yeah.

1552
01:26:03,448 --> 01:26:04,867
Yeah. I'm fine.

1553
01:26:05,903 --> 01:26:08,742
I'll give you a call.

1554
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:11,887
Will you? I want you to.

1555
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:13,806
Sure.

1556
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,012
Well...

1557
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,427
I'll see you in choir.

1558
01:26:26,503 --> 01:26:27,884
Okay. Yeah.

1559
01:26:27,961 --> 01:26:30,032
Thanks.

1560
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:31,835
Okay.

1561
01:26:31,912 --> 01:26:34,291
I mean. Good night.

1562
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:35,787
Good night.

1563
01:26:48,139 --> 01:26:49,520
Seven.

1564
01:26:49,597 --> 01:26:52,474
In preparation
for our landing in Houston,

1565
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:55,428
observe the fasten
seat belt sign,

1566
01:26:55,505 --> 01:26:58,535
and no smoking until
well inside the terminal.

1567
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:09,545
Watch this.

1568
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:11,003
Pessimistic golfer.

1569
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:12,499
Pessimistic golfer.

1570
01:27:13,573 --> 01:27:14,992
Oh. Damn!

1571
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,790
Are we two up?

1572
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:20,325
Two.

1573
01:27:20,363 --> 01:27:21,821
Let's hustle up.

1574
01:27:21,897 --> 01:27:23,777
It is flat here.

1575
01:27:23,854 --> 01:27:27,805
But we decided
to teach you to love it.

1576
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:30,797
He wants everybody to move here.

1577
01:27:30,874 --> 01:27:33,291
It's good to see you.

1578
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:36,436
- You look tired. Cal.
- Airplane scotch.

1579
01:27:36,513 --> 01:27:39,045
Why am I still hungry?

1580
01:27:39,122 --> 01:27:40,925
'Cause you're in Texas.

1581
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:42,881
We'll get you home.

1582
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,876
Get some steaks on.

1583
01:27:44,914 --> 01:27:46,986
A baked potato. Too?

1584
01:27:47,063 --> 01:27:50,477
How long has he had
that drawl?

1585
01:27:50,553 --> 01:27:52,510
Since joining the club.

1586
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:36,741
[Laughing]

1587
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,308
It sure wasn't funny.

1588
01:28:40,385 --> 01:28:42,303
We weren't that bad.

1589
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:46,753
I can't listen to that
Buck Jarrett lecture again.

1590
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:50,206
He bugs me
when he does that.

1591
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:53,697
Will he ever stop
kissing his picture?

1592
01:28:53,773 --> 01:28:55,154
Stillman. Shut up.

1593
01:28:56,535 --> 01:28:58,454
Connie. Want a ride?

1594
01:28:58,530 --> 01:28:59,950
Oh. No. Thanks.

1595
01:28:59,988 --> 01:29:02,405
We could've used you today.

1596
01:29:02,481 --> 01:29:04,400
I don't think so.

1597
01:29:04,476 --> 01:29:07,315
Nobody could've helped us.

1598
01:29:07,392 --> 01:29:10,269
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.

1599
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:12,034
Made it with her yet?

1600
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,453
Don't be a prick.

1601
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,524
You're the prick.

1602
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:19,974
You give me a goddamn
pain in the ass.

1603
01:29:24,194 --> 01:29:26,726
Connie. Come on!
Come on!

1604
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:28,260
Connie!

1605
01:29:32,404 --> 01:29:33,785
Connie. That's enough.

1606
01:29:33,861 --> 01:29:34,744
No!

1607
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,010
No!

1608
01:29:36,048 --> 01:29:38,656
Let go! Let go!

1609
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:40,997
It's all right!

1610
01:29:41,035 --> 01:29:43,375
Just calm down.

1611
01:29:43,452 --> 01:29:45,446
You're crazy!
You know that?

1612
01:29:48,247 --> 01:29:51,546
Send him back
where he came from!

1613
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:53,464
It's over. It's over.

1614
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:55,382
All right!

1615
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:56,878
Shit!

1616
01:30:08,348 --> 01:30:09,768
Here's your hat.

1617
01:30:18,092 --> 01:30:20,931
You want to talk?

1618
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:22,887
The guy's a nothing.

1619
01:30:22,964 --> 01:30:24,729
He's a zero upstairs.

1620
01:30:24,805 --> 01:30:27,644
Since fourth grade,
you've known that.

1621
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:29,601
So you look stupid...

1622
01:30:29,677 --> 01:30:32,516
when you let him get to you!

1623
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:35,010
So I look stupid?

1624
01:30:35,086 --> 01:30:36,429
What's with you?

1625
01:30:36,506 --> 01:30:40,917
Why do you want
to be in this alone?

1626
01:30:43,296 --> 01:30:46,019
You know. I miss him. Too.

1627
01:30:47,707 --> 01:30:50,968
The three of us
were best friends.

1628
01:30:53,001 --> 01:30:55,955
It hurts too much
to be around you.

1629
01:30:59,599 --> 01:31:01,019
I got to go.

1630
01:31:04,011 --> 01:31:05,430
Yeah. Okay.

1631
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,683
[Honk]

1632
01:32:22,998 --> 01:32:23,918
Hello.

1633
01:32:23,995 --> 01:32:25,875
Hello. Is Karen there?

1634
01:32:25,951 --> 01:32:27,371
She...

1635
01:32:28,905 --> 01:32:30,325
Bill.

1636
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:31,821
Hello.

1637
01:32:31,859 --> 01:32:33,278
Is Karen there?

1638
01:32:33,355 --> 01:32:35,235
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1639
01:32:35,273 --> 01:32:37,690
I'm a friend of hers.

1640
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:39,723
[Father]
Karen's dead.

1641
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,219
What? What?

1642
01:32:41,258 --> 01:32:42,754
[Man]
She killed herself.

1643
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:53,418
[Karen's Voice]
Let's have the best Christmas ever.

1644
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:57,715
We can. You know.

1645
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:00,093
We could have
the best year...

1646
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:01,551
of our whole lives.

1647
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:08,494
Get the sail down!

1648
01:33:08,571 --> 01:33:10,489
Keep it starboard!

1649
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:14,210
Get the sail down!

1650
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:15,400
Starboard!

1651
01:33:18,353 --> 01:33:19,773
Keep trying!

1652
01:33:19,849 --> 01:33:21,883
I can't! Let it out!

1653
01:33:24,606 --> 01:33:26,524
Let it out!

1654
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,174
Just keep it starboard!

1655
01:33:28,251 --> 01:33:29,632
I can't!

1656
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:34,657
Ahh!

1657
01:33:36,997 --> 01:33:38,263
Bucky!

1658
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,836
Give me your hand!

1659
01:33:43,557 --> 01:33:44,900
We screwed up. Buddy!

1660
01:33:44,938 --> 01:33:47,201
Dad's gonna haul ass over this!

1661
01:33:47,278 --> 01:33:49,733
It ain't so goddamned funny!

1662
01:33:53,339 --> 01:33:54,375
Don't let go!

1663
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:56,331
I won't. Buck!

1664
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,249
Everything will be okay!

1665
01:34:01,357 --> 01:34:02,584
Hang on. Brother!

1666
01:34:02,661 --> 01:34:04,119
Don't let go!

1667
01:34:04,195 --> 01:34:05,692
Stay with me!

1668
01:34:05,768 --> 01:34:07,226
Stay with me!

1669
01:34:07,303 --> 01:34:09,988
Stay with me!

1670
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:15,167
Oh. God!

1671
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:19,655
Bucky!

1672
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:22,072
Buck!

1673
01:34:23,338 --> 01:34:25,064
Buck!

1674
01:34:29,668 --> 01:34:30,627
[Berger]
Hello.

1675
01:34:30,703 --> 01:34:32,161
This is Conrad.

1676
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:33,619
What's going on?

1677
01:34:33,696 --> 01:34:35,575
I need to see you.

1678
01:34:35,652 --> 01:34:37,033
Where are you?

1679
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,606
I don't know.

1680
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:40,064
All right.

1681
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:42,020
Get to the office.

1682
01:34:42,058 --> 01:34:43,439
I'll meet you there.

1683
01:34:43,516 --> 01:34:44,705
Okay.

1684
01:34:48,733 --> 01:34:51,112
Good. You're here.

1685
01:34:51,188 --> 01:34:52,569
Something happened.

1686
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:54,027
Just a minute.

1687
01:34:54,104 --> 01:34:56,482
Wait till we get inside.

1688
01:34:58,554 --> 01:34:59,436
There.

1689
01:35:00,971 --> 01:35:02,467
Shit.

1690
01:35:02,505 --> 01:35:06,073
You'd think they'd assume
there'd be emergencies.

1691
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:07,914
Don't take it off.
Just sit down.

1692
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:13,361
Something happened.

1693
01:35:13,438 --> 01:35:14,436
What?

1694
01:35:14,512 --> 01:35:15,855
It's...

1695
01:35:15,932 --> 01:35:17,274
It's what?

1696
01:35:17,351 --> 01:35:18,732
Oh. God!

1697
01:35:20,267 --> 01:35:21,763
I need something.

1698
01:35:21,839 --> 01:35:22,913
What?

1699
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:24,410
It keeps coming.

1700
01:35:24,486 --> 01:35:26,289
I can't stop it!

1701
01:35:26,366 --> 01:35:27,900
Don't try.

1702
01:35:27,977 --> 01:35:30,394
Got to get off the hook.

1703
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:32,005
For what?

1704
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:34,077
What I did to him!

1705
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,228
What?

1706
01:35:35,304 --> 01:35:37,644
It must be somebody's fault...

1707
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:39,793
or there's no point!

1708
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:41,787
What point? It happened!

1709
01:35:41,864 --> 01:35:44,780
Oh. No. I don't mean that.

1710
01:35:44,856 --> 01:35:46,276
It's just that...

1711
01:35:46,352 --> 01:35:48,769
Bucky. I didn't mean it.

1712
01:35:48,846 --> 01:35:51,723
Bucky, I didn't mean it.

1713
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:53,526
Bucky!

1714
01:35:53,603 --> 01:35:54,562
It wasn't your fault.

1715
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,863
You said. "Get the sail down!"

1716
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,973
I couldn't! It jammed!

1717
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,661
And then the halyard jammed!

1718
01:36:00,738 --> 01:36:02,579
Because the goddamned
halyard jammed!

1719
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,456
Then you're sittin' here
screwing around!

1720
01:36:05,533 --> 01:36:07,183
Until it's too late!

1721
01:36:07,259 --> 01:36:10,290
And I'm supposed
to take care of it!

1722
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:11,518
That wasn't fair.

1723
01:36:11,594 --> 01:36:14,395
No! And then
you say. "Hang on!"

1724
01:36:14,471 --> 01:36:15,507
"Hang on!"

1725
01:36:15,584 --> 01:36:17,157
Then you let go!

1726
01:36:17,195 --> 01:36:18,691
Why'd you let go?

1727
01:36:18,768 --> 01:36:19,957
I got tired!

1728
01:36:20,034 --> 01:36:22,566
Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!

1729
01:36:34,535 --> 01:36:37,795
It hurts to be mad at him.

1730
01:36:37,872 --> 01:36:39,253
Yeah.

1731
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,396
He just wasn't careful.

1732
01:36:43,434 --> 01:36:47,194
He didn't see how
a bad thing might happen.

1733
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:50,877
Bad things happen even
when people are careful.

1734
01:36:50,953 --> 01:36:52,795
We should've come in...

1735
01:36:52,871 --> 01:36:55,365
when it started to look bad.

1736
01:36:55,403 --> 01:36:57,667
So you made a mistake.

1737
01:36:57,743 --> 01:36:59,930
Why did he let go?

1738
01:37:00,007 --> 01:37:01,426
Why?

1739
01:37:01,503 --> 01:37:04,418
Maybe you were stronger.

1740
01:37:04,495 --> 01:37:07,602
Did that ever occur to you?

1741
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:18,113
How long will you
punish yourself?

1742
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:19,264
When will you quit?

1743
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:20,952
I'd like to.

1744
01:37:21,029 --> 01:37:22,295
Why don't you?

1745
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:24,980
It's not that easy.

1746
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,691
God...

1747
01:37:32,767 --> 01:37:34,647
I loved him.

1748
01:37:38,637 --> 01:37:40,517
I know.

1749
01:37:54,442 --> 01:37:57,511
What happened?
What started all this?

1750
01:37:57,587 --> 01:37:59,007
Karen.

1751
01:38:00,733 --> 01:38:02,920
She killed herself.

1752
01:38:02,996 --> 01:38:05,912
I just found out she's dead.

1753
01:38:05,989 --> 01:38:07,945
Jesus.

1754
01:38:08,022 --> 01:38:10,132
She was fine.

1755
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:12,433
No. She wasn't.

1756
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,848
She told me!
She said she was...

1757
01:38:15,924 --> 01:38:16,845
What?

1758
01:38:16,922 --> 01:38:19,569
She was busy and
feeling good and...

1759
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:20,643
What?

1760
01:38:22,331 --> 01:38:23,482
What?

1761
01:38:23,558 --> 01:38:24,901
If I'd known...

1762
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:26,397
I could've done something.

1763
01:38:26,474 --> 01:38:29,159
You're taking her on. Too?

1764
01:38:29,197 --> 01:38:30,118
No!

1765
01:38:30,156 --> 01:38:31,077
No?

1766
01:38:31,115 --> 01:38:32,535
No. I just...

1767
01:38:32,612 --> 01:38:33,494
What?

1768
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:34,952
That isn't it.

1769
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:37,982
I feel really bad about this.

1770
01:38:38,059 --> 01:38:41,243
Just let me feel bad about this!

1771
01:38:42,355 --> 01:38:43,621
Okay.

1772
01:38:45,808 --> 01:38:48,954
Listen. I feel
bad about it. Too.

1773
01:38:52,828 --> 01:38:55,245
Why do things
happen to people?

1774
01:38:55,322 --> 01:38:57,623
It isn't fair.

1775
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:00,270
You're right.
It isn't fair.

1776
01:39:00,347 --> 01:39:02,649
You just do one wrong thing...

1777
01:39:02,725 --> 01:39:04,106
and...

1778
01:39:04,183 --> 01:39:06,677
Um-hmm.

1779
01:39:06,753 --> 01:39:10,436
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1780
01:39:17,111 --> 01:39:18,530
You know.

1781
01:39:30,998 --> 01:39:32,686
You know.

1782
01:39:35,563 --> 01:39:37,404
I hung on.

1783
01:39:37,481 --> 01:39:40,473
I stayed with the boat.

1784
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,084
Exactly.

1785
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:51,406
Now. You can live
with that. Can't you?

1786
01:39:57,314 --> 01:39:59,194
I'm scared!

1787
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:01,380
I'm scared.

1788
01:40:01,419 --> 01:40:03,567
Feelings are scary.

1789
01:40:03,644 --> 01:40:05,638
And sometimes they're painful.

1790
01:40:05,715 --> 01:40:07,902
If you can't feel pain...

1791
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:10,817
you won't feel
anything else.

1792
01:40:10,894 --> 01:40:13,388
You know what I'm saying?

1793
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:17,876
I think so.

1794
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:22,364
You're here. You're alive.

1795
01:40:22,441 --> 01:40:25,126
Don't say you don't feel that.

1796
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:27,313
It doesn't feel good.

1797
01:40:27,389 --> 01:40:28,771
It is good.

1798
01:40:28,809 --> 01:40:30,228
Believe me.

1799
01:40:34,448 --> 01:40:36,251
How do you know?

1800
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:40,356
Because I'm your friend.

1801
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:47,760
I don't know
what I would've done...

1802
01:40:47,836 --> 01:40:50,176
if you hadn't been here.

1803
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:56,199
You're really my friend?

1804
01:40:58,232 --> 01:41:00,918
I am. Count on it.

1805
01:41:51,516 --> 01:41:52,898
Hi.

1806
01:41:52,974 --> 01:41:54,317
I would've called...

1807
01:41:54,394 --> 01:41:57,194
but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

1808
01:41:57,271 --> 01:41:58,652
About the other night...

1809
01:41:58,728 --> 01:42:01,069
I liked being with you.

1810
01:42:01,107 --> 01:42:03,447
I didn't like myself.

1811
01:42:03,524 --> 01:42:05,365
Conrad. I was stupid.

1812
01:42:05,442 --> 01:42:08,242
That was dumb of me to laugh.

1813
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:10,160
It was my fault.

1814
01:42:10,237 --> 01:42:12,193
I was embarrassed.

1815
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:13,383
Really?

1816
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:15,109
You were embarrassed?

1817
01:42:15,186 --> 01:42:17,334
When those boys came in...

1818
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:19,789
it was awful and awkward.

1819
01:42:19,866 --> 01:42:22,052
When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.

1820
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:25,275
They were just having
a good time.

1821
01:42:25,351 --> 01:42:29,149
I let them interfere
with what was happening.

1822
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,607
It was dumb.

1823
01:42:30,684 --> 01:42:34,060
I've done lots of
dumb things lately.

1824
01:42:34,136 --> 01:42:38,663
I just didn't know if you were
being straight with me.

1825
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,074
Yeah?

1826
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:46,374
Anyway. I'd like
to try it again.

1827
01:42:46,412 --> 01:42:47,793
It worked okay...

1828
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,903
except for the bowling.

1829
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,399
Yes.

1830
01:42:51,437 --> 01:42:53,240
Yes?

1831
01:42:54,314 --> 01:42:56,271
Yes.

1832
01:42:57,307 --> 01:42:59,685
Are you going to school?

1833
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:02,485
No. Not on Sunday.

1834
01:43:05,209 --> 01:43:07,127
Have you eaten?

1835
01:43:07,204 --> 01:43:09,122
No. I haven't.

1836
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,539
Do you want some breakfast?

1837
01:43:13,419 --> 01:43:14,800
Okay.

1838
01:43:27,996 --> 01:43:29,223
Mom!

1839
01:43:31,026 --> 01:43:33,290
All right.
How about that?

1840
01:43:33,367 --> 01:43:34,748
Boy. Oh. Boy.

1841
01:43:34,824 --> 01:43:36,704
I do love that.

1842
01:43:36,781 --> 01:43:39,619
These holes sure do love you.

1843
01:43:39,696 --> 01:43:43,532
We should spend more time
playing golf together.

1844
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:46,448
Maybe our next vacation...
strictly golf.

1845
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:47,944
Pinehurst.
Myrtle Beach.

1846
01:43:47,982 --> 01:43:49,900
Pinehurst would be nice.

1847
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:52,816
I think Connie would
like Pinehurst.

1848
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:56,192
Is that deliberate
or just a reflex?

1849
01:43:56,268 --> 01:43:59,146
I assumed you meant him. Too.

1850
01:43:59,222 --> 01:44:02,061
I'm surprised you
haven't called him.

1851
01:44:02,138 --> 01:44:04,017
I'll call him tonight.

1852
01:44:04,094 --> 01:44:06,971
Can we have a little drink?

1853
01:44:07,048 --> 01:44:08,928
Drink. Yes. Little. No.

1854
01:44:09,004 --> 01:44:10,385
Let's finish this.

1855
01:44:10,462 --> 01:44:11,345
What?

1856
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:12,841
What you started.

1857
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:14,797
Me? There's no point.

1858
01:44:14,835 --> 01:44:16,255
He controls you.

1859
01:44:16,332 --> 01:44:18,211
He isn't the problem.

1860
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,669
Isn't he?

1861
01:44:19,746 --> 01:44:23,006
No. Let's talk about
what's bothering you.

1862
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:25,922
No. Let's discuss
what's bothering you.

1863
01:44:25,999 --> 01:44:29,835
How did I make you
so angry with me?

1864
01:44:29,912 --> 01:44:32,290
You blame me
for everything.

1865
01:44:32,328 --> 01:44:34,707
Can't you see
beyond yourself?

1866
01:44:34,783 --> 01:44:36,203
No. I can't!

1867
01:44:36,241 --> 01:44:39,118
Neither can you
or anybody else!

1868
01:44:39,195 --> 01:44:40,576
I'm just honest.

1869
01:44:40,653 --> 01:44:42,034
Stop being honest...

1870
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:43,990
and start being generous!

1871
01:44:44,067 --> 01:44:45,448
Think about him!

1872
01:44:45,525 --> 01:44:48,363
What does he expect from me?

1873
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:52,276
He wants a hug
when he passes exams?

1874
01:44:52,353 --> 01:44:55,230
I can't respond
when someone says...

1875
01:44:55,307 --> 01:44:58,146
"I did something
great. Love me."

1876
01:44:58,222 --> 01:45:02,020
He wants to know
you don't hate him.

1877
01:45:02,097 --> 01:45:04,514
Mothers don't hate their sons.

1878
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,429
Is that what he told you?

1879
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:11,304
You accept what he says
with no questions.

1880
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:14,258
I'm trying to
keep this family...

1881
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:17,173
What does everyone
want from me?

1882
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:21,508
Listen. We all just
want you to be happy.

1883
01:45:21,546 --> 01:45:22,966
Happy?

1884
01:45:23,042 --> 01:45:23,963
Yes.

1885
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,569
You tell me
the definition of happy.

1886
01:45:27,646 --> 01:45:30,791
First. Be sure your kids are safe...

1887
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:34,206
that nobody's been hit by a car...

1888
01:45:34,282 --> 01:45:37,121
or drowned in your swimming pool!

1889
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,574
Then tell me how to be happy!

1890
01:46:31,901 --> 01:46:34,280
I'm turning in.

1891
01:46:34,318 --> 01:46:35,738
Dinner was good.

1892
01:46:35,814 --> 01:46:37,195
Really good.

1893
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:39,612
It's early. You tired?

1894
01:46:39,689 --> 01:46:41,837
It was a rough week.

1895
01:46:41,914 --> 01:46:45,481
Your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you?

1896
01:46:45,558 --> 01:46:47,438
No. She was fine.

1897
01:46:49,931 --> 01:46:52,348
I'm glad you're back.

1898
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,501
Good night.

1899
01:48:23,073 --> 01:48:27,293
[Sobbing]

1900
01:48:33,738 --> 01:48:35,119
Calvin?

1901
01:48:46,589 --> 01:48:48,392
Why are you crying?

1902
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:56,371
Can I. Uh...

1903
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:58,826
Can I get you something?

1904
01:49:00,821 --> 01:49:02,241
I don't...

1905
01:49:02,317 --> 01:49:04,197
What did you say?

1906
01:49:08,187 --> 01:49:10,373
Calvin. What did you say?

1907
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:11,908
[Sighing]

1908
01:49:14,746 --> 01:49:16,856
Tell me.

1909
01:49:23,224 --> 01:49:24,644
You are beautiful.

1910
01:49:28,096 --> 01:49:30,475
And you are unpredictable.

1911
01:49:32,508 --> 01:49:34,388
But you're so cautious.

1912
01:49:36,881 --> 01:49:38,262
You're determined. Beth...

1913
01:49:38,339 --> 01:49:40,372
but you know something?

1914
01:49:42,597 --> 01:49:44,131
You're not strong.

1915
01:49:46,126 --> 01:49:49,272
I don't know
if you're really giving.

1916
01:49:52,302 --> 01:49:53,760
Tell me something.

1917
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:55,832
Do you love me?

1918
01:49:57,865 --> 01:50:00,205
Do you really love me?

1919
01:50:02,507 --> 01:50:06,151
I feel the way I've always
felt about you.

1920
01:50:18,273 --> 01:50:20,652
We would've been all right...

1921
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:24,066
if there hadn't been any mess.

1922
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,979
But you can't handle mess.

1923
01:50:29,513 --> 01:50:32,812
You need everything neat and easy.

1924
01:50:33,886 --> 01:50:35,306
I don't know.

1925
01:50:35,344 --> 01:50:37,723
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1926
01:50:37,799 --> 01:50:40,139
It was so much Buck.

1927
01:50:40,216 --> 01:50:45,011
It's as if you buried
all your love with him.

1928
01:50:45,088 --> 01:50:46,968
I don't understand that.

1929
01:50:48,502 --> 01:50:51,840
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

1930
01:50:51,916 --> 01:50:54,218
Maybe it was just you.

1931
01:50:54,295 --> 01:50:59,704
Maybe, finally, it was
the best of you that you buried.

1932
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,077
But whatever it was...

1933
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:10,407
I don't know who you are.

1934
01:51:10,445 --> 01:51:14,780
I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1935
01:51:17,273 --> 01:51:19,307
So I was crying.

1936
01:51:23,641 --> 01:51:27,554
Because I don't know
if I love you anymore.

1937
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:34,766
And I don't know
what I'll do without that.

1938
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:01,770
[Door Slams]

1939
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,886
Dad?

1940
01:54:03,993 --> 01:54:06,870
The yard looks smaller
without leaves.

1941
01:54:08,366 --> 01:54:09,785
Dad. What happened?

1942
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:15,156
Your mother's
going away for a while.

1943
01:54:15,233 --> 01:54:16,345
Where?

1944
01:54:16,422 --> 01:54:17,573
Why?

1945
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:19,069
Back to Houston.

1946
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:21,486
I don't know.

1947
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,941
Why? What...

1948
01:54:25,936 --> 01:54:27,355
I know why.

1949
01:54:27,432 --> 01:54:29,312
It's me. Isn't it?

1950
01:54:29,388 --> 01:54:30,309
No.

1951
01:54:30,347 --> 01:54:31,728
It's my fault.

1952
01:54:31,805 --> 01:54:33,992
Don't do that to yourself!

1953
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:35,411
It's nobody's fault!

1954
01:54:35,488 --> 01:54:38,748
Things happen.
People don't always have answers.

1955
01:54:42,393 --> 01:54:46,037
I don't know why
I'm yelling at you.

1956
01:54:46,114 --> 01:54:49,068
You should do
that more often.

1957
01:54:49,144 --> 01:54:50,794
Haul my ass a little.

1958
01:54:50,871 --> 01:54:52,252
Get after me.

1959
01:54:54,477 --> 01:54:56,241
Like you did for him.

1960
01:54:56,395 --> 01:54:57,776
He needed it.

1961
01:54:57,853 --> 01:54:58,735
You didn't.

1962
01:54:58,812 --> 01:55:01,612
You were always
so hard on yourself.

1963
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:03,914
I never had the heart.

1964
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:06,407
Oh. Dad. Don't.

1965
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:08,632
Well. It's the truth.

1966
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,660
I never worried about you.

1967
01:55:12,737 --> 01:55:15,537
I just wasn't listening.

1968
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:18,760
I wasn't sending
many signals then.

1969
01:55:18,836 --> 01:55:20,678
You couldn't do anything.

1970
01:55:20,716 --> 01:55:24,130
I should've got
a handle on it somehow.

1971
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:32,838
I used to figure you had
a handle for everything.

1972
01:55:32,877 --> 01:55:35,025
You knew it all.

1973
01:55:35,102 --> 01:55:38,938
You always made us feel
everything would be all right.

1974
01:55:39,974 --> 01:55:42,812
I've thought about that
a lot lately.

1975
01:55:42,889 --> 01:55:45,229
I really admire you for it.

1976
01:55:45,306 --> 01:55:47,224
Don't admire people too much.

1977
01:55:47,301 --> 01:55:50,255
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1978
01:55:51,367 --> 01:55:53,132
I'm not disappointed.

1979
01:55:56,201 --> 01:55:58,656
I love you.

1980
01:56:04,026 --> 01:56:05,407
I love you. Too.
