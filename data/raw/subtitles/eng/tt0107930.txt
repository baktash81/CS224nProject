The Kelly Gang had been
holding up banks

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,999
for as long as, well, for as
long as there'd been banks.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Historically, we were
the World's First Biker Gang.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,499
What really set us apart
from all the other outlaws

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,999
was our philosophy.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,999
We always gave everything
we stole to the poor.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,499
My uncle Dan had been the
most notorious aboriginal outlaw

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,999
of all time,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,499
until he retired to run the family pub.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,999
My brother job was
the Gang's tax expert,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,499
and the rest of the Gang
worked full-time

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,300
in the manufacture
and consumption of beer.

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,300

of the once world-famous Kelly Gang

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,499
had been reduced to just one man...

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,550

We lived in this wild pub.

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,499
It was so old that no one was sure

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,999
if it was actually built

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,499
or just somehow
grew out of the ground.

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,999
Over the years, it has become home

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,499
to every kind of wildlife
you can imagine.

Apart from my dog,

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,499
my bike was my best mate.

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,999
I personally built it
from the wheels up

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,499
out of scrap metal.

68
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,999
Sure, it had some
minor structural problems.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,499
It wasn't exactly mechanically perfect,

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,999
but everyone respected it.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,300
Especially Joe.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Morning, Dan.

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,300
Morning, Ned.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,499
It is refueled.

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Thanks, Joe.

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,800
You still haven't fixed
that leaking pump.

77
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,800
Have now.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,300
Ooh!

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,300
See yourself.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,999
Our pub was on the shore
of a national park,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,499
hundreds of miles from anywhere.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,999
I reckon it was as close to paradise

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
as you can get.

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,499
Riding to work that day,

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,800
nothing seemed different
from any other day.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,300
At least that's what
I thought at the time.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,999
Good morning.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,499
It's a .44.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,499
Check out the dickhead
talking to a machine.

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,999
That's no dickhead.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,300
That's Ned Kelly.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Oh, yeah!

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,800
I don't think so.

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,300
Ouch. Computer malfunction.

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,520
Bingo.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
This is the Kelly Gang...

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,300
And I'd like to make a deposit.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,300
Deposit?

99
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
Yeah. Deposit this money

100
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,499
amongst the bank accounts of any
people who can't repay their loans.

101
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,499
And I want receipts,
and I want 'em now.

102
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,300
Oui. Oui.
I will get all the staff onto it.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,800
All officers, take your positions.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
It was then I heard something

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
you rarely hear in the
middle of a bank robbery...

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,499
Shakespeare.

107
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,800
"If music be the food of love,

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,800
play on. Give me excess of it."

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,499
"If music be the food of love..."

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,999
And who are you?

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,999
Robin Banks.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
I was earlier. Now I'm depositin'.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,999
This is my lunch break.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,300
I love american accents.

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,999
Excuse me.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,499
I like the way you talk.

117
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,300
In fact, I like everything
about America.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,999
What you reading?

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,999
Shakespeare.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,999
I hate flies.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,999
Mr. Kelly, all the people's receipts.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Thanks, mate.

123
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,800
This time he's trapped.

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,999
Hey...

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,300
maybe I'll see you later.

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,800
I doubt it, cowboy.

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,800
Bye, Ned.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800

but I'd just triggered
off a chain of events

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,999
that was to threaten
the very existence

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,499
of the Kelly Gang.

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,999
"...cannot see the pretty fall
leaves that themselves commit,

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,999
or if they could,
Cupid himself would blush."

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,999
The outlaw

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,499
dropped this.

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Take it to Sir John's office immediately.

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,999
Ned Kelly has robbed
yet another branch

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,999
of the International Trust Bank,

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,499
but this time his target
was head office.

165
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,499
The bank's largest foreign investors

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,999
have responded by
threatening to pack up

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,499
and go home.

168
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,999
However, locals are
reacting quite differently.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,999
Ned Kelly's deadly. He's great.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
He's wonderful.

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,999
He's fabulous.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,999
He gives us the cash.

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,499
He's got a great bike.

174
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,999
Since Ned Kelly has
been depositing money

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,999
in our bank account,

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,999
I can afford more groceries.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,300
Look.

178
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,499
Through the haphazard program

179
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,499
of redistributing money,

180
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,499
the Kelly Gang has effectively

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,499
lowered interest rates, cut inflation,

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,999
and raised the standard of living

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,499
for the average family.

184
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
Rotten bastards.

185
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,499
It's been Ned Kelly's complete
disregard for authority

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,999
that has captured
the Hearts of the People

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
and made him something
of a national hero.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
Yes?

189
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,999
Sir John, one of our young tellers

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,499
has some information
regarding the robbery.

191
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,300
What is it?

192
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,800
Apparently this was
dropped during the holdup.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
Oh, Sir John.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,999
There's also a Major Wib
here to see you.

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes. Come in.

196
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,999
Major Wib from Great Britain, sir.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,499
Formerly of Her Majesty's
personal guards.

198
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,999
Five years Scotland Yard,

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,999
three years Royal British Commandos.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,999
Served with distinction special
forces-- intelligence branch.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,999
At your service,
Vis-a-vis the Kelly problem.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,499
That's very impressive, Major.

203
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,999
Thank you, Sir John.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,499
I had the pleasure of being
on duty at Buckingham Palace

205
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,499
the day you got your knighthood.

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,300
Oh, really?

207
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,999
Yes. Rah-rah poo-poo, sir.

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,499
It's about time we had a man

209
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,499
of your particular talents
working exclusively for us

210
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,499
in the field of corporate banking.

211
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,999
If you'll pardon the pun, sir,

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,800
I plan to make a killing.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Thank you. That'll be all.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Please, Major.

215
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,800
Now, what do you make of this?

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a toweling mat,

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,999
commonly used on the top
of Australian hotel bars

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,800
for the absorption of beer spillage.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,499
Looks like some sort of a rodent.

220
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,499
Is it a rat?

221
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,999
It's a kangaroo, sir.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,300
The Glenrowan Hotel.

223
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,999
It's in a national park
called Reckless Island.

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,499
No wonder the police
can't track them down.

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,800
According to this, it's
a remote wilderness.

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,499
Kelly would know that island
like the back of his hand.

227
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,999
At the first sign of armed aggression,

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,499
he'd vanish into the bush
and pick us off like flies.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,300
Yes, you're right.

230
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Major, the one thing
you'll learn in business

231
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,499
is that almost anything
can be achieved

232
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,999
by having good political connections.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Miss Twisty, draft a confidential fax

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
to the department of national parks.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Tell them that the bank will be acting

236
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,800
as the Sole Agent for the
sale of Reckless Island.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,999
Right away, Sir John.

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,499
You can't sell a national park.

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,800
Wib?

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,499
I'm going to turn Kelly's hideout

241
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,300
into a... japanese tourist resort.

242
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,300
♪ Met down by the jetty landing ♪

243
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,300

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,499
For a Kelly, getting shot
was an occupational hazard.

252
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,999
But I guess over the years
we must have developed

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,999
some sort of natural tolerance.

254
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,499
Unfortunately, I still had to spend

255
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,800
a heck of a lot of time
digging out bullets.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,999
Good morning, ma'am.

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,499
How may the bank help you?

258
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm taking out a loan.

259
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,300
It's the Hollywood Outlaw!

261
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,499
Aah!

262
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,499
Don't kill me.

263
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,999
I've never killed anyone.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,499
I only shoot guns

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,999
from the hands of those who would...

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,499
Prefer to see me dead.

267
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,800
Now, hand over the money.

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,300
I've got some shopping to do.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Freeze, lady!
Stay right where you are!

270
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,999
I regret the day

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,499
I let you put a video store here.

272
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,300
All you and that dog ever do

273
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
is watch that same dumb movie.

274
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,999
Hey! We were watching that.

275
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,499
I'm getting shot to pieces,
and for what?

276
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,499
We got the biggest turnover
of any bank robbers around

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,999
and we still can't afford
to fix the pub.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,999
Using stolen money for our own benefit

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,999
would be against every principle

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,300
upon which the Kelly Gang
was founded.

281
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,300
Ohh...

282
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,999
Dan was right, of course.

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,499
The robbing from the rich
and giving to the poor

284
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,999
wasn't easy like in Robin Hood's day.

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,499
I could use help with the stamps.

286
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,499
I used to deposit so much money

287
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,999
in so many people's bank accounts,

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,300
we could spend all afternoon
mailing out receipts.

289
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,499
Oh, look.

290
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,300
I been shot in the lung again.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,499
Of course, that was nothing

292
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,800
compared with my dad.

293
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,999
He was still listed

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,499
in the guinness book of world records

295
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,800
as the world's most
frequently shot human being.

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,300
You're very lucky.

297
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,800
You've got your father's
bulletproof constitution.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,999
A little lower, I think, Uncle Dan.

299
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,999
That's it.

300
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,499
OK. Ready?

301
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,499
Yep.

302
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,300
Band-aids.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,999
Ah, thanks.

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,300
Whew!

305
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,999
I gotta do something

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,999
about getting shot all the time.

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,499
And there it was--

308
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,300
a bulletproof garbage can.

309
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
- Aah!
- Aah!

310
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,999
Come on, Ned. It's happy hour.

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,999
Pass the beer.

312
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,499
Hurry up, Ned.

313
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,800
Banks close at 5:00, you know.

314
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Morning, Dog.

315
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,800
Ready?

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,499
Corn flakes.

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,499
No, fella.

318
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,999
Corn...

319
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,300
flakes.

320
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,499
Corn flakes.

321
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,499
Come on.

322
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,499
Talk.

323
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,999
Keep practicing.

324
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,800
Heh.

325
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
Mr. Kelly.

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,499
- Yes!   - Yes!
- Yes!

327
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,999
We're all Kellys, mate.

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,499
You have a letter.

329
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,999
A letter?

330
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,800
A letter?

331
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,499
"The International Trust Bank

332
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
"will be acting as Sole
Agent for the sale of...

333
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,499
Reckless Island."

334
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
- What?
- What?

335
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,499
According to this document,

336
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,999
our island is going to
be relocated to...

337
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,999
Tokyo Bay, Japan.

338
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,300
What?

339
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,499
I loathe this weather.

340
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,999
I loathe this country.

341
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Quite right, Sir John.

342
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Ah, for a cold, Foggy,
drizzly english morning, eh?

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,300
I reckon this flag needs
a slight modification.

344
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
What the hell's going on in here?

345
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,300
That's the British flag!

346
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,999
Take it back to Britain.

347
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,499
You're a larrikin, Kelly.

348
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,800
You have absolutely
no respect for authority.

349
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,800
You're not selling our island.

350
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,499
There's obviously an informer

351
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,300
working somewhere in the bank.

352
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,800
Hmm?

353
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,499
Well, they won't be
working here for long.

354
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,999
We've brought in
every birth certificate

355
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,800
of every Kelly who was
born on Reckless Island.

356
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,800
Yeah.

357
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,499
They go back quite a long way.

358
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,300
It proves that the Kellys
have lived there

359
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,300
in one form or another

360
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,800
for at least 40,000 years.

361
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,999
The first person

362
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
to land on the island

363
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,300
was an aborigine named Awaba Kelly.

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,499
This here's his birth certificate.

365
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,300
So what.

366
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,499
That makes Reckless Island

367
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,300
Kelly Tribal Land.

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,499
So us Kellys legally have
first right of purchase.

369
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,999
Fine, but... you'll have to match

370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,999
the japanese offer of $1 million.

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,999
No problem.

372
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,999
Oh, really?

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,999
You'll never raise the cash.

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,999
Aren't you forgetting something, mate?

375
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,999
The Kelly Gang robs banks.

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,999
Yes, but the Kelly Gang

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,300
gives all its money to the poor.

378
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,300
Ahem.

379
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,999
We were in deep trouble, all right,

380
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,999
so we headed to the Brewery

381
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,499
to do some thinking.

382
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,800
It was there that I found out

383
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
this wasn't the first time

384
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,800
Reckless Island had been under threat.

385
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,300
Legend has it

386
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,300
that it's about an ancient battle

387
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,499
in which the first inhabitants
saved the island

388
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,499
from evil invaders.

389
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,499
No kidding.

390
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,800
It's all part of aboriginal mythology--

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,300
you know, Ned-- the dreaming.

392
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,800
I suppose it doesn't make any sense

393
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
in the modern world.

394
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,800
If we could make it make sense,

395
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
maybe everything that
doesn't make sense

396
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,499
would make sense, eh?

397
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,999
Ah, you do enough dreaming

398
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,300
for everyone around here.

399
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,499
Slept in again, eh?

400
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,499
Yes. He was up all night.

401
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,300
I think he was building something.

402
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,300
♪ Wild thing ♪

403
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,800
♪ You make my heart sing ♪

404
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,999
♪ You make everything groovy ♪

405
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,300
♪ Oh, wild thing, yes ♪

406
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,999
What are you doing with
that can on your head?

407
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,999
I'm going bank robbing.

408
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,999
You go robbing a bank in
that garbage can outfit.

409
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,499
You'll wreck the entire image

410
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,499
of the Kelly Gang.

411
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,800
What are you wearing it for?

412
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,800
So I don't get shot. Aah!

413
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,999
With a bulletproof armor suit,

414
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,999
I can rob a lot of bank real fast

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
and buy the island back.

416
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,499
Any money the Kelly Gang
gets in this country.

417
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,499
Belongs to the people of this country.

418
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,999
Why don't we rob banks
in another country?

419
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,999
I'm telling you, for an outlaw,

420
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,300
America is the land of opportunity.

421
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,999
Even a little kid knows

422
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,300
that in America
when people rob banks.

423
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,499
They get to keep all
the money themselves.

424
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,999
You've been looking
at too many movies.

425
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,999
Look, there's only one
way to save this island.

426
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,800
It's called Free Enterprise.

427
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,999
Suddenly, I was on
my way to the USA,

428
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,499
home of bank-robbing legends

429
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,800
like Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde,

430
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
and the Hollywood Outlaw.

431
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,300
Uh...

432
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,300
What's the purpose of your
trip to the United States?

433
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,800
Business.

434
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,800
Hold your fire!

435
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Your accountants had hidden talents.

436
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,499
So, what's this big discovery of yours?

437
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,800
Ned Kelly has left the gang

438
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,999
and gone to America.

439
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,999
Why would he go there?

440
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Money.

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,300
Yes, of course.

442
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,499
He's out of steal the million dollars

443
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,999
to buy Reckless Island himself.

444
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,300
Now he's all alone
in a foreign country.

445
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,800
Think I'll pay him a visit.

446
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,499
Be careful! You mustn't
use a gun yourself.

447
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,999
We're an International Bank.

448
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,999
We can't afford to be
incriminated in America.

449
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,800
That's right.
I'm a bank executive now.

450
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,499
Does, uh...

451
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,499
that mean I get to fly
in the corporate jet?

452
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,800
"The lion, dying, thrusteth forth his paw

453
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
"and wounds the Earth,

454
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,999
"nothing else with rage
to be o'erpowered.

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,999
"And wilt thou, pupil-like,
take the correction?

456
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,999
"Mildly kiss the rod

457
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,999
"and fawn on rage with base humility,

458
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,999
which art alive..."

459
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,300
"in the king of beasts?"

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,999
"Good night, good night,

461
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,499
parting is such sweet Sorrow."

462
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,800
Sorrow.

463
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,999
Such sweet Sorrow.

464
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,499
"Parting is such sweet Sorrow.

465
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,499
Good night. Good night."

466
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,300
G'day.

467
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,999
What are you doing here?

468
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm going to America.

469
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,999
What for?

470
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,999
Rob a few banks.

471
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,499
They say guys who carry guns

472
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,800
have a serious personality deficiency.

473
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Huh?

474
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,999
It's a prop, a tool, a crutch.

475
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,499
If you know anything
about bank robbing,

476
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,800
you'd know you need a gun.

477
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,300
Lucky this seat was empty, eh?

478
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,800
What are you doing up here, anyway?

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,499
Actually, I got fired

480
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,499
for trying to save an island.

481
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,300
No kidding.

482
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,999
That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

483
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,499
Someone from your bank

484
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,999
sent us a copy of a fax which--

485
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,800
It was you.

486
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,499
Thanks.

487
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
You're welcome.

488
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,999
Nice pair of dolphins.

489
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Hmm?

490
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,499
Uh, yeah. I think I'll go
back to my book now.

491
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,800
Look, I'm really sorry
you lost your job.

492
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,300
Well...

493
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,999
I wasn't cut out for banking anyway.

494
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,999
Maybe it was the best thing
that could have happened.

495
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,499
Hmm.

496
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,800
Looks like we're heading
to the same place.

497
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,499
Uh... no. No, um,

498
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,300
I'm changing planes in
LA, going on to England.

499
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,499
I'm auditioning for a new drama school

500
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,999
at Stratford-upon-avon.

501
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,499
Are you an actress?

502
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Well... someday.

503
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
Got a boyfriend?

504
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,999
Um, over the past few years,

505
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,300

Shakespeare for me was Norm.

506
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800

Drop the money, lady!

526
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
I'll cover you. Get on.

527
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,499
I'm not getting on that thing.
It's filthy.

528
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,300
Hey. That money's not real.

529
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,300
And that bank's not real.

530
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,999
Hang on.

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,499

533
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,499
Cut it, Lyle.

534
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,999
Cut!

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,999
Sorry. We'll have to
go again, everybody.

536
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,999
Can I...

537
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,999
have your autograph?

538
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,499
Mr. Delance!

539
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,999
I'm sorry, Chuck.

540
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,999
I have no idea how this happened.

541
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,999
Wait a minute.

542
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,800
You're a bloke.

543
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,999
Get those camera ready?

544
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,499
Rocket-head here rides up

545
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,499
and says, "Get on the bike."

546
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,499
Well, I'm an actor,

547
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,999
and that's a stuntman's job.

548
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,999
Hey. We'll shoot it over.

549
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,999
You're looking great, Chuck.

550
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,499
I can't perform anymore.
I'm just too upset.

551
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,499
Oh, for crying out loud.

552
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,999
I don't care who your agent is.

553
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
I'll see that you never work

554
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
in this town again.

555
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Who is this guy, anyway,

556
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,499
Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ?

557
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,300
The name's Kelly.

558
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,300
Ned Kelly.

559
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,499
I thought I must have
landed on another planet.

560
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,300
Banks weren't banks,
money wasn't money,

561
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,999
and my favorite actress
turned out to be a man.

562
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
To save Reckless Island,

563
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,800
I needed to find a real bank, and fast.

Check out the metal-head.

570
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,499
What are you, undercover cop?

571
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,800
Bank robber.

572
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,800
All right.

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,499
Ahem.

574
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,800
Good evening!

575
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,800
How may we help you... Masked Man?

576
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,499
Well, if you're the loan arranger,

577
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,800
just hand over a million bucks.

578
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
You're more than welcome
to what we've got.

579
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,499
We've got a weird one

580
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,999
holding up the Hollywood friendly bank.

581
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Throw it up on the big screen.

582
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,300
That's him.

583
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,300
But be very careful, Lieutenant.

584
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,999
The most dangerous place on Earth

585
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,999
is between Ned Kelly
and a bag of money.

586
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,499
Would you like a line of credit?

587
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,800
A credit account?

588
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,800
Credit card?

589
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,800
Cash.

590
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,300
Please, fill out this application form.

591
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,999
What for?

592
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,499
We don't get much call for cash.

593
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,800
We have to order some.

594
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,300
Sure I can't fix you up with plastic?

595
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,999
Sam, your dinner's ready.

596
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,800
But, Mom, it's a total fiasco.

597
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,999
This is where he shoots the guns

598
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,499
out fo the actors' hands,

599
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,999
with real bullets, for God's sake.

600
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,999
Those cops are supposed to be winning.

601
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,300
Look at that jerk.
He's ruined the Climax.

602
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,999
He screwed up the movie.

603
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,499
I like him.

604
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,800
What?

605
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,300
He's a damn sight better.

606
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,499
Than those ham actors you hire.

607
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,999
Get a load of Chuck.

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,300
Mr. Delance!

609
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,499
Are you sure this gentleman

610
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,800
is doing an unrehearsed performance?

611
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,999
Absolutely.

612
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,499
He's an animal.

613
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,999
That's what I thought.

614
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
You better sign him up.

615
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,499
Sign him up?

616
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,999
Of course. What did
you say his name was?

617
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,300
Uh... Kelly. Fred Kelly.

618
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,999
No, no, no. Ned Kelly.

619
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,499
Kelly. One of the great
show business names.

620
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,300
Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly.

621
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,300
No kidding.

622
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,499
I'd better find this guy

623
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,999
before some other studio nabs him.

624
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
How'd the bank robbery go?

625
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,300
He signed you up for
a credit card, right?

626
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,499
Right.

627
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,499
Listen, man,
I'll give you some free advice.

628
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,499
Forget that bank-robbing gig.

629
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,999
The best way to get rich quick

630
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,300
is do what all the
smart people are doing.

631
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,499

659
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,999
or you'll be wearing metal

662
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,499
Every person has the
right to bear arms.

663
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
Yeah.

664
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,800
You're about to be shot dead
on Nationwide television.

665
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,999
No TV network would stoop so low.

666
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,499
Welcome to News Kill, live.

667
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,999
I'm here on Hollywood Boulevard,

668
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,499
where some wacko with
a trash can on his head

669
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,499
is about to be blasted to
pieces by the Hollywood police,

670
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,499
right before your very eyes.

671
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,800
OK, men, don't take any chances.

672
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,999
Put two bullets apiece in his head,

673
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,499
then we'll break for doughnuts.

674
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,300
Hey, what's the problem, Officer?

675
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,999
This guy's an
international bank robber.

676
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,300
He's not a bank robber.
He's an actor.

677
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,499
Huh?

678
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,800
An actor?

679
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,300
OK, boys, he's just an actor.

680
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,300
Let's go.

681
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,499
An actor?

682
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,499
That's right. And legally,

683
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,300
Hollywood police can't shoot actors.

684
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,300
If the police start shooting actors,

685
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,300
then the studios will close down.

686
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,499
If that happens,
there's no more movies.

687
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,999
With no more movies,

688
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,300
people have got nothing to believe in.

689
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,999
Everyone gets depressed,

690
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,499
no one goes to work,

691
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,499
and the economy collapses.

692
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,499
Yes, yes. That's very sad.

693
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,999
Now find me some people

694
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,300
who can shoot actors.

695
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,999
I had to admit

696
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,999
that as an international bank robber,

697
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,300
I'd been a failure.

698
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,800
The only way to save the island now

699
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,300
was to pretend I was an actor.

700
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,800
Ned,

701
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,499
delance pictures is
into action movies--

702
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,499
you know, macho heroes, sex, violence.

703
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,499
High turnover.

704
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,300
Big profits.

705
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,499
The quality of our movies is so high

706
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,999
that they bypass the
theaters completely

707
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,499
and go straight to video.

708
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Wow!

709
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,300
Do you want to know the secret

710
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,999
to making big money in video rental?

711
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,999
The answer is one word--

712
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,499
guns.

713
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,499
You see, guns aren't just guns.

714
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,499
They're a...

715
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,999
Phallic symbol.

716
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,999
Yeah.

717
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,300
The bigger the gun,
the bigger the profit.

718
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,499
Now, I know what you're thinking.

719
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,999
Let me tell you what you're thinking.

720
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,499
You're thinking, how will
I turn a nobody like you

721
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,800
into a big star?

722
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,800
Well, it's simple.

723
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
We're going to build you

724
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,999
the biggest goddamn
gun in Hollywood.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,300
But, Sam, aren't you
forgetting something?

726
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,800
Over 60% of video renters are women.

727
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,999
Mom's right.

728
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,999
What the heck do the
women want to see?

729
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,999
Women want a love story.

730
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,499
A love story...

731
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,999
with a big gun.

732
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,499
Brilliant.

733
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,300
It's got everything.

734
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,499
Ned, to be a movie star here,

735
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,999
you have to talk like an american.

736
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,800
For a million bucks,
I'll talk like a martian.

737
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,499
A million bucks?

738
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
Hmm.

739
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,999
Tell you what I'll do.

740
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,499
When the movie's finished,

741
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,499
I'll pay you 1 million bucks.

742
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,499
You got a deal.

743
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,499
Mom, if we can just
find the right actress

744
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,800
to play opposite Ned...

745
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,499
then every lovesick couple,

746
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,800
every lonely guy and gal,

747
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,999
every family in America

748
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,499
will be saying, "Let's rent a video!"

749
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,999
It's going to be a great movie.

750
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,300
It's called...

751
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,800
The Christian Cowboy.

752
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,999
It's about a gunslinging stranger

753
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,499
who cleans up Las Vegas

754
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,499
and falls in love with a beautiful nun.

755
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,499
Look, I could be accepted

756
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,999
into the newest Shakespearean
drama school in England.

757
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,499
I won't throw that away

758
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,499
to be in some totally crass movie.

759
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,999
Bye. I got to run.

760
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,499
With your help, we can
buy Reckless Island

761
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,499
and save it from ecological disaster.

762
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,499
You mean...

763
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,499
if I do this movie with you,

764
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,499
it'll save your wilderness?

765
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,999
It's the only chance we've got.

766
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,999
Look,

767
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,300
the head of the studio told me

768
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,999
he's got the best writer in Hollywood

769
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,300
working on the script,

770
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,499
so it'll probably be like Shakespeare.

771
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,999
Christian Cowboy, take 1.

772
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,999

773

I repeat--

787
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,300
repent, sinners!

788
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,300
Jesus said...

789
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,800
gambling is Satan's tool.

790
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,499
Beware of the work of the devil,

791
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,800
or your souls will burn
in the fires of hell!

792
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Hey!

793
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,499
Look, dudes! Ha ha ha!

794
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,800
It's the Christian Cowboy!

795
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,999
Hah!

796
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,499
The word of the lord

797
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,999
is the only way to your salvation.

798
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,999
Prayer time, sinners!

799
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,999
Aah!

800
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,999
- Ow!
- Aah!

801
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,800
Aah!

802
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,999
Uhh...

803
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,800
That's one way of doing it, I guess.

804
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Oh, Reverend.

805
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,800
I thank the lord

806
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,800
you brought that... big gun to town.

807
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,300
Ma'am,

808
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,300
you're a fine-lookin' nun.

809
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,300
You better get thee to a nunnery.

810
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,999
Love this!

811
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,499
Cut it, Lyle.

812
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,499
Freeze, Mr. Kelly.  Music down.

813
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,300
Turning off the blue screen.

814
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,499
Cut!

815
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,499
That's-- that's a wrap for day one.

816
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,800
Call tomorrow, 6am.

817
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,499
Fantastic.

818
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,999
Robin, you're a natural.

819
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,999
Ned, what's the scoop
with your ad lib line--

820
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,999
"Better get thee to a nunnery"?

821
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,999
It was Robin's idea.

822
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,300
Uh, it's hamlet's line to Ophelia.

823
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,800
It's classic Shakespeare.

824
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,499
Who the hell's Shakespeare?

825
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,800
He's only the greatest
english writer of all time.

826
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,499
Well, he'd better have
an american work permit.

827
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,999
I don't want union trouble.

828
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,999
He died 400 years ago.

829
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,499
I thought it sounded stale.

830
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,800
Let's stick to Bernie's script.

831
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,999
You're on another winner, Bernie.

832
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Thanks.
I'm adding some extra violence.

833
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,999
If it's 400 years old,

834
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,800
that means legally all his
stuff is out of copyright.

835
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,499
What are you saying?

836
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,300
It's free.

837
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,300
Hey, Bernie,

838
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,499
on second thought,

839
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,499
there may be something
to this Shakespeare stuff.

840
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,499
Get some of his old scripts

841
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,300
and freshen them up.

842
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,800
Who are you?

843
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,999
Big Mac...

844
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,499
Beth.

845
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,499
To blow your head off

846
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,499
or...

847
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,999
not blow your head off--

848
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,800
that is the question.

849
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,999
That's the last of 'em.

850
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,499
How can the sisters of Las Vegas

851
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,499
ever repay you for cleanin' up

852
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,999
the rottenest town in the west?

853
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,999
Well, ma'am,

854
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,800
you could kick that habit
and marry me.

855
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,300
Ohh, yes!

856
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,800
Amen.

857
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,300
Cut!

858
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,300
Lost somethin'?

859
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,499
Yeah.

860
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,800
My driver.

861
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,800
Where you headin'?

862
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,499
To my hotel.

863
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,300
I'll give you a ride.

864
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,800
There you go.

865
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,300
Thanks, mister.

866
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,800
No worries.

867
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,050
Oh!

868
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,800

Thanks.

893
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,499
I got to go.

894
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,499
Bye.

895
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,300
Bye.

896
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,999
"All the world's a stage,

897
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,300
and all the men and
women merely players."

898
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,999
"They have their exits

899
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,300
and their entrances."

900
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,300
"And each person in time

901
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,300
plays many parts."

902
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,999
Wrap the set.

903
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,999
OK, wrap it, and thank you.

904
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,499
She'll sleep with anything.

905
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,499
She's sleeping with the director.

906
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,499
So am I.

907
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,300
What?

908
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,999
Hollywood.

909
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,999
What a place.

910
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,999
One day you're a bank robber,

911
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,800
the next day you're a movie star.

912
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,800
All I had to do was finish the movie,

913
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,999
and I'd have the money.

914
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,999
I knew everyone back home
had been countin' on me.

915
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,300
It was time to tell 'em the good news.

916
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,800
Lights, camera, action!

917
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,999
You're the star

918
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,300
of a happy Hollywood video letter.

919
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,999
Your 20 second starts... now.

920
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,999
Hi, Dan.

921
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,800
Hi, Joe.

922
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,300
Ooh.

923
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,800
Video letter.

924
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,499
What is it?

925
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,800
Hmm.

926
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,999
Hi, Dan. Hi, Joe.

927
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,499
It's Ned!

928
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,499
I think he's wearing makeup.

929
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,499
You don't reckon he's
turned kinky, do you?

930
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,499
Guess what.

931
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,800
I'm an actor.

932
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,999
Gee.

933
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,999
The time's nearly up.

934
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,999
Well...

935
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,499
I just wanted you blokes to know

936
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,499
that when I finish my movie,

937
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,999
I'll be gettin' 1 mi--

938
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,499
Get away. No photographs.

939
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,499
Shoo!

940
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,300
Come on, Ernie.

941
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,999
Let's get some autographs.

942
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Any stars coming in this mornin'?

943
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,499
G'day, Ralph.

944
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,800
G'day, mate. Mr. Kelly.

945
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,499
Can I have your autograph?

946
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,999
Sure.

947
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,300
Please write, "To Hank."

948
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,499
I really admire what you do.

949
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,999
I could never be an actor.

950
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,999
I'd be too afraid.

951
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,300
Uh, make mine out, "To Ernie."

952
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,499
Ms. Banks,

953
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,800
will you be moving into a
secret Hollywood love nest,

954
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,499
and if so, with who?

955
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,999
Hey! There he is!

956
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,300
Where? Where?

957
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,300
Ned...

958
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,999
Do you like carrots?

959
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,999
Yeah.

960
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,499
Mr. Kelly, don't you feel

961
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,800
your gratuitous use of guns on screen

962
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,999
is helping to create a
more dangerous society?

963
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,499
From an intellectual basis--

964
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,999
Let me handle this.

965
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,499
Hey, smarty-pants, where you from?

966
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,499
New York.

967
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,499
- Oh!
- Oh!

968
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,999
Well, here in Hollywood,

969
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,499
it's personality questions only.

970
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,800
Mr. Kelly,

971
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,300
what color underpants do you wear?

972
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,999
Black.

973
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,999
Ooh!

974
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,999
Outrageous.

975
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,999
You better get into makeup.

976
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,499
I'd like to ask Mr. Kelly
another question.

977
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,800
Go take a meeting.

978
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,499
Hey, buddy, watch your language.

979
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,499
Why don't you keep in touch?

980
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,999
You keep in touch.

981
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,300
You keep in touch.

982
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,499
You keep in touch!

983
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,999
You keep in touch!

984
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,499
No!

985
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,300
You keep in touch!

986
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,300
I'm not gonna keep in touch,

987
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,499
'cause you can keep in touch!

988
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,999
I got Ned Kelly's autograph.

989
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,800
That wasn't Ned Kelly.

990
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,800
Who are you?

991
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,499
I'm the president of the Ned Kelly...

992
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,499
Fan Club.

993
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,499
And that wasn't him.

994
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,999
Who was it, then?

995
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,300
A thief.

996
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,999
He stole Ned Kelly's identity.

997
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,499
Well, he signed Ned Kelly's name.

998
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,999
Yeah. He wrote mine, too.

999
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,300
Look. "To Ernie."

1000
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,999
If he wrote your name,

1001
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,300
then he's stolen your identity, too.

1002
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,499
What do you mean?

1003
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,999
When your identity's been stolen,

1004
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,499
you're no longer yourself.

1005
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,999
You've got no personality.

1006
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,300
You're nobody.

1007
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,999
I want my identity back.

1008
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,300
Automatic.

1009
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,999
Silencer.

1010
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,300
Semiautomatic.

1011
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,300
Price check.

1012
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,300
Man targets.

1013
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,800
Regular size.

1014
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,800
You have no choice.

1015
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,300
He's stolen your identity, aren't he?

1016
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,800
Maybe. I--

1017
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,300
I haven't been feeling myself lately.

1018
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,999
Man target's on special-- 9.05!

1019
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,800
That's the way they operate.

1020
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,800
We believe he's an alien,

1021
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,499
possibly from another planet.

1022
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,499
It's time to make our move.

1023
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,999
Wib, are you prepared?

1024
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,999
Absolutely, Sir John.

1025
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,999
My people here are fully trained.

1026
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,999
All we need to do now

1027
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,800
is get our friend in a public place alone.

1028
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,999
Ned, the eyelashes
are a big improvement.

1029
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,300
You're looking great.

1030
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,499
By the way,

1031
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,499
the women want to see
you wearing a mustache.

1032
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,800
Don't shoot, mister.

1033
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,300
It's only popcorn.

1034
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,999
Sorry. I thought you
were going to shoot us.

1035
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,999
Ned Kelly, one of these days

1036
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,800
you're going to kill
somebody with this thing!

1037
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,300
Guns don't solve problems,

1038
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,499
they create them.

1039
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,499
You don't need a gun.

1040
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,800
You're addicted.

1041
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,999
You're a gun addict.

1042
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,999
I'm not addicted.

1043
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,300
I haven't fired a shot all day.

1044
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,999
I can give these things
up anytime I want.

1045
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,800
Anytime at all.

1046
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,300
Feels good.

1047
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,300
Ah.

1048
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,999
Overstretched and undercapitalized.

1049
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,300
Good.

1050
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,800
Miss Twisty,

1051
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,999
let's send a fax.

1052
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,300
A fax?

1053
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,300
This fax just came through.

1054
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,300
I'm so sorry.

1055
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,499
I can't pay you your money.

1056
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,499
They've frozen our accounts.

1057
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,499
They've foreclosed on all his loans.

1058
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,800
They're going to sell us off.

1059
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,800
Who's done this?

1060
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,499
Our bank, of course.

1061
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,300
Bank?

1062
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,800
Which bank?

1063
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,300
- Aah!
- Aah!

1064
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,499
Come on, let's try again.

1065
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,999
This is hopeless.

1066
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,800
It's solid steel.

1067
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,499
Hello?

1068
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,999
Hello?

1069
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,999
Dog, how are you?

1070
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,499
It's Ned.

1071
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,999
Slow down.

1072
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,499
What are you doing?

1073
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,999
Talking to my dog.

1074
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,300
Now, listen. Listen to me carefully.

1075
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,800
Where is Dan?

1076
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,999
Good dog.

1077
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,800
Is the dog talking back?

1078
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,300
Sort of.

1079
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,499
Stop kidding around, Dog.

1080
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,999
Where's Dan?

1081
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,999
Dog?

1082
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,300
Dog?

1083
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,999
Hello?

1084
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,999
Dog?

1085
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,800
Ned, there's a call for you.

1086
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,999
Hello?

1087
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,499
Just letting you know that
if you're planning a trip home,

1088
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,499
you'll need a Japanese Visa

1089
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,999
because I'm exporting Reckless Island

1090
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,800
tomorrow.

1091
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,499
What's wrong?

1092
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,999
A bunch of blokes in gray
suits are talking my home.

1093
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,499
Organized crime.

1094
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,300
It's worse than that.

1095
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,499
They're corporate bankers.

1096
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,999
Here's your money, Ned.

1097
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,999
Holy cow.

1098
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,999
Mom's been laundering
the company's money.

1099
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,499
I knew that sooner or later,

1100
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,999
borrowing all that money
would catch up with you,

1101
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,999
so I have been putting aside
a little something each week.

1102
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,999
If you guys are broke,

1103
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,499
I couldn't take that money.

1104
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,800
You must save your wilderness.

1105
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,999
Ned, it's yours. You earned it.

1106
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,999
Besides, we need much
more than $1 million

1107
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,999
to save the studio.

1108
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,999
The only way we can stay
in show business now

1109
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,800
is to beat that bank.

1110
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,300
And no one has ever beaten a bank.

1111
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,999
Well, there was a first
time for everything.

1112
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,999
That bank was stealing my home.

1113
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,999
They'd hurt my friends
and beaten up my dog.

1114
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,300
Enough was enough.

1115
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,499
You're not coming. It's too dangerous.

1116
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,499
Mr. Kelly,

1117
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,999
the flight to Australia
is boarding immediately.

1118
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,300
Better hurry.

1119
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,999
So don't bother arguing anymore.

1120
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,499
I'm not arguing anymore.

1121
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,999
Will you give me a ticket, please?

1122
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,300
You two are traveling together?

1123
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,300
- No.
- Yes.

1124
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,999
How nice.

1125
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,499
Try it again.

1126
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,300
Come on. Come on.

1127
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,999
There.

1128
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,300
All right.

1129
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,999
OK, you're all clear.

1130
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,999
Thank you.

1131
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,499
Have a nice flight.

1132
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,300
All right, next, please.

1133
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,499
Oh, look,
your fans came to say goodbye.

1134
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,800
Hi.

1135
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,999
Kelly!

1136
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,499
Bon voyage.

1137
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,999
Fare time, alien.

1138
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,300

finger on your trigger ♪

1139

1144
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,800
It's done.

1145
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,300
Two bullets point-blank range.

1146
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,999
I'm on my way back.

1147
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,999
Good.

1148
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,499
That's the last we'll see of Ned Kelly.

1149
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,800
Hey, look!
The bullets have hit the cross!

1150
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,800
Amen.

1151
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,499
My plan was simple.

1152
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,999
Give the bank the money

1153
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,300
and kick them off the island.

1154
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,300
Anyway, I figured Sir John
had to be bluffing.

1155
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,499
You can't export an island.

1156
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,800
It's impossible.

1157
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,999
Charges have been laid

1158
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,999
under the ocean and across the spit.

1159
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,499
The explosions will fracture

1160
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,499
the rock strata beneath the surface,

1161
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,999
breaking the island off
from the mainland.

1162
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,499
Then an ocean-going tugboat

1163
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,999
will simply tow it to Japan.

1164
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,800
Won't the island just sink?

1165
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,800
Not with the latest Japanese technology.

1166
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,999
They've fitted the island

1167
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,300
with a series of subsurface stabilizers

1168
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,300
to provide it with flotation
during the voyage.

1169
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,300
Well, it's really creating

1170
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,800
an offshore asset!

1171
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,300
- Aah!
- Aah!

1172
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,999
Hut-2, hut-2, hut-2, hut-2!

1173
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,499
Hut-2, hut-2, hut-2, hut-2!

1174
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,999
Hut-2, hut-2, hut-2, hut-2!

1175
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,800
Gentlemen, up until now,

1176
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,499
the best undeveloped real estate

1177
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,999
has been located in the
most remote places on Earth.

1178
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,999
Our bank is about to prove

1179
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,999
that cheap wilderness can be exported

1180
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,800
to the world's most wealthy
industrialized countries.

1181
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,800
Aah!

1182
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,999
There's heavily armed bankers out
there, and you've given up guns.

1183
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,300
What can you do by yourself?

1184
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,999
Trust me.

1185
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,499
Ned, I might not ever see you again,

1186
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,499
so whatever happens, I...

1187
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,300
Robin, I know what I'm doing.

1188
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,300
Now what?

1189
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,499
Yes, the island is yours.

1190
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,800
Sayonara!

1191
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,499
We're moving!

1192
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,499
You've all done an excellent job.

1193
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,999
I'd like you to stay on board the island

1194
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,999
until it's safety reached
international waters.

1195
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,800
Fly me back to the bank.

1196
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,300
I'll refuel the helicopter, sir.

1197
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,300
It's Ned Kelly!

1198
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,300
The island stopped moving!

1199
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,800
Aah!

1200
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,300
Shoot them both.

1201
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,800
Fire!

1202
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,499
Inside! Quick!

1203
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,800
Ohh!

1204
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,800
- Aah!
- Aah!

1205
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,300
- Aah!
- Aah!

1206
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,999
Aah!

1207
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,499
He's ricocheting bullets
with that rubbish bin suit.

1208
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,499
Put down your guns
before you kill yourselves.

1209
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,800
Ow!

1210
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,300
Ned.

1211
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,300
The pub's on fire.

1212
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,800
Ned's out there, and he's in trouble.

1213
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,800
I can feel it.

1214
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,499
Wake up, Dan.

1215
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,800
You're daydreaming.

1216
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,999
You're daydreaming.
You're daydreaming...

1217
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,999
Yeah.

1218
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,800
Day... dreaming.

1219
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,999
Aah!

1220
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,300
1...

1221
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,800
- Aah!
- Aah!

1222
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,300
Aim for his head!

1223
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,499
Don't go out. It's suicide.

1224
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,300
We can't stay here either.

1225
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,999
Let's take all the beer we can carry

1226
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,499
and get out the back way.

1227
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,499
You're not deserting Ned, are you?

1228
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,499
Aim for his legs!

1229
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,300
Legs?

1230
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,800
We'll finish him off.

1231
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,800
Hold fire!

1232
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,300
We'll move in and shoot him in the head.

1233
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,800
Now!

1234
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,300
- Aah!
- Aah!

1235
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,999
I quit!

1236
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,999
I resign.

1237
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,800
My head hurts.

1238
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,300
Here's your money.

1239
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,800
Now get off our island.

1240
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,800
Welcome home.

1241
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,800
Aah!

1242
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,999
Ha ha!

1243
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,999
You business people
don't know when to stop.

1244
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,800
Remove your helmet.

1245
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,499
Unless you have friends
in Heaven, Kelly,

1246
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,300
you're out of luck.

1247
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,499
Such is life.

1248
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,800
Amen.

1249
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,999
It looks like you broke
your dad's record

1250
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,499
for getting shot.

1251
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,800
Congratulations! Ha ha!

1252
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,999
Guns?

1253
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,999
Looks like the Kelly
Gang's back in business.

1254
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,499
Yeah...

1255
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,300
