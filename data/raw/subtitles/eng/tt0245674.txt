1
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Is it bad tonight?

2
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Bad. That's one way to describe it.

3
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Insane seems a little more appropriate.

4
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
It feels like he's breathing down my neck.

5
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,200
It is my professionaI opinion
we should get the hell out of here. Now.

6
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,900
Noted.

7
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
Clean this place up, then locate our guests.

8
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I just need to take the edge off.

9
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,600
You know the routine.
I need you clear-headed.

10
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,000
First things first.

11
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,200
Now, where is he?

12
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,900
Show me where he's hiding.

13
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,700
Son of a bitch!
You said he only killed nine people.

14
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
There are 40 victims here.

15
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,300
Nine when he was alive.
He's added a few since then.

16
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Now where is he, Dennis?

17
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
All teams go to alpha. Bring in the cube!

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How did this guy get the name
"The Breaker"? Is he a truck driver?

19
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Simple folkIore.
The locaI color exorcising its demons.

20
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe it's because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possible.

21
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,200
I hate being rushed.

22
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
This one isn't like the others.

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
- I'll give you a bonus.
- You don't have that kind of money.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,900
After tonight you'll be surprised.
Now, get to work.

25
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
CarefuI, Dennis.

26
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,800
Don't get too curious.

27
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,100
Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,900
How can you justify what you're doing,
Cyrus? It's out and out slavery!

29
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,800
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, Kalina?

30
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,500
Still carrying around
those ridiculous quicksilver flares?

31
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,500
You still have that quaint magicaI book?

32
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,100
These aren't animals you're capturing,
they're human beings.

33
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,700
They are dead human beings.

34
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,600
Maybe you should join Greenpeace.
Throw blood on old women's furs.

35
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Who are you to play God?

36
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
- Playing is for children.
- You'll never pull it off.

37
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,300
Not without the right spells.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

38
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,600
Thirteenth ghost?

39
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time already.

40
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Why did he say thirteenth?

41
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,400
Move the cube into position.

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,700
What's he talking about, 13 ghosts?

43
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,300
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!

44
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.

45
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,700
Yes. Twelve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700
That's not how it works, and you know it!

47
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,600
There's no time to argue.

48
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,900
Release the bait!

49
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,900
What bait? We never needed bait before!

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,800
A truck full of blood?
You've got to be shitting me.

51
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,200
Oh, boy.

52
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,400
Now...

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,900
...power up the cube.

54
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Start transmitting.

55
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,700
Come.

56
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,700
Come.

57
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,400
Come!

58
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,100
Help me! Help me!

59
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,700
Oh, shit!

60
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
Put him down!

61
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,400
Cyrus, I hope you're happy.
You've got your twelve now.

62
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Help me! He's dying!

63
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,600
Hang on, Damon. Somebody help!
Damn you, Cyrus!

64
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
Somebody help me, please!

65
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Help me. Do something!

66
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh, Cyrus.

67
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,400
Oh, God.

68
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,900
- Swing me!
- Come on, Bobby.

69
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Faster, Kathy.

70
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Let me get your arms.

71
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Try to drag me.

72
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,800
You're the best little brother.
I love you. Let's go!

73
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you!

74
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,400
Look at those two. She's got him
on the run now, but pretty soon...

75
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,700
...he's going to be picking her up
and throwing her over his shoulder.

76
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
They're perfect.

77
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,400
Watch them. Watch them.

78
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
They really love this place.

79
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,100
I love you.

80
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,800
Surprise!

81
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
My heart! My heart!

82
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Happy birthday, Dad!

83
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,300
Happy birthday, Arthur.

84
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
Here's my present, Dad.

85
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,900
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.

86
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,200
What did you wish for?

87
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,700
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

88
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,500
What's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?

89
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,100
I'll get the kids. Call the fire department.

90
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
Dad! Help, Mom!

91
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Get the kids. Get the kids!

92
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,500
Mom! Dad! Help me!

93
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Where's your mom? Where is she?

94
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,400
I don't know where Mom is.

95
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,300
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!

96
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Jean! Jean!

97
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her there.

98
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.

99
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,100
You can't go back in there, sir.

100
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry, sir. She didn't make it.

101
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,400
I should have gone back in.

102
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
We are gathered here today,
to honor the memory...

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
...and life's work ofJean Kriticos...

104
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
...a devoted mother and loving wife...

105
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,200
...who was too quickly taken from this life.

106
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,500
Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.

107
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I miss you, Mom.

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,100
Why did you have to leave us?

109
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
I can't do this without you.

110
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,300
I don't want you to go.

111
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Mom, I love you so much.

112
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Please watch over us.

113
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
I'll love you always.

114
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,300
Dad, it's...

115
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,700
It's almost 8:30.
Shake a leg or you'll miss your first class.

116
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,300
Today on Death in America:
"Cancer rates are down...

117
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
"... but suicide is sky-high.

118
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,500
"We have a speciaI treat for you today.

119
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,900
"A body was found this morning,
decolopolated. "

120
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,800
"Decapitated. "

121
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Bobby, find a healthier hobby.

122
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,300
Leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.

123
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Good morning, everybody.

124
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,800
Something smells interesting.

125
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Dad, they found a guy without a head
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

126
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
I love Dunkin' Donuts.

127
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,000
Kathy.

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,700
Let Maggie make breakfast for once.
That's why we hired her.

129
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,800
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

130
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
Just that one time.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
I heard that. Hell, I cook better than you.

132
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,700
We have to try to get along here.

133
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Dad, tell Kathy that keeping
a record of death is healthy.

134
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,700
Kathy, "Keeping a record of death
is healthy. "

135
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,900
Because she's being a reaI slut about it.

136
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,000
Bobby. Don't call your sister a slut.

137
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Thank you, Maggie.

138
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,800
I prefer the term "bitch. "

139
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,200
Sluts are girls with loose-

140
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,
did you do your homework?

141
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,700
Because Mr. Peterson-

142
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Damn it! Bobby, that's the third time
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

143
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
- Sorry.
- If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't-

144
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,500
We don't have a big place anymore, do we?

145
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,300
It's the best I can do for now...

146
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,900
...so let's all try and keep our shit
off the floor.

147
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,700
All right? Now, Bobby,
put away the damn tape recorder.

148
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.

149
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm sorry, Dad.

150
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,400
Must be the lawyer. I forgot.

151
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,300
Lawyer? I thought our credit
was all cleaned up.

152
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
No, I don't think it's about that.

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,700
They won't make us move again, will they?

154
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,700
It's gonna be all right.
Whatever it is, we'll deaI with it.

155
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Mr. Kriticos?

156
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
That's right. You are?

157
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,800
Ben Moss. How do you do?

158
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,200
Please, come in.

159
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Is now a good time, or...?

160
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,400
As good a time as any.
Please, just give me one minute.

161
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,700
Sorry. I'm ready.

162
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,400
I represent the estate of your uncle
Cyrus Kriticos.

163
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
We have an Uncle Cyrus?

164
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,600
Had. I only met him a couple of times
as a kid.

165
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
He wasn't too popular.

166
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,800
My dad said
he squandered the family fortune.

167
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
We have a family fortune?

168
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,900
No. Cyrus squandered it.

169
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,400
Bobby, isn't that great?
You have a late uncle.

170
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,900
- What is he late for?
- His next birthday.

171
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,600
You mean, he's dead?

172
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
- Now we get his attention.
- Pipe down.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
Cyrus recorded this message
six weeks ago.

174
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
He asked that it be played for you
in the event of his death.

175
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,000
Arthur...

176
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
...it's good to talk to you.

177
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,000
Sadly, if you're watching this now,
it means I am no longer among the living.

178
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,100
Happily, that makes you and your family
my sole beneficiaries.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...

180
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,100
...to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament.

181
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Give it to them, Ben.

182
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,900
A key?

183
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
A key to what?

184
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
A key to your new house.

185
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
What?

186
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,600
This house is the fruit of my life's work.

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,100
Is this for reaI?

189
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
It is a one-of-a-kind home.
It's my home, actually.

190
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
My home.

191
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,600
I have no complaints.
I've led an interesting life.

192
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,700
I have seen some amazing things.

193
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,700
But the only regret I have, is that
I never got to know my nephew Arthur...

194
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,600
...nor appreciate the love of a family,
like you have.

195
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,700
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

196
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,100
Enjoy.

197
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
Perhaps we'll meet again...

198
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,800
...in another life.

199
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
- Wow!
- When can we see it?

200
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,000
The house is yours whenever you like.
I'm heading up there after work.

201
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
If you want, you, your wife and kids-

202
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,900
Time-out. I am not the missus here.

203
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,000
My wife...

204
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,800
My wife is...

205
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,600
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

206
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,500
What? It's true.

207
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
That's enough, Robert.

208
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Mr. Moss, exactly where is this place?

209
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,100
A couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove...

210
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,600
...just up the parkway.

211
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
It's in a gorgeous area. But I warn you,
your uncle liked his privacy.

212
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

213
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Come on. Hurry up.

214
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,100
S- U-F.

215
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,100
Suffocate. I got it. I win.

216
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
So what? You think you're so slick.

217
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,300
Come on, you guys. We're almost there.

218
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,100
- Excited?
- Yeah. Mom would have freaked over this.

219
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,100
Looks like things are
starting to get better, right?

220
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Yeah.

221
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,300
That's strange.

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Dad, it's beautifuI.

223
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,800
My God. I've never seen anything like it.

224
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,300
CooI!

225
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
So futuroic.

226
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,900
It's about time somebody showed up.
Is this your place?

227
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,400
- Who are you?
- I'm the power guy.

228
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,400
Don't touch.

229
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whole tri-quad area.

230
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,000
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

231
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,800
Could you come back tomorrow?
Is that a possibility?

232
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,400
Tomorrow? Let me see.

233
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,100
There are about 5,570 houses right now
without power.

234
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,000
My bosses kind of frown on that, so...

235
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Well, that's not really our problem, is it?

236
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Look, buddy, I've been doing this job
for about three weeks.

237
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,500
Is there any way
you can give me a break here?

238
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
Sure.

239
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
No problem.

240
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
Thank you.

241
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
Mr...?

242
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,000
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

243
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,400
It's quite a place you've got.

244
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,300
Yeah. We're moving in.

245
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
One step at a time.

246
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,200
- That's odd.
- Dad, you broke it.

247
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,900
Bobby, give it a rest.

248
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Hello.

249
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Wow! You can see right through it.

250
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
You guys couldn't afford any walls?

251
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,300
How weird.

252
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.

254
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,700
It's like a funhouse.

255
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,900
It's Latin.

256
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
Everything's so beautifuI.

257
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,700
Family, just so we're all clear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

258
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,000
Wow!

259
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,700
What an incredible wealth of knowledge.

260
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,800
A samurai sword.

261
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,900
In your dreams, paI.

262
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

263
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

264
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, Cyrus.

265
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,600
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

266
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Goodness.

267
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
It's like a cathedraI.

268
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,600
All right, first rule: No throwing stones.

269
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,700
It's marvelous, though, isn't it?

270
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
A living work of art.

271
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,700
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement...

272
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,100
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.

273
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I believe it's down the hall.
It's two doors on the right.

274
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,400
Excuse me.

275
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,500
The construction is amazing.

276
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm getting dizzy.

277
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,400
Bobby.

278
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
Don't touch anything. Okay?

279
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,000
At least untiI we get property insurance.

280
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,300
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign
in the library.

281
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,700
After that, I'd love to give you
and your family a tour of the house.

282
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Great. I don't want you guys to move
from this spot.

283
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
We'll be right back.

284
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,900
You're being paranoid and overprotective.

285
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,200
Yeah, of all this stuff.

286
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,800
I know you guys too well. Stay...

287
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,500
...right here. I mean it.

288
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,400
What the...?

289
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Where'd you hide your money, old man?

290
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
Shit!

291
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,300
What the hell was that?

292
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
Oh, no.

293
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, Cyrus.

294
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,300
Now I know I'm dreaming.

295
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Was Cyrus a hunter?

296
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
You could say that.

297
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,300
Your uncle was quite a collector
of many things.

298
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,300
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign, Arthur.

299
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,700
Okay, look.

300
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,000
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids...

301
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,700
...but this place is beyond amazing.

302
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,900
I'm just a math teacher.

303
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,200
The taxes alone must be...

304
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,500
I have nothing set aside.

305
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,400
To be honest, a fire took away everything.

306
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

307
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,500
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

308
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,400
Basically, you and your family
never have to worry about money again.

309
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,700
Son of a bitch.

310
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,100
Lookee here. Look, y'all.

311
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,000
Look, look!

312
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,500
Sign.

313
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,100
Arthur?

314
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,900
Arthur, we've got to...

315
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
We have to talk.

316
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
What is the deaI with the breakers?

317
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,900
Nothing. I'm not a power guy.
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

318
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
- You're Dennis Rafkin?
- Who's Dennis Rafkin?

319
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
My office warned me about this guy.

320
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,100
I know this will sound
completely whacked, but stay with me.

321
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,200
I used to hunt displaced spirituaI energies
with your uncle.

322
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm sorry?

323
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,400
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths.

324
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

325
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,300
Okay. I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.

326
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Arthur, I used to...

327
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,100
I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

328
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Goats?

329
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!

330
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,700
Race you to the end of the hall.

331
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,100
No, Bobby, I don't think this is the place-

332
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,600
Come on, slowpoke!
Is that the best you got?

333
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,900
My grandma scoots better than that.

334
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,100
Ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits
trapped on earth. Ghosts.

335
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,400
As in Halloween? Boo?

336
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
As in Demi Moore
and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.

337
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,500
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.

338
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,100
Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.

339
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
I'll explain everything...

340
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,000
...as soon as you get
you and your children outside.

341
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,000
- What's taking you so long?
- Out of my way.

342
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,400
- I don't think scooting is your game.
- Come on.

343
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,500
- I won.
- You cheated. I didn't get a start.

344
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,200
Got to be on your toes, man.

345
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,000
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.

346
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,100
- I wonder what my room's like.
- This is the coolest room in the house.

347
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,300
I'll be in here.

348
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
This place is awesome!

349
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,500
Cyrus has containment cubes
all over the basement.

350
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,000
I don't know why they're here...

351
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,900
...and I am not staying around to find out.

352
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,300
- So, if I were you-
- Well, he isn't you.

353
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,700
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncle died.

354
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
I see this all the time.

355
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,100
Some rich guy passes away
and all the nuts come out!

356
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,500
Next thing, he'll be claiming
Cyrus owned him money or-

357
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,700
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitload of money!

358
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,300
These are some funky-looking specs.

359
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
- What do you think? Do I look cooI?
- Let me see.

360
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,400
Not so fast. Cater to my ego first:

361
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,300
"Maggie's the best babysitter
you ever had. "

362
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,200
- Come on!
- All right.

363
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm getting my ass
out of the big glass house!

364
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
Grab your children! Do the same.

365
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,000
Are you all right?

366
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,800
Jean! Jean!

367
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
We'll go get you some help. Okay?

368
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
Don't touch me.

369
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
Oh, my God!

370
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
We have struck gold.

371
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
- Easy.
- Don't.

372
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,000
How's your head?

373
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,300
Not good.

374
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
Where's the suit?

375
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,400
Power guy. Idiot.

376
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,200
CooI!

377
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,800
Better have a pair of those in my room.

378
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
Bobby, where are you going?

379
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,400
What are you staring at?

380
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,000
Hey, kiddo.

381
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,100
He thinks I'm going to duck.

382
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,400
Nice tits.

383
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,300
What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

384
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,600
Not bad for an hourly wage.

385
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
It's time to leave.

386
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,800
I'll take your word for it.

387
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,600
Kathy?

388
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Come on. This way.

389
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,900
Shit! What the hell? Kathy!

390
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,800
Maggie? Bobby!

391
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
I was just kidding before.

392
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
A little lawyer humor.

393
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Kathy?

394
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,900
Bobby!

395
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,100
I don't believe it.

396
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
Believe what?

397
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,500
- I told them not to leave this spot.
- They're kids, what do you expect?

398
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,000
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I'II look up.

399
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,100
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!

400
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Kathy? Where are you guys?

401
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,900
Bobby!

402
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm sorry.

404
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,600
What are you doing up here?
I told you to wait downstairs.

405
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbelievable.

406
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,200
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?

407
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
He's with Maggie.

408
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,700
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw all the glass-

409
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.

410
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,200
Bobby.

411
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,700
Down here.

412
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,800
Maggie?

413
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,100
Come on down and play.

414
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,800
Is that you?

415
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,100
Maggie?

416
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,700
Stop playing games.

417
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,500
Bobby? I have something for you.
We'll have lots of fun.

418
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,600
Don't come down, Bobby.

419
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,400
Stay upstairs.

420
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,200
Don't follow her.

421
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Down here, Bobby.

422
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,800
Bobby, don't come down.

423
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,000
Bobby? Around the corner.

424
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,200
Don't come down here!

425
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,600
That's it.

426
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,700
You guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

427
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,200
Bobby!

428
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
I'll find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.

429
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,000
- But, Dad-
- No "buts"!

430
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,700
I want you both to wait in the car.
I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.

431
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,200
- Why are you freaking out?
- Just this once, don't argue with me.

432
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
What happened to the door?

433
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Son of a bitch!

434
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,300
I cannot believe this.

435
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,300
I'm going to have to break it down.
Back away!

436
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,200
It's quite dramatic...

437
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,300
...but you're wasting your time.
It's all sealed up.

438
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,400
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
- Don't go there.

439
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,100
What do you mean, "all sealed up"?

440
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,900
What part of that code
are you having trouble cracking?

441
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,500
The entire house is sealed up.

442
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,700
- There must be another way out.
- I've looked.

443
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,700
We'II look again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.

444
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,800
That's all right, I'll wait right here.

445
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,400
I don't know what is going on here,
or who the hell you are.

446
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,400
And my son is missing.

447
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,700
So, untiI those questions are answered,
you're not leaving my sight.

448
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,700
Now, get up!

449
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
All right. Breathe.

450
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,100
Did the lawyer split?

451
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,500
Bobby.

452
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,700
Bobby.

453
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

454
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,700
Bobby!

455
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,500
- Bobby.
- Come on out now, paI!

456
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,900
Stop screwing around.

457
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,700
Glass family Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

458
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,400
This is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.

459
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,700
This is shatterproof and soundproof.

460
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,200
What are these?

461
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,300
That's a little harder to explain.
They're containment spells.

462
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,800
Ghosts can't cross those.

463
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,800
- Ghosts?
- Yes, ghosts.

464
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,000
The supernaturaI realm has its own laws.
For ghosts, it's spells.

465
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,300
Written or spoken, the ghosts
have to obey whatever the spells say.

466
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,400
The entire basement is filled with ghosts.

467
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,000
In this basement?

468
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,900
Of course, in this basement.
If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!

469
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Dad!

470
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,300
- I can prove it.
- I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

471
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,500
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.

472
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,200
Bobby, come on.

473
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,300
- I don't see any ghosts.
- Because they're locked downstairs.

474
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
Dad!

475
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,000
There's more of this crazy spell shit
on the floor.

476
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,800
Let me see those.

477
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

478
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,800
Hidden barrier spells.
Why would he need more protection?

479
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,900
All right, that's enough.
This is not helping.

480
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,900
Do me a favor and stop
with all the haunted house nonsense...

481
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,900
...at least untiI we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

482
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,500
Bobby, come on.

483
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,200
I don't know where he could be.

484
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,300
No, no!

485
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,500
Wait!

486
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,900
What did I just say,
that there was a petting zoo downstairs?

487
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No!

488
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,900
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

489
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,000
Right, right. But you also said...

490
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
...that they're all locked up. Right?

491
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,600
- No. No way.
- Wait.

492
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,200
Listen.

493
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,000
I'll make a deaI with you.

494
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,800
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...

495
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
...if you just help me...

496
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,200
...find my son.

497
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,700
Unbelievable. Get out of my way.

498
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,100
Bobby.

499
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,800
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

500
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,300
You need to put on those glasses.

501
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Leave me alone!

502
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,800
That's it. That's a good boy.

503
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,100
Bobby.

504
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,900
Bobby.

505
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,800
Go upstairs and find your father.

506
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,700
Mom?

507
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Go on.

508
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,100
Go upstairs!

509
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,800
Go find Kathy.

510
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,100
Watch out.

511
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,700
Watch out.

512
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,700
Bobby! Come on!

513
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,200
You don't have to scream, all right? Just...

514
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,300
...chill.

515
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,800
- This way.
- Hold on. Listen to me.

516
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,300
This will take forever.
This place is just too big.

517
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,700
Kathy and I will head up this way.
You two check down there.

518
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,300
- No, I don't think we should split up.
- It's okay.

519
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,900
Go in a straight line, turn around.
We'll meet back here in five.

520
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,000
Five. Back here.

521
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,500
Don't touch anything.

522
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,900
- I don't want to go with him!
- Go ahead.

523
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,700
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

524
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,100
There are ghosts down here.
If you don't believe me, look for yourself.

525
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.

526
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,700
What the hell? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

527
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,200
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

528
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,900
- God! I hate it when they do that!
- Do what?

529
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,900
They wait for you to put your face
up to the glass, then give you...

530
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,100
...a big, fat "boo"!

531
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,500
Don't do that!

532
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
God.

533
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,400
See it?

534
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,000
- It's, it's...
- A ghost.

535
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,800
Just like I've been saying all night!
Finally, a believer!

536
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,400
Ghosts are around us all the time.
Most of them can't hurt us.

537
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,900
Most don't want to.
Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.

538
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
But there are exceptions,
like this bad-ass behind me.

539
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,000
Those who die violently stay in
a tortured realm, so that's all they know.

540
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,700
What is he doing?

541
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,300
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the glasses.

542
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,700
I've had it with this. It's time to go.

543
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,000
- Now! Please!
- Don't touch me.

544
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,400
Will you come on?

545
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,000
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It's time to go.

546
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.

547
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,800
Dad!

548
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,000
Dad.

549
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,000
Listen to me.

550
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,500
He's going to be okay.

551
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,200
We're going to find him.

552
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,100
I am so ready to leave this place.

553
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,800
- Oh, boy.
- What?

554
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,800
- That's the symboI of The JackaI.
- What's The JackaI?

555
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,000
The JackaI is the Charlie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.

556
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,100
We've got to get out of this basement.

557
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,200
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there-

558
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Kathy!

559
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,600
Think about what you're saying.

560
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,300
There is no such thing as ghosts.

561
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,300
Kathy.

562
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,800
Kathy!

563
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,500
What is it? I can't see it!
Tell me where it is!

564
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Get off!

565
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,800
Hold on! Stay with me!

566
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
Come on, pull!

567
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,400
- Who are you?
- Never mind, just pull.

568
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,100
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

569
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,600
Somehow...

570
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,300
...we got behind enemy lines.

571
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,400
Hurry!

572
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,900
Please, hurry!

573
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,500
Hey, little guy.

574
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,400
- How.
- Don't tease the ghosts.

575
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,000
- Will you shut up?
- You shut up. You keep pissing them off.

576
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,600
Go.

577
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,700
- Maggie!
- What?

578
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,300
Where?
I can't see without the glasses, idiot!

579
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,200
Well, I can see.
And I think you should go this way!

580
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,500
Go, go!

581
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,100
It's all right. I've got you.

582
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,500
Look at me.

583
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,500
Daddy.

584
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,700
It's okay.

585
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,500
Who the hell are you?

586
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,200
And what the hell was that?

587
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,100
My name is Kalina Oretzia.
I'm in the spirit reclamation business.

588
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
What?

589
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,200
I free trapped souls. Cyrus-

590
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,500
Forget Cyrus, who traps souls,
for a damn second.

591
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
What are you doing here?

592
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,100
Looks to me like I'm saving your ass.

593
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,600
Oh, my God!
It's over there! It's over there!

594
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,700
Give him your glasses.

595
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Come on!

596
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,400
Oh, my God.

597
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,600
Unbelievable.

598
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,000
Another one of Cyrus's victims.

599
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,100
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

600
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Victims?

601
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,500
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.

602
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,400
That's why I'm here.
I intend to set them all free.

603
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,800
Listen to me.

604
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,900
I need to know...

605
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,300
...how you got in here.

606
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,600
I slipped through an opening in the house
when it shifted.

607
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,000
- An opening where?
- It's closed now. It won't happen again.

608
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,500
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

609
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,100
Many people died
in the quest for this book.

610
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,400
It was written in the 15th century
by an astrologer named Basileus.

611
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,400
In it, he describes
the making of a certain machine.

612
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,700
One that can see into the future.

613
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,300
He wrote it while he was under
demonic possession.

614
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

615
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,000
Built what? What are you talking about?

616
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,900
Basileus's device.

617
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,400
We're in the middle of a machine, designed
by the deviI and powered by the dead.

618
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,600
Listen to me.

619
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,400
I don't give a shit about any machine...

620
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,100
...or deviI or Basileus or anything...

621
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,800
...except getting my family
the hell out of this place.

622
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,900
I came here
to set the souls in this house free.

623
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,100
You want help, you have to help me first.

624
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,400
Kathy, can you walk?

625
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,900
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!

626
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,300
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

627
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,700
Try telling him that.

628
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,700
Come on.

629
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,800
This way. Come on.

630
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,800
Stairs. Let's go.

631
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,400
Go. You go!

632
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,800
Don't touch me!

633
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,800
Wait! The glasses!

634
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,700
You'll need these! Catch!

635
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,300
- Good job.
- Sorry.

636
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,700
Perfect. Another dead end.

637
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,600
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?

638
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,800
- Get away.
- What? What do we do now?

639
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Get away from the glass.

640
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,800
- Why?
- Just do it.

641
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,700
Glasses.

642
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,500
Duck!

643
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,800
Move! Go left!

644
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,300
Do something, for Christ's sake!
We're running out of corridors!

645
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,300
Duck! Go left! Go right! Move!

646
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
Get down!

647
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,100
Here. We've got to get to the library.
It has spell protection all around it.

648
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,500
Where is that from here?

649
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,500
Can I rely on you not to get me killed?

650
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,600
I guarantee nothing.

651
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,600
See anything?

652
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,800
- Anything?
- No.

653
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,200
Come on.

654
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,900
I think they're just downstairs.

655
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,800
Nothing.

656
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,200
If we get out of this alive,
I've got to get a pay raise.

657
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,000
That's a big "if. "

658
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,400
Give me the flare.

659
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,300
What's wrong?
Don't start freaking out now. Come on.

660
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,000
What?

661
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
- Okay. What?
- Shut up.

662
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,200
Give me the book.

663
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,200
Just back up.

664
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,200
Go. Slow.

665
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,200
- I'm going slow.
- Slow.

666
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,500
Go! Go!

667
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,000
Fast!

668
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,200
- What the hell?
- Who the hell?

669
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,100
What the hell are you doing here?

670
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,900
Shit!

671
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,300
Remember me?

672
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,700
Thanks for taking your time.

673
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,900
Go down the hall. Turn left, then right.

674
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
- Where are we going?
- Trust me, okay?

675
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,800
- Arthur?
- Trust her.

676
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,600
Okay, let's go!

677
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,100
- Who the hell is she?
- I'll explain her later.

678
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,200
What happened to Kathy?

679
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,800
I don't know, she disappeared.

680
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,000
How do you lose an entire family
in a glass house?

681
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,500
Arthur!

682
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,200
Kalina, give me a flare!

683
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,400
Get him! Go! Get up!

684
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,300
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!

685
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,300
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!

686
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,800
Oh, my God! Go! Run!

687
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,800
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

688
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,900
Get the door. Close the door!

689
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Arthur, are you all right?

690
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,600
God, what's going on here?
Fucking ghosts.

691
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,300
I hate this job.

692
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,500
They don't like you, either. I wonder why.

693
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,100
You got something to say, say it.

694
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,300
All right. Let's start with:
This is all your goddamn fault!

695
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,300
If you hadn't caught them,
we wouldn't be running from them.

696
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,200
It was his uncle that built the house!

697
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,800
You helped him. How could you help him
without knowing what he was doing?

698
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,900
- I had my reasons.
- Money, you parasite.

699
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,600
You stole people's souls for money!
How depraved is that?

700
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
If you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!

701
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,000
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.

702
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,700
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit
flashes in front of my eyes.

703
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,600
So, yeah, I'm depraved.

704
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,100
But Cyrus was my friend,
and he accepted me.

705
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,000
He didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!

706
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,000
- He used you.
- Shut up, both of you.

707
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,100
Cut him some slack.
What difference does it make?

708
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,700
You didn't tell him, did you?

709
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Tell me what? What now?

710
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,700
About the fourth ghost.

711
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,700
Don't do this. I didn't tell him.

712
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,400
He has a right to know.

713
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,800
What about the fourth ghost?

714
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,800
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.

715
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,800
You're saying my wife's spirit...

716
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,900
...is trapped in this house?

717
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,000
I didn't know you.

718
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,000
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

719
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,600
Why? In God's name, why?
Tell me, why her?

720
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,400
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them,
including your wife.

721
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,200
I figured out who you were
and I've been trying to help you.

722
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,600
You call this help? She's right!
This is all your goddamn fault!

723
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,700
Son of a bitch!

724
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,300
You can save her. And your kids, too.

725
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Just listen to me and believe me.

726
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,900
This house is not a house.

727
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,000
It is a machine.

728
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,000
A complete and faithfuI re-creation
of Basileus's design.

729
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,000
According to this, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

730
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,600
See these?
They represent the black zodiac.

731
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,200
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.

732
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,700
I don't want to play.

733
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,600
The Torso.

734
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,600
The Bound Woman.

735
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,000
The Withered Lover.

736
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,800
Jean.

737
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,000
Bobby. I love you.

738
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,700
The Torn Prince.

739
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,000
The Angry Princess.

740
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,500
I'm sorry.

741
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,300
The Pilgrimess.

742
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,600
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

743
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,700
The Hammer.

744
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,600
And here, the sign of Hell's Winter:
The JackaI.

745
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,900
And The Juggernaut.

746
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,900
The machine required the energy...

747
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,800
...of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to life.

748
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,800
Once it engages,
the spirits are released one by one.

749
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,100
The house then draws them to its center.

750
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,400
Each one adds its energy to the machine,
powering it up.

751
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,700
Powering it up for what?

752
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,700
To open the Ocularis Infernum.

753
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,400
What's that?

754
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,700
It's Latin.

755
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,100
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?

756
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,000
Very good.

757
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,500
The Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house
with crazy white people...

758
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Go on.

759
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,700
In hell, there is an eye
that sees everything, the past, the future...

760
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,100
...heaven and earth,
the blessed, the damned.

761
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,600
If knowledge is power,
then the man who controls the Ocularis...

762
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,700
...would be the most powerfuI
man on earth.

763
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,400
Your uncle.

764
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,100
Great.

765
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,000
So...

766
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,600
...how many ghosts have been set free?

767
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,500
Eleven. And the house needs twelve.

768
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,500
No. Damon said something about thirteen.

769
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,300
That there are thirteen ghosts.

770
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,500
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.

771
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,600
To stop the process, the house needs
a sacrifice of life instead of death.

772
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,300
A willing, human sacrifice.

773
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

774
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,700
The only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love.

775
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,700
You're the thirteenth ghost.

776
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,700
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finaI configuration.

777
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,600
As the eye opens,
the spirit uses the power of life...

778
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
...to short-circuit the system.

779
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,600
Uses the power of life how?

780
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,500
By leaping into the eye.

781
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,900
And Arthur's supposed to take this leap?
No fucking way, lady.

782
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,700
That's suicide. I won't let you do it.

783
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,300
You need to come up with something else.
That's not working.

784
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,000
Love is the most powerfuI energy.

785
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,600
Meaning?

786
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,600
In order for you to save your children,
you must trade your life for theirs.

787
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,200
Let me see this.

788
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,700
There's got to be a better way.

789
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,400
I don't read Latin.

790
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,700
Well, we can try it the old-fashioned way,
my personaI favorite.

791
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,400
Nobody will be here
to brag about it afterwards.

792
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,800
We need to come up with
a game plan soon. Time's running out.

793
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,100
Are you going to blow the place up?

794
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,200
The last ghost is about to be released.

795
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,900
- I know why you feeI you have to do this.
- Get away from me.

796
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,800
Psychics call it a "linking. "
We linked earlier. I saw everything...

797
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,100
...about Jean, about you.

798
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,900
Shut up.
I'm not going to listen to this from you.

799
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,200
Kalina is talking about suicide.

800
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,100
Anything to save my kids.

801
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,200
It doesn't add up.
It doesn't make any sense.

802
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,900
There's got to be a better way.

803
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,400
"Doesn't add up"?
What does add up here, Dennis?

804
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,900
How much of this equation
makes any sense at all?

805
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,500
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

806
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,200
AII I can think about are my kids.

807
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,800
I don't even know if they're alive.

808
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,300
Then let's go out there and find out.

809
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,200
One last time,
while there's still time, you and me.

810
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,000
Kalina...

811
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,700
...no matter what I decide to do,
or what happens to any of us...

812
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,200
...are you sure
you can you stop that machine?

813
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,400
I've got enough explosives
to blow us back to the 15th century.

814
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,800
Okay.

815
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,600
- How many flares do you have left?
- One, why?

816
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,400
We're going out again.

817
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,900
No fucking way, Arthur.
You're going to get yourself killed.

818
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,700
Not if we take that.

819
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,600
Ten minutes
untiI the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

820
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,800
Go.

821
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,200
We'll go down and buy you some time.

822
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
After you, Captain America.

823
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,300
Damn. I just got my nails done.

824
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,600
Here. Put these on.

825
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,100
Come on, let's go!

826
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,000
"There's no place like home. "

827
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,100
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

828
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
"There's no place like home. "

829
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,600
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

830
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,400
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.

831
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,300
That would suck.

832
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,500
Rotate.

833
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,600
Is that half the lawyer?

834
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,600
Here, take this. Move it.

835
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,200
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.

836
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,900
Oh, my God. Shit.

837
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,600
GirI, hurry up!

838
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,200
- Ram him!
- He's swinging for the fences!

839
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,000
Kalina, get over here!
This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!

840
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,400
Where is it?

841
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,400
Where is it?

842
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,100
Kalina?

843
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,900
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.

844
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,300
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.

845
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,200
I made sure your pathetic nephew
didn't get himself killed!

846
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,600
Kalina!

847
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,100
Where are the spells?

848
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,000
You're not mad at me, are you?

849
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,300
Of course not.

850
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,700
- What is it?
- Oh, shit.

851
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,400
There's only room for one of us.

852
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,100
What are you doing?

853
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,000
Don't worry, I've been looking for a reason
to like myself for a long time.

854
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,600
Dennis, don't do this!

855
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,400
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!

856
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,600
Dennis, no!

857
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,000
Oh, my God.

858
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,200
What do we do now?

859
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,400
Your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself will save his kids.

860
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,000
But he won't do it
unless his kids are in jeopardy.

861
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,600
- Well, put them in jeopardy.
- What?

862
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,200
- Why not?
- But they're kids.

863
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,400
Greatness requires sacrifice.

864
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,100
Now, I have a job to do.

865
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,500
And so have you.

866
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,000
Do it. Do it!

867
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,500
Yes.

868
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,900
And now to finish this.

869
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,600
Oh, my God. Jean.

870
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,900
I loved you so much.

871
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,800
I miss you.

872
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,300
Miss you.

873
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,500
I'm nothing without you.

874
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,500
Don't go.

875
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,200
Don't go.

876
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,500
Fetch the book.

877
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,100
Cyrus! What are you doing?

878
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,800
You just can't teach some people.

879
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:00,200
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

880
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,200
- Kathy!
- Bobby, don't look.

881
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,500
I don't want to look.

882
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,100
Kathy, I'm scared!

883
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,100
Kathy!

884
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,900
Kathy! Bobby!

885
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,600
Daddy!

886
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,000
Bobby!

887
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,600
Dad, help!

888
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,900
Oh, my...

889
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,200
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

890
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,200
This house is not a house. It's a machine...

891
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
...designed by the devil...

892
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,800
...and powered by the dead.

893
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,500
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

894
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,100
They represent the black zodiac.

895
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,100
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

896
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,800
- The First-Born Son.
- One.

897
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,100
- The Torso.
- Two.

898
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,300
- The Bound Woman.
- Three.

899
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,000
- The Withered Lover.
- Four.

900
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,900
The Torn Prince.

901
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,500
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.

902
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,700
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

903
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,600
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.

904
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,300
Twelve.

905
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,600
You're the thirteenth ghost.

906
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,100
If I'm the thirteenth...

907
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,100
You son of a bitch!

908
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,000
Release my kids, you bastard!

909
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,500
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!

910
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,100
Do you hear? You loser!

911
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,700
I've dedicated my entire life to this.

912
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,300
Every waking moment, for years.

913
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,200
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication? Have you?

914
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,100
The world has no time
for little people like you.

915
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,800
It needs people
who are willing to do anything!

916
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,000
Anything for greatness.

917
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:08,200
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

918
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,200
You will make that leap.

919
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,700
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

920
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,000
...out of an act of pure love.

921
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,600
That's why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic family.

922
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,100
Make it stop, Dad!

923
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,200
Congratulations,
you get to become the thirteenth ghost.

924
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,200
Get on your feet.

925
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,100
Come on!

926
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,200
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

927
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,300
You can finish this.

928
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
You still have the power in you.

929
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,600
It's just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.

930
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,100
Dad! Help!

931
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,800
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

932
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, fuck!

933
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,000
Dad!

934
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,600
Don't move!

935
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,000
Keep your heads down!

936
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,400
Hold on!

937
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,500
Everybody okay?

938
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,500
You okay?

939
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,200
How did you know we'd be safe here?

940
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,900
I didn't.

941
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,900
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.

942
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,600
I love you both so much.

943
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,800
Mom?

944
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,600
I love you guys.

945
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,100
I love you.

946
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,600
This is it for me.

947
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,100
I am on the first plane back to Newark.

948
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:32,100
I am sorry, family, Kathy,
Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...

949
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,900
...I am sick of this nanny shit.

950
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,800
I've had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
