13
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,125
Harold, please, not again the TV.

14
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:02,080
Ma! Come on, Ma! Why do you have
to make a big deal outta this?

15
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:05,563
You know you'll get the set back
in a couple of hours.

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,961
Why you gotta make me
feel so guilty, Ma?!

17
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,918
Jesus! What are you doing?

18
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:22,755
Trying to get me to break
my own mother's set? Or radiator?

19
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:25,002
And maybe blow up the house?

20
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:29,518
Your own flesh and blood! Is that
what you're trying to do? Your son?

21
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:35,078
Why you play games with my head,
for Christ's sake?

22
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:37,322
Harold, I wouldn't do that.

23
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:41,996
The chain isn't for you.
It's for the robbers.

24
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,003
Then why won't you come out?

25
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:46,686
(Rattles door)

26
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,924
See what I mean?
See how you always upset me, Ma?

27
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,605
Christ's sake.

28
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:04,926
(Sighs )

29
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,486
Ma?

30
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,686
Ma!

31
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:15,800
Come on out. Please, Ma?

32
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:21,322
Ah, screw it!

33
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,959
This isn't happening.

34
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:27,761
And if it should be happening,
it would be all right.

35
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:32,119
So don't worry, Seymour.
It'll all work out.

36
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,876
You'll see already.
In the end, it's all nice.

37
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:45,559
Shit, man. That motherfucker's
starting to look a little seedy.

38
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,563
You particular all of a sudden?

39
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:51,883
I don't care,
just as long as we get our bread.

40
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,646
Just give me a hand, Tyrone.

41
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,719

42
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,397
- Hello.
- (All) Hi.

43
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,925
Fuck, the table too!

44
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,437
What do you want?
You want me to schlep it on my back?

45
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:13,275
- You got a friend.
- I ain't my leper's schlepper.

46
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:17,400
Such a son. Your mother needs you
like a moose needs a hat rack.

(Music pauses )

50
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:45,278
Shit, man.

51
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,000
This is some boss scag, baby.

52
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:52,120
- I mean, dynamite.
- Oh, man, it's something else.

53
00:05:57,647 --> 00:05:59,444
You know what we need to do?

54
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,598
We need to get us a piece of this
Brody shit, cut it up and off it!

55
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,081
We could double our money... easy.

56
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,403
Buy some pieces
and we got some whole other shit.

57
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,244
That'd be righteous.

58
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:18,759
I'll bet in no time we'd get a pound
of pure straight from Sal the Geep.

59
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,035
oooh!

60
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,363
That's what I'm talking about,
baby - no hassles.

61
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,842
- How's it goin'?
- What's up, buddy?

62
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,037
- The usual?.
- Yeah, sounds good.

63
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,960
Anything else? Huh?

64
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:12,363
- (Waiter) Anything else?
- Ah, no.

65
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,523
Nothing. I'm all right.

66
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:25,999
- Good afternoon, Mrs Goldfarb.
- Good afternoon, Mr Rabinowitz.

67
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:29,039
Although I'm not so sure
how good it is. And you?

68
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,796
- What can I say? You want your TV?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

69
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,727
Mrs Goldfarb,
can I ask you a question?

70
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,564
You won't take it personal?.

71
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,922
How many years we know each other?
Who's to count?

72
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:46,562
Why not tell the police?
Maybe they could talk to Harry.

73
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:50,998
- He wouldn't be stealing the TV.
- I couldn't do that.

74
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:55,006
Harry's my only child.
He's all I have.

75
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,686

I mean, they give you everything.

110
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:37,076
They hook you up with an apartment,
a croaker shrink.

It's great. It's just...

money is never what I really
wanted from them, you know?

That's pretty much
all they have to give.

(Harry ) Why don't you
get away from 'em?

115

- How am I gonna do that?
- I don't know.

116

Well, in a box you'll catch it.

you'll look with your new red hair.

00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,841
That's a red. I mean, that's a red.

144
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:20,766
It's not a red red,
but that's a red. It's a red.

145
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,843
- Red?
- Yeah. It's a red.

146
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,879
- You're telling me that's red?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,724
Then what's orange?

148
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,839
If this is a red,
I want to know - what's orange?

149
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,039
Well, it could be...

150
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,645
that it's a little orange too.

151
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,836
You know something?

152
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:56,480
I always thought you were the most
beautiful girl I ever seen.

153
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,566
Really?

154
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,362
Ever since I first saw you.

155
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,477
That's nice, Harry.

156
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:17,323
That makes me feel really good.

157
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,167
Other people
have told me that before,

158
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,641
and it was meaningless.

159
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:36,881
Why? Because you thought
they were pulling your leg?

160
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,237
No, no, not like that. I mean...

161
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,757
I don't know. I don't know
or even care if they were.

162
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,923
Just from them it was...

163
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,397
just meaningless, you know?

164
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:55,837
When you say it, I hear it.

165
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,724
I really hear it.

166
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:10,037
Somebody like you could really
make things all right for me.

167
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,884
You think?

168
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,404
(Marion ) What is it?

169
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:19,484
(Harry ) Remember when I told you
about the store?

170
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:20,926
Yeah.

171
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,356
I've been thinking about it and...

172
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:26,638
I put together some numbers and...

173
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,678
and it's not impossible!

174
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:32,241
I mean, you know, you could do it.

175
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,118
You should do it!

176
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:37,000
I mean, we could do it together.

177
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,439
What do you think?

178
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,795
- (Stomach rumbling)
- Stop already.

179
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:53,398
You'll feel better in the red dress
than in the cheese Danish.

180
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,081
'Three things changed my life.
Three.'

181
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,721
(Audience ) 'Number one!
No red meat!'

182
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,759
'Think about it.
What do they stick in red meat?

183
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:41,119
'I ate red meat to the point where
I would eat it...right off, raw.

184
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,442
'I loved my meat!
I turned it around.

185
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,002
'You need to be committed.
You need to be passionate.

186
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:50,403
'No red meat for 30 days.
No red meat!

187
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,360
'Three things is all I did
to change my life. Three things.'

188
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:04,196
(Sizzling)

189
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:07,364
Ada told us. It's gorgeous.

190
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,477
We're gonna make it darker.

191
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,677
- Why?
- To go with my red dress.

192
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,605
- But it's looking like Madonna.
- It's not.

193
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,798
And neither is this.
But soon - I'm going on a diet.

194
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,407
- What diet?
- Eggs and grapefruit.

195
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:23,280
- I was on that. lots of luck.
- It's not so bad.

196
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,636
- How long you been on it?
- All day.

197
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:29,726
- All day! It's one o'clock!
- (All laugh)

198
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,201
- Thinking thin.
- She's thinking thin.

199
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:35,478
My louise, she lost 50lbs
just like that.

200
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,324
- like what?
- Poof!

201
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:40,484
- Did you put her in a sweatbox?
- (All laugh)

202
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,520
She went to a doctor. He gave
her pills. You don't want to eat.

203
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:50,039
So? You mean, I'm sitting here
not thinking about pastrami on rye?

204
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:53,159
Don't talk like that
when someone's on a diet.

205
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:56,483
Big deal. I'll sneak
another wedge of grapefruit.

206
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,883
- I'm thinking thin!
- Ooh, Sara, the mailman.

207
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,955
Sara Goldfarb? You have something
for me? I'm expecting something.

208
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:10,238
Goldfarb, Goldfarb. Sara Goldfarb.

209
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,596
- Is that it?
- That's it!

210
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,956
- Come on.
- I gotta get my stuff.

211
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,838
- All right.
- I can tell you.

212
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:19,959
Your name. Put your name.

213
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:23,124

215
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,800
Dynamite?

216
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:29,080
It's dynamite.

217
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,921
A-ha! Dynamite!

218
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,322
All right, we on our way.

219
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,723
- Brody's man says it's fine shit.
- All right, man.

220
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:42,326
- Here we go.
- Hey, Ty?

221
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,402
- let's do this right, man.
- Come on, baby. Naturally.

222
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:55,641
- Hurry, hurry. let's hurry.
- I wonder when you'll hear.

223
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:58,645
- Hi!
- I wanna come with you!

224
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:03,283
Maybe they'll send you to the
Tavern On The Green with the stars.

225
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,558
Yeah, eggs and grapefruit
at Tavern On The Green.

226
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:10,520
- I hope they have that.
- Hurry before the mailman comes.

227
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,364
- Here we are.
- Mail it!

228
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,716
(Woman ) Oh, Sara!

229
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,837
(Silence )

230
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,319
(lock turning)

231
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,805
- There it is, Jim.
- Huh?

232
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,841
- There it is, baby.
- Oh, shit!

233
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:36,005
- Shall we try it?
- Wait, Ty.

234
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:40,802
look, this is our chance
to make it big.

235
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:45,682
We play it right,
we can get a pound of pure.

236
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,400
But if we get wasted...

237
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:51,837
- we'll fuck it up.
- Right on.

238
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,357
Hey, look, I ain't trying
to jive you, Jim.

239
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:58,683
I don't wanna be runnin'
the streets my whole life,

240
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,763
my nose runnin' down to my chin.

241
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,880
All I'm sayin' is take a little
taste so we know how much to cut.

242
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:06,326
It's business.

243
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,319
Yeah, fair enough.

244
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,723
- Shit...
- (Both laughing)

245
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:37,555

- Sara.
- 'Yeah?'

266
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,437
I need the number
of that doctor.

267
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,443
(Harry ) I don't understand
why you gotta see him.

268
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:19,479
Cut the son of a bitch loose,
for Christ's sake.

269
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,725
Because he'll tell my parents
that I've stopped therapy.

270
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,759
They're already thinking
of cutting me off.

271
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,077
Harry, I'm not gonna sleep with him.

272
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:33,164
I'm gonna come home
after the concert.

273
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:35,402
You're jealous!

274
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,716
Harry - jealous?

275
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:43,244
- Put your arms around me.
- No.

276
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:46,324
You are so stubborn!
Put your arms around me.

277
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,245
Stop that!

278
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,886
- I'll suck your eyeballs out.
- Mm-hm.

279
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,280
Well...

280
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,558
I'm disappointed
that you're indisposed.

281
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,997
Is Anita out of town or something?

282
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,839
Why do you ask?

283
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:10,197
I was just wondering
if she was "indisposed".

284
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:16,126
No.

285
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:20,285
She's fine, thank you.
Actually, she's in Florida.

286
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:24,206
- Can I ask you something, Arnold?
- Of course.

287
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:29,519
Anything. What?

288
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,161
- You just have something here.
- Gone?

289
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,926
A little bit, a little bit lower.

290
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,481
It's OK. Don't worry.
It's much better.

291
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:38,926
Arnold!

292
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,717
How are you, Mrs Goldfarb?

293
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:47,476
How am I? Enormous.
That's why I'm here.

294
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:50,325
- I've seen much worse.
- Oh...thank you.

295
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,723
- How's your hearing and vision?
- I have both.

296
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:58,201
The doctor will be with you shortly.

297
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,446
- You're a little overweight.
- A little?

298
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,047
I have 50lbs
I'm willing to donate.

299
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,840
We can take care of that.
No problem.

300
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,164
We're on our way, baby.

301
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:06,516
We are on our way!

302
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:10,401
God, It was great out there.
I mean, everybody is thirsty.

303
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:13,245
Come to me. (laughing)

Got plenty of time for that.

Right now I'm grooving
with these new mirrors I got.

You don't have to make anything,
my sweet.

322
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,801

to love your mama, huh?

Huh?

325
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:06,359
- What ya doin', baby?
- Nothin'.

326
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,918
Just thinkin' about you.

327
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,365
About the nasty things
I'm about to do to ya.

00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,326
Ty, you scare me to death.

331
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:27,963
No, I wouldn't scare you.
I don't wanna scare nobody.

332
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:34,478
All I want out of life is a bit
of peace and happiness. That's all.

333

(Marion ) Hmm?

336
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:51,484
For my mother. I've been thinking
about getting something for her.

337
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:53,677
like...a present or something.

338
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:56,878
But I didn't know
what I was gonna get, until now.

339
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:59,566
- And?
- I finally asked myself, right,

340
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,996
what's her fix?

341
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,924
Television, right?

342
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,925
If ever there's a TV junkie,
it's the old lady.

343
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:10,243
I owe her a new set,
with all the wear and tear it got

344
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:13,359
being schlepped
back and forth to old Abe's.

345
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,523
You really love her, don't you?

346
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:20,236
I-I guess so. You know?

347
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,323
Most of the time
I just want her to be happy.

348
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,518
- let's go get it now.
- (Sighs )

349
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,842
let's push off first.

350
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,759
(Marion laughs )

351
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:38,436
It's early, Harry. We shouldn't
get going till tonight.

352
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:26,281
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

353
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,320
'Be excited. Be, be excited.

354
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,880
'Be excited.

355
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:33,316
'Be committed and be passionate.'

356
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:38,760
(Man ) 'I am a living testament.
65lbs thinner. I feel great!

357
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:50,156
'Number three. Ohhh, number three!

358
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:54,598
(Speaking very slowly)
'This drives most people crazy.

359
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:59,323
'This is easy so far.'

360
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:02,757
(Voice continues, slowing down )

361
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,722
(Children playing outside )

362
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:55,716
- That is thin!
- She's not the same person.

363
00:35:55,767 --> 00:36:00,158
I can almost zip the red dress.
I've almost got the zipper up.

364
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:02,004
- The mailman!
- Oh!

365
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,322
When I see it
I'll wave it all over.

366
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,927
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

367
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,516
- What did he say?
- Don't worry, Sara, it'll come.

368
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,956
Yeah, don't worry. It'll come.

369
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:17,120
It's Harry!

370
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,566
Harry, oh!

371
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:23,078
Hey, Ma, easy.
You'll crush me, for Christ sakes.

372
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,163
- Come inside.
- Hello.

373
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:29,086
(All) Hi, Harry! Hello!
(Sara ) We'll have a little visit.

374
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,880
So, how are you, Harry?
You look so good.

375
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,487
- You want something to eat?
- No, Ma.

376
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:38,645
A little nosh, a piece of cake?
I could go and get something.

377
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:41,963
I don't have anything in the house,
but Ada would.

378
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,396
A cupcake?
You want something to eat?

379
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:47,325
No, no, Ma, nothing. Please, sit.

380
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,200
You're making me dizzy,
for Christ's sake.

381
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:53,683
You notice anything, huh?
You notice I'm slimmer?

382
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:55,638
Yeah, I guess you are.

383
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:59,077
25lbs, I lost. 25lbs!
Can you believe it?

384
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:02,597
- And that's only the beginning.
- That's great, Ma.

385
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:06,037
I'm really happy for you.
But will you sit? Please.

386
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm sorry I haven't been around
in a while, Ma, but I've been busy.

387
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:16,920
Yeah? You got a good job?
You're doing well?.

388
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:20,084
- Yeah, good, real good.
- What kind of business?

389
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:24,564
Well, I'm sort of a distributor
like, for a big importer.

390
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:29,237
- Ohh! I'm so happy for you!
- Ma... Easy. You're killin' me.

391
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:31,960
Jesus, what,
you been lifting weights?

392
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:34,680
- I knew you could do that.
- You were right.

393
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:37,878
Now maybe you'll meet
a nice girl and have a baby?

394
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:41,562
Well, I already met one.

395
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:44,075
- (Squealing)
- Ma, don't go ape shit.

396
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:47,164
- Who is she? Who's her parents?
- You know her.

397
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:51,200
- Marion? Marion Silver. Remember?
- Oh, Silver!

398
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:54,159
of course. Manhattan Beach.

399
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:57,279
House on the esplanade.
Garment business.

400
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:59,397
He's big in women's undies.

401
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:04,123
Before you go bouncing all over
again and make me forget, just...

402
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:08,722
What I wanna tell you
is that I got you a present.

403
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,839
I don't need a present.
Just have a baby.

404
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:15,402
Will you let me tell you
what I got ya? Will ya, Ma?

405
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:20,645
Christ, you are really something
else today, you know that?

406
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,155
look, I know...

407
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:25,966
Well...

408
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:32,083
I'm sorry for being such a bastard.
I wanna make it up.

409
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:35,802
I mean, I know I can't change
anything that's happened,

410
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,156
but I want you to know that...

411
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,961
That I love ya, and that I'm sorry.

412
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:46,956
And I want you to be happy.
So I got you a brand-new TV set.

413
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:51,080
It's gonna be delivered in a
couple of days. It's from Macy's!

414
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:52,799
oh, Harry!

415
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:57,284
Your father'd be so happy

416
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,637
if he could see
what you're doing for your mother.

417
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:05,878
See that, Seymour?

418
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,964
(Grinding teeth)
You see how good your son is?

419
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:13,000
He knows what it's like
for his mother living all alone.

420
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,117
No one to visit her.

421
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,158
(Grinding teeth)

422
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,804
Hey, Ma.

423
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:30,361
- You on uppers?
- What?

424
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:34,161
You're on uppers.
You're on diet pills, ain't you?

425
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:36,641
I told you.
I'm going to a specialist.

426
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:39,963
That's what I thought!
You're on speed, ain't ya?

427
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:42,237
Harry, I'm goin' to a doctor.

428
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:45,597
- Does he give you pills?
- Of course. He's a doctor.

429
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:48,878
- What kind of pills?
- A purple, a blue, an orange...

430
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:50,804
I mean, like what's in 'em?

431
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:55,557
Oh, Harry, I'm Sara Goldfarb, not
Albert Einstein. How should I know?

432
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,440
Does it make you feel good
and give you pep?

433
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:01,081
Well... yeah, a little.

434
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:03,687
Ma, I can hear ya
grinding your teeth.

435
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,082
- That goes away at night.
- At night?

436
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:10,245
Yeah, when I take the green one.
30 minutes I'm asleep. Poof.

437
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:13,279
Ma, Ma, ya gotta
cut that stuff loose.

438
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,318
I'm tellin' ya, it's no good.

439
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:18,245
What do you mean it's no good?
25lbs I've lost.

440
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:20,801
So what? You wanna be a dope fiend?

441
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:25,238
Dope fiend? Am I foaming
at the mouth? He's a nice doctor.

442
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,482
I am telling you, he's no good.

443
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,520
How come you know so much? How
come you know more than a doctor?

444
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:37,001
Believe me, Ma, I know. All right?

445
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:40,077
You'll get strung out.

446
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,039
Ah, come on!
I almost fit in my red dress.

447
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,045
The one I wore
to your high school graduation.

448
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:48,282
The one your father liked so much.

449
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:52,366
oh, I remember how he looked at me
in that red dress.

450
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,077
Ma, what's the big deal
about the red dress?

451
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,316
I'm going to wear it at...

452
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,358
You don't know!

453
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:09,037
I'm gonna be on television.
I got a call and an application...

454
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,885
Come on, Ma, who's pulling your leg?

455
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,758
No, no, no. I'm tellin' ya.

456
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,879
I'm gonna be a contestant
on television.

457
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:19,441
They haven't told me when yet,

458
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:24,436
but you'll be proud when you see
your mother in her red dress on TV.

459
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:29,515
What is the big deal?. Those pills
will kill you before you get on.

460
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,478
"Big deal?. "

461
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,324
You drove up in a cab.

462
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,200
Did you see who had the best seat?

463
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,807
I'm somebody now, Harry.

464
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:41,315
Everybody likes me.

465
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:43,005
Soon...

466
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:46,926
millions of people will see me
and they'll all like me.

467
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:49,683
I'll tell them about you...

468
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:51,319
and your father.

469
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,798
How good he was to us.

470
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,439
Remember?

471
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,081
It's a reason
to get up in the morning.

472
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:06,717
It's a reason to lose weight,
to fit in the red dress.

473
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,317
It's a reason to smile.

474
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:15,124
It makes tomorrow all right.

475
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:19,721
(Sighs ) What have I got, Harry?

476
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:21,846
Hmm?

477
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:26,165
Why should I even make the bed
or wash the dishes?

478
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:29,517
I do them, but why should I?

479
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:32,319
I'm alone.

480
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:36,643
Your father's gone, you're gone.

481
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:41,395
I got no one to...

482
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,244
care for.

483
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:46,117
What have I got, Harry?

484
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,605
I'm lonely.

485
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,485
I'm old.

486
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,802
You got friends, Ma.

487
00:42:58,847 --> 00:43:01,042
It's not the same.

488
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,324
They don't need me.

489
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:11,283
I like the way I feel.

490
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,846
I like thinking
about the red dress...

491
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,766
and the television
and you and your father.

492
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,803
Now when I get the sun, I smile.

493
00:43:30,727 --> 00:43:32,479
I'll come and visit, Ma.

494
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:38,004
Now that I'm straight, m-my business
is going good, I'll come.

495
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:40,515
Me and Marion,
we'll come for dinner.

496
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:42,364
Good. You bring her.

497
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:45,046
I'll make you
mushroom soup and a roast.

498
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:49,118
That sounds great, Ma.
That sounds great.

499
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:52,842
- I'll call ahead, all right?
- OK.

500
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,159
I'm glad.

501
00:43:56,207 --> 00:44:00,997
I'm glad you have a nice girl
and your own business. I'm glad.

502
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:08,720
I gotta go, Ma.

503
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,964
I got an appointment in Manhattan
in a little bit,

504
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:13,838
but I'll be back.

505
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:17,402
- OK, y-you still got your key?
- Yeah, I got it, Ma.

506
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,359
Bye, Son.

507
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,204
(Door closes )

508
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,519
(Sighs )

509
00:44:57,767 --> 00:44:59,997
Brody says you comin' up quick.

510
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:03,164
oh. Thanks, man.

511
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:09,720
He says you're smart, you're loyal
and you're not a junkie.

512
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:15,038
Brody wants to promote you.

513
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,885
Give you more responsibility.
Interested?

514
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,838
Yeah, yeah!

515
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,843
Shit, yeah, man.

516
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,883
(Indistinct)

517
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:28,316
Brody says,
you fuck him, I kill you.

518
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,562
- I got that.
- Remember that.

519
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,203
Shit! You got a white driver!

520
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:44,604
- (Gunshots )
- Fuck!

521
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:48,957
- What the fuck?
- (Dog barking)

522
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:51,396
(Police siren wailing)

523
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,479
Don't move!

524
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:34,082
I love you, Harry.

525
00:46:37,207 --> 00:46:39,357
You make me feel like a person.

526
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:44,606
like I'm me...

527
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:48,044
and I'm beautiful.

528
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:51,643
You are beautiful.

529
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:59,043
You're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

530
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,597
You're my dream.

531
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:11,883
(Nurse ) 'No, I'm certain.
I've checked again.'

532
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:15,078
But maybe you gave me
a weaker one last time.

533
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:18,756
'That isn't possible.
They're all the same potency.'

534
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:20,798
But something isn't the same.

535
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:25,803
'You're becoming adjusted to them.
It's nothing to worry about, OK?'

536
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:27,246
(Click)

537
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,642
- 'We got a winner!'
- 'We got a winner!'

538
00:47:45,687 --> 00:47:48,918
'She's beautiful,
with a winning sense of humour

539
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,480
'and magical smile.

540
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,042
'From Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
let's welcome

541
00:47:54,087 --> 00:47:55,679
'Mrs Sara Goldfarb!'

542
00:47:55,727 --> 00:48:00,164
(Audience ) 'Juice by Sara!
Juice by Sara! Ohh, Sara!

543
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:04,997
'Sara's got juice!
Sara's got juice! Ohh, Sara!'

544
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:07,561
(Crash)

545
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,805
- (Door opens )
- (Guard) love, Tyrone C.

546
00:48:15,847 --> 00:48:18,407
Get your shit together.
You made bail.

547
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:20,039
How much?

548
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:23,363
Most of our cash.
You're up for consortin'.

549
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,204
oh, shit, man!

550
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:29,001
Angel says there's a war
between the Italians and Blacks.

551
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:33,165
Sal the Geep is keeping the shit
in Florida until Brody's gone.

552
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:34,196
Shit.

553
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,045
- No one's got a thing.
- Except Big Tim.

554
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:38,964
Shit. let's go see him.

555
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:41,805
He only givin' up for pussy.

556
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:43,326
What?

557
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,040
Pussy. He's hooked on it, man.

558
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:49,523
I'd give him all he wants.
He said I ain't cute enough.

559
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,839
(Tappy on TV)
'Come on, number three!

560
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,675
(Speaking very slowly)
'This drives most people crazy.

561
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:09,604
'They're not gonna like it.

562
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:13,162
'This is easy so far!
Give it up for 30 days, it will...'

563
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,519
(Gasps )

564
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:27,804
(Harry ) You all right?

565
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:32,875
Yeah. It was just a bad dream.

566
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,805
Want some water?

567
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,444
Maybe we should dip in now.

568
00:49:58,487 --> 00:50:01,240
Come on! I already told you,
all right?

569
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:04,879
It's all we have.

570
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,919
Tyrone is gonna score
in the morning, Harry.

571
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:15,124
I don't know, it's...

572
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,964
it's a bitch out there.

573
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,763
It'll be OK.

574
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,524
It'll be OK, Harry.

575
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,603
(Sighs ) Yeah...

576
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,399
I guess so.

577
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:41,083
I love you, Harry.

578
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:21,886
(Talking very fast) What's
the problem? The weight's fine.

579
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:24,202
The weight's fine, I'm not.

580
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:27,278
The refrigerator...

581
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:28,726
(Crash)

582
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,564
Something wrong?

583
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:34,399
Everything's...

584
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:40,563
all mixed up.

585
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:43,167
- Confused...
- Nothing to worry about.

586
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:46,279
Get this filled.
Make an appointment for a week.

587
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:56,600
Well?.

588
00:51:57,687 --> 00:51:59,803
Ty ain't found nothin' yet.

589
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:03,484
What are we gonna do?

590
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:05,404
I don't know.

591
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:08,007
Well, you have
to do something, Harry.

592
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:10,277
It's your fault
we don't have anything.

593
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:14,320
- What?
- You were all hot last night.

594
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:18,076
- That is such bullshit!
- We could've had something...

595
00:52:18,127 --> 00:52:21,881
Was I supposed to watch you
push off and not go myself?

596
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,963
Don't put it all on me, OK?

597
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:28,721
(Door slams )

598
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,838
Don't worry, man.
We'll fill it up again.

599
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:40,644
Things'll get better,

600
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:44,077
then we'll be fillin'
the box back up, you know?

601
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:53,520
(Tyrone ) So,
you wanna hear the news?

602
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:55,364
(Harry ) What news?

603
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:58,956
(Tyrone ) You got your good news,
you got your bad news.

604
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,599
Shoot.

605
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,444
Good news is,

606
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:05,320
there's gonna be
some prime on the street.

607
00:53:06,327 --> 00:53:08,841
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

608
00:53:08,887 --> 00:53:10,878
Who told you that?

609
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:14,037
- Angel.
- Yeah?

610
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:18,365
Sal the Geep sent word to let
a couple of keys go for Christmas,

611
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,477
him being a good Christian and all,

612
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:23,485
not wantin' bad feelin'
during the season.

613
00:53:23,527 --> 00:53:25,961
- You believe it?
- Well, I did...

614
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,918
till I heard the bad news.

615
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:29,844
(Footsteps )

616
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:35,245
(Harry ) Yeah?

617
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:38,085
Price is double.
You have to cop for weight.

618
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:41,324
- At least a half a piece.
- How much?

619
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,438
- Two.
- Two?

620
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,445
- That's fuckin' insane!
- What you gonna do?

621
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:49,955
Man ain't gonna
lay no nickel bag on ya.

622
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,759
Where we gonna get two?

623
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:53,877
You mean Arnold?

624
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:57,681
Well, your parents
won't even return your call.

625
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:00,918
I haven't seen him in months.

626
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:04,846
- So? He's still callin', ain't he?
- I don't know.

627
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,920
look, I don't know what else to do.

628
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:11,720
It's our last chance
to get back on track!

629
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:15,237
We won't have to make
the freezing scene every day!

630
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,284
We need the bread.

631
00:54:19,327 --> 00:54:22,763
Getting the money
is not the problem, Harry.

632
00:54:22,807 --> 00:54:24,877
What is the problem?

633
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,760
I don't know
what I'll have to do to get it.

634
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:36,079
look...

635
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:37,765
Baby...

636
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:41,761
we'll be back in business
in no time.

637
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:44,917
We'll start movin' again,

638
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:47,117
and we'll start savin'.

639
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:53,039
It'll be perfect, just like it was.
I promise, Marion.

640
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:58,239
You'll see.

641
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:11,800
No, I've just, uh...I've had this
flu forever, it seems like.

642
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:16,483
- Are you depressed?
- No, it's nothing like that.

643
00:55:16,527 --> 00:55:19,166
I've been, uh...
I've been really busy.

644
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:22,836
Actually,
I've been designing...non-stop.

645
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:26,357
Wonderful.
Glad to hear you've been productive.

646
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:32,764
To be perfectly frank,

647
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,560
I was a little surprised
to hear from you.

648
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:42,766
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Why?

649
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:48,006
Well, it's usually the case...
from someone you haven't heard from.

650
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:50,638
Everything's fine.

651
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:55,965
Actually,

652
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:01,797
I have a favour to ask.

653
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:07,399
(Screaming)

654
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,519
You smug fuck!

655
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,285
What is it?

656
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:18,965
I need some money.

657
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:21,202
May I ask what for?

658
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:26,880
- Could you turn the light off?
- Why do you want the light off?

659
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:28,804
I just do.

660
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:32,566
- You never did before.
- Please, Arnold.

661
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:58,840
(Indistinct commentary )

662
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:51,479
(Door slams )

663
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,364
(lift bell rings )

664
00:58:36,087 --> 00:58:38,078
(Thunder crashes )

665
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:55,875
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, man.

666
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,964
All Angel said
was meet at Waldbaum's.

667
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:05,562
- Is this the right Waldbaum's?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

668
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:10,157
You just watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

669
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,161
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Hey.

670
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:30,363
Everyone and their mother.

671
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,402
The truck's gonna be here.
Back up.

672
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,441
Back up.

673
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,483
(All cheering)

674
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:54,641
(Cheering)

675
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,361
(Arguing)

676
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:56,763
(Horn honking)

677
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:00,444
Come back!

678
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:07,079
Stupid fuckin' junkie!
We're fucked! We are fucked.

679
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:09,197
Sitting in that hot-ass sun

680
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:12,478
while we sit here ass deep
in motherfuckin' snow.

681
01:02:16,127 --> 01:02:17,924
What if we went down there?

682
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,561
- Are you serious?
- Why not?

683
01:02:20,607 --> 01:02:22,518
What the fuck are you sayin'?

684
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:26,765
We ask some room clerk at some hotel
for a connection?

685
01:02:26,807 --> 01:02:30,595
You saying you can't nose out
some dope when it's around?

686
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:33,445
Man, we got nothin' to lose.
It's wide open.

687
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:37,366
And if we get there right away
we can name our own price,

688
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:40,479
and have those fools
cover the street for us.

689
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:47,118
Yeah, man. last summer was
a motherfuckin' ball, huh, Jim?

690
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:55,200
Just seems like a thousand years ago
since last summer, man.

691
01:02:55,247 --> 01:02:57,283
It'll be like that again, man.

692
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:03,596
I could get Angel
to get us a short...

693
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:06,286
if we promise him
some dynamite scag.

694

700
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:23,036
Thank God. Where have you been?

701
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:25,521
Where the hell you think I've been?

702
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:29,399
- Where's the score?
- We had a bit of a problem.

703
01:04:29,447 --> 01:04:33,156
I mean, everything was goin' good,
and then...

704
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,675
- some dumb-ass junkie...
- Did what?

705
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:39,003
Some dumb-ass junkie did what?!
You fucked up?!

706
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:43,245
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- You promised it was gonna be OK.

707
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:47,041
I fucked that sleaze-bag.
I put myself through hell for you!

708
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:51,638
- There's nothing out there!
- I don't give a shit! Fucking loser!

709
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:56,562
You wanna be sure
we have some extra?

710
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:59,405
Ty told me about a guy
holding some weight.

711
01:04:59,447 --> 01:05:01,563
But he ain't sellin' it!

712
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,518
(Ty ) 'Yeah?'

713
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,206
- Gimme that guy's number.
- 'What guy?'

714
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:08,636
- The guy who likes broads!
- 'Why?'

715
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,518
Just gimme the number!

716
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:14,276
'All right. 934-8777.'

717

You worried so much,
go fix yourself up with him!

718
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:23,958
You won't have to fuckin' wait
and I won't freeze my ass off!

When is he gonna be back?

796
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:33,639
A few days?
Angel, what am I supposed to do?

797
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:36,718
Please, you gotta help me.

798
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:39,600

Anything. Help me.

I'm gonna be on television.

I'm Sara Goldfarb.

803
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:58,160
And you should tell me
when I'm gonna be on television.

804
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,721
Just sit for a moment.
I'll ring them.

I just wanna know when.

806
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:08,281
Maybe you lost my card! Please,
have a look, and you'll tell me.

807
01:12:08,327 --> 01:12:13,082
It's not the prizes.
I'll give them away. (Chuckles )

808
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:15,197
I just wanna be on the show.

809
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,556
I've waited so long...

810
01:12:17,607 --> 01:12:22,123
to be on with my Harry
and my grandson.

811
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,556
Here, Mrs Goldfarb, sip this.

812
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:28,919
Sometimes it takes a while to get
called for a show, Mrs Goldfarb.

813

- Oh. Oooh.

- Can you walk?
- I'm walkin' across the stage!

816
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,883
And you should see
my Harry on television.

817
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:46,043
We're giving the prizes away.

818
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:49,875
(Sobbing) I just wanted
to be on the show!

819
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:55,320

- We think it's Sara Goldfarb.

820

Tell Seymour to meet me
at the beauty parlour.

821
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:02,846
I've got the red dress that
I wore to Harry's graduation.

822
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:05,196

836
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:27,684
Whoo.

837
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:38,125
oh, shit!

838
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:40,601
God damn! How long you had that?

839
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:45,118
- Just a few days.
- That shit don't look too good.

840
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:47,476
It don't feel too good either, man.

841
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:52,123
But a little stuff
will take care of that.

842
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:54,123
Hey! Don't shoot in there!

843
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,397
I'll blow it if I don't.

844
01:14:57,207 --> 01:14:58,799
Fuck it.

845
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:09,040

(Buzzer)

848
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:29,964
- Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?
- Yes, Seymour.

849
01:15:30,007 --> 01:15:33,397
- Take anything?
- I took my red dress and...

850
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:36,041
- No emergency. Take her to psych.
- Television.

851
01:15:46,687 --> 01:15:48,279
Come on in.

852
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:52,486
Thanks.

853
01:15:57,647 --> 01:15:59,399
What's your name?

854
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:02,959
Marion.

855
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:04,884
Well, what do you know?

856
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,758
Maid Marion.

857
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:09,195
(Chuckles )

858
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:15,083
I'm little John.

859
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:19,280
Beautiful view.

860
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,921
You know what I like
about paddy chicks?

861
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:25,681
They give good head. (Chuckles )

862
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,321
Black broads
know nothin' about head.

863
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:30,164
I don't know why.

864
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:33,677
Maybe it's to do
with some ancient tribal custom.

865
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:35,524
(Chuckling)

866
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,518
Come here.

867
01:16:52,647 --> 01:16:55,878
Mmm. Better save
some of that energy.

868
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:14,721
oh, I know it's pretty, baby,

869
01:17:14,767 --> 01:17:16,678
but I didn't take it out for air.

870
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:28,997
Yeah. (Chuckles )

871
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:36,637
I told your ass,
stay away from that arm. See?

872
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:40,277
I gotta call Marion, man.

873
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:43,444
That's about to be
a long-distance call now.

874
01:17:43,487 --> 01:17:48,117
That's 600 miles!
We are 600 miles closer to Miami.

875
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:51,682
It's also 600 miles
further away from New York.

876
01:17:56,767 --> 01:17:59,156
I know where to get
a real nice taste,

877
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,005
though it's more like play.
Sunday night?

878
01:18:02,047 --> 01:18:05,562
We're throwing a little gathering.
All good people.

879
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:07,643
I can't, I'm busy.

880
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:09,882
Anyway, I'm not really hooked.

881
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:13,044
Oh, I know,
but it's a real nice taste.

882
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:21,397
I'll see you Sunday, Maid Marion.

883
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:25,521
OK, just try
and answer my questions.

884
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:30,243
- When did you start taking pills?
- Oh, the summer.

885
01:18:30,287 --> 01:18:34,121
- You started last summer?
- I got the best place in the sun.

886
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:38,001
- Ada fixed my hair.
- Everything is gonna be all right.

887
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,436
We'll get you fixed up in no time.

888
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,886
(Screaming)

889
01:19:00,927 --> 01:19:03,725
- Hold tight, man.
- I can't fucking cut it.

890
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:05,997
I gotta do something about my arm.

891
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:07,844
let me see what it looks like.

892
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:16,957
oh, damn, Jim!

893
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,486
oh, man.

894
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:22,121
That's one ugly motherfucker.

895
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,681
- I gotta call Marion.
- Fuck that.

896
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:27,287
We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

897
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:33,799
What is that?

898
01:19:33,847 --> 01:19:37,317
I don't want that.
I don't want that!

899
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:39,562
Ah! Oh...

900
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:48,002
(Heavy footsteps )

901
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,965
- (Phone )
- (Groaning)

902
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:16,198
What's the problem?

903
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:20,206
- It's my arm. My arm is killin' me.
- let's have a look at it.

904
01:20:21,247 --> 01:20:22,805
(Gasping)

905
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,600
All right.

906
01:20:29,727 --> 01:20:31,558
I'll be back in a minute.

907
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:59,317
I wanna play blackjack
all night long.

908
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:04,077
So I make up this routine. I say,
"you go ahead. I don't feel good."

909
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:06,083
Sure enough, they leave...

910
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,402
Ready? One, two and three.

911
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:12,117
As soon as they leave,

912
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,523
I go running back to the casino,
sit at my blackjack table.

913
01:21:15,567 --> 01:21:17,558
I am there for the whole night.

914
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:23,318
Finally, I get up so big, I got
five $100 black chips in my pocket.

915
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:25,881
I swear to God.
The hours are going by.

916
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:29,715
I'm laying back, hittin' on
hard 17 s. It was beautiful.

917
01:21:29,767 --> 01:21:31,917
- (Groaning)
- Next thing I know,

918
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:36,597
this security guard is sitting there
telling me I have to leave.

919
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:39,878
I'm like, "Why you telling me
I have to leave?"

920
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:42,282
He says,
"You have to leave because..."

921
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:44,318
(Continues indistinct)

922
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:49,359
Swallow.

923
01:21:52,847 --> 01:21:55,486
(Slowly) Swallow.

924
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:05,322
(Indistinct announcement on PA)

925
01:22:11,687 --> 01:22:13,996
(Footsteps approaching)

926
01:22:23,727 --> 01:22:27,436
You have to eat. If we're gonna
get you healthy you have to eat.

927
01:22:27,487 --> 01:22:31,844
Work with the attendants.
I'm gonna try some new medications.

928
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,556
(Groaning)

929
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,921
(Groaning)

930
01:23:05,287 --> 01:23:07,926
(Muffled screaming)

931
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:23,478
(Phone ringing)

932
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:33,877
- Hello.
- (Harry ) 'Marion.'

933
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:37,005
Harry?

934
01:23:37,687 --> 01:23:41,999
'Marion, I've been
thinking about you so much.

935
01:23:42,047 --> 01:23:43,799
'Are you OK?'

936
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:50,435
- When you comin' home?
- Soon.

937
01:23:50,487 --> 01:23:51,920
When?

938
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:54,766
Soon.

939
01:23:55,847 --> 01:23:59,203
- 'You holdin' out all right?'
- Harry?

940
01:24:01,047 --> 01:24:03,322
Can you come today?

941
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:09,316
(Sighs ) Yeah.

942
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:12,923
(Sobbing)

943
01:24:15,407 --> 01:24:17,284
I'll come.

944
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:20,558
(Sobbing) 'I'll come today.'

945
01:24:24,967 --> 01:24:28,004
You just wait for me, all right?

946
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:34,397
- OK, Harry.
- 'I'm coming back, Marion.'

947
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:36,244
- Yeah.
- 'Marion?'

948
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:37,640
Yeah?

949
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:41,321
I'm really sorry, Marion.

950
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,164
I know.

951
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:46,924
(Phone beeps off)

952
01:24:51,927 --> 01:24:53,804
(Doctor) Mrs Goldfarb?

953
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:57,485
You all right?

954
01:24:58,967 --> 01:25:04,405
Um, so, Mrs Goldfarb,
we've tried several medications,

955
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:06,836
and you don't seem to be responding.

956
01:25:06,887 --> 01:25:10,766
I believe we might want to try
some alternative methods.

957
01:25:10,807 --> 01:25:14,561
We've had excellent results
with ECT in the past.

958
01:25:14,607 --> 01:25:16,837
Um... So if I can just...

959
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:19,447
get your John Hancock...

960
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:22,405
we'll get underway.

961
01:25:22,447 --> 01:25:23,880
Great. Thanks.

962
01:25:25,087 --> 01:25:28,045
(Groaning) Oh, Jesus Christ!

963
01:25:28,087 --> 01:25:30,362
I need a doctor, man.

964
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:33,479
My friend is sick.
Give him some help, please.

965
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:37,042
I can't take it, man!
My arm! My fuckin' arm!

966
01:25:38,407 --> 01:25:40,318
(Screaming) Help me!

967
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:44,599
Help us!
Somebody fuckin' help us, please!

968
01:25:58,807 --> 01:26:01,401
(Door opens )

969
01:26:04,087 --> 01:26:07,159
Maid Marion. Welcome. (Chuckling)

970
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:09,198

OK for work.
Can you hear me? Can you see me?

987
01:26:45,887 --> 01:26:47,684
Yes. Oof!

988
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:51,402
Say, "sir". Goddam New York
dope fiend niggers.

989
01:26:51,447 --> 01:26:53,403
learn some manners.

990
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:55,597

993
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:04,286
Says something's wrong
with his arm.

994
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:05,680
(Screams )

995
01:27:05,727 --> 01:27:08,446
He won't be puttin'
any more dope in that.

996
01:27:08,487 --> 01:27:10,796
- Smells worse than he do.
- Test.

997
01:27:10,847 --> 01:27:13,759
(Prison doctor) Get him
over to hospital.

998
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:16,560
- (Groaning)
- Ready? And...one.

999
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,996
(Grinding hum )

1000
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:23,878
(Cheering)

1001
01:27:26,807 --> 01:27:29,605
(Beeping)

1002
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,160
(Man ) That's the trouble
with you dope fiends.

1003
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:44,516
You got a rotten attitude. You know?

1004
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:48,558
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Ass to ass.

1005
01:27:48,607 --> 01:27:52,236
- (Men laughing)
- Ass to ass!

1006
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:04,156
Put your spineless back into it!
Come on!

1007
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:08,766
Ready? And...two!

1008

(Cheering)

1011
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:21,442
- Put it in there!
- That's it.

1012
01:28:21,487 --> 01:28:24,445
Nice and easy.

1013
01:28:24,487 --> 01:28:27,559
(Guard) Mashed potatoes!

1014
01:28:27,607 --> 01:28:30,246
Here's the close.
I need one gram. Bingo.

1015
01:28:30,287 --> 01:28:31,561
(Gasps )

1016
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:35,919
(Man ) Don't give up. Don't give up.
Move it, move it, move it!

1017
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:38,559
- OK.
- (Moans )

1018
01:28:38,607 --> 01:28:41,121
Ready? And...three!

(Grinding hum )

1020
01:28:45,967 --> 01:28:48,686
Cum! Cum! Cum! Cum!

1021
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:53,839
We're gonna take it off
at the shoulder.

1022
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:56,640
(Men chanting) Cum! Cum! Cum! Cum!

1023
01:28:56,687 --> 01:28:58,678
(Chanting continues )

1024
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:03,320
Saw.

1025
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:28,485
