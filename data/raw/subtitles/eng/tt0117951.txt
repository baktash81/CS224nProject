70
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:21,814
Closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,191
poisoning your body with that shite.

84
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,945
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.

85
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,572
Stuffing your veins with that filth.

Yeah. No more.

The Sick Boy method.

94
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,347
Well, it really worked for him, eh?

95
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,349
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.

96
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,725
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.

97
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,061
That's hardly a substitute.

98
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,980
You need one more hit.

99
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:45,147
No, I don't think so.

100
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,483

<i>We called him Mother Superior</i>

106
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:23,769
<i>For this you will need one

107
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:27,815
<i>Soothing music.
Tomato soup, 10 tins of.</i>

108
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,695
<i>Mushroom soup, 8 tins of

Mikey. Hi.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.

123
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,701
Look, could you help me out?

124
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:23,621
<i>This was typical of Mikey Forrester.</i>

125
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:26,499

134
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:45,851
That's all I've got, man.

135
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,728
Take it or leave it.

136
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,658
Are you feeling better now?

137
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,285
For all the good they've done me,

138
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,079
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.

139
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,292
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

140
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,502
<i>The heroin from my last hit

141
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,879
<i>The suppositories have yet to melt.</i>

142
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,673
Ohh!

143
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,593
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

144
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:30,021
<i>I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.</i>

145
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,691
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,</i>

146
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:37,111
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,</i>

147
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:41,407
<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

148
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,911
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

149
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,382
Ohh.

150
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,016
Fuck.

151
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,101
Ohh! Oh!

152
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,023
Ahh.

153
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:42,653
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

154
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,151
<i>And now.</i>

155
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:23,945
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

156
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:26,739
<i>The downside of coming off junk</i>

157
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,783
<i>was I knew I would mix
with my friends</i>

158
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,826
<i>in a state of full consciousness.</i>

159
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,245
<i>It was awful.</i>

160
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,788
<i>They reminded me of myself.</i>

161
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,623
<i>I could hardly bear to look at them.</i>

162
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:37,333
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.</i>

163
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,126
<i>He came off junk at the same time.</i>

164
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:41,045
<i>Not because he wanted to.</i>

165
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:42,129
<i>Just to annoy me.</i>

166
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,257
<i>Just to show me
how easily he could do it,</i>

167
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,801
<i>thereby downgrading
my own struggle.</i>

168
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,928
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

169
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:52,098
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>

170
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:53,975
<i>he insisted on telling me once again</i>

171
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,060
<i>about his unifying theory of life.</i>

172
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:59,480
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

173
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:00,898
What do you mean?

174
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,151
Well, at one point,
you've got it.

175
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,821
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

176
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,614
All walks of life.

177
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,618
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

178
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:15,288
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

179
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,373
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.

180
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:20,251
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

181
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,836
In your heart, you kind of know

182
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,382
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

183
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,052
So who else?

184
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:34,682
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

185
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:38,311
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?

186
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:43,024
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

187
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,027
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

188
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,155
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

189
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,532
And what about "The Untouchables"?

190
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,285
I don't rate that at all.

191
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:56,495
Despite the Academy Award?

192
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:59,040
That means fuck all.

193
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,125
It's a sympathy vote.

194
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,505
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

195
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,549
Yeah.

196
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,593
That's your theory?

197
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,012
Yeah.

198
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,474
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

199
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,769
Give me the gun.

200
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,021
Give me the gun.

201
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,780
Do you see the beast?

202
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,199
Have you got it in your sights?

203
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,743
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

204
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:40,581
This should present
no significant problems.

205
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,923
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

206
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:53,803
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

207
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,972
No! Get off!

208
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,558
<i>Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful</i>

209
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,726
<i>and fulfilling life as a good citizen.</i>

210
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,401
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

211
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:11,571
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

212
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,573
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

213
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,408
"This cunt is not trying."

214
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,618
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

215
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,203
But then again, try too hard...

216
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,122
You might get the fucking job.

217
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,039
Exactly.

218
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:22,915
Nightmare.

219
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,585
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

220
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,337
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

221
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:30,715
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

222
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

223
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,553
Try some of this, Spud.

224
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,806
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

225
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,435
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

226
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,396
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

227
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,481
There's too much discrimination
in this town.

228
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:48,774
They're both schools.

229
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,443
We're all in this together.

230
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:53,279
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

231
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,906
People get hung up on details.

232
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,325
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

233
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,160
It could be six.
Could be none.

234
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,494
It's not important.

235
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,706
What is important is that I am, yes?

236
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,710
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?

237
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:08,961
No!

238
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:12,131
Yes, only to get my foot in the door.

239
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,549
Showing initiative and that.

240
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,760
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.

241
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,721
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"

242
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:20,348
as you put it.

243
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:23,142
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

244
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,144
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

245
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:28,606
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

246
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,942
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you

247
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,985
to the leisure industry?

248
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:36,656
In a word, pleasure.

249
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:39,033
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

250
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,536
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

251
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:47,541
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

252
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:48,542
Yes, I am.

253
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:51,754
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

254
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,548
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

255
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:58,010
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

256
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,846
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

257
00:16:02,306 --> 00:16:04,141
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

258
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:07,061
We'll let you know.

259
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:08,187
The pleasure was mine.

260
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,856
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.</i>

261
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,902
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

262
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,531
Picture the scene.

263
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:21,158
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

264
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:22,577
Me and Tommy playing pool.

265
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,954
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

266
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,957
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

267
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,251
So it comes to the last shot.

268
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,503
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.

269
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,171
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,

270
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,257
looking all fucking biscuit-arsed,

271
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,509
when this hard cunt comes in.

272
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:41,345
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

273
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,180
Starts staring at me.

274
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,891
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,

275
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,643
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."

276
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:48,728
You know me.

277
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:51,063
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

278
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:53,774
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

279
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,361
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

280
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:00,489
So I squares up, casual like.

281
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:04,535
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

282
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,870
Shites it.

283
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:09,832
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

284
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:14,128
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

285
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,717
<i>And that was it.</i>

286
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,594
<i>That was Begbie's story.</i>

287
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,096
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.</i>

288
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,141
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

289
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,060
<i>You always got the truth from Tommy.</i>

290
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,937
<i>It was one of his major weaknesses.</i>

291
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,105
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,</i>

292
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,149
<i>and he never cheated on anyone.</i>

293
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,276
It was Wednesday morning.

294
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,320
We were in the volley playing pool.

295
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,821
That much is true.

296
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:45,034
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

297
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,828
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

298
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:49,413
never mind pot a ball.

299
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,499
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.

300
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,377
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

301
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:57,088
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

302
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,924
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.

303
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:02,510
Oh, fuck's sake.

304
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:06,597
So he's got the hump, right?

305
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:10,059
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do

306
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,186
is to pot the black to win one game

307
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:13,980
to salvage a little bit of pride

308
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,649
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

309
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:20,820
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

310
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,825
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

311
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:28,703
Fuck!

312
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,496
Aah!

313
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,374
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

314
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,835
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.

315
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:36,877
Can you believe it?

316
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,838
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

317
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,047
Fuck off!

318
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,425
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

319
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,927
Then I thought he was going to do me.

320
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:50,474
The beggar's fucking psycho, man.

321
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:55,187
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

322
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,981
Can I borrow this?

323
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:59,191
<i>What indeed could one do?</i>

324
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,986
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.</i>

325
00:19:03,863 --> 00:19:06,782
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.</i>

326
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:10,703
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.</i>

327
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,916
Nobody move!

328
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,501
That lassie got glassed,

329
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,755
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

330
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,381
Who the fuck are you?

331
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,717
Yes!

332
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,552
Ohh!

333
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,447
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!

334
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,244
Oh, Lizzy!

335
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:52,370
Oh, Lizzy!

336
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:54,747
Oh, Tom, come in me!

337
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,040
<i>And as I sat watching</i>

338
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:58,501
<i>the intimate
and highly personal video,</i>

339
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,796

00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,923
<i>I realized that something important</i>

341
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,968

346
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,681
I read it in "Cosmopolitan."

347
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:55,349
It's an interesting theory.

348
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,018
Actually, it's a nightmare.

349
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,603
I've been desperate for a shag,

350
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:01,939
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

351
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:03,649
You should try it with Tommy.

352
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:07,111
What, and deny myself the only
pleasure I get from him?

353
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:08,738
Did I tell you about my birthday?

354
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:09,572
What happened?

355
00:21:09,697 --> 00:21:12,158

Useless motherfucker.

00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,771
What are you two talking about?

357
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,689

359
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:46,692

385
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,142
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

386
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:45,770
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner

387
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:47,355
in which you dealt with that.

388
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,899
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."

389
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:50,983
Thanks.

390
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,985
- What's your name?
- Diane.

391
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,154
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

392
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,989
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

393
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,032
Great.

394
00:23:58,157 --> 00:23:59,242
What?

395
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:02,787
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

396
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,289
Do you find that this approach
usually works?

397
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:07,875
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

398
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,003
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

399
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:14,048
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

400
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,967
but if I'm prepared to take a chance,

401
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,219
I might just get to know the inner you.

402
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:22,723
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.

403
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:24,725
Taxi!

404
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,228
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

405
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:31,315
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?

406
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:35,570
Well, what's wrong, boy?

407
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,154
Cat got your tongue?

408
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,323
I left something.

409
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,326
Are you getting in or not, pal?

410
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,516
Do you understand?

411
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,895
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

412
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:11,022
Generous but firm.

413
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:11,856
What?

414
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:15,276
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

415
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:19,989
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

416
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:21,407
Right?

417
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,254
Diane.

418
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,422
Shh!

419
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:37,173
What?

420
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,425
Shut up!

421
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:21,634
Wake up, Spud.

422
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:23,761
Wake up.

423
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,638
Sex.

424
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,808
Casual sex.

425
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:38,818
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

426
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:39,860
Now?

427
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:42,655
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

428
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:45,491
So let's see what I'm missing.

429
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:01,966
Not much.

430
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,303
Pushed forward again.

431
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:07,346
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

432
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,390
picking it up from the outside.

433
00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:10,892
I think he wants to go himself.

434
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:13,185
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

435
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,687
And he scores!

436
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,481
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

437
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:19,692
Gemmill at his very best!

438
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:22,862
What a penetrating goal that was!

439
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:24,655
I haven't felt that good

440
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:28,159
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

441
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,414
You can't sleep here.

442
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,750
- What?
- Out.

443
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,043
Come on!

444
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:39,879
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

445
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,380
It's up to you.

446
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:45,176
And don't make any noise.

447
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,762
Jesus!

448
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,187
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

449
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,982
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

450
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,778
I might have returned it by mistake.

451
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:04,904
Returned it?

452
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,866
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

453
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,577
The fucking video shop?

454
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:16,040
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

455
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:19,794

00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:00,394
Right.

474
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:04,982

475
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:08,527
Flatmates?

476
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,488
I must remember that one.

477
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:13,449
Morning.

Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

480
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:36,389
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

481
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,893
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

482
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:44,105
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

483
00:30:45,189 --> 00:30:49,068
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

484
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:51,195
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

485
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,574
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.

486
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:57,577
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

487
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,412
I'll put the sheets in the machine.

488
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,581
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

489
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:03,416
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

490
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,542
It's no problem for me.

491
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,252
I'd rather take care of it myself.

492
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:07,587
Honestly, it's no problem.

493
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,588
Really, no!

494
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,923
Spud, they're my sheets!

495
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,604
I don't see why not.

496
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,397
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

497
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,565
What? Holding hands?

498
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:28,774
Not holding hands.

499
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,443
In that case, you can do it.

500
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:31,736
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

501
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:32,862
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

502
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:34,488
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

503
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:36,157
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?

504
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:38,659
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

505
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:40,745
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

506
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,122
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

507
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:46,125
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

508
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:49,587
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

509
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,383
I'll see you around then.

510
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:08,981
Now what?

511
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:10,650
We're going for a walk.

512
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:11,776
What?

513
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,527
A walk!

514
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:15,446
Where?

515
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,114
There!

516
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:20,660
Are you serious?

517
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,445
Well, what are you waiting for?

518
00:32:56,946 --> 00:32:58,197
Tommy.

519
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:02,034
This is not natural, man.

520
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:05,246
It's the great outdoors!

521
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,914
It's fresh air.

522
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,042
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,

523
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:13,045
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

524
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,089
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?

525
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:18,050
It's shite being Scottish!

526
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:20,261
We're the lowest of the low.

527
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:22,722
The scum of the fucking Earth.

528
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,224
The most wretched,
miserable, servile,

529
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,936
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization.

530
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,938
Some people hate the English.
I don't.

531
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:32,732
They're just wankers.

532
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:36,402
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.

533
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:40,531
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.

534
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:43,409
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

535
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:45,703
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy,

536
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:47,204
and all the fresh air in the world

537
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:49,999
won't make any fucking difference!

538
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,843
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:03,721
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.

540
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:05,306
<i>At or around this time,</i>

541
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:07,892
<i>Spud, Sick Boy, and I made
a healthy, informed,</i>

542
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:11,646
<i>Democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

543
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,940
<i>It took about 12 hours.</i>

544
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:21,113
<i>It looks easy, this,
but it's not.</i>

545
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,033
<i>It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.</i>

546
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:28,996
<i>But living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>

547
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:50,142
Ursula Andress.

548
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:52,520
The quintessential Bond Girl.

549
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,689
That's what everyone says.

550
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:58,985
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

551
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,488
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual,

552
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:07,827
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

553
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,078
Shite.

554
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,705
I mean, let's face it, mate.

555
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,582
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,

556
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,792
she'd shag
the whole fucking lot of us.

557
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,680
Well done.

558
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:30,850
I knew he was gonna do that.

559
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,819
Lizzy's gone, Mark.

560
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:44,864
She's gone and fucking dumped me.

561
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:48,034
It was that videotape

562
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,744
and that Iggy Pop business

563
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:51,704
and other sorts of shit.

564
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:55,750
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

565
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,835
I said to her,

566
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:59,712
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

567
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:02,924
But no way, no fucking way.

568
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:08,554
Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?

569
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:12,058
What a total fucking misnomer.

570
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,895
I mean, I wouldn't touch her
with yours.

571
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,272
I want to try it, Mark.

572
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:22,109
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit.

573
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:24,111
Better than sex.

574
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:29,617
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult.

575
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:32,203
I can find out for myself.

576
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,459
I've got the money.

577
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:45,258
Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?

578
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,259
Personality.

579
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,971
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.

580
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,391
Like heroin.

581
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:59,897
I mean, heroin's got great
fucking personality.

No! God, no!

00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:52,176
Oh, my God, no!
Please, no!

<i>I think Allison

<i>It had been days

614
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:06,023
<i>though someone must have said
something in all that time.</i>

615
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:07,900
<i>Surely to fuck,
someone must have.</i>

616
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:10,653
- Allison! Allison!
- Help me, please!

617
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:11,946
Calm down!

618
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,241
Everything's going to be just fine.

619
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:18,119
<i>Nothing could have been further

620
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:20,830
<i>In point of fact, nothing was

621
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:23,749
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

622
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:25,543
<i>Bad?</i>

623
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:29,213
<i>I mean everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was.</i>

624
00:39:37,138 --> 00:39:39,891
No!

625
00:39:46,814 --> 00:39:48,691
Fuck.

626
00:39:48,816 --> 00:39:50,484
Jesus Christ!

627
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,070

No!

<i>It wasn't my baby.</i>

<i>She wasn't my baby.</i>

00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,662
<i>Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.</i>

00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:04,290
<i>Spud's? Swanney's?
Sick Boy's?</i>

632
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,292
<i>I don't know.</i>

633
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:09,211
<i>Maybe Allison knew.
Maybe not.</i>

634
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:12,256
<i>I wished I could think of
something to say,</i>

635
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,259
<i>something sympathetic,
something human.</i>

636
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,553
Say something, Mark.

637
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:23,476
Fucking say something!

638
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:31,317
I'm cooking up.

639
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,503
Cook us up a shot, Rents.

640
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:53,130
I need a hit.

641
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:56,884
<i>And so she did.
I could understand that.</i>

642
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:59,262
<i>To take the pain away.</i>

643
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,307
<i>So I cooked up,
and she got a hit.</i>

644
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:05,393
<i>But only after me.</i>

645
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,770
<i>That went without saying.</i>

646
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:12,483
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

647
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,944
<i>It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.</i>

648
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:16,988
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

649
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:18,948
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

650
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:20,366
<i>It seemed he had no theory</i>

651
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,577
<i>with which to explain a moment
like this.</i>

652
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:24,537
<i>Nor did I.</i>

653
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:27,707
<i>Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.</i>

654
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:29,875
<i>Pile misery upon misery,</i>

655
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,461
<i>heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile,</i>

656
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:34,839
<i>then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein,</i>

657
00:41:34,922 --> 00:41:36,716
<i>and do it all over again.</i>

658
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,926
<i>Keep on going, getting up,
going out, robbing,</i>

659
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,553
<i>stealing, fucking people over,</i>

660
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,221
<i>propelling ourselves with longing</i>

661
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:44,849
<i>towards the day
that it would all go wrong.</i>

662
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:48,144
<i>Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,</i>

663
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:49,604
<i>you never have enough.</i>

664
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:52,398
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>

665
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:55,693
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

666
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:03,451
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.</i>

667
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:11,542
Because shoplifting
is theft, which is a crime,

668
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:13,210
and despite what you may believe,

669
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:16,130
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.

670
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:17,798
Heroin addiction
may explain your actions,

671
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:19,759
but it does not excuse them.

672
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:22,053
Mr. Murphy,
you are a habitual thief,

673
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:24,138
devoid of regret and remorse.

674
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:26,265
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,

675
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,852
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.

676
00:42:29,977 --> 00:42:32,563
Mr. Renton, I understand
that you have entered

677
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:34,440
into a program of rehabilitation

678
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,652
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

679
00:42:37,777 --> 00:42:40,321
The suspension of your sentence

680
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:43,699
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.

681
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:45,785
Should you stand guilty
before me again,

682
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:49,163
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.

683
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:51,499
Thank you, Your Honor.

684
00:42:51,624 --> 00:42:55,544
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.

685
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,769
<i>What can you say?</i>

686
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:14,272
<i>Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

687
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:16,983
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.

688
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:19,485
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.

689
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:23,322
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

690
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:27,994
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!

691
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,497
You better clean up your act.
Cut that shite out forever.

692
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:33,833
You listen to Francis.

702
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:09,201
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.

703
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:13,497
Well, it's not our fault!

704
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,209
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,

705
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:20,630
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

706
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:25,718

724
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:27,947
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.

725
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,616
- Usual table, sir?
- Oh, why, thank you.

726
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:33,953
Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?

727
00:45:34,036 --> 00:45:35,621
No, stick it on my tab.

729
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,126

breached quite some time ago.

730
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,587
Oh, well, in that case.

731
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:45,256
Hard currency!
That'll do nicely.

732
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,759
Can't be too careful when we're
dealing with your type, can we?

733
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:52,805
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

734
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:55,224
No, thank you.
I'll proceed directly

00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,265
Getting out much, Tommy?

869
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,975
No.

870
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:31,564
Following the game at all?

871
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:33,441
No.

872
00:58:34,984 --> 00:58:37,320
Nah, me neither, really.

873
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:49,790
You take the test?

874
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,210
Aye.

875
00:58:55,046 --> 00:58:57,006
Clear?

876
00:58:57,757 --> 00:58:59,216
Aye.

877
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:03,304
That's nice.

878
00:59:05,765 --> 00:59:08,142
I'm sorry, Tommy.

879
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:12,313
Got any gear on you?

880
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:15,524
No, I'm clean, man.

881
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:20,488
Well, sub us, then, mate.

882
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:23,407
I'm expecting a rent check.

883
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:39,423
Thanks, Mark.

884
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:42,009
No bother.

885
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,766
<i>No bother, none at all.</i>

886
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:50,351
<i>Not for me, anyway.</i>

887
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:52,436
<i>It's easy to be philosophical</i>

888
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,606

with shite for blood.</i>

889
01:00:03,406 --> 01:00:05,116
What do you want?

890
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,034
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

891
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,786
Is that a promise, then?

892
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,329
Yes, it is.

893
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:13,374
Calm down.
I'm only asking.

894
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:19,714
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.

895
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,465
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.

896
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:24,010
- Well, it isn't.
- It smells like it.

897
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:27,888
- You're too young.
- I'm too young for what?

898
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:38,316
You're not getting any younger, Mark.

899
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:41,027
The world's changing.
Music's changing.

900
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:42,695
Even drugs are changing.

901
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,238
You can't stay in here all day

902
01:00:44,363 --> 01:00:47,408
dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

903
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:49,201
It's Iggy Pop.

904
01:00:49,327 --> 01:00:51,871
Whatever.
I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

905
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,999
Iggy Pop is not dead.
He toured last year.

906
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:58,711
The point is, you've got
to find something new.

907
01:01:00,796 --> 01:01:04,467
<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

908
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,843

01:01:51,555 --> 01:01:54,433
Oh, yes, it's a beautifully
converted Victorian townhouse.

916
01:01:54,517 --> 01:01:56,310
Ideally located in a quiet road,

917
01:01:56,435 --> 01:01:58,729
near to the local shops and transport.

918
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:01,816
This one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.

919
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:04,527
Fully fitted in excellent
decorative order.

920
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,946
Lots of storage space,
and all mod cons.

921
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:10,658
And it's going at £320 a week.

922

01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:24,880

925
01:02:24,964 --> 01:02:26,549
<i>After all, this was Boomtown,</i>

926
01:02:26,632 --> 01:02:30,344
<i>where any fool could make cash

<i>There was no such thing as

934
01:02:48,237 --> 01:02:51,282

935

robbery with a fucking replica?

01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,673
Have you got a passport?

1040
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:24,342
Why?

1041
01:09:24,425 --> 01:09:26,177
I met this bloke.

1042
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:28,346
Runs a hotel, a brothel.

1043
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:30,389
Loads of contacts.

1044
01:09:30,514 --> 01:09:31,641
Does a nice sideline

1045
01:09:31,724 --> 01:09:34,352
in punting British passports
to foreigners.

1046
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,187
Get you a good price.

1047
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,232
And why would I want
to sell my passport?

1048
01:09:43,361 --> 01:09:45,154
It was just an idea.

1049
01:09:46,405 --> 01:09:48,407
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>

1050
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:51,827
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug
deal, and he didn't get rich.</i>

1051
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:54,205
<i>Instead, he and Begbie
hung around my bed-sit</i>

1052
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:55,790
<i>looking for things to steal.</i>

1053
01:09:55,915 --> 01:09:59,543
<i>I decided to put them in
the worst place in the world.</i>

1054
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:07,218
<i>♪ Sandman goes, two in tow ♪</i>

1055
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:09,303
<i>♪ Wet and dumb ♪</i>

1056
01:10:14,016 --> 01:10:17,436
<i>♪ Coming down again ♪</i>

1057
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:27,989
<i>They weren't paying any rent,</i>

1058
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:30,741
<i>so when my boss
found two suckers who would,</i>

1059
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:33,828
<i>Sick Boy and Begbie were bound
to feel threatened.</i>

1060
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:37,498
Yep, lots of storage.
All mod cons.

1061
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:39,750
320 quid a week.

1062
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,004
- Aah!
- Aah!

1063
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:44,463
<i>And that was that.</i>

1064
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:47,967
<i>But by then we had another
reason to go back.</i>

1065
01:10:48,092 --> 01:10:49,343
<i>Tommy.</i>

1066
01:10:49,468 --> 01:10:51,470
Tommy knew he'd got the virus, like,

1067
01:10:51,596 --> 01:10:54,348
but he never knew
he'd gone full-blown.

1068
01:10:54,473 --> 01:10:56,517
What was it,
pneumonia or cancer?

1069
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:59,103
No, toxoplasmosis.

1070
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:01,147
Sort of like a stroke.

1071
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:02,732
How's that?

1072
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:06,068
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

1073
01:11:06,652 --> 01:11:08,738
She wouldn't let him near the house.

1074
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:12,450
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.

1075
01:11:12,575 --> 01:11:14,493
I bet Lizzy told him where to stick it.

1076
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,622
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.

1077
01:11:17,747 --> 01:11:19,040
Get the fuck, right.

1078
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:22,460
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.

1079
01:11:22,585 --> 01:11:23,711
You can imagine what happened.

1080
01:11:23,836 --> 01:11:26,297
To those of us gathered here today,

1081
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:30,593
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

1082
01:11:30,676 --> 01:11:32,261
- What?
- Thomas was a son.

1083
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:33,930
The thing was neglected.

1084
01:11:34,013 --> 01:11:36,307
Pissing and shitting all over the place.

1085
01:11:36,432 --> 01:11:37,475
Tommy's lying about,

1086
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,978
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers.

1087
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:44,523
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

1088
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:49,403
A loving man with a great lust for life.

1089
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:51,822
Neither did I.
What is it?

1090
01:11:51,948 --> 01:11:54,116
Fucking horrible.

1091
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,077
It's like an abscess in your brain.

1092
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:57,995
Fucking hell.

1093
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,247
Then what happened?

1094
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:01,958
He starts getting these headaches,

1095
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:05,294
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.

1096
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:07,463
And then he has a stroke.

1097
01:12:07,546 --> 01:12:11,384
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.

1098
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:14,470
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.

1099
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:17,056
He'd been dead for ages

1100
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:19,308
before the neighbors
complained about the smell

1101
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:22,311
and got the police
to break down the door.

1102
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:24,730
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.

1103
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:26,482
He has gone from us,

1104
01:12:26,566 --> 01:12:29,986
but we have many things
to remember him by.

1105
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:31,070
The kitten was fine.

1106
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:34,407
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

1107
01:12:37,743 --> 01:12:42,832
<i>♪ Did you think
I would leave you crying ♪</i>

1108
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:47,378

- Tommy.
- Tommy.

1116
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:28,544
Did you tell him yet?

1117
01:13:29,587 --> 01:13:30,630
On you go.

1118
01:13:30,755 --> 01:13:32,214
What?

1119
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,966
There's this mate of Swanney's.

1120
01:13:34,091 --> 01:13:35,801
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.

1121
01:13:35,927 --> 01:13:37,136
Aye.

1122
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:42,975
Well, he's come into some gear.

1123
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,060
A lot of gear.

1124
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:45,645
How much gear?

1125
01:13:47,438 --> 01:13:52,610
About two kilos, so he tells me.

1126
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:55,821
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,

1127
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:58,407
where he met two Russian sailors.

1128
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:01,118
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,

1129
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:02,620
there and then, like.

1130
01:14:02,703 --> 01:14:06,123
So he wakes up the next morning,

1131
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,961
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.

1132
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:11,629
He wants rid of this, right?

1133
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:12,713
So?

1134
01:14:12,838 --> 01:14:16,634
So he met me, and I offered
to take it off his hands

1135
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:19,387
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention

1136
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:22,056
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.

1137
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:22,974
Ho ho-ho-ho!

1138
01:14:23,057 --> 01:14:25,059
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral,

1139
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:27,645
and you're talking about a scag deal?

1140
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:30,648
Aye.

1141
01:14:34,402 --> 01:14:36,237
What was your price?

1142
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:38,322
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?

1143
01:14:38,447 --> 01:14:40,074
We're £2,000 short.

1144
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,410
Well, that's tough.

1145
01:14:42,535 --> 01:14:46,414
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.

1146
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:48,666
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.

1147
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,711
Aye, you fucking do.

1148
01:14:53,212 --> 01:14:54,922
I've seen your bank statement.

1149
01:14:55,047 --> 01:14:57,341
For fuck's sake.

1150
01:14:57,425 --> 01:15:01,846
£2, 133.

1151
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:05,182
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?

1152
01:15:05,308 --> 01:15:07,018
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?

1153
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:09,228
What the fuck are you boys on, eh?

1154
01:15:09,353 --> 01:15:11,022
Spud, you've already been to jail.

1155
01:15:11,147 --> 01:15:13,608
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?

1156
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:16,110
I just want the money, Mark.

1157
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:18,112
If everybody keeps their mouth shut,

1158
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:20,781
there'll be no cunt going to jail.

1159
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:27,038
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running</i>

1160
01:15:27,163 --> 01:15:29,790
<i>through my mind about
what might happen in London.</i>

1161
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:33,127
<i>Things I didn't want to talk
to anyone about,</i>

1162
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:36,297
<i>ideas best kept to myself.</i>

1163
01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:38,466
<i>No one told me
when we bought the scag,</i>

1164
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:41,344
<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>

1165
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,141
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.</i>

1166
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:49,644
<i>Sick Boy was too careful these days.</i>

1167
01:15:49,769 --> 01:15:52,897
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,</i>

1168
01:15:53,022 --> 01:15:54,732
<i>and I did what had to be done.</i>

1169
01:15:58,527 --> 01:16:00,404
It's good.

1170
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:03,616
Oh, it's really fucking good.

1171
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:07,662
Mmm. Ohh.

1172
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:10,248
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

1173
01:16:10,373 --> 01:16:13,251
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.</i>

1174
01:16:13,376 --> 01:16:16,754
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.</i>

1175
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:19,590
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

1176
01:16:19,715 --> 01:16:21,425
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

1177
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:24,262
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams</i>

1178
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:26,264
<i>being perpetrated with three
of the most useless</i>

1179
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:29,934
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups in town.</i>

1180
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:31,602
<i>I knew what was going on in his mind.</i>

1181
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:34,230
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.</i>

1182
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:35,314
<i>One way or another.</i>

1183
01:16:35,398 --> 01:16:36,774
<i>He had to.</i>

1184
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:39,110
<i>If he got caught with a bagful of scag,</i>

1185
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:40,736
<i>on top of that armed-robbery shit,</i>

1186
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:43,447
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

1187
01:16:43,823 --> 01:16:45,700
<i>Begbie was hard,
but not so hard</i>

1188
01:16:45,825 --> 01:16:48,786
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.</i>

1189
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:58,629
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

1190
01:16:58,754 --> 01:17:00,590
<i>But let's be clear about this.</i>

1191
01:17:00,673 --> 01:17:03,759
<i>There's final hits and final hits.</i>

1192
01:17:03,843 --> 01:17:05,845
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

1193
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,685
Did you bring the cards?

1194
01:17:12,977 --> 01:17:14,312
- What?
- The cards.

1195
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:16,981
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1196
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:19,191
Well, I've not brought them.

1197
01:17:21,193 --> 01:17:23,529
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

1198
01:17:23,654 --> 01:17:25,781
I'm sorry.

1199
01:17:25,865 --> 01:17:28,075
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

1200
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,913
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

1201
01:17:32,705 --> 01:17:33,915
Christ.

1202
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:22,922
These are your friends, right?

1203
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:26,092
These are the guys I told you about.

1204
01:18:26,217 --> 01:18:28,594
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

1205
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,596
You didn't get followed,
did you?

1206
01:18:30,721 --> 01:18:32,765
We didn't get followed.

1207
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,225
Okay.

1208
01:18:51,284 --> 01:18:52,451
All right.

1209
01:18:52,577 --> 01:18:53,744
Aye.

1210
01:18:56,414 --> 01:18:58,958
<i>Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.</i>

1211
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,044
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

1212
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,724
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1213
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:12,698
So how much would you like for this?

1214
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:16,786
£20,000.

1215
01:20:18,454 --> 01:20:21,582
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than £ 15,000.

1216
01:20:21,707 --> 01:20:23,501
<i>This was a real drag to him.</i>

1217
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,503
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

1218
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:27,838
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?</i>

1219
01:20:27,922 --> 01:20:30,591
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!</i>

1220
01:20:30,716 --> 01:20:32,510
Well, £ 19,000.

1221
01:20:32,593 --> 01:20:35,388
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to £ 19,000.

1222
01:20:38,057 --> 01:20:40,393
Well, fucking £ 16,000, then.

1223
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:43,354
Okay.

1224
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:46,065
Well, fucking £ 16,000 it is, then.

1225
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:53,739
These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.

1226
01:20:53,864 --> 01:20:56,617
Here's two.

1227
01:20:56,742 --> 01:20:58,452
That's four.

1228
01:20:58,578 --> 01:21:00,955
<i>We settled on £16,000.</i>

1229
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,834
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

1230
01:21:11,924 --> 01:21:14,468
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1231
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:17,179
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

1232
01:21:17,263 --> 01:21:19,515
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.

1233
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:22,935
Okay.

1234
01:21:25,438 --> 01:21:27,481
- Yes!
- Yes!

1235
01:21:27,607 --> 01:21:28,983
Fucking...

1236
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:32,653
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.</i>

1237
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,655
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.</i>

1238
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,240
<i>Like it meant something.</i>

1239
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:38,826
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.</i>

1240
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:40,453
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>

1241
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:41,913
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>

1242
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:45,166
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

1243
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,501
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

1244
01:21:47,627 --> 01:21:48,628
For four fucking grand?

1245
01:21:48,753 --> 01:21:52,798
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1246
01:21:53,716 --> 01:21:56,010
I don't know, man.

1247
01:21:56,135 --> 01:21:58,596
I'm gonna get something for my ma.

1248
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:02,892
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1249
01:22:02,975 --> 01:22:05,019
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1250
01:22:05,144 --> 01:22:06,103
Shag her senseless.

1251
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:08,272
No, man!
True love.

1252
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:09,774
True love.

1253
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:11,275
Hey, but I could handle

1254
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,278
some hot sex with a Jewish Princess.

1255
01:22:14,403 --> 01:22:16,447
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

1256
01:22:16,572 --> 01:22:17,531
If you're gonna waste it on a bird,

1257
01:22:17,657 --> 01:22:20,117
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

1258
01:22:20,243 --> 01:22:21,619
Now get the drinks.

1259
01:22:21,744 --> 01:22:24,872
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

1260
01:22:26,415 --> 01:22:28,376
Okay.
Same again?

1261
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:30,920
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

1262
01:22:31,003 --> 01:22:33,589
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

1263
01:22:33,673 --> 01:22:35,508
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

1264
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:37,218
I'll be right fucking after you.

1265
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:39,971
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1266
01:22:40,096 --> 01:22:42,348
By the way,
see when I get back.

1267
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:44,976
Be halfway down the street
with the money.

1268
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:46,477
Fucking kill you.

1269
01:22:46,602 --> 01:22:48,813
I thought you might, Franco.

1270
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:50,439
I thought you might.

1271
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:57,154
Are you game for it?

1272
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,781
What?

1273
01:23:00,491 --> 01:23:01,951
Well?

1274
01:23:03,035 --> 01:23:04,620
Are you serious?

1275
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:13,629
Don't know.

1276
01:23:13,713 --> 01:23:15,214
What do you think?

1277
01:23:16,549 --> 01:23:17,717
Still here, I see.

1278
01:23:17,842 --> 01:23:20,219
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

1279
01:23:20,344 --> 01:23:22,680
Why not?
I know I would.

1280
01:23:23,556 --> 01:23:25,224
Where's Franco?

1281
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:30,313
For fuck's sake!

1282
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,606
Sorry, mate.

1283
01:23:31,731 --> 01:23:35,026
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

1284
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:36,569
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1285
01:23:36,694 --> 01:23:38,738
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

1286
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:41,824
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

1287
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:45,161
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

1288
01:23:45,244 --> 01:23:47,371
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

1289
01:23:47,496 --> 01:23:48,497
Fuck off.

1290
01:23:52,919 --> 01:23:54,629
Aah.

1291
01:23:54,754 --> 01:23:57,131
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1292
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,515
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

1293
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,018
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

1294
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:11,604
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

1295
01:24:11,729 --> 01:24:13,397
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

1296
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,566
You were in my fucking way.

1297
01:24:15,691 --> 01:24:16,984
Help!

1298
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:19,487
Oh, no.

1299
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:22,823
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

1300
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:24,158
You?

1301
01:24:26,577 --> 01:24:27,703
You?

1302
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:38,089
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.

1303
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:41,133
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

1304
01:24:41,259 --> 01:24:45,012
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

1305
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:51,143
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

1306
01:24:56,941 --> 01:24:58,526

just a minor betrayal.</i>

1347
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:41,040

I ripped them off.</i>

1348
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,459
<i>My so-called mates.</i>

1349
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,795

a shit about him.</i>

1350
01:28:45,878 --> 01:28:47,463
<i>And Sick Boy.
He'd have done the same to me</i>

1351
01:28:47,546 --> 01:28:49,382
<i>if he'd only thought of it first.</i>

1352
01:28:51,008 --> 01:28:53,803
<i>And Spud. Well, okay,
I felt sorry for Spud.</i>

1353
01:28:53,886 --> 01:28:55,721
<i>He never hurt anybody.</i>

1354
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:05,022
Bastard!

1355
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:12,697
Bastard!

1356
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:17,910
Fuck! Fuck!

1357
01:29:18,035 --> 01:29:19,745
All right, move away, people.

1358
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:21,706
What's going on in there?

1359
01:29:22,873 --> 01:29:25,459
Open up.
Open up now!

1360
01:29:25,585 --> 01:29:27,336
Bastard!

1361
01:29:28,045 --> 01:29:29,505
Bastard!

1362
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,966
<i>So why did I do it?</i>

1363
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:35,720
<i>I could offer
a million answers, all false.</i>

1364
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,847
<i>The truth is that I'm a bad person,</i>

1365
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,390
<i>but that's gonna change.</i>

1366
01:29:39,515 --> 01:29:41,350
<i>I'm going to change.</i>

1367
01:29:41,434 --> 01:29:43,436
<i>This is the last of that sort of thing.</i>

1368
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:45,229
<i>I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on.</i>

1369
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:47,607
<i>Going straight and choosing life.</i>

1370
01:29:47,732 --> 01:29:49,942
<i>I'm looking forward to it already.</i>

1371
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:52,153
<i>I'm going to be just like you.</i>

1372
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:54,906
<i>The job, the family,
the fucking big television,</i>

1373
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,532
<i>the washing machine, the car,</i>

1374
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,618
<i>the compact disc,
and electrical tin opener,</i>
