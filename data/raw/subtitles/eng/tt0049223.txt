1
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,258
In the final decade
of the 21st century...

2
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:37,024
men and women in rocket ships
landed on the moon.

3
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,796
By 2200 A.D., they had reached
the other planets of our solar system.

4
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,031
Almost at once there followed
the discovery of hyper-drive...

5
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,471
through which the speed of light
was first attained...

6
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,600
and later greatly surpassed.

7
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,134
And so at last,
mankind began the conquest...

8
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,807
and colonization of deep space.

9
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,215
United Planets cruiser C-57-D...

10
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,449
now more than a year out from Earth base
on a special mission...

11
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:06,925
to the planetary system of
the great main sequence star, Altair.

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,464
- When do we get a D.C. fix, Jerry?
- Half a minute, Skipper.

13
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,703
Ship on course, sir.
We'll reach D.C. point at 1701.

14
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,144
That's less than three minutes now.

15
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,410
- All right, take it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.

16
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,678
Chief, we'll drop back below light speed
in about three minutes.

17
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,883
- Got your breakable gear stowed?
- Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,289
All right. Good.

19
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,426
D.C. set and punched on, Skipper.

20
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:49,162
All right, attention. Captain to crew.
All hands squared away to decelerate.

21
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,467
Ship's beeper will, as usual,
sound ten times after lights dim.

22
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,939
- Come on, Doc. D.C., Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,035
D.C. stations, on the double.

24
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,910
Wanna bounce through this one?

25
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,883
All right, we're down
to.3896 of light speed.

26
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,892
It's a little warm
in here, Skipper.

27
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,085
There's Altair
right on the nose, Skipper.

28
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,559
Meanwhile, this ship
arranges its own eclipses.

29
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,673
Okay, Jerry, punch out
an orbit on the fourth planet.

30
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,681
Aye, aye, Skipper.

31
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,811
Ship in approach, Skipper.
Helical vector oriented.

32
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,618
Attention.
Captain to crew. Attention.

33
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,787
Our destination, Altair-4,
is now visible on the main view-plate.

34
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,564
As you'll recollect from your briefing
lectures, this is an Earth-type planet.

35
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,797
Twenty years ago, the spacecraft
Belerephon landed here...

36
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,736
with a prospecting
party of scientists.

37
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,774
Our mission is to search for survivors.
That is all.

38
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,828
The Lord sure makes
some beautiful worlds.

39
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,593
How do these continents
check with the old charts?

40
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,124
Be able to tell you better in a while,
Skipper. It's time for brakes.

41
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,603
Okay, take it away.

42
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,039
Astrogator to crew.
Stand by to change flux.

43
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,065
Another one of them new worlds.

44
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,505
No beer, no women,
no pool parlors, nothing.

45
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,170
Nothing to do but throw rocks at tin
cans, and we gotta bring our own cans.

46
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,839
Attention. Captain to crew.

47
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,213
We are now entering
the atmosphere of Altair-4.

48
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,946
No survival suits
will be required upon landing.

49
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,549
Oxygen content:
4.7 richer than Earth standard.

50
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,991
Gravity, only.897.

51
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,859
Adjust your equipment accordingly.
That is all.

52
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,330
All hands, check equipment.

53
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,642
Not even any short-range
radio signals yet?

54
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,648
Not so far, sir.

55
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,522
Can you make out
anything down there?

56
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,387
I may be missing
some individual structures...

57
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,986
but there are no cities,
ports, roads, bridges, dams.

58
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,997
There's just
no sign of civilization.

59
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,001
Sir, we're being radar-scanned.

60
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,130
- Can you zero on it?
- No, sir.

61
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,733
It seems to emanate from
an area of about 20 miles square.

62
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,040
Twenty miles square?

63
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,842
Bosun, pass the alert.

64
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,783
Combat stations. Blaster men,
activate your scopes.

65
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,047
Radio contact, sir.
There's a voice.

66
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,055
- Human?
- It sounds like it.

67
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,057
Boost it.

68
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,154
Spaceship, identify yourself.
You're being tracked.

69
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,528
Cut me in, Quinn.

70
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,696
United Planets Cruiser C-57-D,
J.J. Adams commanding.

71
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,968
- Who are you?
- Morbius of theBelerephon.

72
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,704
- Who?
- Edward Morbius.

73
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:37,975
Here it is. "Morbius, E. Ph.D., Lit.D.
Expedition philologist."

74
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,919
- Philologist?
- What do you wish here, cruiser?

75
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,391
You don't understand. We're your
relief. We're glad to find you alive.

76
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,689
I, of course,
appreciate your concern...

77
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,858
but absolutely no assistance
of any sort is required.

78
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,696
The red carpet treatment, huh?

79
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,728
Dr. Morbius, my orders are to
survey the situation on Altair-4.

80
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:03,105
Let me repeat:
I'm in no sort of difficulty here.

81
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,510
Your best procedure will be to
turn back at once without landing.

82
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,013
Sorry, sir.

83
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,516
If you set down on this planet,
I warn you...

84
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,612
that I cannot be answerable for
the safety of your ship or your crew.

85
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,147
If you'll just supply me
with landing coordinates.

86
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,055
Dr. Morbius,
I require landing coordinates.

87
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,431
Very well, but I wash my hands
of all responsibility.

88
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,336
- You have standard charts?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,708
You may come in at 83-17-4 north...

90
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,578
148-21 west.

91
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,241
Thank you.

92
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,413
It's right back there
in the desert.

93
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,515
Commander, I urge you to reconsider.
Please permit me to recommend...

94
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,088
Something funny down there, Skipper.

95
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,333
Okay, Jerry, I'll take her in.

96
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,835
Right.

97
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:09,699
Attention. Captain to crew.
Stand by to reverse polarity.

98
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,803
Standard class "A" security
will be maintained upon landing...

99
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,781
and until further notice,
all hands will wear side arms.

100
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,114
That is all.

101
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,119
- Artificial gravity off.
- Grav. off.

102
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,620
- Half flux.
- Half flux.

103
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,681
- Cut primary coils.
- Primaries cut, sir.

104
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,225
All clear, sir.

105
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,368
Look at the color of that sky.

106
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,631
Yeah, but I'll still take blue.

107
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,765
I don't know. I think a man
could get used to this...

108
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,433
and grow to love it.

109
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,377
Bosun, you can assemble the tractor.

110
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,641
Better check the command mike.

111
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,684
- The command mike, sir.
- Oh, good idea.

112
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,013
- Chief?
- Sir?

113
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,646
You're in command now, Quinn.
You keep right at those instruments.

114
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,919
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Hey, what's this dust coming?

115
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,407
Looks like we're being met.

116
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,409
Bosun.

117
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,911
Hold the tractor.

118
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:32,615
- Quite a vehicle, huh?
- That driver must be a madman.

119
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,947
What driver?

120
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,947
Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.

121
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,322
I am to transport you
to the residence.

122
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,296
If you do not speak English...

123
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,800
I am at your disposal
with 187 other languages...

124
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,564
along with their various
dialects and sub-tongues.

125
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,801
Colloquial English
will do fine, thank you.

126
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,811
This is no offense,
but you are a robot, aren't you?

127
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,414
That is correct, sir.

128
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:41,385
For your convenience, I am monitored
to respond to the name "Robby."

129
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:45,117
Nice climate you have here.

130
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,216
High oxygen content.

131
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,525
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

132
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,693
Hey, Doc,
is it a male or a female?

133
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:02,908
In my case, sir, the question
is totally without meaning.

134
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,909
Will you get in, gentlemen?

135
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,815
Quinn, tractors if I blink red.

136
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,688
- I'll bring a tractor in a hurry, sir.
- Right.

137
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,340
Passengers will please
fasten their seat belts.

138
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,854
Looks after us like a mother.

139
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:13,275
If you gentlemen will go in,
you're expected.

140
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,253
- I am Morbius.
- I am Commander Adams.

141
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,660
This is Lieutenant Farman,
my executive...

142
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,165
and Lieutenant Ostrow,
our ship's doctor.

143
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,539
How ironic that a simple scholar
with no ambition...

144
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,940
beyond a modest measure of seclusion,
should, out of a clear sky...

145
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,811
find himself besieged by
an army of fellow creatures...

146
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,679
all grimly determined
to be of service to him.

147
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:56,188
I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome,
but we do have our orders.

148
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,746
But you must stay
for lunch, gentlemen...

149
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,520
and do forgive the ill manners
of an old recluse.

150
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,528
Won't you come in?

151
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,205
Whatever that lunch was,
it was certainly delicious.

152
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,710
Simply some of Robby's synthetics.

153
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,239
- He's your cook too?
- Even manufactures the raw materials.

154
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,547
Come around here, Robby.

155
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,713
I'll show you how this works.

156
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:37,188
One introduces a sample of human food
through this aperture.

157
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,960
Here there's a small built-in chemical
laboratory where he analyzes it.

158
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,434
Later he can reproduce identical
molecules in any shape or quantity.

159
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,939
Why, it's a housewife's dream.

160
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,498
Plus absolute selfless obedience.

161
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,511
Activate the dispose-all unit.

162
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,291
A household disintegrator beam.

163
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,721
Put your arm in there.

164
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,365
Order cancelled.

165
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,594
Don't attribute feeling
to him, gentlemen.

166
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,866
Robby is simply a tool.
Tremendously strong, of course.

167
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,431
He could quite easily topple
this house off its foundation.

168
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,001
In the wrong hands, mightn't
such a tool become a deadly weapon?

169
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,209
No, Doctor, not even though I were the
mad scientist of the tape thrillers...

170
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,515
because, you see, there happens
to be a built-in safety factor.

171
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,853
Commander, may I borrow that
formidable-Iooking side arm of yours?

172
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,961
Thank you.

173
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:50,935
Robby, point this thing at that
althaea frutex out there on the terrace.

174
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,100
Fire.

175
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,572
You understand the mechanism?

176
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:06,084
Yes, Morbius.
A simple blaster.

177
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,417
All right.
Now turn around here.

178
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,557
Point it at the commander.

179
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,892
Aim right between the eyes.

180
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,004
Fire.

181
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,714
You see, he's helpless...

182
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,081
Iocked in a sub-electronic dilemma
between my direct orders...

183
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,553
and his basic inhibitions
against harming rational beings.

184
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,022
Cancelled.

185
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,720
If I were to allow
that to continue...

186
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,957
he would blow
every circuit in his body.

187
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,868
Doctor, how did you
come by such a mechanism?

188
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:00,667
Uh, I didn't
"come by" him, Doctor...

189
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,200
I tinkered him together
during my first months up here.

190
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,906
- Coffee is ready, sir.
- Gentlemen.

191
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,782
Doctor, do you mean that
you made this gentleman?

192
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,287
A useful enough toy, Lieutenant...

193
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,189
but nowadays I have
no time for such things.

194
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:26,059
Dr. Morbius, you're a philologist,
an expert in words and languages...

195
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,066
their origins and meanings.

196
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,160
Yet this robot of yours
is beyond the combined resources...

197
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,172
of all Earth's physical science.

198
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,232
My dear Commander,
maybe you overestimate...

199
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,005
both Robby and myself.

200
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,810
Gentlemen, let me show you
another bit of parlor magic.

201
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,093
Forgive me. I didn't mean
to alarm you, gentlemen.

202
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,493
I had Robby install
the steel shutters...

203
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,464
before I realized how
altogether safe I am here.

204
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,470
Well, gentlemen,
this has been very pleasant.

205
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,841
You've seen how
comfortable I am here...

206
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:16,643
no hardships,
no special difficulties...

207
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,479
and no need at all
for military assistance.

208
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,316
Now I daresay you're impatient
to get back to base.

209
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,846
Yes, the moment we've interviewed the
other members of the Belerephon party.

210
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,956
Others. But there are
no others, Commander.

211
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,431
Before the first year was out,
they had all, every man and woman...

212
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,732
succumbed to a...
to a sort of a planetary force here...

213
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,535
some dark, terrible,
incomprehensible force.

214
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,542
Only my wife and I were immune.

215
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,545
And just how do you account
for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?

216
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,812
We differed from the others only
in our special love for this world...

217
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,082
in our boundless longing
to make a home here...

218
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,352
far from the scurry
and strife of humankind.

219
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,785
I remember how, when the vote
was taken to return to Earth...

220
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,231
she and I were utterly heartbroken.

221
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,236
How could we have foreseen the
extinction of coworkers and friends?

222
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,400
Skipper, there is no record of any wife
in the Belerephon rolls.

223
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:21,003
Lieutenant, look under
"biochemistry," Julia Marsin.

224
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,947
She and I were married
by the skipper on the voyage here.

225
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,779
I have the certificate.

226
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,379
I thought Robby had managed some
very charming feminine touches.

227
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,981
I take it Mrs. Morbius
isn't at home today?

228
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,391
My dear wife died
a few months after the others.

229
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,863
Only in her case,
it was of natural causes.

230
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,991
I'm very sorry.

231
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,535
Dr. Morbius,
just what were the symptoms...

232
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,697
of all those other deaths,
the unnatural ones?

233
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,401
The symptoms were
striking, Commander.

234
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,808
One by one,
in spite of every safeguard...

235
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,506
my coworkers were torn
literally limb from limb.

236
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:56,878
By what?

237
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,349
By some devilish thing
that never once showed itself.

238
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,352
- And the Belerephon?
- Vaporized...

239
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,514
as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off.

240
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,522
And yet, in all these 19 years...

241
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:14,123
you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force?

242
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,369
Only in nightmares
of those times.

243
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,668
And yet, always in my mind...

244
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,073
I seem to feel the creature
is lurking somewhere close at hand...

245
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:29,513
sly and irresistible, and only waiting
to be re-invoked for murder.

246
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,110
Father?

247
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,789
Alta!

248
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,223
Alta, I specifically asked you...

249
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,284
not to join us for lunch.

250
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,387
But, Father, lunch is over.

251
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,592
I'm sure you never said a word
about not coming in for coffee.

252
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,067
Well, did you or did you?

253
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,730
This is Commander Adams...

254
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,503
Dr. Ostrow and, uh,
Lieutenant Farman.

255
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,009
- My daughter.
- How do you do?

256
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:03,708
I've always so terribly wanted to meet
a young man, and now three at once.

257
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,478
- That's very kind of you.
- You're lovely, Doctor.

258
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,084
Of course, the two end ones
are unbelievable.

259
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,226
Could this end one
get you some coffee?

260
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,058
I'm quite able to get it,
thank you.

261
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,997
Thank you.

262
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,304
Of course, you must make allowances
for my daughter, gentlemen.

263
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:35,677
She's never known any human being
except her father.

264
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,273
I hope you'll make
allowances too, sir.

265
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,719
We young men have been shut up in
hyperspace for well over a year now...

266
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,313
and right from here,
the view looks just like heaven.

267
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,824
Sugar?

268
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,521
But you keep helping me.
After all, you're not Robby.

269
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,463
I wouldn't mind being Robby
in certain ways.

270
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,763
That's only in certain ways,
of course.

271
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:01,033
I can see that was probably very clever,
but I don't seem to understand it.

272
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,633
Well, there's...
There's no rush.

273
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,642
I suppose one day I shall be obliged
to make the trip to Earth with her...

274
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,346
for the sake of her
natural development.

275
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,912
I should say fairly soon too.

276
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:22,358
Your father wasn't too happy at first
about your meeting us, was he?

277
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,295
Well, naturally not.
You're from Earth.

278
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,800
- What's wrong with Earth?
- How lucky I am, though.

279
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,803
All three of you are such
very fine exceptions.

280
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,568
- You are exceptions, aren't you?
- Oh, sure, sure.

281
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,667
That is, I am, anyway.

282
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,508
Old dependable Jerry.

283
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,846
Of course, the doc can be trusted too,
in the daytime.

284
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,211
What about the commander?

285
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,417
Well, I hate to tell
you this, Alta, but...

286
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:58,122
that man is notorious
throughout seven planetary systems.

287
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,724
Oh, dear.
What does he do?

288
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,132
Well, I don't feel
free to discuss...

289
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:08,230
the shortcomings of
a fellow officer, but...

290
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:12,937
any girl or woman who lets him
get her alone, anywhere...

291
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,213
Yes, I can see it now.

292
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,190
There, just then when he looked at me,
his eyes almost had fire in them.

293
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,596
I'm so glad you don't have
any fire in your eyes, Lieutenant.

294
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,859
Well, I'm not that harmless.

295
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,266
- Alta?
- Yes, Father?

296
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,374
These gentlemen have expressed
a very kindly concern...

297
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,206
- over the amount of liberty you have.
- Liberty?

298
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,078
I told them that you have my permission
to visit Earth whenever you choose.

299
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,413
Earth? I?

300
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,976
Then my little girl
never feels Ionely or confined?

301
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,252
Why, I don't know.
I have you and Robby and all my friends.

302
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,849
Friends?

303
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,396
- Perhaps you'd better call them, dear.
- All right.

304
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,230
Come, gentlemen.

305
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,207
I felt something
go right through my head.

306
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,841
Alta's whistle is above the pitch of
human hearing. I often feel it myself.

307
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,932
- What's up?
- Look.

308
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,307
No. Watch.

309
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,490
Why, he's as tame as a kitten.

310
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,585
Outside of the range of my daughter's
influence, it's still a deadly beast.

311
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,606
Just a routine checkup from the ship.

312
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,940
- What, Chief?
- Everything okay, Commander?

313
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,004
- No problem.
- Would you mind activating the viewer?

314
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,880
As you can see, we're under
no restraint whatsoever.

315
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,554
Knock that off, Quinn.

316
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:45,825
If I can be of any help to you in your
preparations for the homeward voyage...

317
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:50,198
Thank you, sir, but unfortunately
circumstances may keep us here a while.

318
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,464
- Circumstances?
- You see, my orders...

319
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,028
don't quite seem to cover
the Belerephon fatalities.

320
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:59,510
I am forced now to contact base
for new instructions.

321
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:02,604
But, Commander,
suppose these new instructions...

322
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,912
require my return to Earth
for questioning...

323
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,612
two years or more
away from my work here?

324
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:13,147
Tell me, just what is involved
in your making contact with Earth base?

325
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,853
Fundamentally,
it's a question of crude power...

326
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,329
how to short-circuit the continuum
on a five or six parsec level.

327
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,958
Of course, a transmitter like that
isn't standard equipment.

328
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,968
- No.
- To build one...

329
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,472
we'd cannibalize about two-thirds
of the ship's electronic gear...

330
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,632
and then unship
the main drive to juice it.

331
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:34,168
Just to construct a bunker to house
the core would take about ten days.

332
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,409
Disabled here
for ten days and nights?

333
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,849
Tell me, would two-inch
lead shielding do as well?

334
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,911
It'd be better if we happened to be
carrying 100 square yards of the stuff.

335
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,082
Then I'll have Robby
run it off for you...

336
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,956
and you'll get it
not later than tomorrow noon.

337
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,621
That's very obliging of you, sir.

338
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,597
Obliging?

339
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,657
Look out there, Commander,
the Belerephon party.

340
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,034
Nineteen years ago
I dug those graves with my own hands...

341
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,973
and I have, believe me,
no wish to repeat that experience.

342
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,924
We'll see you again soon,
Alta, I hope.

343
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,828
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Excellent lunch, Doctor.

344
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,866
To tell the truth, I sometimes
still miss the conversation...

345
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,335
of such gentlemen
as yourself, Doctor.

346
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:35,271
Well, thank you for your
courtesy and concern, sir.

347
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,583
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.

348
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,581
Easy with this core. Our M.G. coils
won't take us home without it.

349
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,744
Come on, Cookie, out of the way.
You wanna get run over?

350
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,914
Handle it gently.
It has to get us home.

351
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,627
- Is it far enough away from the ship?
- Sure. No interference there.

352
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,928
- What about the magnetic pull?
- Bosun, drop the thing down over there.

353
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,559
Aye, aye, sir.

354
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:47,443
Where do you wish
the shielding stacked, sir?

355
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,448
You can just put it right over
there by the core, thank you.

356
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,883
Wait a minute.
That's solid lead he's carrying.

357
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,581
Common lead would have
crushed the vehicle, sir.

358
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:01,752
This is my morning's run
of isotope 217.

359
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,261
The whole thing
hardly comes to ten tons.

360
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,464
Hello, Alta.

361
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,092
Does your father know you're here?

362
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,865
He did tell me not to go near the ship,
but this isn't very near.

363
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,808
- Cookie, out of here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

364
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,810
Yes, sir.

365
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,053
Commander, put me down, sir!

366
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,661
- Commander.
- What is it, Chief?

367
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,664
If you'd like
to check my assembly...

368
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,098
for the monitor unit
of the Klystron transmitter...

369
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,137
- What, already?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,796
Excellent.

371
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,909
Are... are these condensers
out of my accelerator circuits?

372
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,678
Yes, sir. I borrowed some solenoids
from your gyrostabilizers too.

373
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,685
Here's the big deal, sir.

374
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,221
I'll bet any quantum mechanic
would give his life...

375
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,484
for a chance to fool around
with this gadget.

376
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,492
Get this in the ship by dark.

377
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,291
It won't do any good to have some fool
fall on it before we transmit tomorrow.

378
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,298
- Good work, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

379
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,333
Come here. Over here.

380
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,382
Can I be of service, sir?

381
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,851
Never mind the "sir," but I'm
a stranger in this so-called planet...

382
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,651
and I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

383
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,817
where I could get hold
of some of the real stuff.

384
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,761
- "Real stuff"?
- Just for cooking purposes.

385
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,890
I take a big pride in my duties.

386
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,595
Pardon me, sir. "Stuff"?

387
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,738
Just about one jolt left.
Oh, genuine Ancient Rocket bourbon.

388
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,215
See here? Hey!

389
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:12,587
You low-living contraption!
I oughta take a can opener to you!

390
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,353
Quiet, please.
I am analyzing.

391
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:24,501
Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules
with traces of fusel oil.

392
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,068
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

393
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,575
Gallons?

394
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,807
I've been from here to there in
this galaxy, and I want you to know...

395
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,247
you're the most understanding soul
I ever met up with.

396
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,955
It's nothing really personal,
just a kiss.

397
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,325
Hmm. But why should people
want to kiss each other?

398
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,261
It's an old custom.

399
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,856
All the really high civilizations
go in for it.

400
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,903
- But it's so silly.
- But it's good for you, though.

401
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,234
It stimulates the whole system.

402
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,332
As a matter of fact, you can't
be in tip-top health without it.

403
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,139
Really?
I didn't know that.

404
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,840
I'd be only too happy
to show you.

405
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,474
Well, thank you very much,
Lieutenant.

406
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,848
No trouble at all.

407
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,987
Is that all there is to it?

408
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,526
Well, you've sort of
got to stick with it.

409
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,468
Just once more, do you mind?

410
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,480
Not at all.

411
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:52,521
There must be something
seriously the matter with me...

412
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,423
because I haven't noticed
the least bit of stimulation.

413
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,062
Honey, let's do this thing right.
Now, here.

414
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,713
Are you giving me the treatment?
Are you?

415
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,984
Lieutenant Farman.

416
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,145
Don't say a word, sir.

417
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:26,713
I know there are lots of pressing duties
waiting for me back at the ship...

418
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,420
and rank doth have
its little privileges, hmm, sir?

419
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,487
And you can depend on it that
those privileges won't be stretched...

420
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,999
into taking your kind of advantages.

421
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,399
- But l...
- Dismissed.

422
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,235
What's the matter with him?
Why did you both act so funny?

423
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,214
Well, what'd you expect?

424
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,149
Don't you understand, Alta?

425
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,655
No? Well, look at yourself.

426
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:02,625
You can't dress like that around men,
especially not a space wolf like Farman.

427
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:06,994
So for Pete's sake, go home
and put on something that'Il...

428
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:07,997
Anything.

429
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,066
What's wrong with my clothes?
I designed them myself.

430
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,743
Stop looking at me that way.
I don't think I like it.

431
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,877
What do you mean?

432
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,383
We were just trying to get
some healthy stimulation...

433
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,250
from hugging and kissing,
that's all.

434
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,620
Oh, that's all?
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

435
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,025
There's no feelings, no emotions.
You, uh...

436
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,894
Nothing human would
ever enter your mind.

437
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,560
It so happens that I'm in command
of 18 competitively selected...

438
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,900
super-perfect
physical specimens...

439
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,496
with an average age of 24.6...

440
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:54,238
who have been locked up
in hyperspace for 378 days!

441
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:58,305
It would have served you right
if I hadn't have... and he...

442
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
Get out of here before I have you
run out of the area under guard...

443
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,284
and then I'll put
more guards on the guards!

444
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,698
"And then I'll put
more guards on the guards!"

445
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,002
I don't like him.
I just don't like him.

446
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,340
The way he kept looking at me.
Then he shouted.

447
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,745
- What about?
- I don't know, really.

448
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,783
It was awful.

449
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,548
I was only trying to be nice
about kissing the lieutenant.

450
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,683
- How did the commander react to that?
- He was furious.

451
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,751
He seemed to think that all that about
biology had something to do with me.

452
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,321
Personally, I mean.
I've never been so nervous in my life.

453
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:52,529
I hope I don't see him again
if I live to be 400 million!

454
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,164
Well, I daresay
you won't have to.

455
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,367
The best thing you can do
is to go to bed.

456
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,536
I still have some work
to do in my study.

457
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,876
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

458
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,734
Where have you been?
I've beamed and beamed.

459
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,069
Sorry, miss.

460
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,872
I was giving myself an oil job.

461
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,005
And what is it you require
this time, Miss Alta?

462
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:41,108
Robby, I must have a new dress,
right away.

463
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,779
- Again?
- But this one must be different.

464
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,382
Absolutely nothing must show...
below, above or through.

465
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,391
Radiation-proof?

466
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,225
No, just eye-proof will do.

467
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,698
- Thick and heavy?
- Oh, no, Robby.

468
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,100
It must be the loveliest,
softest thing you've ever made for me...

469
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,038
and fit in all the right places,
with lots and lots of star sapphires.

470
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:07,635
Star sapphires take a week
to crystallize properly.

471
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,374
Would diamonds or emeralds do?

472
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,848
Well, if they're large enough.

473
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,013
Five, ten and fifteen carats,
and on hand.

474
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,353
I will run the dress up for you
in time for breakfast.

475
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,020
- Sleep well, miss.
- Thank you, Robby.

476
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,033
I don't really care now
whether I do or not.

477
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:45,043
Funny to see two moons
in the sky, isn't it?

478
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,584
Funny how quick
a guy gets used to it.

479
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,059
- Joe.
- What?

480
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,893
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?

481
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,432
Like a sort of big breathing.

482
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:09,132
That's funny. I did.

483
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:56,217
Strong and Grey, last night during
your watch this ship was entered...

484
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,586
and valuable government property
was sabotaged.

485
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,320
The two of you claim to have
been at your posts and awake.

486
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,329
Yet this ship was entered,
the heavy-duty hatch was raised...

487
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,595
and latched back, and neither of you
saw or heard anything.

488
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,136
Except you, Grey.
You heard breathing.

489
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,033
And, Youngerford, let me see,
you were asleep in your bunk...

490
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,243
and you think you had a dream.

491
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,305
A dream!

492
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,282
Pending more evidence, you're deprived
of space pay and all privileges.

493
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,188
- Me too, sir?
- No, you'll stand 20 extra watches.

494
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,920
I'll have less dreaming
aboard this ship!

495
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,159
Dismissed!

496
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:48,535
Half of this gear we can replace
and the rest we can patch up somehow...

497
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,803
except this special
Klystron frequency modulator.

498
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,312
With every facility of the ship,
I think I might be able to rebuild it...

499
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,109
but frankly, the book says no.

500
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,616
It came packed in liquid boron
in a suspended grav...

501
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,779
All right, so it's impossible.
How long will it take?

502
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,449
Well, if I don't
stop for breakfast...

503
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,988
- Get on it, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.

504
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,627
The tractor's ready, sir.

505
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,368
- Wait. I'll put on a clean uniform.
- You'd better stay as you are.

506
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,002
- I'm leaving you in command here.
- Oh, I see.

507
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:30,411
Establish a standard perimeter
and set up a class "A" alert by sundown.

508
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,472
Aye, aye, sir.

509
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,463
Good morning, gentlemen.

510
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,232
We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.

511
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,638
Morbius is in his study, sir...

512
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:34,041
never to be disturbed
while that door is closed.

513
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,914
All right, we'll wait.

514
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,482
Is there any other way
out of there?

515
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,615
This is the only door.

516
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:51,958
In case you require anything,
gentlemen, use the beamer.

517
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,134
How could he have
slipped past two sentries?

518
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,535
Nothing important, Skipper.

519
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:12,208
Doc, you stay right there where you are
and keep your eye on that door.

520
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:16,151
Okay, Skipper. If Morbius comes out,
we'll call you from right here.

521
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,597
Good morning.

522
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,399
Good morning.

523
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,747
- Come on in.
- Didn't bring my bathing suit.

524
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,341
What's a bathing suit?

525
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,284
Oh, murder.

526
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,790
Never mind.
I'm coming out.

527
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,427
Alta, listen.
You mustn't...

528
00:44:57,495 --> 00:45:01,397
You just wait right there.
It'll only take me a second to get dry.

529
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:08,364
- I'll just turn my back here.
- lf that's the way you feel about it.

530
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,140
Don't worry. You're not gonna
have to look at me anymore.

531
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,507
You'll see.

532
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:22,310
- See what?
- You'll see what.

533
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:28,015
Now wait a minute, Alta.
If you're planning on...

534
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:32,961
I sure didn't expect to see you today
after the way you spoke to me yesterday.

535
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,499
I'm very sorry about the way
I spoke to you yesterday.

536
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,764
I was sort of bothered.

537
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,275
All right, you can look now.

538
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,850
Nothing shows through, does it?

539
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,323
I had it made
especially for you.

540
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:10,697
Oh, I thought you weren't
expecting me today.

541
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,429
I wasn't.

542
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:18,366
I guess there's just something
about me personally you don't like.

543
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,604
You always look just beautiful.

544
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,981
Then why don't you kiss me
like everybody else does?

545
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,815
Everybody?

546
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,946
Hasn't your father
taught you anything?

547
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,288
Well, he says
I'm terribly ignorant...

548
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,123
but I have had
poetry and mathematics...

549
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:41,062
Iogic, physics, geology and bi...

550
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,827
Ology?

551
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,427
Of course, that's mostly
on the theoretical side.

552
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:49,029
Well, so far.

553
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:52,299
What's wrong with theory?

554
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,512
This.

555
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,249
It's all right.
He's my friend.

556
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:55,569
I'm sorry, Alta.
I had to do that.

557
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,971
He didn't recognize me.

558
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,306
He would've killed me. Why?

559
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,046
- You really don't know, do you?
- No, I don't.

560
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,830
- Is he still in there?
- Hasn't come out.

561
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:30,132
Wait a minute, Skipper.
After all, it is his house.

562
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,910
What's the matter?

563
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,912
Doc, something new
has been added.

564
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,281
That's gonna
complicate things a bit.

565
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,497
Not even a window.

566
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:08,067
The robot lied.
Morbius hasn't been in here.

567
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,340
Doc, he's up to something.

568
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,678
Look at this, Skipper.

569
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,949
- Hieroglyphics?
- Maybe.

570
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:21,219
But it doesn't look like
Egyptian or cuneiform...

571
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,884
or Chinese.

572
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,664
You'll find the household silver
in the dining room...

573
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,792
and my daughter's jewelry
on her dressing table.

574
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,303
Dr. Morbius...

575
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,669
last night our Klystron monitor
was sabotaged.

576
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,345
And you suspect me?

577
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:46,440
Then the time has come
for clarification.

578
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,109
Sit down.

579
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,686
In times long past...

580
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,791
this planet was the home of
a mighty and noble race of beings...

581
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,428
which called themselves the Krell.

582
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,337
Ethically,
as well as technologically...

583
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,638
they were a million years
ahead of humankind...

584
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:16,441
for in unlocking
the mysteries of nature...

585
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,346
they had conquered
even their baser selves...

586
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,647
and when, in the course of eons,
they had abolished sickness...

587
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,553
and insanity and crime
and all injustice...

588
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,887
they turned,
still with high benevolence...

589
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,586
outward toward space.

590
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:34,392
Long before the dawn of man's history,
they had walked our Earth...

591
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,797
and brought back
many biological specimens.

592
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,769
I see. That explains
the tiger and the deer.

593
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,369
The heights they had reached...

594
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:49,037
but then, seemingly on the threshold
of some supreme accomplishment...

595
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:52,412
which was to have crowned
their entire history...

596
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:56,510
this all but divine race
perished in a single night.

597
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,954
In the 2,000 centuries
since that unexplained catastrophe...

598
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,119
even their
cloud-piercing towers...

599
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,924
of glass and porcelain
and adamantine steel...

600
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,932
have crumbled back into
the soil of Altair-4...

601
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,130
and nothing, absolutely nothing
remains above ground.

602
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,764
What were they like?

603
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,071
No record of their
physical nature has survived...

604
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:24,979
except, perhaps, in the form
of this characteristic arch.

605
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,813
I suggest you consider it
in comparison to one of our...

606
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,786
functionally designed human doorways.

607
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,968
That recording was made by Krell
musicians a half a million years ago.

608
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:57,179
If you will follow me, I will show you
some of their other remaining artifacts.

609
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,422
Krell metal.
Try your blaster there, Commander.

610
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,912
This spot should be molten.

611
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:38,080
It's not even warm,
and no trace of radioactivity.

612
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,090
The molecules are many times
more densely interlocked...

613
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,149
than in earthly steel...

614
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,354
yet it drinks up energy
like a sponge.

615
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:07,417
This is just one
of their laboratories.

616
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,317
You will notice that much
of the equipment is familiar...

617
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,947
though designed
for nonhuman technicians.

618
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,159
What's this?

619
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:26,770
On this screen
may be projected...

620
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:29,203
the total scientific knowledge
of the Krell...

621
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:32,606
from its primitive beginning
to the day of its annihilation...

622
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:36,305
a sheer bulk surpassing
many million earthly libraries.

623
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,372
- You're able to read this?
- A little. It's my profession.

624
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,075
Twenty years ago,
I began here with...

625
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,178
this page
of geometrical theorems.

626
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,351
Eventually I was able to deduce
most of their huge, logical alphabet.

627
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,825
I began to learn.

628
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,590
The first practical result
was my robot...

629
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,599
which you gentlemen
appear to find so remarkable.

630
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,635
Child's play.

631
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,932
I've come here every day now
for two decades...

632
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:05,236
painfully picking up a few of the least
difficult fragments of their knowledge.

633
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,836
A thing like this,
it's too big to evaluate.

634
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,880
Think what a discovery of this kind...

635
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:13,178
what is this device over here?

636
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,310
I call it
their "plastic educator."

637
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:20,982
As far as I can make out, they used it
to condition and test their young...

638
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:24,050
in much the same way
as we once employed finger-painting...

639
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:25,719
among our kindergarten children.

640
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,594
I often play with it myself
for relaxation...

641
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,361
although working here,
I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...

642
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,403
with multiple arms and legs.

643
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,839
Now, you can see
that this headset...

644
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,308
was designed for something
much bulkier than my human cranium.

645
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,278
Now, over here you see...

646
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,946
the electromagnetic waves
of my brain...

647
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,649
sending that indicator up
about halfway.

648
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,227
I gather that
one of their own young...

649
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,388
comparable to
a seven-year-old child...

650
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,331
was normally expected to send that
all the way to the top...

651
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,029
which by Krell standards
classifies me as a low-grade moron.

652
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:10,301
Yet I have
an officially recorded IQ of 183.

653
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,008
Now then, for the primary function.

654
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,775
Actually, to operate...

655
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:23,513
Well, I'll choose a familiar subject
to start with to save time.

656
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,395
There now, gentlemen.

657
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,059
What's that?

658
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:40,569
What's happening there?

659
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,709
A statue.

660
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,547
That's Altaira.

661
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,348
Simply a three-dimensional image,
Commander.

662
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,854
But it's alive!

663
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:03,518
Because my daughter is alive in my brain
from microsecond to microsecond...

664
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,118
while I manipulate.

665
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,330
There.

666
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,133
Something of a strain.

667
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,395
Aladdin's lamp
in a physics laboratory.

668
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,407
Would you gentlemen care to take
the Krell test of your intelligence?

669
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,308
- Yes, very much.
- You may be disappointed, Commander.

670
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,142
Suppose we start
with the good doctor.

671
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,012
- What do I do?
- Just sit down there, and I'Il...

672
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,080
Move forward.

673
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,916
There now.

674
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:35,186
Now, Doctor,
you can read it here.

675
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,782
There's something wrong here.

676
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,125
I have an IQ of 161...

677
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,826
yet I don't register
a third what you did.

678
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,561
Now the commander.

679
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,081
It's all right, sir. A commanding
officer doesn't need brains.

680
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,314
Just a good loud voice, huh?

681
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,323
Do I pull this switch
to make an image?

682
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,018
Stop! You'd never survive.

683
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:14,086
Our Belerephon skipper tried it,
and it was instantly fatal to him.

684
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,430
Oh, I see.
So you're immune to this too?

685
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:21,266
In my first attempt
at creating an image here...

686
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:24,774
my brain pattern there
was scarcely any larger than yours.

687
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,207
Afterwards, I lay unconscious
for a day and a night.

688
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:30,779
Yet you came back
for a second go at it.

689
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,212
It was a question
of science, Doctor...

690
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,515
but you can imagine my joy
when I discovered that the shock...

691
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:42,524
had permanently doubled
my intellectual capacity.

692
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,528
Otherwise, my researches here
would have come to nothing...

693
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,530
poor as they have been.

694
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,331
Recently I have turned up
some rather puzzling indications...

695
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,669
that in those final days
before their annihilation...

696
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:00,676
the Krell had been applying
their entire racial energies...

697
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,336
to a new project...

698
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,676
one which they actually
seemed to hope...

699
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,740
might somehow free them
once and for all...

700
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:11,754
from any dependence
on physical instrumentalities.

701
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,756
A civilization
without instrumentalities?

702
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,018
Incredible.

703
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:18,493
Dr. Morbius,
everything here is new.

704
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:21,497
Not a sign of age or wear
on any of it.

705
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:26,298
Young man, these devices,
self-serviced, self-maintained...

706
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:30,567
have stood exactly as you see them
for 2,000 centuries.

707
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,471
2,000 centuries?

708
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,477
And during all this time,
what was their power source?

709
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,479
That's a good question.

710
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,539
May I draw your attention
to these gauges...

711
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,585
all around here, gentlemen?

712
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,654
Their calibrations
appear to indicate...

713
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,849
that they are set
in decimal series...

714
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,859
each division recording
exactly ten times as many amperes...

715
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,861
as the one preceding it.

716
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,829
Ten times ten
times ten times ten...

717
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,423
times ten times ten,
on and on and on...

718
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:00,595
row after row,
gauge after gauge.

719
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,071
But there is no direct wiring
that I can discover.

720
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,710
However, when I
activate this machine...

721
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:09,871
it registers infinitesimally,
you see...

722
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,471
down there in the lower
left-hand corner.

723
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,847
And then...

724
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:18,319
when I activate
the educator here...

725
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,815
it registers a little more.

726
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,987
But this much is negligible.

727
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,759
The total potential here must be
nothing less than astronomical.

728
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,095
Nothing less.

729
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,467
The number ten
raised almost literally...

730
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:36,472
to the power of infinity.

731
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,072
Gentlemen, would you care to see
some more of the Krell wonders?

732
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,306
- Indeed, yes.
- Yes.

733
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:47,407
If you will,
step in this shuttle car.

734
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:05,026
How often the Krell technicians
have ridden in this little vehicle.

735
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,062
What now, Dr. Morbius?

736
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,073
Prepare your minds
for a new scale...

737
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,439
of physical scientific values,
gentlemen.

738
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,493
Twenty miles.

739
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,253
Twenty miles.

740
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,630
Listen.

741
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,827
Circuits opening and closing.

742
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:17,396
And they never rest. This is
one of their ventilator shafts.

743
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:21,240
You can feel the warm air rising.
Look down here.

744
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,279
Look down, gentlemen.
Are you afraid?

745
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,525
7,800 levels.

746
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:49,928
And 400 other shafts
like this one.

747
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,400
Yes, a single machine.

748
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:29,138
A cube 20 miles on each side.

749
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:33,114
For 2,000 centuries
it has waited patiently here...

750
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:37,483
tuning and lubricating itself,
replacing worn parts.

751
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,920
I have reason to believe
that 16 years ago...

752
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,924
a minor alteration was performed...

753
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:45,723
throughout the entire 8,000 cubic miles
of its own fabric.

754
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,825
But what's it all for?

755
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,095
Sometimes the gauges
register a little...

756
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,661
when the buck deer fight in the autumn
or when birds fly over in the spring...

757
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,731
and nearly a whole dial
became active...

758
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:02,005
when your ship first approached
from deep space.

759
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:05,013
I'll show you a section
of one of the power units.

760
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,951
These units are sunk
in the body of the planet...

761
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:13,615
fifty miles
right below our feet.

762
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:16,784
Now, be sure and look
only in the mirror.

763
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,795
Man does not behold
the face of the Gorgon and live.

764
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,733
9,200 thermonuclear reactors
in tandem.

765
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,310
The harnessed power
of an exploding planetary system.

766
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,286
All hands, stand clear
of fence area.

767
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,325
All right, Quinn, turn it on.

768
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,887
- Have you tested it yet, Bosun?
- Right away, sir.

769
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,674
- There you are, sir.
- Very good.

770
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,616
Lieutenant? Having completed
my washing-up duties after chow...

771
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,118
I request the lieutenant's permission
to take a walk...

772
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,121
outside the perimeter, sir.

773
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,589
- There's nothing out there.
- But there is, sir.

774
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:25,594
I mean... well, I thought it might
brighten the boys' mess up a bit...

775
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:30,599
if I could find a few
wild radishes or something.

776
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:33,431
I don't know what you're lying about,
but you better get back...

777
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,767
before the skipper does,
or we'll both be skinned.

778
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,501
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

779
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,772
Quinn, this is Farman.
Kill the power on the fence.

780
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,982
All right, put it back on.

781
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:07,796
480 pints...

782
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,395
as you requested.

783
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,302
Total: 60 gallons.

784
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,310
Genuine Kansas City bourbon!

785
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,574
It's smooth too.

786
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,752
Robby, I ain't never
gonna forget this.

787
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,799
Any time you're hard up
for lube oil, let me know.

788
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,507
What's up?
Somebody coming this way?

789
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,245
No, sir.
Nothing coming this way.

790
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:58,848
The fence is shorting!

791
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,728
Shall I shut down
the current, sir?

792
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,697
No. It's stopped now.

793
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:12,030
Check over the whole system
in the morning.

794
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,363
Aye, sir.

795
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,537
It's strange how that fence
just shorted out.

796
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,288
You're too arbitrary, Commander.

797
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,524
Perhaps I do not choose to be
dictated to in my own world.

798
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,566
Dr. Morbius, a scientific find
of this magnitude...

799
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,068
has got to be taken
under United Planet supervision.

800
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,195
No one man can be allowed
to monopolize it.

801
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,297
For the past two hours
I've been expecting you...

802
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,467
to make exactly
that asinine statement.

803
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,476
Just one moment, Commander.

804
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,035
For close on 20 years now
I've been constantly...

805
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:34,447
and I hope dispassionately,
considering this very problem...

806
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,542
and I have come
to the unalterable conclusion...

807
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,645
that man is unfit as yet
to receive such knowledge...

808
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,088
such almost limitless power.

809
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:45,992
Whereas Morbius, with his
artificially expanded intellect...

810
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,725
is now ideally suited to administer
this power for the whole human race.

811
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,289
Precisely, Doctor.

812
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,130
Such portions then
of the Krell science...

813
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,727
as I may, from time to time,
deem suitable and safe...

814
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,568
I shall dispense to Earth.

815
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,631
Other portions,
I shall withhold.

816
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:02,371
And in this, I shall be
answerable exclusively...

817
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,436
to my own conscience
and judgment.

818
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:07,915
Dr. Morbius, in the absence
of special instructions...

819
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:09,918
you leave me
in a very awkward position.

820
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,982
- Commander Adams.
- Speaking, Lieutenant.

821
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:16,048
Skipper, the chief's
been murdered.

822
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,589
Quinn? Murdered?

823
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,595
Yes, he was alone,
working on the monitor.

824
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,188
The rest of us were outside
on guard duty. l...

825
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,530
- How was it done?
- "Done"?

826
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,536
Skipper, his body is plastered
all over the communications room.

827
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,673
Leave everything as it is.
We're on our way.

828
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,193
It's started again.

829
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,736
Is that it?

830
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,570
I tried to make a plaster model
from the footprints we found.

831
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,338
37 inches by 19.

832
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,518
Why, it's fantastic.

833
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,779
Doc, I don't understand.

834
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:24,122
Whatever walks on this would be quite
an opponent for a man with a club...

835
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,161
but with our weapons,
Quinn could have...

836
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:31,633
No. This thing runs counter to
every known law of adaptive evolution.

837
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,134
What do you mean?

838
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,065
Notice this structure here.

839
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,142
Characteristic
of a four-footed animal.

840
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,110
Yet our visitor last night
left the tracks of a biped.

841
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,205
Primarily a ground animal too.

842
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,275
Yet this claw could only belong
to an arboreal creature...

843
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:54,119
like some impossible tree sloth.

844
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,057
Just doesn't fit into normal nature
anywhere in the galaxy.

845
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,593
This is a nightmare.

846
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,856
Is that what you made
out of that footprint?

847
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,898
I think it's fairly close.

848
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,599
Pardon me, Commander. Are you ready
to hold discipline on the cook, sir?

849
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,797
Yeah, let's have him.

850
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:17,602
I'm obliged to remind you that I gave
him permission to go out last night.

851
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,944
Did you give him permission
to get falling-down drunk?

852
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,506
Drunk, sir? Me, sir?

853
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,518
Ask Dr. Ostrow, sir.

854
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:26,419
Four pints of 120 proof bourbon
without a trace of hangover in it.

855
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,252
That ain't natural.

856
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:32,920
Besides, why did that Robert argue me
into drinking all that whiskey?

857
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,724
You were with the robot last night?

858
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,355
Yes, sir.

859
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,629
Him and me, we kind of got to
toasting each other's good health...

860
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,671
just for cordial interplanetary
relations, you understand.

861
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:46,674
Now, that's all the time?
Even while the chief was being killed?

862
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,403
Certainly, sir.

863
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:51,504
I hope you don't think I got
that stiff in five minutes.

864
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,616
All right. Dismissed.

865
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:04,220
I guess that kind of
washes the robot up.

866
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,227
Where does that leave us
for suspects?

867
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,661
Maybe it leaves us
with the same one.

868
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,165
Maybe we should drop over
to that Krell laboratory...

869
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:13,702
and get our IQs boosted
a couple of hundred percent.

870
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,703
Sir, burial detail is ready.

871
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,901
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

872
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,039
- Dismissed.
- Company, dismissed.

873
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,453
Fine technician.

874
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,355
Good shipmate.

875
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,730
That's a good epitaph
for any man.

876
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,709
Good day, Dr. Morbius.

877
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,837
I daresay neither of us
slept any last night.

878
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,075
That's a pretty close guess.

879
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,084
I warned you while your ship
was still in space.

880
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,985
I begged you not to land
on this planet.

881
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,786
Believe me, Commander,
that is only a foretaste.

882
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,259
The Belerephon pattern
is being woven again.

883
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:17,860
Remain here and the next attack
on your party...

884
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:22,394
will be more deadly and general.

885
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,439
How do you know that?

886
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,704
Know? l...

887
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:31,303
I seem to visualize it.

888
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,242
If you wish, call it...

889
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,687
a premonition.

890
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,572
What do you make of that, Skipper?

891
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,766
I'd say it sounded
like an ultimatum.

892
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,308
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.

893
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,545
Bosun. I want a clear field
of fire in all directions.

894
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:10,552
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Randall?

895
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,554
How soon will radar
be operational?

896
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:15,216
- Operating right now, sir.
- Good. Keep on it yourself.

897
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,987
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The M.A. alert is completed?

898
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,790
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Fine.

899
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,455
Activate main batteries.

900
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,362
Alarm for test.

901
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,342
Fire!

902
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,052
Check good.

903
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,466
Lieutenant, you got
your trouble squad in hand?

904
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,970
Yes, sir, but they're
a little trigger-happy.

905
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,507
They're sort of edgy
to see whatever's out there.

906
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,538
Oh, Jerry.

907
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:15,316
This may be a big deal coming up.

908
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,012
I'm sorry if I've leaned on you...

909
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:23,047
Stop knocking yourself out, Skipper.
She picked the right man.

910
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,090
- What is it, Randall?
- Radar just picked up something.

911
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,099
- Where away?
- At the head of the arroyo.

912
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,101
- Moving?
- This way. Slowly.

913
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,809
Automatic control.

914
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,549
Batteries, fire!

915
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,024
Batteries, hold fire.

916
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:59,084
Do you see anything out there?

917
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:01,629
Nothing.

918
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,900
Batteries, fire!

919
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,473
Batteries, cease fire.

920
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,772
- Randall.
- Dead on target, sir.

921
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,335
Good.

922
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,677
- Give me audio-com.
- Aye, aye, sir.

923
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,341
Attention!

924
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:24,477
This may have been a ruse to divert us
from some other part of the perimeter.

925
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,885
Continue watching
on your own immediate fronts.

926
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,423
That is all.

927
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,090
What?

928
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,099
It just stopped
at the foot of the pass.

929
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,101
Are you sure you've got
a real blip there?

930
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:43,263
Big as a house, and we were
on target with both bursts.

931
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:45,102
It's coming on again!

932
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,199
- Straight across?
- It shows here.

933
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,543
It's still coming!

934
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:51,876
Gray, Strong, set up
a cross fire on those rocks.

935
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:28,950
Fire!

936
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:32,787
The blasted thing's invisible!

937
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,660
Jerry! Hold fire!

938
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,106
Fire!

939
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:56,768
Father!

940
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,807
Alta!

941
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,012
- Alta, where are you?
- Father!

942
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,014
What is it?
What's the matter?

943
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,414
I just had a terrible dream!

944
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,885
There was blood and fire
and thunder...

945
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:15,515
and something awful was moving
in the middle of it.

946
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:18,025
I could hear it roar and bellow.

947
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,254
Now, now. You know
a dream can't hurt you.

948
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:23,059
Not me. Not us.

949
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,293
The thing I saw was trying
to break in the camp.

950
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,460
It was gonna kill...

951
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,165
You'll take care of him for me,
won't you? You'll protect him.

952
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:36,542
My darling, I'm completely helpless
as long as he remains here so willfully.

953
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:37,874
Come now.

954
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,624
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir?

955
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,886
Get those graves dug.
Keep the men busy.

956
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,898
- The busier the better.
- Randall?

957
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,666
Give me audio-com.

958
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:05,329
Well, men, whatever it was,
our main battery stopped it.

959
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,633
You believe that?

960
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,837
No, it just went away
for some reason. It'll be back.

961
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,785
Doc, an invisible being...

962
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,253
that cannot be disintegrated
by atomic fission.

963
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,193
No, Skipper. That is
a scientific impossibility.

964
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,854
Hypnotic illusions
don't tear people apart.

965
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,795
That's true enough...

966
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:33,801
but any organism dense enough to
survive three billion electron volts...

967
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:38,067
would have to be made
of solid nuclear material.

968
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,199
It would sink of its own weight
to the center of this planet.

969
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:43,176
You saw it yourself standing there
in those neutron beams.

970
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,712
There's your answer.

971
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,044
It must have been renewing
its molecular structure...

972
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,050
from one microsecond
to the next.

973
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:56,852
- Bosun! I want the tractor.
- Ready, sir.

974
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,917
We pick up the girl and her father
whether they like it or not.

975
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:01,292
Section 86A:

976
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,831
"Evacuate all civilians
from disaster areas."

977
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,459
You left out
two very important words.

978
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,059
"Where feasible."

979
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,231
If you remember
the Belerephon expedition...

980
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,240
their ship was vaporized
trying to lift off.

981
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:16,539
Which makes it a gilt-edged priority
that one of us...

982
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:19,274
gets into that Krell lab
and takes that brain boost.

983
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,274
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir?

984
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,818
I'm leaving you in command.
Get the ship operational.

985
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,484
Do your best to wait it out
for me and the doctor...

986
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:33,551
but the second that fence starts
to short again, lift off...

987
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:37,065
and report back to Earth base
on conditions in this sector.

988
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,565
Right, Skipper.

989
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:54,579
All right. Get everything
aboard ship. We're pullin' out!

990
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,439
No lights showing.

991
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,410
Look, Doc, in case
we make it into that lab...

992
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,474
I'll take the first go
at the IQ booster.

993
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,619
You hear me?

994
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,121
I hear you.

995
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,772
I am monitored to admit no one
at this hour.

996
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:58,478
That sounded final.

997
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,150
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

998
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:12,924
My beams are focused
on your blasters, gentlemen.

999
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:26,341
Hasn't he got a built-in rule
against wringing our necks for us?

1000
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,334
That is true, sir.

1001
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:32,346
Yet I am monitored
to admit no one.

1002
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:39,113
- Let them in.
- This is your father's order.

1003
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,383
- Get out of the way.
- Quiet.

1004
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,753
Emergency cancellation Archimedes.

1005
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,527
Why are you here?

1006
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,506
We were attacked.

1007
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,838
Three more men dead,
including Jerry Farman.

1008
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,485
I don't know.
It was...

1009
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:15,319
just some kind of big outline
in the disintegrator beams.

1010
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,086
And you can't explain it?

1011
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,723
Well, anyway, we fought it,
and we lost.

1012
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:27,030
- I figure it'll be back.
- You must leave, now.

1013
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,797
I'm not going without you.

1014
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,033
But I can't possibly leave him alone.
I just can't.

1015
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,302
- Then we'll take him.
- By force?

1016
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,310
I can't agree to that either.

1017
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:39,313
Can't you? You don't realize
what's loose on this planet!

1018
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,349
But I'm immune,
like both my parents.

1019
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:43,646
That's what he says.
Nothing could be immune to that thing...

1020
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,085
Oh, darling, please go.

1021
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,625
Oh, please.
If you love me, go.

1022
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:59,099
Alta. Doc, will you talk
some sense to this girl?

1023
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,567
I'm in over my head. Doc?

1024
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,033
Doc?

1025
01:24:08,644 --> 01:24:10,578
On the sofa, Robby.

1026
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:23,958
So you took the brain boost, huh?

1027
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,985
You oughta see my new mind.

1028
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,493
Up there in lights.
Bigger than his now.

1029
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,260
Easy, Doc.

1030
01:24:35,337 --> 01:24:38,602
Morbius was too close
to the problem.

1031
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:42,068
The Krell had completed their project.

1032
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,008
That big machine.

1033
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,570
No instrumentalities.

1034
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:49,206
True creation.

1035
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:51,979
Doc, let's have it.

1036
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:54,579
- But the Krell forgot one thing.
- Yes, what?

1037
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,491
Monsters, John.

1038
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,822
Monsters from the Id.

1039
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:02,989
The Id? What's that?

1040
01:25:03,065 --> 01:25:04,498
Talk, Doc.

1041
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,333
Doc?

1042
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,394
How romantic!

1043
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,861
The fool!
The meddling idiot!

1044
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:45,065
As though his ape's brain
could contain the secrets of the Krell.

1045
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,343
Father, he's dead.

1046
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:52,107
He was warned,
and now he's paid.

1047
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,809
Let him be buried with the other victims
of human greed and folly.

1048
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:05,423
Morbius, you wanted me
to make a choice.

1049
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,626
Now you've chosen for me.

1050
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,423
I'm ready to go with you, darling.

1051
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,561
I will place him
in the tractor, sir.

1052
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,070
Thank you.

1053
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:20,297
She mustn't do this.
She must be prevented.

1054
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,138
Morbius, what is the Id?

1055
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:26,169
My daughter is planning a very foolish
action, and she'll be terribly punished.

1056
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:28,580
- What is the Id?
- Id! Id! Id!

1057
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,588
It's an obsolete term...

1058
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,657
I'm afraid,
once used to describe...

1059
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:40,991
the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind.

1060
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,866
Monsters from the Id.

1061
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,166
Monsters from the subconscious.

1062
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,169
Of course.
That's what Doc meant.

1063
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,176
The big machine... 8,000 cubic miles
of Klystron relays...

1064
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,945
enough power for a whole population
of creative geniuses...

1065
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:06,283
operated by remote control.

1066
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:09,551
Morbius, operated by
the electromagnetic impulses...

1067
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,922
of individual Krell brains.

1068
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,221
To what purpose?

1069
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:16,128
In return, that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter...

1070
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:19,634
to any point on the planet, in any shape
or color they might imagine...

1071
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,635
for any purpose, Morbius!

1072
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,196
Creation by mere thought.

1073
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:27,207
Why haven't I seen this all along?

1074
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,903
Like you, the Krell forgot
one deadly danger...

1075
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,007
their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction.

1076
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:39,019
The beast.
The mindless primitive.

1077
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:43,715
Even the Krell must have
evolved from that beginning.

1078
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:47,785
And so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious...

1079
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:50,423
had access to a machine
that could never be shut down.

1080
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:53,593
The secret devil
of every soul on the planet...

1081
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:56,159
all set free at once
to loot and maim...

1082
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,430
and take revenge and kill!

1083
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,401
My poor Krell!

1084
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,983
After a million years
of shining sanity...

1085
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,722
they could hardly have understood
what power was destroying them.

1086
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,963
Yes, young man.

1087
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:28,530
All very convincing
but for one obvious fallacy.

1088
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:34,438
The last Krell died
2,000 centuries ago...

1089
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,704
but today, as we all know...

1090
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:39,713
there is still at large
on this planet a living monster.

1091
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:45,183
Your mind refuses
to face a conclusion.

1092
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:46,321
What do you mean?

1093
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:46,719
What do you mean?

1094
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:52,993
- Morbius!
- What?

1095
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,928
Something is approaching
from the southwest.

1096
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,965
It is now quite close.

1097
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,446
- Could Robby be wrong?
- No, never.

1098
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,079
There it comes.

1099
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,662
I feel sorry for you,
young man.

1100
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:36,033
Feel sorry for your
daughter, Morbius.

1101
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,665
It's listening.

1102
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:49,874
- Alta, go into my study.
- You still refuse to face the truth.

1103
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:53,011
- What truth?
- Morbius, that thing out there.

1104
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:55,022
- It's you.
- You're insane!

1105
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,854
You have led it here where Alta
must see you torn to pieces!

1106
01:29:57,926 --> 01:30:00,554
You think she's immune?
She's joined herself to me!

1107
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,995
- Yes, and whatever comes, forever.
- Say it's a lie.

1108
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,828
Let it hear you!
Tell it you don't love this man!

1109
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,198
Not even if I could.

1110
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:15,409
Stop it, Robby!
Don't let it in! Kill it!

1111
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:28,147
It's no use.

1112
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:30,316
He knows it's your other self.

1113
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,888
We're safe.

1114
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,518
Why did you jumble
that combination?

1115
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:08,824
Whatever you know in here,
your twin self in the tunnel knows too.

1116
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:10,865
I'm not a monster, you...

1117
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:15,261
We're all part monsters
in our subconscious!

1118
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:18,100
- So we have laws and religion.
- Let me go!

1119
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:21,336
You've got to listen.
We don't have much time.

1120
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,937
Here's where your mind
was artificially enlarged.

1121
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:30,178
Consciously it still lacked the power
to operate the great machine...

1122
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,651
but your subconscious
had been made strong enough!

1123
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:35,451
- I won't hear you!
- You've got to listen!

1124
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:38,856
Twenty years ago, when your comrades
voted to return to Earth...

1125
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:42,055
you sent your secret Id out
to murder them!

1126
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:50,331
Not quite realizing it, of course,
except maybe in your dreams.

1127
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:54,130
What man can remember
his own dreams?

1128
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:58,339
At least when we approached from space,
you remembered enough to warn us off.

1129
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:02,679
But when you thought we were a threat
to your little egomaniac empire...

1130
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:06,380
your subconscious
sent its Id monster out again!

1131
01:32:06,454 --> 01:32:09,389
More deaths, Morbius.
More murder!

1132
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:13,018
And now this too?
Harm my own daughter?

1133
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,585
But now she's defying you, Morbius...

1134
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,188
and even in you, the loving father,
there still exists...

1135
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,029
the mindless primitive...

1136
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:23,867
more enraged and more inflamed
with each new frustration.

1137
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:26,304
So now you're whistling up
your monster again...

1138
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,808
to punish her for her disloyalty
and disobedience!

1139
01:32:30,945 --> 01:32:33,914
And if you don't do something
about it soon...

1140
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:36,610
it's going to be coming
right through that door.

1141
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:45,151
Solid Krell metal, 26 inches thick.

1142
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,389
Look at your gauges. Look!

1143
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:50,727
That machine is going
to supply your monster...

1144
01:32:50,799 --> 01:32:53,393
with whatever amount of power
it requires to reach us.

1145
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,102
Look now!

1146
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:08,580
Red-hot.
Soon it'll be white-hot.

1147
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:10,982
Then it'll soften and melt.

1148
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:25,129
Alta, say you don't believe this of me!
Tell me you don't!

1149
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:39,513
Then it must be true.

1150
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:42,474
Yes, I must be guilty!

1151
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,711
Then help us, darling!

1152
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:48,313
I've known you great and noble
like the Krell.

1153
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,970
Guilty! Guilty!

1154
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:12,411
My evil self is at that door,
and I have no power to stop it!

1155
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:46,742
Stop! No further!
I deny you! I give you up!

1156
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:10,670
Father. Oh, Father.

1157
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:15,773
Son...

1158
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:18,945
turn that disc.

1159
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,179
The switch. Throw it.

1160
01:35:37,999 --> 01:35:39,591
In 24 hours...

1161
01:35:41,002 --> 01:35:46,030
you must be 100 million miles
out in space.

1162
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,276
The Krell furnaces...

1163
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,371
Chain reaction...

1164
01:35:53,448 --> 01:35:56,042
They cannot be reversed.
Alta!

1165
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,725
98.6 million.
We're clear now.

1166
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:20,339
Quite an astrogator.

1167
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:24,605
A genuine privilege, Commander.

1168
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:26,840
Activate main view-plate.

1169
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:28,381
Aye, aye, Skipper.

1170
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,877
That's Altair-4,
the bright speck below the star.

1171
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,188
Fifteen seconds.

1172
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:46,500
Yes, Alta, your father,
my shipmates...

1173
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:48,535
all the stored knowledge
of the Krell.

1174
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:52,400
Five seconds, four...

1175
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,636
three, two, one...

1176
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:12,152
Alta, about a million years
from now the human race...

1177
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,718
will have crawled up
to where the Krell stood...

1178
01:37:15,797 --> 01:37:19,858
in their great moment
of triumph and tragedy.

1179
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:28,536
And your father's name
will shine again...

1180
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:30,600
