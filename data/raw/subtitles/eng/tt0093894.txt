1
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,738
Yankee-nine-niner, what
are your coordinates?

2
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,073
Zero-two-zero, flight
level one-five.

3
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,618
We're above release
point Echo-Bravo-one.

4
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,036
Move in and check it out.

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,746
Roger. Moving in.

6
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,925
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

7
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,635
No weapons evident.

8
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,472
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

9
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,474
I said the crowd is unarmed.

10
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,142
There are lots of women
and children down there.

11
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,810
All they want is food,
for God's sake!

12
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,647
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

13
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,649
All rioters must be eliminated.

14
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,986
The hell with you. I will not
fire on helpless people.

15
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,948
Abort mission. We
return back to base.

16
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,325
- Lieutenant Saunders, do you copy?
- Affirmative.

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,411
Take command. Detain Richards
and proceed as ordered.

18
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,081
Richards, what the
fuck are you doing?

19
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,540
Shit. Let's get him!

20
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,427
- God damn it!
- Shit, we're pitching over!

21
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,889
I got it! I got control!

22
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,644
They said detain him.
Don't drop him.

23
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,112
Richards, you're
gonna fry for this.

24
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,906
And I'll see you in hell.

25
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,255
Come on, keep digging.

26
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,050
- What's the holdup?
- This one's had it.

27
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,220
Watch the detonator.

28
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,934
Get that garbage out of here.
Move!

29
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,624
Hey, Charley, did you see
The Running Man last night?

30
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,502
I never miss it. I
even won 500 bucks.

31
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,630
You lucky bastard.

32
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,884
Work crew coming through.
Prisoner transfer to post.

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,469
Okay. Hang on.

34
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,639
Lenny, this is the East Perimeter.
Fresh meat just got here.

35
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,432
Shut down the deadline.

36
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,435
Affirmative. Shutting down now.
Stand clear.

37
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,523
Access code pending.

38
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,151
Verified. Perimeter deactivated.

39
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,903
Sonic deadline is down.

40
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,823
- Sonic deadline is down.
- Okay, assholes, move it. Move it.

41
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,533
Let's go. Let's go!

42
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,869
Get out the lead or lose your head.
Come on!

43
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,889
East Perimeter here. New
prisoners are all in compound.

44
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,974
We're clear.

45
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,309
Affirmative.
Activating deadline.

46
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,521
What are you looking at?
Get out of here.

47
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,859
Sonic deadline is up.
Sonic deadline is up.

48
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,322
Prisoner restraint collars armed.
Prisoner restraint collars armed.

49
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,481
Give you a lift?

50
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,566
No, no!

51
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,241
- Get it open.
- I got it. I got it.

52
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,329
- Repeat the code.
- I did. 653...

53
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,872
Shit! It's not working.

54
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,212
- You're a hell of an actor, Laughlin.
- Who was acting?

55
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,047
Well, you're still
alive, aren't you?

56
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,260
- Repeat that code.
- Okay.

57
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,809
Weiss, what's the holdup?
Come on!

58
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,978
The linking computer's
denying the code.

59
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,775
It must be the walls in
here blocking the signal.

60
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,694
- It's not happening.
- Then we try it outside. Move!

61
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,664
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!

62
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,374
Get out of the way. Move!

63
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,335
Open the gates! Open the gates!

64
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,841
Go ahead! Do it!

65
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,386
Shut off the deadline or
we all lose our heads!

66
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,692
The system's locked. Must
be an encryption lockout.

67
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,985
Damn!

68
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,115
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

69
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,660
- All right! All right!
- Sonic deadline is down.

70
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,663
- Prisoner restraint collars disarmed.
- Chico! Amigo!

71
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,583
Chico! Come back! The
deadline's still up.

72
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,504
He's not going to make it.
That collar's going to blow.

73
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,630
Sonic deadline is up.

74
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,090
Chico!

75
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,344
Prisoner restraint
collars armed.

76
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,555
No, Chico!

77
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,267
Sonic deadline is up.
Sonic deadline is up.

00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,980

Perimeter deactivated.

84
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,077
Please observe and obey.

85
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,497
Zone passes are
required at all times.

86
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,791
Display passes properly.

87
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:49,546
All inter-zone workers with day passes are
reminded that curfew begins at midnight.

88
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:54,343
Anyone without a valid zone card after
midnight will be permanently detained.

89
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,723
Cadre kids, don't forget, October
is bonus recruitment month.

90
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,394
Earn a double bonus for
reporting a family member.

91
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,772
ICS, your entertainment
and information network,

92
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,942
reminds you seeing is believing.

93
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:15,948
What's the number one television
show in the whole wide world?

94
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,118
- The Running Man!
- Yes!

95
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,328
Yes, it's The Running Man.

96
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,416
Four hundred square blocks of danger,
destruction, demolition, and...

97
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,793
You guys want to
buy a hot stereo?

98
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,004
- Stevie.
- Laughlin. Glad you guys made it.

99
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,466
...unstoppable network
stalkers give criminals,

100
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,303
traitors and enemies of the state
exactly what they deserve.

101
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,890
Sundays, 8:00 to 11:00, on
ICS Channel One. Be there!

102
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,810
Produced in cooperation with the
Zone Four Department of Justice.

All rights reserved.

104
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:50,232
The Running Man, America's
favorite game show.

105
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,990
A child, your child,
happy, loving, caring...

106
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,452
Can you believe this shit?
Twenty-four hours a day.

107
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,288
- Seven days a week.
- Don't listen to it.

108
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,083
I worry about the kids. The
network shuts down the schools.

109
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,836
The kids are either in hiding
or getting basic training,

110
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,963
brainwashed by the TV.

111
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,966
We can jam the network once we
find the uplink to the satellite.

112
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,926
Then we'll broadcast the truth.

113
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,929
Truth? Hasn't been
very popular lately.

114
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,099
Can't find the code
or the uplink.

115
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,437
Don't know where the network hid
something that big, but they managed.

116
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,231
Stevie, would you mind?

117
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,861
Goodbye, my lovely.

118
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,377
You're one of the cops who
locked up all my friends,

119
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,962
burned my songs.

120
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,216
People like you took this country
and turned it into a jail.

121
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,718
- We don't want his death on our hands.
- He's a cop.

122
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,763
- He's the Butcher of Bakersfield.
- Come on, Mic.

123
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,390
You can see through that crap.
It's network propaganda.

124
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,517
We don't know that.

125
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,310
We know we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

126
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,646
We also know he's not one of us.

127
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,023
Perhaps now he's seen too much.

128
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,567
I've seen too much?

129
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,361
All I've seen is a
bunch of low foreheads

130
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,072
who think they can change the
world with dreams and talk.

131
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,865
It's too late for that.

132
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,285
If you're not ready to act,
give me a break and shut up.

133
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,668
Nothing worth losing your
head over, though, huh?

134
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,339
You got it.

135
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,929
Hey, get out of here.

136
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,909
Well, there's your ride.
It's all set.

137
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,537
Nothing like first class.

138
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,290
Señorita, señorita.
You want to come in?

139
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,333
Yeah. Hey, you, too?

140
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,627
I guess this is it.

141
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,463
Now you, Weiss, stay out of
the National Database, okay?

142
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,676
And you, Laughlin, stop trying to teach
the constitution to the street punks.

143
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,013
- See you guys at the 10-year prison reunion.
- You can still join us if you want to.

144
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,515
No, thank you. My brother's going
to get me out of the city.

145
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,476
Plus, I'm not into politics.
I'm into survival.

146
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,562
Nowadays, Fritz,
it's the same thing.

147
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,315
Laughlin, save it for the written test.
Good luck.

148
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,983
Yeah, for all of us.

149
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,078
We need you, Damon!

150
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,085
Brenda, do you have this week's
ratings, or do I have to guess?

151
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,713
They're the same as last week, and
those were the same all last month.

152
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,883
I guess we've just peaked. But
it's not like we've dropped.

153
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,968
Not likely. You're
beautiful, sweetheart.

154
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,971
- Sorry, Mr. Killian!
- Hey, that's all right.

155
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,598
- What's your name?
- Dan.

156
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,892
Dan, you're doing good work.
Looks beautiful. Don't worry.

157
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,143
- Thank you.
- Okay?

158
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,603
Thank you.

159
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,524
Brenda, if that asshole is
mopping the floor tomorrow,

160
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,902
you'll be mopping it for the
rest of the week. Let's go!

161
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,695
Security code accepted.

162
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,886
Edward?

163
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,515
Damon, were you down in wardrobe yet?
They've got your new jackets.

164
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,518
- They're fantastic!
- Who chose the colors?

165
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,813
- Hey, how are my people today?
- Fine, sir. Thank you.

166
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,691
You're looking good. Love that...
Tony! Tony!

167
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,485
- What have you got for me?
- Damon, thank God.

168
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,278
The Justice Department's been
calling every 10 minutes.

169
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,823
Just give them an evasive answer.
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

170
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,533
You got my coffee?

171
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,578
- I want to know what we got, all right?
- All right. Let's see.

172
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,292
Lights.

173
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,090
Oh, God. Kitchen,
toast and coffee.

174
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,843
ICS Channel One.

175
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,018
Are you ready for pain? Are
you ready for suffering?

176
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,395
If the answer is yes,

177
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,816
then you're ready for
Captain Freedom's Workout.

178
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,361
Yes, it's America's
own Captain Freedom,

179
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,782
10-time national champion, the greatest
stalker to ever play the game.

180
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,369
All right, now, all you
runners, ready, get set, go!

181
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,705
We interrupt Captain Freedom's Workout
to bring you this urgent news bulletin.

182
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,333
The city police are engaged
in a door-to-door search

183
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,045
for Benjamin A. Richards, known
as the Butcher of Bakersfield.

184
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,383
Richards, a former police
officer, was the helicopter pilot

185
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,218
who went berserk 18 months ago,

186
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,264
firing without warning on a
crowd of innocent civilians.

187
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,309
If you see this man, do not approach him.
Contact your local block warden.

188
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,895
He is considered
armed and dangerous.

189
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,897
Don't make a sound,
you understand?

190
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,567
Who are you? A friend
of my brother's?

191
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,406
- What are you talking about?
- This is his apartment.

192
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,074
I moved in last month.

193
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,035
They told me the last tenant
was taken away for...

194
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,538
- Yes?
- For re-education.

195
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,001
Help!

196
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,338
El asesino is in my house!

197
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,049
El Butcher of Bakersfield's
in my bathroom!

198
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,011
That's the ticket.
No pain, no gain.

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,472
Let go of me! Let me go! Let go!

200
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,684
Now, listen to me, because I'm
only going to say this once.

201
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,271
This is all a lie. I was framed.
I'm completely innocent.

202
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,524
- Yeah, sure.
- Now, be quiet and stay still.

203
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,818
I'm out of here in five minutes.

204
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,116
Hi, this is Amber. I'm
not home right now.

205
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,454
I'm out somewhere having a wonderful time
with glamorous people in a fabulous place.

206
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,625
So, when you hear the tone, control
your jealousy and leave your message.

207
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,128
"Baby Face" March.

208
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,213
Are you kidding me? Next.

209
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,258
How's this one? Case 114.
Schoolteacher.

210
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,678
Killed his wife and his mother-in-law at a
faculty dinner party with a steak knife.

211
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,722
Yeah. See I like that quality.

212
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,267
He's the sort that the neighbors
say, "Such a quiet man,

213
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,354
"but never too busy to say
hello." But look at him.

214
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,941
He weighs 120 pounds. He
wouldn't last 30 seconds.

215
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,068
Who else?

216
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:17,030
What about those bank robbers? The
ones who made that suicide pact.

217
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,492
- Did they commit suicide?
- Obviously not, Damon.

218
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,452
Then they're unreliable.

219
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,787
I got a friend at
a talent agency.

220
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,622
Maybe they've got an
ax-murderer or something.

221
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,960
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Somebody with stamina.

222
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,087
Tony. Tony.

223
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,384
Pipe that feed in here now!
Take a look at this.

224
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,012
This is yesterday's prison break.
Hey. Look!

225
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,976
Look at that mother move, huh?
Is he beautiful? Who is he?

226
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,186
Are you kidding?
That's Ben Richards.

227
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,398
The cop from the massacre?
Sensational.

228
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,609
- Perfect contestant. I want him!
- You can't have him.

229
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,735
Why not?

230
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,697
Damon, you know our contract. We
never get military prisoners.

231
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,533
Who's a military prisoner?
He's still at large.

232
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,785
Yeah? Well, they'll
get him for me.

233
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,996
Cadres can't have it both ways.

234
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,958
They want ratings. I can get 10
points for his biceps alone.

235
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,002
Hello. Yeah, this is Killian.

236
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,380
Get me the Justice Department,
Entertainment Division.

237
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:20,427
No, hold that. Operator, get
me the President's agent.

238
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,139
What is this?

239
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,642
That's my synthesizer setup.
I'm a musician.

240
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,314
Well, I'm really a singer. I
write music for the network.

241
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,943
Have you heard of their theme song, We
Bring You Joy, We Bring You Strife?

242
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,528
Well, I wrote that.

243
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,739
You must be very
proud of yourself.

244
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,660
- It's really nothing.
- Look at this.

245
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,458
They're all on the censored list.
And look what we have here.

246
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,252
This looks like
black-market clothing.

247
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,921
And you wrote the
network jingle.

248
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,840
Come on. Everybody does it.

249
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,967
Money.

250
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,345
That's what I need, money.

251
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,972
That money's not going
to do you any good.

252
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,432
You know, you won't be
able to leave this quad.

253
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,852
- You don't have a travel pass.
- You do.

254
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,355
Now I do.

255
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,193
Let's see.

256
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:26,034
Now where should we go?
Maybe someplace warm.

257
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,453
I need to work on my tan anyway.

258
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,623
You see, you get
so pale in prison.

259
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,542
There you are. Good.

260
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,631
Now, I'm going to untie you, and
then you're going to get dressed,

261
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:45,053
- and then you're going to come with me.
- Yeah? Well, why should I?

262
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,724
Because I'm going to say please.

263
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,523
Well, why didn't you say so?

264
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:01,653
All flights to Pretoria, Tutuville
and Mandelaburg are on schedule.

265
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,115
Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.

266
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,077
All Mideast flights are
canceled until further notice.

267
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,916
You'll never pull this off, you know.
You are unarmed, outnumbered.

268
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,419
Face it. You're screwed.

269
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,132
So, why don't you just forget about
all this and turn yourself in?

270
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,718
You know, you have a
very negative attitude.

271
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,139
Now remember, I can break
your neck like a chicken's.

272
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,268
Travel pass.

273
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,356
What a beautiful day today.

274
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,109
I can practically taste
those piña coladas already.

275
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,153
- Right, sweetheart?
- Miss.

276
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,281
You didn't put it in your
purse again, did you?

277
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,285
Last vacation, she put my credit cards in
there and we couldn't find them for a week.

278
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,787
Here, could you hold
on to this please?

279
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,291
You want to move it, up there?
We got a plane to catch.

280
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,917
Go on. Go on.

281
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,213
You can't live with them and
you can't live without them.

282
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,891
I'm warning you, I get sick.
Air sick, car sick.

283
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,269
I'm going to throw
up all over you.

284
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,980
Go ahead. It won't
show on this shirt.

285
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,414
Help! He's Ben Richards!

286
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,708
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

287
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,878
Out of my way! Get the
hell out of my way!

288
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,298
Positive ID. Benjamin A.
Richards.

289
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,883
Priority one fugitive. Repeat.

290
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,635
All units, terminal seven.

291
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,947
All right. We're on him. Close it in.
Close it in.

292
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,163
Go, go, go. Move!

293
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,208
You move and you're dead!

294
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:44,065
Hi, cutie pie. You know, one
of us is in deep trouble.

295
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,861
- Do you know who I am?
- I've seen you before.

296
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,490
You're the asshole on TV.

297
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,618
That's funny. I was going to
say the same thing about you.

298
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,539
I saw the video of your prison break.
Sensational.

299
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,835
Ben, I think we might be
able to help each other out.

300
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,879
I've got the brains,
and you've got talent.

301
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:12,635
No, you've got more. You've got talent,
you've got charisma and you've got balls.

302
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,097
That's why I pulled a few
strings to get you here.

303
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,268
And that's why I'd
like you to volunteer

304
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,938
to appear on
tomorrow's broadcast

305
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,525
- of The Running Man.
- Fuck you.

306
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,197
You're a brilliant conversationalist, Ben.
A trifle limited, but brilliant.

307
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,283
Take a look.

308
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,492
How long are they going
to keep us here?

309
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,746
Isn't that your old
schoolteacher buddy there, huh?

310
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,207
And there's your other buddy, the one
who helped you in the prison infirmary.

311
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,752
Weiss, Laughlin.

312
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,799
- What are you going to do with them?
- Well, that's really up to you, Ben.

313
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,846
You see, I created The Running
Man, but I don't make the rules.

314
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,098
I've got a contract
with the government.

315
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,517
They send me the convicts,
I put them on the show.

316
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,977
Well, you've seen it, right?

317
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:09,317
And you know at least you've got a chance,
but your buddies, Ben, they're the B-list.

318
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,280
So, if you don't do The
Running Man tomorrow,

319
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:20,453
Weiss and Laughlin are going
to go on in your place.

320
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,498
What do you say?

321
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,265
We'll see how far this clown
runs when we're done with him.

322
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,393
Starting barium IV.

323
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,773
- That's a go.
- Reading all systems down the line.

324
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,025
Your bird is singing
loud and clear.

325
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,153
All systems check out.

326
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,114
Mandibular restraint.

327
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,497
Interphalangic injection.

328
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,796
Deltoid IM injection.

329
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,551
- Procedure completed.
- Takes care of him.

330
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,557
Sons of bitches.

331
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,602
He's wrapped. Knock him
out till show time.

332
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,220
These guys, they never
stop competing.

333
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,389
I get thirsty just
watching them.

334
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:07,602
But in my line of work, I can't
afford that filled-up feeling.

335
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:13,608
That's why I drink Cadre Cola.
It hits the spot.

336
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,197
The capture of renegade police officer
and mass murderer Ben Richards

337
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,450
was filmed yesterday by
runway security cameras.

338
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,786
Richards' hostage, Amber
Mendez, was unharmed.

339
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,664
Some airport personnel
were not so lucky,

340
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,709
like the ticket agent and
security guard Richards shot

341
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,795
at point blank range when
he arrived at the airport.

342
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
But that's not true.

343
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:40,801
They were taken to Cadre Memorial Hospital
where they remain in guarded condition.

344
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,679
And now back to
Climbing for Dollars.

345
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,326
Mr. Richards.

346
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,163
I'm your court-appointed
theatrical agent.

347
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,088
It's time.

348
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,309
And digital effects number one.

349
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,020
Roll process mod.

350
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,025
Okay, you guys. Hey, here we are.
Come on.

351
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,196
Move, move. Come on.

352
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,366
Hey, over here. Here!

353
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,369
Big crowd tonight.

354
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,581
Better there than
in the streets.

355
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,225
Buzzsaw, touch me! Buzzsaw!

356
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,316
- Who's the number one stalker?
- Buzzsaw.

357
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,235
Slice those runners for me, man.

358
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,614
He touched me! Did you guys see that?
Buzzsaw touched me!

359
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,965
Look at my power.

360
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,249
Don't touch the hair!

361
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,617
Look, do you have any more change?
I ran out.

362
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,495
- Yeah.
- Six dollars. Jesus, this place...

363
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,290
You're lucky to be alive.

364
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:02,294
I mean that guy just killed,
what, 60, 80, 100 people?

365
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,924
- Not according to him, he hasn't.
- Well, that's what they all say.

366
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,801
"...and whereas the
victim contests this,"

367
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,263
"whereas network and victim
have in past been combatants,"

368
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:17,101
"ad hoc de facto, the parties
herein have agreed to disagree."

369
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,645
"This is now mutually
consented to be de jure,"

370
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,606
"and therefore parties have certain
obligations to each other."

371
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,067
"Respective rights
and obligations..."

372
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:31,907
Boy, you're lucky he didn't kill you, too.
Or rape you and kill you.

373
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,869
Or kill you, then rape you.

374
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,413
"Conflicts between your
estate and the network..."

375
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,875
I mean, a guy like that,
what would stop him?

376
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,545
Yeah, what would?

377
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,008
Look, Amy, I have to
pass on that drink.

378
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,218
I just remembered that I
have some paperwork to do.

379
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,304
- So, I'll catch you tomorrow, okay?
- And now, here's the producer

380
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,558
of The Running Man, and
everyone's favorite showman,

381
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,227
Damon Killian.

382
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,359
Yeah! Thank you.
You're beautiful.

383
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,446
I love you. Yes!

384
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,658
You're beautiful. Thank you.

385
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,334
It's show time!

386
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,837
Yeah, yeah!

387
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:34,804
All right. Now, tell me, what's
the number one television show

388
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,389
in the whole wide world?

389
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,600
- The Running Man!
- The Running Man!

390
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:44,396
- And who loves you and who do you love?
- Damon!

391
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,024
- One more time!
- Damon!

392
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,192
Yes!

393
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,239
Phil, my announcer.

394
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,783
I heard the warm-up today,
and I've got to tell you,

395
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,453
honestly, Phil, I don't think
I've ever heard you funnier.

396
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,374
I'm just kidding, guys.
You're great at your job.

397
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,334
Too bad it isn't music!

398
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:11,632
"Res ipsa loquitur ad infinitum for
cassettes, videotapes, bubble-chips,"

399
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,135
"and all other methods of
recordings known or unknown."

400
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,601
Sign here.

401
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,186
Hey.

402
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,651
Here, here, here. Use
my back, victim.

403
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,996
Don't forget to send me a copy.

404
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,586
...the love of my life,
my number one fan,

405
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,215
- Mrs. McArdle. How are you doing?
- Just fine.

406
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,177
I want a kiss, now, a big kiss.
But remember, no tongues.

407
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,434
- Bless you.
- Sit down, little darling.

408
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,604
We have one hell of a
show for you tonight.

409
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,815
Phil, please, if you will,

410
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,695
introduce tonight's
guest runner.

411
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,698
And watch that screen.

412
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,492
Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.

413
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,036
He's Ben Richards,

414
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,583
the brutal slayer of 60 men, women and
children in the Bakersfield massacre.

415
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:33,213
Food riot in progress. Approximately
1,500 civilians. Moving in.

416
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:37,426
Yankee-nine-niner, the crowd in unarmed.
Repeat, unarmed.

417
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,262
Abort attack. Acknowledge,
Yankee-nine-niner.

418
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:43,265
- The hell with you!
- Lieutenant Saunders, take command.

419
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,684
Detain Richards and
return to base.

420
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,772
Acknowledge, Yankee-nine-niner.
Acknowledge. Return to base.

421
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,484
Those are innocent, unarmed people
down there! Cease fire! Cease fire!

422
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,910
No.

423
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,177
Well, we all know the aftermath.

424
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,889
Grieving parents,
orphaned children,

425
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:27,267
a nation shocked
to its very core.

426
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,687
Here he is,

427
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:33,524
ready to pay the price
for our home audience,

428
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:39,113
in person, the Butcher
of Bakersfield!

429
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,040
- Look at him!
- Get him!

430
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,422
Get him!

431
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,330
Now, Ben Richards could have gone
to prison to pay his penalty,

432
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,751
but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man,

433
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,502
- risking everything for a chance...
- Excuse me.

434
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,673
...at our fabulous prizes like a
trial by jury, suspended sentence,

435
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,800
maybe even a full pardon,

436
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:46,221
like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

437
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,100
You remember them.
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

438
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:55,230
There they are and at this very moment,
they're basking under the Maui sun,

439
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:59,359
their debt to society
paid in full.

440
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,361
Speaking of prizes,

441
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,323
you don't have to be a menace
to society to be a winner,

442
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,618
'cause you folks in the audience,
you'll get a chance, too.

443
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,871
Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.

444
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,374
Damon, how about a year's supply
of Orthopure procreation pills,

445
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,459
both adult and kiddy sizes,

446
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,462
and the latest edition of
The Running Man home game?

447
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,382
Ben, I know you're just dying
to get into that game zone

448
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,595
and show us that same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

449
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,224
Well, first I've got a
little surprise for you.

450
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,855
We all know you're a
big, tough guy, Ben,

451
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,649
but that doesn't mean
that you're a loner,

452
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,403
and it takes a big man to admit
that he needs his friends.

453
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,406
We didn't want to break
up a winning team, Ben,

454
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,536
so here they are, ready to go
for broke right by your side.

455
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,998
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ben's buddies,

456
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,003
Harold Weiss and
William Laughlin!

457
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,798
Son of a bitch.

458
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,804
You know how this works.

459
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,766
The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks,

460
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,477
left over from the
big quake of '97,

461
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,605
and I don't think any of
us will ever forget that.

462
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,860
Once inside the zone, the
runners have three hours.

463
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,821
They've got to go through
all four game quads.

464
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,866
Three hours or less, and they're
going to need every second,

465
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,034
'cause you know who's
on their tail?

466
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,036
The stalkers!

467
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,873
- Who?
- The stalkers!

468
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,460
- And you know what happens then.
- Anything goes!

469
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,797
- What?
- Anything goes!

470
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:50,345
Right! Without further ado,
it's time to start running!

471
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:03,567
On your marks, get set...

472
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,029
Killian, I'll be back.

473
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,659
Only in a rerun.

474
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,786
Go!

475
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,752
- Go!
- You son of a bitch!

476
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,630
Go! Yes!

477
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,140
- ...team in position.
- Lock down terminus impact net.

478
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:51,073
- All systems go.
- Vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.

479
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,810
Come on, get up!

480
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,446
Edith Wiggins, come on down!

481
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,953
Yeah!

482
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,713
Edith, you look like you might have
done a little stalking yourself.

483
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,051
All right. Now, we need you to
give me the name of the stalker

484
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,471
that we send out to hunt down
those three desperate criminals.

485
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,057
- Okay.
- Give me 10 seconds please.

486
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,729
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

487
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,362
Time's up.

488
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,905
No more bets.

489
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,032
Come on. Back off, back off.
Come on.

490
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,369
- I don't know, they're all so good.
- Quickly.

491
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,746
Well, my husband and my little
boy, they have their favorites,

492
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,625
- but I like my men big and cuddly.
- Yeah?

493
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,127
- Who is it?
- Subzero!

494
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,713
All right. Okay.

495
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:16,510
We're looking for Subzero!

496
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,687
And now, our first
stalker of the evening,

497
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,358
a Cadre trophy champion with
over 30 lifetime kills.

498
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,735
Let's welcome the
incredible ice-man

499
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,198
who slices his enemies limb from
limb into quivering, bloody sushi,

500
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,617
Professor Subzero!

501
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,974
Move. Move it.

502
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,351
Come on. Let's go!

503
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,960
Damon, here in the locker room
there's a lot of excitement, here,

504
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,462
a lot of adrenaline.

505
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:38,300
The stalkers know there's 400 square
blocks of game zone out there

506
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,344
and anything can happen
in the next three hours.

507
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,889
I remember once when
I was in the...

508
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:48,768
Sorry, Cap, I've just been informed, the
runners have entered the first quad.

509
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,062
Let's go there now, live!

510
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,406
- What are we doing?
- Faster, Laughlin. Faster.

511
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,657
Keep going.

512
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,164
Come on, come on,
bring your money.

513
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,874
Come on. Give it to me. Come on.

514
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,418
Fresh blood, first dibs. You pay
your money, you make your choice.

515
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,753
Come on. How about you?

516
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,386
It's cold.

517
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,656
What is this?

518
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,085
Guess they want us to stay.

519
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:07,097
Subzero does it again.
A triple hit!

520
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:11,434
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Weiss, come on! Go.

521
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,799
Banzai!

522
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:48,221
Look at this, an ICS home video.
Yeah!

523
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:54,060
And The Running Man home
version, right here.

524
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,521
Come on, get me out
of here, you guys!

525
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,025
Hang on, Weiss. I'm coming.

526
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,327
- Come on, big boy!
- Yeah!

527
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,412
Richards?

528
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,874
Will, get me out
of here, you guys!

529
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,964
Will, look out!

530
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,266
Kill that son of a bitch!

531
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,486
Come on! Yeah, Yeah!

532
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,947
Hey, Killian!

533
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,952
Here is Subzero,

534
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,538
now, plain zero.

535
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:52,554
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is just horrible.

536
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:58,351
Words can't express what we're
all feeling at this very moment.

537
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,523
A great champion has fallen.

538
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:08,570
We'll be back right after
these important messages.

539
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,322
Pull!

540
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,451
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

541
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,165
- What the hell is that?
- It's gas.

542
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,625
- Let's get out of here. Come on.
- Come on.

543
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,671
- I'm sure glad we took care of Subzero.
- Yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.

544
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,924
I know... I know a stalker died.

545
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,636
Well, it had to happen
sooner or later.

546
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,474
Yeah, well it is a
contact sport, right?

547
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,480
Yeah, see, but you guys at Justice,
you cannot have it both ways.

548
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:48,526
You want ratings, you want people in front
of the TV sets instead of picket lines.

549
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,905
Well, you ain't going to get that
with reruns of Gilligan's Island.

550
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,574
Gilligan's Island.

551
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,829
Yeah, yeah, the one
with the boat!

552
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,672
Fireball! Fireball!

553
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,674
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

554
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,759
Leon?

555
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:18,014
I don't know. I think maybe Dynamo,
but Buzzsaw was last year's champion.

556
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,475
I can't decide!

557
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,435
Then don't decide, Leon.

558
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,480
Hard decisions call
for hard solutions.

559
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,776
And here are two hard-asses ready
to step in and take charge.

560
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,570
You asked for them, Leon.
You got them.

561
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:36,699
Here they are,
Buzzsaw and Dynamo!

562
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:42,372
Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.

563
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,374
Let's give a down-home welcome

564
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,336
to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,
last season's leading stalker.

565
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,382
Buzzsaw's Hammond and Gage chainsaws
are made of Trylon-coated Dura-steel,

566
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,636
and can cut muscle, sinew,
bone or even solid steel!

567
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,062
- Well?
- Ratings just jumped eight points

568
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,397
right across the board.

569
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,023
- Eight?
- Make that nine points.

570
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,943
- I love Ben Richards.
- You want another surprise?

571
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,194
- What?
- Remember the girl

572
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,488
who was with Richards
at the airport?

573
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,532
- The one with the cute ass?
- This is cuter.

574
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,160
They just caught her downstairs. She
was pulling the Bakersfield video.

575
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,705
Would you please welcome...

576
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,541
- Sensational.
- ...our third stalker of the evening,

577
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,625
Dynamo!

578
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,616
Thank you. You're beautiful.

579
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,035
Well, it's been an exciting
show so far, right?

580
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,621
We've had shocks,
we've had surprises,

581
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,082
and we thought, "Why not
one more surprise?"

582
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:13,713
Will you please help me welcome
our mystery contestant,

583
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,424
Ms. Amber Mendez.

584
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,508
Stop that!

585
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,638
- Let me go!
- Amber.

586
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:26,309
Amber. Now, I understand
that you're single, Amber,

587
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,811
and that you live
on the West Side.

588
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,939
And not surprisingly,

589
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:36,736
she has flaunted the law and
traditional morality all of her life.

590
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,073
Go ahead, tell some
lies about me now.

591
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,117
We don't lie. Phil,
tell us all about her.

592
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,498
It's clear. Come on.

593
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,166
Weiss, what is it?

594
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,795
The camera relay, it's pointing
into the zone, not up.

595
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,255
- Who gives a damn?
- Come on.

596
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,134
Hey, where are you going?

597
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:04,097
Later, she cheated
on college exams,

598
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:10,186
had sexual relationships with two,
sometimes three different men in a year,

599
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:14,565
and then she met Mad
Dog Ben Richards.

600
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,275
Her confederate.

601
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,569
Her lover.

602
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,030
That was a lie.

603
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:25,660
Dear, dear, dear. Let's reunite
these little lovebirds.

604
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,954
Go!

605
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,639
It's got to be here somewhere.

606
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,308
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

607
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,685
All the relays are the same.

608
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,603
They point into the
middle of the game zone.

609
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,272
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna connect,

610
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,399
which means the uplink to the
network satellite is in there.

611
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,901
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it.
No one ever comes out here.

612
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,695
If we can find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

613
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,572
We get it to Mic, and the
underground will jam the network.

614
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,948
- Jam the network?
- That's right.

615
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,242
Jam it up your ass. Forget
this crazy uplink business!

616
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,411
You're gonna get us all killed.
We've got to move on.

617
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,581
- Let's go, move! Move!
- Weiss! Sorry, Ben.

618
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,711
Christ.

619
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,853
Stalkers, we've got a bead,

620
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:38,232
20 degrees north, mark seven,
12 degrees east, mark two.

621
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,072
- Yes!
- Come on, brothers.

622
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,032
Let's win one for the Zero!

623
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,414
"Uplinks. Underground. Uplinks.
Underground."

624
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,250
If you guys don't shut up,
I'm going to uplink your ass

625
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,337
and you'll be underground.
Watch out, the lights!

626
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,514
- Let's get out of here.
- Someone's coming.

627
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,065
Hey! Hey! Richards, wait!
It's Amber!

628
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,733
What the hell are
you doing here?

629
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,693
Well, you don't have to
beat the crap out of me!

630
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,696
- You think I'm glad to be here?
- Who the hell is this?

631
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:30,159
She's the one that turned me in at the
airport. Guess this is her reward.

632
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,662
Yeah, go ahead. Make jokes.

633
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,163
It's your fault I'm here.

634
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,834
The police think I'm helping you out.
They even think I'm your girlfriend.

635
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,085
Well, I can straighten that out.

636
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,880
See this camera up there? I can
strangle you for the home audience.

637
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,132
- Another relay.
- Where?

638
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,341
- They're out here.
- Weiss!

639
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,260
- What's he talking about?
- Come on.

640
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,344
Let's go.

641
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,930
Weiss! Over here! Over here!

642
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,815
Richards, cuidado!

643
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,752
You son of a bitch!

644
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,465
Richards, help!
Where are we going?

645
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,135
Laughlin!

646
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,315
- In here?
- Yeah, let's go.

647
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,361
Give me your money. Okay.

648
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,039
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Hey!

649
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,834
The resistance has been trying to
jam the network for five years,

650
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,252
and this could be our chance.

651
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,837
- Let's go.
- No.

652
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,089
This is more important.

653
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:11,260
- It's the uplink to the network satellite.
- But he's going to find us.

654
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,304
Weiss, come on. Weiss.

655
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,437
Over there.

656
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,993
Who loves you and
who do you love?

657
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,704
Let me hear it.

658
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,122
You've got it.

659
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,795
Who loves you and
who do you love?

660
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,879
Let me hear it.

661
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,756
One more time.

662
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,064
Laughlin!

663
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,651
Hang on, I've got you.

664
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,654
Run. Get out of there.
Get out of there!

665
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,583
Laughlin, get up.

666
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,343
Go, go, go.

667
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,631
- Here you go, Leon.
- Wow, yeah.

668
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,592
The Running Man home game.

669
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,493
It's okay. It's okay, man.

670
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,911
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Don't worry.

671
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,330
- You make more money.
- You make more money.

672
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,337
Let's get out of here, Weiss.
He's gonna find us.

673
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,509
- Jackpot.
- What are you doing? Weiss?

674
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,595
What are you doing?

675
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,433
- What's this, Weiss?
- It's the uplink interface. Look out.

676
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,897
Great, hexagonal decode system.

677
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,525
Not impossible, it's just
gonna take a little time.

678
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,238
- Your name is Amber, right?
- Yeah.

679
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,116
Okay, Amber, I'm going to need
you to remember these numbers.

680
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,992
We've got to get them to
Mic, and the resistance.

681
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,371
All right, all right, I will.
But then, let's go.

682
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,537
Richards! I love this saw.

683
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,081
This saw's part of me.

684
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,792
And I'm gonna make
it part of you!

685
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,358
That's all right.

686
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,735
Keep it.

687
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,496
God.

688
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,300
18-24.

689
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,345
Come on.

690
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,266
- 18-24.
- 61-B.

691
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,935
Say them.

692
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,771
- Say them.
- 18-24-61-B.

693
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,273
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

694
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:01,610
- Not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
- 17-17.

695
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,576
- 4.
- 17-7-4.

696
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,204
- 17-17-4.
- Why...

697
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,124
- Come to me, my love.
- Oh, my God.

698
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,585
No!

699
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,865
Let me go! Richards!

700
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,534
Hey, light-head!

701
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,245
- Hey, Christmas tree!
- Richards.

702
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,265
Shit!

703
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,272
All right, all right.

704
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,446
Follow me, light bulb.

705
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:31,867
Got you!

706
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,218
Come on!

707
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,636
All right, all right.

708
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,824
Oh, God. I'm stuck.

709
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,035
Somebody help me!

710
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,748
God. Cut, go to commercial.
Jesus Christ!

711
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:23,544
I have no power! Cut!
Go to commercial!

712
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,926
Kill him!

713
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,226
No. I won't kill a
helpless human being,

714
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,521
not even sadistic scum like you.

715
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,524
Oh, my God.

716
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,235
Come on.

717
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,820
Do it.

718
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,412
- What happened to Buzzsaw?
- He had to split.

719
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,541
Hey, what an incredible battle!

720
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,628
Buzzsaw gone, Dynamo down,

721
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:11,133
but the stalk isn't over
till the fat lady sings,

722
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,968
and the very last criminal...

723
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:18,140
Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
Fireball, you are wanted in wardrobe.

724
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,143
...and our halftime show.

725
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,982
Laughlin, break's over.

726
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,903
Come on, let's get going.
Come on.

727
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,322
I'm going somewhere,
but not with you.

728
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,867
Buzzsaw took care of my
traveling arrangements.

729
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,582
Oh, my God.

730
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,588
- Weiss?
- He's dead.

731
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:57,095
But he gave me the code,
the satellite uplink code.

732
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:01,767
The underground has a broadcast
center in quadrant four.

733
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,437
Take her. Take her
and the code to Mic.

734
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,066
Don't let us die for nothing.

735
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,445
Listen, we're counting on you.
Don't let us down.

736
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,786
I don't want to be the only
asshole in heaven, Ben.

737
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,762
He saved my life.

738
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,724
It should be me down there.

739
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,352
We got them? Hey, Ben.

740
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,522
Ben, I got to hand
it to you, pal.

741
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,900
You got the whole network
here in an uproar.

742
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:56,488
Why, they're shipping bicarb to
the Justice Department in crates.

743
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,200
So that's why this little call
is just between you and I.

744
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,952
It's not going out on the air.

745
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,745
Listen very carefully, Ben.

746
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:08,000
How would you like a three-year
contract, guaranteed,

747
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:12,337
a Cadre credit line, and
a beachfront condo?

748
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,589
Sound impossible?

749
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:17,467
Ben, that's the standard
deal for a network stalker.

750
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,345
And I know real talent
when I see it, Ben.

751
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,724
And I'd just hate to see
you get canceled tonight

752
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,559
when you could go the distance.

753
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,897
Say the word, Ben, and you could
be the one doing the stalking.

754
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,356
What do you think?

755
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,114
You cold-blooded bastard! I'll
tell you what I think of it!

756
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,325
I'll live to see you
eat that contract.

757
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,160
But I hope you leave
enough room for my fist,

758
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,162
because I'm going to ram
it into your stomach

759
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,539
and break your goddamn spine!

760
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,591
Damon, it's for you.

761
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,760
- Who?
- It's the Attorney General.

762
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,390
Get out. Everybody out.
Come on. Move.

763
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,563
Yes?

764
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:16,234
Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!
Fireball!

765
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:19,488
Fireball!

766
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,826
Come on, Fireball!

767
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,394
Let's go!

768
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,948
Yeah! He's my hero.
He's my hero.

769
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:34,271
And there he goes. Fireball's on his way.
And Dynamo's down, but not out.

770
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,399
- Back to you, Damon.
- Hey! All right, Agnes.

771
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,403
Listen now, big chance for you.
Win a whole lot of prizes.

772
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,698
You know we've still got two
crack stalkers out there, right?

773
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:48,660
Dynamo and Fireball. Who do you
think will make the next kill?

774
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,621
Oh, boy, that's a tough one.

775
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,582
Come on, give it a try.
You can do it.

776
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,834
- Who do you think?
- Okay.

777
01:10:56,294 --> 01:11:00,172
I think the next
kill will be made by

778
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,090
Ben Richards.

779
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,301
- You can't do that.
- Hold it, hold it.

780
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:09,389
Agnes, Richards is a runner.
You've got to pick a stalker.

781
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,767
I can pick anyone I choose,

782
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,351
and I choose

783
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,063
- Ben Richards.
- Richards?

784
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,565
That boy's one
mean motherfucker.

785
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:25,781
$200 on Richards. Come
on, 200 on Richards.

786
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,868
$200 on Richards.
Come on, you got it.

787
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,704
- Let's do it?
- Yeah, just do it, just do it.

788
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,830
Okay, okay.

789
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,083
- Okay, man, you want it, you got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

790
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,751
All right, Richards!

791
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,798
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Two-five, two-five.

792
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,803
Secret broadcast center, my ass.

793
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,638
I don't know what Laughlin
was talking about.

794
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,306
There's nothing out here.

795
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:55,143
Me and my big mouth. We should
have taken the trip to Hawaii.

796
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,896
I had the shirt for it,
but you fucked it up.

797
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,733
- Jesus Christ.
- Guess again.

798
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:23,588
- Come on, keep up.
- I'm running too fast. My feet can't keep up.

799
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,343
There we go. The
number one rusher.

800
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:32,931
He smells blood, and nothing
on Earth is gonna stop him.

801
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:42,941
This way.

802
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,359
Why here? No, I want
to go that way.

803
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,528
- I think that... Let go.
- Let's go.

804
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,075
You're gonna get us killed.

805
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,038
Stop it!

806
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,876
Richards! Let me go!

807
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,338
Burn them. Good.

808
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,991
Amber, get out of here.

809
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,161
Go!

810
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,331
Move!

811
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,860
Amber?

812
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,495
Richards?

813
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,466
Richards?

814
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:43,770
Richards?

815
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,759
Whitman.

816
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,106
Price.

817
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,987
Haddad.

818
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,705
They're Running Men.

819
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,333
Last season's winners.

820
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,754
No, last season's losers.

821
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,650
My gas line! My gas line!

822
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:14,350
Cut to the commercials!

823
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,071
How about a light?

824
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,963
What a hothead.

825
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,553
- Yeah, Richards!
- Get him, Richards.

826
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,389
Captain Freedom to wardrobe.

827
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,474
Captain Freedom to
wardrobe, on the double.

828
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,828
Forget it, Killian!
I won't do it.

829
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,705
It's not a request, moron.
It's an order.

830
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,707
I don't need this crap!

831
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,961
This stuff is garbage!

832
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:22,053
I was killing guys like this 10
years ago with my bare hands!

833
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,891
I'm not going for any of these tricks!
This is a sport of death and honor!

834
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,476
Code of the gladiators!

835
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,563
Cap, will you spare me
the combat Zen speech?

836
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:36,109
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you see what's going on out there?

837
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:39,946
This isn't a game! They're
betting on Richards up there!

838
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,241
- Bullshit!
- Get out of here.

839
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,578
Get him out of here!

840
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,331
What's the matter,
steroids make you deaf?

841
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,417
Get him out of here, now!

842
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,348
Now what?

843
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,101
Now let's find Mic's
secret broadcast center,

844
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,395
if it even exists.

845
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,439
Shit!

846
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,568
Let's try that way.

847
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,242
We're trapped.

848
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:30,580
Subzero, Fireball

849
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,290
and Buzzsaw.

850
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,711
Say their names with
reverent pride.

851
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:40,215
They punished crime
and served the law.

852
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,884
As patriots, they died.

853
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,722
This is what I hate.
Third-act problems.

854
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,933
Roll stock.

855
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:52,810
Freeze in digital memory.

856
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,190
- And...
- Activate traveling matte.

857
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:02,737
Tony, this better work, pal,
or you'll be a digital memory.

858
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:03,905
Take it easy, Damon.

859
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,740
We're loading Richards'
image onto the database,

860
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,659
and when he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

861
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,537
you'll never know
the difference.

862
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,206
All right, boys.
Let's see you dance.

863
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,045
Sensational. I love it!

864
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:26,010
Mr. Richards, I'm surprised
you were so easily caught.

865
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:34,018
Welcome to the people's network.
We've been waiting for you.

866
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,729
This is nice, Mic.

867
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,190
But it would have been nicer if you
would have gotten off your asses

868
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:41,734
- and helped us out there.
- We couldn't.

869
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:45,071
We'd have been seen, and the government
would have found this place.

870
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,865
Laughlin, Weiss, would
have died for nothing.

871
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,367
They didn't.

872
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,328
I have the uplink code.

873
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,455
Ladies and gentleman,

874
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,042
I've just got an update on
tonight's incredible action.

875
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:01,546
The runners have entered
the final quad.

876
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,799
And Captain Freedom has hung
up his announcer's mike

877
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,342
and come out of retirement.

878
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:09,596
He's suited up and ready
for the final conflict.

879
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,473
Let's go now, live
to the game zone.

880
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:42,605
Yes, it's all over! What a colossal fight!
This is an incredible moment in sports.

881
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:46,234
Captain Freedom out of retirement
and still undefeated champion.

882
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:50,279
Proving once again that right
and might are one and the same.

883
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,660
Damn that Killian!

884
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,539
What's wrong? You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

885
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:03,042
- We can go anywhere, do anything.
- No, don't you understand it?

886
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:05,670
He'll never let us out of here alive.
They can't afford it.

887
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,589
They'll get the police, the army,
and hunt us down like dogs,

888
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,508
off-camera, of course.

889
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,012
Okay. Dismantle
all the overlays.

890
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:18,307
Put the digital matte in
the pixel memory storage.

891
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,143
You know, the damn thing
worked like a charm.

892
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:24,188
It should. Editel charged us an
arm and a leg for the software.

893
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,650
Damon, you didn't
have to kill him.

894
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:33,489
It's all a part of life's rich pattern, Brenda,
and you better fucking get used to it.

895
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,285
That's the one for the awards show, huh?
Thank you. You're doing nice work.

896
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,536
I thank you.

897
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,913
Tony, you're finally getting it.

898
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,418
Guns. You don't need
guns to jam a satellite.

899
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,170
I do, to keep it.

900
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,671
The minute I steal the signal,

901
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,924
the network will try to shunt
the next one in orbit.

902
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,469
Stevie's group is going
inside to stop them now.

903
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:55,970
These kids?

904
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,639
That's a bad move, Mic.

905
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,768
They need a leader. They need
someone with experience.

906
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,562
I thought you were
looking for the door.

907
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,400
I told Killian I'd be back.

908
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,945
I wouldn't want to be a liar.

909
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,906
Listen up, everybody.

910
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,744
I want you to all to consider yourselves
picked up for the rest of the season, okay?

911
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:25,708
What are you, my people or an oil painting?
We're up nine points!

912
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,044
Come on, now. Let's go, champ.

913
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:34,175
We're going to send the
uplink code in 20 minutes.

914
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,928
Ten seconds later,
I'll go on the air.

915
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,972
- We'll be ready.
- If you want to make an impression,

916
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:43,267
forget the speech.
Try this instead.

917
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:45,478
What is it?

918
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,606
It's the original video from
the Bakersfield massacre,

919
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,942
before they edited
for broadcasting.

920
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,580
Where did you hide that?

921
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,667
It's none of your business.

922
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,014
Hey, what the hell?

923
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:39,699
- Six minutes.
- Begin satellite coding sequence.

924
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,910
Load uplink code into
transponder grid.

925
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:47,957
Shunt power to main circuits. Mr.
Spock, you have the com.

926
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,419
Who's Mr. Spock?

927
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,979
Come on, let me hear it now.

928
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,148
Yeah.

929
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:16,694
Welcome to the post-game
wrap-up show.

930
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,529
Ladies, I love you.

931
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,699
Thank you, young man.

932
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,952
- Hello. You're on the air.
- Hi, Damon. My name is Wendy.

933
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:28,539
Listen, I have a question about Dynamo.
Is he seriously hurt or what?

934
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,626
He's gonna be fine, love.
Fortunately, see...

935
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:34,754
- Good luck.
- ...Dynamo is still under factory warranty.

936
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,297
You, too.

937
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,340
You're on the air.

938
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,967
Damon, I feel so bad
about the dead stalkers.

939
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:43,262
Is there any way I can make a
donation to help out their families?

940
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,681
What a darling you are.
Yes, my doll.

941
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:50,186
All you do, you send your checks to the
patriots fund, care of this station.

942
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:55,900
Three, two, one, that's it.

943
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,069
We got it! We got that baby!

944
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,863
Those contributions
are tax deductible.

945
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:05,534
And who loves you and
who do you love?

946
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,203
Damon!

947
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,497
Yes. Yes. Yes.

948
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,501
Hey, what's going on?

949
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,670
We don't lie.

950
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:20,007
...like our previous winners,
Whitman, Price and Haddad.

951
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,678
You remember them. There they
are and at this very moment

952
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:26,305
basking under the Maui sun,

953
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:29,350
their debt to society
paid in full.

954
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:32,061
Watch that screen.

955
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:35,064
Yankee-nine-niner, what's
the status of the crowd?

956
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:39,568
Food riot in progress.
Approximately 1,500 civilians.

957
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,696
No weapons are evident.

958
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,991
Proceed with Plan Alpha.
Eliminate anything moving.

959
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,742
I said the crowd is unarmed.

960
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,869
There are lots of women
and children down there.

961
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,788
All they want is some
food, for God's sake!

962
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,124
As you were, Richards.
Proceed with Plan Alpha.

963
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,210
- All rioters must be eliminated.
- The hell with you.

964
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,838
- I will not fire at helpless human beings.
- You have your orders...

965
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:02,049
- Where's it coming from?
- The network satellite.

966
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,803
Abort mission. Return to base.

967
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,180
Don't touch that dial.

968
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,142
Detain Richards and
proceed as ordered.

969
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:14,020
Richards, what the
fuck are you doing?

970
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,192
Ladies and gentlemen!

971
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:23,320
Ladies and gentlemen, if
you'll please bear with us,

972
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:27,241
- we're experiencing technical difficulties.
- Bullshit!

973
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,207
It's show time.

974
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,476
Get the people out. Come
on, get the people out.

975
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,950
Thought it was pretty funny
out there in the zone?

976
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:14,497
What's the matter now, bitch?
Why aren't you laughing?

977
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,165
Because there's nothing funny

978
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,543
about a dickless moron
with a battery up his ass.

979
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:32,848
Out, out.

980
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,564
I'll show you dickless.

981
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:24,275
- Get out of my way!
- Get down! Down!

982
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:31,782
Let's go!

983
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:08,110
Hello, cutie pie.

984
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:13,991
One of us is in deep trouble.

985
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:34,637
Sven, do you wanna talk to Mr.
Richards?

986
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:42,603
Well?

987
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:48,609
I got to score some steroids.

988
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:58,118
You look pissed, Ben.

989
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,000
Believe me, you got
every right to be.

990
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:08,003
But, hey, will you
just let me explain?

991
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:10,464
This is television,
that's all it is.

992
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,384
It's nothing to do with people.
It's to do with the ratings.

993
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:19,014
For 50 years, we've told them what
to eat, what to drink, what to wear.

994
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,475
For Christ's sake, Ben,
don't you understand?

995
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:25,729
Americans love television.
They wean their kids on it.

996
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:29,149
Listen, they love game
shows, they love wrestling,

997
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:31,610
they love sports and violence.

998
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,821
So what do we do?

999
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:36,532
We give them what they want.

1000
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:40,619
We're number one, Ben.
That's all that counts.

1001
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,914
Believe me, I've been in
the business 30 years.

1002
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,543
Well, I haven't been in show business
as long as you have, Killian,

1003
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:49,586
but I'm a quick learner.

1004
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,840
So, I'm going to give the
audience what I think they want.

1005
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:53,924
Wait.

1006
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:01,432
You bastard. Drop dead!

1007
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,226
I don't do requests.

1008
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,901
No!

1009
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:57,988
Well, that hit the spot.

1010
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:07,748
Yeah! All right, yeah!

1011
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,796
Take him out!

1012
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:24,640
Richards! Richards! Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards!
