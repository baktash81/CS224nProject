2
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,984
<font color=#FFFF80>You ever feel like
nothing you do matters?</font>

3
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:07,158
<font color=#FFFF80>You leave footprints on the
beach and somehow they are gone.</font>

4
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,801
<font color=#FFFF80>Like its just today, over again.</font>

5
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:15,075
<font color=#FFFF80>They say that your teen years are
for making friends and having fun.</font>

6
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:17,908
<font color=#FFFF80>Which made me feel even worse.</font>

7
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:22,322
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey, Amy. It's Jake. I'm
in your math class.</font>

8
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,794
<font color=#FFFF80>- Hey do not forget your adult diapers.
- Yeah right.</font>

9
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,071
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake.</font>

10
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,143
<font color=#FFFF80>Its a phone for you.</font>

11
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,856
<font color=#FFFF80>But that day, everything changed.</font>

12
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,929
<font color=#FFFF80>Thanks for the ride, Shelly.</font>

13
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,162
<font color=#FFFF80>How come you have to go
deal with your grandpa?</font>

14
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,834
<font color=#FFFF80>My dad, couldn't get out of work</font>

15
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,908
<font color=#FFFF80>I didn't think he worked.</font>

16
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:59,123
<font color=#FFFF80>You know, I'm...
I'm just gonna call grandpa.</font>

17
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,326
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello, this is Abe.</font>

18
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:04,797
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey, it's Jake.</font>

19
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,639
<font color=#FFFF80>No, don't come here.</font>

20
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,200
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen to me.</font>

21
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,041
<font color=#FFFF80>Its not safe!</font>

22
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,573
<font color=#FFFF80>Stay away.</font>

23
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:13,845
<font color=#FFFF80>Grandpa, did you take
your pills today?</font>

24
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:15,486
<font color=#FFFF80>The Key!</font>

25
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,918
<font color=#FFFF80>To my gun cabinet...
it was in the drawer.</font>

26
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,589
<font color=#FFFF80>And now its gone!</font>

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,804
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah, Dad took it. Alright?</font>

28
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,443
<font color=#FFFF80>For safekeeping.</font>

29
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,904
<font color=#FFFF80>It's okay.</font>

30
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,448
<font color=#FFFF80>Your father wants, I should
to fight them without a gun?!</font>

31
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:36,024
<font color=#FFFF80>God bless him.</font>

32
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,496
<font color=#FFFF80>Whats his deal? Alzheimers?</font>

33
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,497
<font color=#FFFF80>Dementia.</font>

34
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,007

heebie-jeebies.</font>

35
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,926

<font color=#FFFF80>What's going on?</font>

39
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:58,273
<font color=#FFFF80>Someone broke in!</font>

40
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,575

41
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,376
<font color=#FFFF80>- 911, what is your emergency?
- 911? Yeah I... I need</font>

00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:10,704
<font color=#FFFF80>the para-medics to 2040 Palm Circle.
My grandpa...</font>

43
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:15,758
<font color=#FFFF80>- Grandpa?
- You have to get away from here.</font>

44
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,520
<font color=#FFFF80>Please, listen.</font>

45
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,300
<font color=#FFFF80>Go to the Island...</font>

are on there way.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF80>September 3rd, 1943.</font>

51
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,704
<font color=#FFFF80>Its okay, just...
just don't move.</font>

52
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,325
<font color=#FFFF80>There's an ambulance coming.</font>

53
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,004
<font color=#FFFF80>I know you think I'm crazy.</font>

54
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,741
<font color=#FFFF80>But the bird will
explain everything.</font>

55
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,323
<font color=#FFFF80>Will you do this Tegrisco?</font>

56
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:46,744
<font color=#FFFF80>Promise me?</font>

57
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,746
<font color=#FFFF80>I promise, yes..</font>

58
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,648
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought I could protect you.</font>

59
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:57,323
<font color=#FFFF80>I should have told you years ago.</font>

60
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,481
<font color=#FFFF80>Grandpa! Tell me...
tell me what?</font>

61
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,083
<font color=#FFFF80>GRANDPA!</font>

62
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,921
<font color=#FFFF80>Shelly behind you!</font>

63
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:47,385
<font color=#FFFF80>There was no one there.</font>

64
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:49,486
<font color=#FFFF80>May I say Jake...</font>

65
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:52,510
<font color=#FFFF80>that considering this
was only a month ago</font>

66
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,632
<font color=#FFFF80>I think you're doing
exceptionally well.</font>

67
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,735
<font color=#FFFF80>Apart from being crazy?</font>

68
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,548
<font color=#FFFF80>Having nightmares and anxiety
doesn't make you crazy.</font>

69
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,420
<font color=#FFFF80>And what about seeing
things which aren't there?</font>

70
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,794
<font color=#FFFF80>Actually in dramatic situations
its not at all uncommon.</font>

71
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:11,614
<font color=#FFFF80>Your subconscious mind draws
an image from a movie, or...</font>

72
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,098
<font color=#FFFF80>It was a story.</font>

73
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,841
<font color=#FFFF80>My grandpa told me
stories when I was a kid.</font>

74
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:20,643
<font color=#FFFF80>About monsters that
he fought in the war.</font>

75
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:21,744
<font color=#FFFF80>So there you go.</font>

76
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,772
<font color=#FFFF80>He was brutally attacked.</font>

77
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:26,058
<font color=#FFFF80>And in your head the man
who did it was inhuman.</font>

78
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,429
<font color=#FFFF80>A monster.</font>

79
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,631
<font color=#FFFF80>It wasn't a man though.</font>

80
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:34,405
<font color=#FFFF80>The cops said that dogs
scratched up the screen door.</font>

81
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:37,247
<font color=#FFFF80>And he chased them
off into the woods.</font>

82
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:40,680
<font color=#FFFF80>And the coroner said
he had a heart attack.</font>

83
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,022
<font color=#FFFF80>And the cops said</font>

84
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,066
<font color=#FFFF80>dogs went for the soft parts.</font>

85
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:52,510
<font color=#FFFF80>The DNA had wounds of animals</font>

86
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:55,443
<font color=#FFFF80>so that's case closed.</font>

87
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:59,056
<font color=#FFFF80>He sounds like an
extraordinary gentleman.</font>

88
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,758
<font color=#FFFF80>Were you very close?</font>

89
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:03,459
<font color=#FFFF80>Puerto Rico.</font>

90
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,161
<font color=#FFFF80>Here.</font>

91
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,804
<font color=#FFFF80>There is a lake where the
water glows in the dark.</font>

92
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:13,247
<font color=#FFFF80>And a secret tunnel. That's
where I hid from the monsters.</font>

93
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:16,020
<font color=#FFFF80>He used to babysit me a lot.</font>

94
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,593
<font color=#FFFF80>And when I was with
him I felt special.</font>

95
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,096
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe.</font>

96
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:26,399
<font color=#FFFF80>Its like 11 o'clock.
What is he doing up?</font>

97
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,653
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm going to be an explorer.</font>

98
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,353
<font color=#FFFF80>Grandpas told me about
my first voyage.</font>

99
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:35,286
<font color=#FFFF80>Everything has already
been discovered, buddy.</font>

100
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,070
<font color=#FFFF80>Pay no attention to your father.</font>

101
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,379
<font color=#FFFF80>He knows bubkiss.</font>

102
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,285
<font color=#FFFF80>Come tegrisco... off to bed.</font>

103
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,825
<font color=#FFFF80>Can you tell me a story.</font>

104
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,256
<font color=#FFFF80>The usual?</font>

105
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,628
<font color=#FFFF80>Okay.</font>

106
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:04,341
<font color=#FFFF80>Once upon a time there
was a little boy</font>

107
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,643
<font color=#FFFF80>where's the pictures?</font>

108
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:08,444
<font color=#FFFF80>Pictures.</font>

109
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,503
<font color=#FFFF80>Once upon a time a
little boy called Abe.</font>

110
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,365
<font color=#FFFF80>That was you.</font>

111
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,610
<font color=#FFFF80>That was me and he lived</font>

112
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:28,461
<font color=#FFFF80>in a lovely children's home on
an little island near Wales.</font>

113
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,324
<font color=#FFFF80>Where the sun shone every day.</font>

114
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:34,356
<font color=#FFFF80>The Headmistress,
Miss Peregrine...</font>

115
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,768
<font color=#FFFF80>Was very clever.</font>

116
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,700
<font color=#FFFF80>And she smoked my pipe.</font>

117
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,342
<font color=#FFFF80>She could turn into a bird.</font>

118
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,275
<font color=#FFFF80>It was a home for special children.</font>

119
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,687
<font color=#FFFF80>Like Bronwyn...</font>

120
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:49,959
<font color=#FFFF80>and Victor.</font>

121
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,562
<font color=#FFFF80>They were both as
strong as ten men.</font>

122
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,263
<font color=#FFFF80>And Hugh</font>

123
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:59,537
<font color=#FFFF80>Hugh had bees living inside him.</font>

124
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:02,679
<font color=#FFFF80>Where is Emma? She could float.</font>

125
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,754
<font color=#FFFF80>She was lighter than air.</font>

126
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:10,488
<font color=#FFFF80>She had to wear special
shoes made of lead</font>

127
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,779
<font color=#FFFF80>to keep her from floating away.</font>

128
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,930
<font color=#FFFF80>Where is she now?</font>

129
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,781
<font color=#FFFF80>She's still on the Island, I believe.</font>

130
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:20,252
<font color=#FFFF80>My mom and papa sent me there,</font>

131
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,757
<font color=#FFFF80>to live with the
special children.</font>

132
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:26,390
<font color=#FFFF80>And now Tegrisco time to sleep.</font>

133
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,421
<font color=#FFFF80>He used to call me Tegrisco.</font>

134
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,963
<font color=#FFFF80>Its Polish, for little tiger.</font>

135
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:33,391
<font color=#FFFF80>Couldn't have picked a
less appropriate nickname,</font>

136
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:34,547
<font color=#FFFF80>I was always a chicken.</font>

137
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,139
<font color=#FFFF80>Why your mom and
dad send you away?</font>

138
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,254
<font color=#FFFF80>Where we lived in Poland,
it was not safe.</font>

139
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,526
<font color=#FFFF80>There were monsters.</font>

140
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,797
<font color=#FFFF80>What kind of monsters?</font>

141
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:48,999
<font color=#FFFF80>Huge ones.</font>

142
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,816
<font color=#FFFF80>With long arms and no eyes.
And tentacles like this.</font>

143
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:03,691
<font color=#FFFF80>The dumb thing was, for years I
actually believed his stories.</font>

144
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,634
<font color=#FFFF80>This is Millard, he's invisible.</font>

145
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,783
<font color=#FFFF80>My teacher says they
are trick photos.</font>

146
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,885
<font color=#FFFF80>And did you believe her?</font>

147
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:25,060
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad says that you get in one of those
places that you were traveling.</font>

148
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,232
<font color=#FFFF80>I would never lie to you, Tegrisco.</font>

149
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,244
<font color=#FFFF80>But you did it.</font>

150
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:33,316
<font color=#FFFF80>About the home... the monsters.</font>

151
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:36,419
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad told me.</font>

152
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,163
<font color=#FFFF80>Your father knows very well that I
went to live in the children's home.</font>

153
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,966
<font color=#FFFF80>He said there were
monsters in Poland.</font>

154
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,609
<font color=#FFFF80>Just not the kind with tentacles.</font>

155
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,483
<font color=#FFFF80>He said you got sent away to Wales
because there were bad people.</font>

156
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:57,327
<font color=#FFFF80>People who wanted to kill
anyone who was different</font>

157
00:13:57,857 --> 00:14:00,129
<font color=#FFFF80>I do not want to talk
about this anymore.</font>

158
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:03,432
<font color=#FFFF80>He said children were special</font>

159
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:08,046
<font color=#FFFF80>but not the way you said.</font>

160
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,748
<font color=#FFFF80>You find something good?</font>

161
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,690
<font color=#FFFF80>Aw. Look at that.</font>

162
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,452
<font color=#FFFF80>It's awesome.</font>

163
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,363
<font color=#FFFF80>Take that.</font>

164
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,896
<font color=#FFFF80>C'mon buddy, lets roll.</font>

165
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,938
<font color=#FFFF80>How are you so okay?</font>

166
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,882
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, You were a lot closer
to him than I ever was.</font>

167
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:06,785
<font color=#FFFF80>He was a wonderful grandpa. But not...
not such a great dad, you know?</font>

168
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,280
<font color=#FFFF80>Never seemed to pick a
job that didn't involve</font>

169
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,411
<font color=#FFFF80>late nights and long
trips away though.</font>

170
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:19,246
<font color=#FFFF80>Me and Aunt Sussie I always kinda thought
he was maybe cheating on our mom.</font>

171
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:26,792
<font color=#FFFF80>I am sorry, buddy. I know how much
you worshipped him but there it is.</font>

172
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,669
<font color=#FFFF80>Surprise!!</font>

173
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,511
<font color=#FFFF80>Happy Birthday. Cousin Jake.</font>

174
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,920
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, its great you've to come
to spend the summer with us.</font>

175
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,615
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait till you see the new dogs.</font>

176
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,456
<font color=#FFFF80>Can't wait.</font>

177
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,806
<font color=#FFFF80>Its aunt Sussie.</font>

178
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,548
<font color=#FFFF80>Thought you might want
to open this one.</font>

179
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:00,580
<font color=#FFFF80>Its from your grandpa.</font>

180
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:05,094
<font color=#FFFF80>Found it while I was packing up. I figured
he meant to give it to you someday.</font>

181
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,966
<font color=#FFFF80>Thanks.</font>

191
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,433
<font color=#FFFF80>I suppose its possible she
could still be still be alive.</font>

192
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:03,934
<font color=#FFFF80>Right.</font>

193
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,276
<font color=#FFFF80>And I could meet her.</font>

194
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,709
<font color=#FFFF80>Maybe even find out what it was
Grandpa wanted me to know.</font>

195
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,410
<font color=#FFFF80>But what if she's dead?</font>

196
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,983
<font color=#FFFF80>Dr. Golan, we are very concerned
with Jake's state of mind right now.</font>

197
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:18,756
<font color=#FFFF80>And there is no way I'm putting my
life on hold to take you to Wales.</font>

198
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,028
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad could take me.</font>

199
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:25,242
<font color=#FFFF80>And he can even look at birds...
work in his book.</font>

200
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:27,644
<font color=#FFFF80>It means you get a break.</font>

201
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:32,118
<font color=#FFFF80>And as Dr. Golan said.
Maybe I can move on.</font>

202
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,320
<font color=#FFFF80>Like closure.</font>

203
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,198
<font color=#FFFF80>Having an opportunity to
see this Children's Home</font>

204
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,244
<font color=#FFFF80>and separate fantasy
from reality,</font>

205
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:46,279
<font color=#FFFF80>May be useful and at the very least a
trip like this provides a chance to</font>

206
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,282
<font color=#FFFF80>say goodbye.</font>

210
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,848
<font color=#FFFF80>There is only one hotel.</font>

211
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:09,960
<font color=#FFFF80>That's us</font>

212
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,592
<font color=#FFFF80>I hope there's bourbon.</font>

213
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:19,007
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh wow! Jake! Check it out.
That's a peregrine falcon.</font>

214
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,610
<font color=#FFFF80>Peregrine, like the Headmistress?</font>

215
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,211
<font color=#FFFF80>Sure.</font>

216
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,455
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey that's probably where grandpa came with
the tale of turning into a bird thing.</font>

217
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,297
<font color=#FFFF80>Maybe. Maybe that's really her.</font>

218

I am Abe Portman's grandson.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Oh. God, Dad I'm kidding.</font>

221
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,633
<font color=#FFFF80>What the H... Hello?</font>

222
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,675
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello?</font>

223
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,621
<font color=#FFFF80>Anybody home?</font>

225

the manager of this place?</font>

226
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:37,783
<font color=#FFFF80>That's me.</font>

227
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:41,096
<font color=#FFFF80>Sorry to keep you. Just helping
uncle Oggie to the loo.</font>

228
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,560
<font color=#FFFF80>- I'm Kev. There's a room upstairs.
- Oh, Great.</font>

229
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,902
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll be back in a bit.</font>

230
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:50,775
<font color=#FFFF80>Kev's just getting
our suite ready.</font>

231
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,748
<font color=#FFFF80>While we are waiting, I thought maybe
we could go check out the beach.</font>

232
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,320
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought we'd go to
the Children's Home.</font>

233
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,722
<font color=#FFFF80>It the beach where
the birds nest?</font>

234
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,003
<font color=#FFFF80>I...I thought we could
check it out real quick</font>

235
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,596
<font color=#FFFF80>I could go to the
home by myself.</font>

236
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,608
<font color=#FFFF80>And you can, really
take your time.</font>

237
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:08,970
<font color=#FFFF80>And I enjoy it.</font>

238
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,042
<font color=#FFFF80>Come on. Jakey. You know
your mom would freak.</font>

239
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:14,684
<font color=#FFFF80>What if we can find
someone to take me?</font>

240
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,157
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey dudes.</font>

241
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:20,200
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad! I got this</font>

242
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,387
<font color=#FFFF80>I was just wondering if any of you guys
might be interested in taking my son here,</font>

243
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:24,784
<font color=#FFFF80>to the other side of the island.</font>

244
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,067
<font color=#FFFF80>And what are your names?</font>

245
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,639
<font color=#FFFF80>I am Worm and this
is Epsy Denty.</font>

246
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,270
<font color=#FFFF80>Epsy Bussines.</font>

247
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,042
<font color=#FFFF80>- I thought you changed that!
- No!</font>

248
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:48,683
<font color=#FFFF80>No. You did remember?</font>

249
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:52,516
<font color=#FFFF80>When Lou said Epsy Bussines made
it look like cracked trousers.</font>

250
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:55,307
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah, But she said it sounded
like a personal hygiene problem.</font>

251
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,901
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, Are these are
like nicknames or...</font>

252
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:00,674
<font color=#FFFF80>stage names of rappers
here in Wales.</font>

253
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:03,376
<font color=#FFFF80>Come on, Worm, show
this shank how its done.</font>

254
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,977
<font color=#FFFF80>What? Now?</font>

255
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,149
<font color=#FFFF80>I like to throw letters
in the churches.</font>

256
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,050
<font color=#FFFF80>My father is always
there, the very dog.</font>

257
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,592
<font color=#FFFF80>But no one can with me,</font>

258
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:13,494
<font color=#FFFF80>I will break the ice
like a burning blade.</font>

259
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,437
<font color=#FFFF80>Yes, it is, it is good.</font>

260
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,210
<font color=#FFFF80>Should we take the shortcut, D.
We'll get there quicker.</font>

261
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,912
<font color=#FFFF80>Take it from me.</font>

262
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:24,883
<font color=#FFFF80>What? Down here?</font>

263
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:41,678
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah.</font>

264
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,938
<font color=#FFFF80>Is this even the way to
the Children's home?</font>

265
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,870
<font color=#FFFF80>Right through those trees.</font>

266
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:27,727
<font color=#FFFF80>No use cryin' over
a lost shoe, boy.</font>

267
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,812
<font color=#FFFF80>The Children's Home...
What happened to it?</font>

268
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,545
<font color=#FFFF80>The German navy A bomb
fell right on the roof.</font>

269
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:41,018
<font color=#FFFF80>September the 3rd, 1943.</font>

270
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,230
<font color=#FFFF80>Where... where did
they go after it?</font>

271
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,592
<font color=#FFFF80>The Headmistress
and the children?</font>

272
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,164
<font color=#FFFF80>Not one survivor.</font>

273
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,407
<font color=#FFFF80>Poor little buggers... and
they were lovely too.</font>

274
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:56,011
<font color=#FFFF80>Why didn't he tell us
that they all died?</font>

275
00:22:56,581 --> 00:23:01,125
<font color=#FFFF80>He leaves to join the army and three
months everyone he knows gets killed?</font>

276
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,468
<font color=#FFFF80>Not even grandpa can turn
that into a bedtime story.</font>

277
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:08,771
<font color=#FFFF80>No wonder he was
scared at being a dad.</font>

278
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,543
<font color=#FFFF80>Being close to anyone.</font>

279
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:14,346
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen.</font>

280
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,119
<font color=#FFFF80>If you need to talk about all
this with someone, buddy.</font>

281
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,361
<font color=#FFFF80>We should call Dr. Golan.</font>

282
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:31,951
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you mind if I go hang out
with those other kids today?</font>

283
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,383
<font color=#FFFF80>They asked.</font>

284
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:36,495
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah. That's awesome</font>

285
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,696
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe?</font>

286
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:02,988
<font color=#FFFF80>You're Emma.</font>

287
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,330
<font color=#FFFF80>And the twins.</font>

288
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,271
<font color=#FFFF80>And Olive.</font>

289
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:09,303
<font color=#FFFF80>Bromwin.</font>

290
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,746
<font color=#FFFF80>He's Miller.</font>

291
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:13,818
<font color=#FFFF80>You are dead.</font>

292
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:15,819
<font color=#FFFF80>All of you. You're all dead</font>

293
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,892
<font color=#FFFF80>I mean he is... he is
invisible he's still dead.</font>

294
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:21,694
<font color=#FFFF80>None of us are dead.</font>

295
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,166
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh my God. Am I dead?</font>

296
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:25,567
<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

297
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:31,342
<font color=#FFFF80>You called me Abe, in the house.
Why?</font>

298
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:33,514
<font color=#FFFF80>You look like him.</font>

299
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,215
<font color=#FFFF80>Just for a moment.</font>

300
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,058
<font color=#FFFF80>Before you started screaming, running
away and concussing yourself.</font>

301
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,000
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, what's happening?</font>

302
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,533
<font color=#FFFF80>We are waiting until the coast is
clear before we go into the loop.</font>

303
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,606
<font color=#FFFF80>You never know who
might be watching.</font>

304
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,519
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, before we...
before we go into what?</font>

305
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:53,443
<font color=#FFFF80>Please Jake
Ms. peregrine's waiting.</font>

306
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:56,503
<font color=#FFFF80>She saw on the ferry and
sent us to get you.</font>

307
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:49,518
<font color=#FFFF80>Where do you think you're going?</font>

308
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:52,060
<font color=#FFFF80>To my room.</font>

309
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,332
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm a... I am a guest here.</font>

310
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,976
<font color=#FFFF80>Does this look like a hotel to you?</font>

311
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,549
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah... No!</font>

312
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,151
<font color=#FFFF80>I've... I've got a key.</font>

313
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,894
<font color=#FFFF80>Talk to the manager.
He'll tell you.</font>

314
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,125
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm the manager, boy.</font>

315
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:11,527
<font color=#FFFF80>He's American.</font>

316
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,198
<font color=#FFFF80>Maybe he's army?</font>

317
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:16,711
<font color=#FFFF80>Bollocks! Listen to his accent.
It's terrible!</font>

318
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:19,473
<font color=#FFFF80>He is a spy.</font>

319
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:21,515
<font color=#FFFF80>What?</font>

320
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:24,217
<font color=#FFFF80>No, I'm not I'm a tourist</font>

321
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,344
<font color=#FFFF80>I say, we should get
the truth out of him</font>

322
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:28,741
<font color=#FFFF80>the old-fashioned way.</font>

323
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,091
<font color=#FFFF80>Come on, quick guys.</font>

324
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,852
<font color=#FFFF80>I can't believe you're real.</font>

325
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:18,253
<font color=#FFFF80>You're all real.</font>

326
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,901
<font color=#FFFF80>We've been trying to tell you.</font>

327
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,045
<font color=#FFFF80>But I am special too.</font>

328
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,196
<font color=#FFFF80>What?</font>

329
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,098
<font color=#FFFF80>In the pub all of you saw it.
Right?</font>

330
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:28,341
<font color=#FFFF80>Everything was flying and breaking.
And that was me.</font>

331
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,643
<font color=#FFFF80>I was doing it with my mind.</font>

332
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,945
<font color=#FFFF80>No, that was me</font>

333
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:35,117
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller? Yeah.</font>

334
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,420
<font color=#FFFF80>Are you naked? Yeah.</font>

335
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:49,439
<font color=#FFFF80>A bomb drops on you in 1943.</font>

336
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,451
<font color=#FFFF80>It is 1943</font>

337
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,383
<font color=#FFFF80>September the 3rd, 1943.</font>

338
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:56,525
<font color=#FFFF80>The whole day, every day.</font>

339
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,457
<font color=#FFFF80>Its our loop.</font>

340
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,385
<font color=#FFFF80>Right on time.</font>

341
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:35,458
<font color=#FFFF80>Ms. Peregrine.
Delighted to meet you.</font>

342
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,007
<font color=#FFFF80>I do hope I'm not going
to have the pub landlord</font>

343
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:39,679
<font color=#FFFF80>knocking on my door
with the police again?</font>

344
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,903
<font color=#FFFF80>I've had to kill them
twice this month.</font>

345
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:43,775
<font color=#FFFF80>Its been terribly inconvenient.</font>

346
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,076
<font color=#FFFF80>We may have broken some
things, that's all.</font>

347
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:50,160
<font color=#FFFF80>And Olive may have
started a tiny fire.</font>

348
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,463
<font color=#FFFF80>But they were going
to hurt Jake.</font>

349
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,408
<font color=#FFFF80>Look at you!</font>

350
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,981
<font color=#FFFF80>The last time dear Abe sent me a
photograph, you were a just a tiny todd.</font>

351
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:04,692
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't you stand there, come in.</font>

352
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,884
<font color=#FFFF80>Your tea is getting cold.</font>

353
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,758
<font color=#FFFF80>How did you know about the pub?</font>

354
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:13,400
<font color=#FFFF80>Your weigh approximately
a 109 pounds, correct?</font>

355
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,532
<font color=#FFFF80>Bronwyn and the twins returned
six minutes after you ran away.</font>

356
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,043
<font color=#FFFF80>I think I'm missing something.</font>

357
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,776
<font color=#FFFF80>And quite apart from the fact that the
perceived safety of the pub makes it...</font>

358
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:22,458
<font color=#FFFF80>the most likely place to
which you would flee?</font>

359
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,228
<font color=#FFFF80>It would take you 18
minutes to run there.</font>

360
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,214
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma and Miller would
have been moments behind</font>

361
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:28,804
<font color=#FFFF80>with the horse and trap traveling
at around 8.2 miles per hour.</font>

362
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,925
<font color=#FFFF80>Fact doing some sort of
Kerfuffle in the pub</font>

363
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:34,118
<font color=#FFFF80>and the return journey
with your added weight.</font>

364
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:37,580
<font color=#FFFF80>You would arrive here
with 30 minutes past 4</font>

365
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,082
<font color=#FFFF80>now then, do you like sugar?</font>

366
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:44,926
<font color=#FFFF80>That will be enough, thank you Olive.
Nobody enjoys over boiled tea.</font>

367
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:57,417
<font color=#FFFF80>Let me help you, Enoch.</font>

368
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:58,948
<font color=#FFFF80>Do not bother.</font>

369
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:02,020
<font color=#FFFF80>Wouldn't want you to
interrupt the tea party.</font>

370
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,540
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm so sorry for
your loss, Jake.</font>

371
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,943
<font color=#FFFF80>You know, then?</font>

372
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:18,855
<font color=#FFFF80>I know if Abe were alive.</font>

373
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:21,557
<font color=#FFFF80>You would have told
me you were coming.</font>

374
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:26,531
<font color=#FFFF80>Shall we take our tea outside?</font>

375
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:33,347
<font color=#FFFF80>Before he died he
told me to find you.</font>

376
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,249
<font color=#FFFF80>There was something
he wanted me to know.</font>

377
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:38,191
<font color=#FFFF80>He said you could
explain everything.</font>

378
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:42,065
<font color=#FFFF80>That's absolutely true. But there
are few things I can't explain.</font>

379
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:46,398
<font color=#FFFF80>We are in common
parlance - as peculiar</font>

380
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,482
<font color=#FFFF80>51 seconds late, Fiona.</font>

381
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:52,113
<font color=#FFFF80>Sorry Ms. Peregrine.</font>

382
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,015
<font color=#FFFF80>How many carrots you
need for supper?</font>

383
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:56,086
<font color=#FFFF80>Just one will do.</font>

384
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:13,851
<font color=#FFFF80>As I was saying some
people are peculiar.</font>

385
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:16,794
<font color=#FFFF80>Its a recessive gene carried
down through families.</font>

386
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:21,768
<font color=#FFFF80>Yet, many generations can pass
without a peculiar child being born.</font>

387
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:26,212
<font color=#FFFF80>And alas, peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages.</font>

388
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:29,144
<font color=#FFFF80>Hence, we live in places like this.</font>

389
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:31,216
<font color=#FFFF80>In Wales?</font>

390
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:33,564
<font color=#FFFF80>Anywhere will do if you
pick the right day.</font>

391
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:36,430
<font color=#FFFF80>That's fine now, Fiona.</font>

392
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:43,746
<font color=#FFFF80>You see. I am a type of peculiar
called an Ymbryne. That means I can...</font>

393
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:45,808
<font color=#FFFF80>You can turn into a bird.</font>

394
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:49,051
<font color=#FFFF80>Well I do! But that's
not very useful.</font>

395
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:52,554
<font color=#FFFF80>An Ymbryne's main skill is
the manipulation of time.</font>

396
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:57,438
<font color=#FFFF80>We chose a safe place, a
safe day and create a loop.</font>

397
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,040
<font color=#FFFF80>What do you mean?</font>

398
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,613
<font color=#FFFF80>A loop preserves
the last 24 hours.</font>

399
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:06,085
<font color=#FFFF80>Reset the loop and the day
is yours to live in again.</font>

400
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,418
<font color=#FFFF80>Reset it daily and you
can stay there forever.</font>

401
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:12,591
<font color=#FFFF80>Entirely safe from
the outside world.</font>

402
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,863
<font color=#FFFF80>Right on time
Bronwyn, good girl.</font>

403
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:24,752
<font color=#FFFF80>And that's why we Ymbrynes are
charged with the care of the young.</font>

404
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:29,596
<font color=#FFFF80>And no one ever gets older?</font>

405
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:32,168
<font color=#FFFF80>Its best for everyone this way</font>

406
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:34,169
<font color=#FFFF80>I assure you.</font>

407
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:41,846
<font color=#FFFF80>Each Ymbryne commits herself to the
creation and upkeep of a place like this.</font>

408
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:45,218
<font color=#FFFF80>A Home for Peculiar Children.</font>

409
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,710
<font color=#FFFF80>You've met the twins.</font>

410
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:06,457
<font color=#FFFF80>This is Claire</font>

411
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,218
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller you've met.</font>

412
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,362
<font color=#FFFF80>And that's Hugh.</font>

413
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:30,676
<font color=#FFFF80>Stop cheating Hugh</font>

414
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:33,278
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller thats a foul, again!</font>

415
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,211
<font color=#FFFF80>No it wasn't!</font>

416
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:40,355
<font color=#FFFF80>If you two cant play without squabbling,
wish you wouldn't play at all.</font>

417
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:42,527
<font color=#FFFF80>Look who our referee is.</font>

418
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,530
<font color=#FFFF80>Good afternoon. I'm Horace.
Delighted to meet you.</font>

419
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:49,943
<font color=#FFFF80>We sorely needed some new blood here.</font>

420
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,346
<font color=#FFFF80>Super shirt by the way.</font>

421
00:35:53,816 --> 00:35:55,117
<font color=#FFFF80>Thanks.</font>

422
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,362
<font color=#FFFF80>You know Emma, of course.</font>

423
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,934
<font color=#FFFF80>And I think thats everyone.</font>

424
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,837
<font color=#FFFF80>Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?</font>

425
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,539
<font color=#FFFF80>Yes, Victor's upstairs.</font>

426
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,952
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, where did
Enoch and Olive go?</font>

427
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:13,313
<font color=#FFFF80>Heaven knows.</font>

428
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:15,785
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch's been off ever since
we went to look for Jake.</font>

429
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,796
<font color=#FFFF80>Ms. Peregrine there's a
policemen at the door.</font>

430
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:18,938
<font color=#FFFF80>He says it's about the pub.</font>

431
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:24,842
<font color=#FFFF80>We discuss this later, Emma.</font>

432
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:27,274
<font color=#FFFF80>It wasn't their fault.</font>

433
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,917
<font color=#FFFF80>Honestly, just they were
just trying to help.</font>

434
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:43,408
<font color=#FFFF80>Thanks. You're not
as vet as I thought.</font>

435
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,714
<font color=#FFFF80>She's not really going
to kill anyone, is she?</font>

436
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,186
<font color=#FFFF80>Not if she can talk
her way out of it.</font>

437
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,027
<font color=#FFFF80>Would you help me
with something.</font>

438
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:57,570
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch usually does it but, like I
said, he is sulking somewhere.</font>

439
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:00,132
<font color=#FFFF80>Is that because of me?</font>

440
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:02,674
<font color=#FFFF80>He is possessive.</font>

441
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:07,748
<font color=#FFFF80>So... What you need help with?</font>

442
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,450
<font color=#FFFF80>One of my daily chores.</font>

443
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,022
<font color=#FFFF80>Put the baby squirrel
back in the tree.</font>

444
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:14,534
<font color=#FFFF80>What baby squirrel?</font>

445
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,679
<font color=#FFFF80>That happens every day?</font>

446
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,712
<font color=#FFFF80>Like clockwork.</font>

447
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:26,314
<font color=#FFFF80>Now, would you mind tying
that rope around my waist?</font>

448
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:28,927
<font color=#FFFF80>Uh... Yeah.</font>

449
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,782
<font color=#FFFF80>Right. Promise to hold on tight?</font>

450
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,031
<font color=#FFFF80>I knew we messed that up.</font>

451
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:48,704
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe did too... the first time.</font>

452
00:38:49,304 --> 00:38:51,676
<font color=#FFFF80>This used to be his job</font>

453
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:56,120
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma, ​​I need to tell you something.</font>

454
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,552
<font color=#FFFF80>He is dead.</font>

455
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:04,036
<font color=#FFFF80>I know. Ms. Peregrine guessed
and she's always right.</font>

456
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:06,839
<font color=#FFFF80>It's okay</font>

457
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,372
<font color=#FFFF80>I said goodbye to him
a long time ago.</font>

458
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,084
<font color=#FFFF80>Were you close?</font>

459
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,257
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought we were.</font>

460
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,659
<font color=#FFFF80>For a while.</font>

461
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:21,331
<font color=#FFFF80>But I suppose not.</font>

462
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:26,706
<font color=#FFFF80>Can I ask, was he like you?</font>

463
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:31,820
<font color=#FFFF80>He was like you. Jake.</font>

464
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,192
<font color=#FFFF80>I need to go change for supper.</font>

465
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,094
<font color=#FFFF80>Will you be dining with us?</font>

466
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:38,795
<font color=#FFFF80>I can't stay out late.</font>

467
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,137
<font color=#FFFF80>Suppers at 5:30.</font>

468
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,641
<font color=#FFFF80>Well that's pretty early.</font>

469
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:48,273
<font color=#FFFF80>The fact we are not all eight years of
old's seems to have eluded Ms. Peregrine.</font>

470
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:52,688
<font color=#FFFF80>You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.
His room's in the attic</font>

471
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:04,677
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake.</font>

472
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:07,480
<font color=#FFFF80>Come meet Enoch, properly.</font>

473
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,341
<font color=#FFFF80>Well, you must feel pretty out of place.</font>

474
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:24,344
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't worry. I am used to it.</font>

475
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:27,457
<font color=#FFFF80>I wasn't worried. Some
advice for you though.</font>

476
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:29,359
<font color=#FFFF80>Man to man.</font>

477
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:32,191
<font color=#FFFF80>If you think you're staying
just because you like Emma,</font>

478
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,662
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't bother.</font>

479
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:37,735
<font color=#FFFF80>You see she swore off romance years
ago when she got her heart broken.</font>

480
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,748
<font color=#FFFF80>And she's never gonna
change her mind.</font>

481
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,452
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch, I wasn't...</font>

482
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:49,655
<font color=#FFFF80>What are you doing?</font>

483
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,952
<font color=#FFFF80>Isn't he amazing?</font>

484
00:41:21,322 --> 00:41:22,883
<font color=#FFFF80>What did you do?</font>

485
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:24,655
<font color=#FFFF80>This?</font>

486
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:27,367
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake. This is not even the fun part.</font>

487
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:29,930
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you want to see the fun part?</font>

488
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,281
<font color=#FFFF80>They are like puppets.</font>

489
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,324
<font color=#FFFF80>Just do anything I tell them.</font>

490
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,796
<font color=#FFFF80>It is even more fun with people.</font>

491
00:42:02,526 --> 00:42:04,527
<font color=#FFFF80>You should have seen some of the
epic battles I used to have.</font>

492
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:07,102
<font color=#FFFF80>At my parent's funeral parlour.</font>

493
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:12,516
<font color=#FFFF80>You need a necktie.</font>

494
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:22,764
<font color=#FFFF80>So. What did my grandpa
do when he was traveling?</font>

495
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,136
<font color=#FFFF80>Visited other loops.</font>

496
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:26,907
<font color=#FFFF80>Really?</font>

497
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,639
<font color=#FFFF80>To do what?</font>

498
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,382
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, there are some questions
I can't answer, alright?</font>

499
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:37,726
<font color=#FFFF80>So it will be a lot easier for me
if you just stopped asking them.</font>

500
00:42:56,562 --> 00:42:58,134
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey, what are you doing?</font>

501
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:00,766
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller, go and put
some clothes on.</font>

502
00:43:01,366 --> 00:43:03,608
<font color=#FFFF80>Polite persons do not
take the sup in the nude!</font>

503
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:05,840
<font color=#FFFF80>Alright!</font>

504
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:11,024
<font color=#FFFF80>You can sit here Jake.</font>

505
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:15,499
<font color=#FFFF80>Look at Enoch. He's jealous.</font>

506
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,731
<font color=#FFFF80>Why would I be jealous?</font>

507
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,973
<font color=#FFFF80>All of you can go marry
Jake for all I care.</font>

508
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:22,713
<font color=#FFFF80>Do not be mean, Enoch.
She doesn't want to.</font>

509
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:24,456
<font color=#FFFF80>She's just excited
to have a visitor.</font>

510
00:43:24,877 --> 00:43:26,578
<font color=#FFFF80>Nobody is marrying anybody.</font>

511
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:30,291
<font color=#FFFF80>Now eat up your food
before it gets cold.</font>

512
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,735
<font color=#FFFF80>Hugh.</font>

513
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:37,767
<font color=#FFFF80>Where's your net?</font>

514
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,560
<font color=#FFFF80>It must be very
strange for you Jake.</font>

515
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,032
<font color=#FFFF80>To meet your
grandfather's friends.</font>

516
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:56,974
<font color=#FFFF80>Visiting another century.</font>

517
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:58,975
<font color=#FFFF80>There spaceships in
your time, Jake.</font>

518
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,547
<font color=#FFFF80>Like the Flash Gordon books?</font>

519
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:04,049
<font color=#FFFF80>Now! Now! Olive, what did I
say about the questions.</font>

520
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,921
<font color=#FFFF80>We don't discuss the future here.</font>

521
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:09,294
<font color=#FFFF80>We enjoy living in
the here and now</font>

522
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,697
<font color=#FFFF80>Claire, why aren't you eating?</font>

523
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:15,869
<font color=#FFFF80>She's embarrassed
in front of Jake.</font>

524
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,741
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't be, please.</font>

525
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:37,848
<font color=#FFFF80>So, Jake, what is your peculiarity?</font>

526
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,890
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh, I'm... I'm not peculiar.</font>

527
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:43,823
<font color=#FFFF80>And that my friends is why
he'll not be staying with us.</font>

528
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:46,565
<font color=#FFFF80>No matter how hard we
try to persuade him.</font>

529
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,367
<font color=#FFFF80>We've spoken about this,
Jake is just visiting.</font>

530
00:44:49,738 --> 00:44:52,440
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you not want to stay, Jake?</font>

531
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,141
<font color=#FFFF80>Tonight or...</font>

532
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,483
<font color=#FFFF80>Forever. You should stay forever.</font>

533
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,186
<font color=#FFFF80>Why would he if he doesn't have to?</font>

534
00:44:59,517 --> 00:45:03,029
<font color=#FFFF80>He can live out there. Grow older
and have a good time instead.</font>

535
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,062
<font color=#FFFF80>And leave. Just like his grandfather did.</font>

536
00:45:10,946 --> 00:45:12,077
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma!</font>

537
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,419
<font color=#FFFF80>Excuse me, where she's going?</font>

538
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,120
<font color=#FFFF80>That wasn't nice, Enoch!</font>

539
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,222
<font color=#FFFF80>You know perfectly
well why Abe left us.</font>

540
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,753
<font color=#FFFF80>To join the army.</font>

541
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:22,742
<font color=#FFFF80>And then he met a lady.
And had a nice wedding cake.</font>

542
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,037
<font color=#FFFF80>And a lovely little baby.</font>

543
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:26,298
<font color=#FFFF80>Children!</font>

544
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,411
<font color=#FFFF80>I know you'd all like a new friend.</font>

545
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:32,644
<font color=#FFFF80>But I'm sure Jake has plenty
of his own back in Florida.</font>

546
00:45:36,057 --> 00:45:39,760
<font color=#FFFF80>I think you should all get ready for
movie-time while I answer that.</font>

547
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:43,203
<font color=#FFFF80>But you always let us stay for it.</font>

548
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:03,340
<font color=#FFFF80>Hi. This is Abe.</font>

549
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,242
<font color=#FFFF80>How is everyone?</font>

550
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:13,819
<font color=#FFFF80>Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.</font>

551
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,361
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller, put some pajamas on.</font>

552
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:17,963
<font color=#FFFF80>It is very hot in here.</font>

553
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:20,765
<font color=#FFFF80>Stop moaning. Excuse me.</font>

554
00:46:29,222 --> 00:46:31,153
<font color=#FFFF80>My grandpa told me about this.</font>

555
00:46:31,694 --> 00:46:33,555
<font color=#FFFF80>Horace projects his dreams, right?</font>

556
00:46:33,996 --> 00:46:35,667
<font color=#FFFF80>He used to listen to the radio.</font>

557
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,739
<font color=#FFFF80>Gets tedious when you know
every word off by heart.</font>

558
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:43,914
<font color=#FFFF80>Splendid, I'll take it.</font>

559
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,016
<font color=#FFFF80>It sounds about clothes mostly.</font>

560
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:48,058
<font color=#FFFF80>Delighted to meet you.</font>

561
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:50,860
<font color=#FFFF80>Super shirt by the way.</font>

562
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:55,164
<font color=#FFFF80>When did he dream this?</font>

563
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:56,635
<font color=#FFFF80>Last night.</font>

564
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:58,737
<font color=#FFFF80>Some of his dreams are prophetic.</font>

565
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,749
<font color=#FFFF80>But mostly they are about clothes.</font>

566
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:05,682
<font color=#FFFF80>Prophetic as in, he can
see into the future?</font>

567
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:23,348
<font color=#FFFF80>The Ymbryne. Who is she?
Mrs. Peregrine, you know her?</font>

568
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:26,891
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't be silly. Horace was just
having a bad dream. Thats all.</font>

569
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,822
<font color=#FFFF80>Thats quite enough.
Thank you Horace.</font>

570
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:06,234
<font color=#FFFF80>I think probably get going.</font>

571
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:10,837
<font color=#FFFF80>You could stay the night. If you wanted to.
Rather than walk home in the dark.</font>

572
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:14,040
<font color=#FFFF80>But the island is very safe, isn't it?</font>

573
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,711
<font color=#FFFF80>Of course</font>

574
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:18,602
<font color=#FFFF80>I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.
Jake could trip.</font>

575
00:48:19,054 --> 00:48:21,965
<font color=#FFFF80>Perhaps you could show
him the shortcuts?</font>

576
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:24,679
<font color=#FFFF80>Should he ever need to avoid...
bumps.</font>

577
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:28,742
<font color=#FFFF80>Wont you stay to see the restart.
It is really quite spectacular.</font>

578
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,471
<font color=#FFFF80>What was that?</font>

579
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:15,483
<font color=#FFFF80>It was my phone.</font>

580
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,465
<font color=#FFFF80>It's been dead the whole time
in the loop I guess now...</font>

581
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:20,357
<font color=#FFFF80>Your phone?</font>

582
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:25,431
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah, I don't like it, a telephone?
You can call people...</font>

583
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:29,275
<font color=#FFFF80>And send written messages.</font>

584
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:31,996
<font color=#FFFF80>Right. You'll love this.
You can take a picture.</font>

585
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:34,419
<font color=#FFFF80>Press that... there... yeah.</font>

586
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,781
<font color=#FFFF80>See?</font>

587
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:45,738
<font color=#FFFF80>Whats wrong?</font>

588
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:53,415
<font color=#FFFF80>Its just funny to think that one
day you'll grow up like Abe did.</font>

589
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:55,987
<font color=#FFFF80>Get married... have children.</font>

590
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,089
<font color=#FFFF80>Grandchildren.</font>

591
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:01,531
<font color=#FFFF80>You might even show
them this photograph.</font>

592
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:04,605
<font color=#FFFF80>And I'll still be here.</font>

593
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,337
<font color=#FFFF80>Wha... can you leave some day?</font>

594
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,109
<font color=#FFFF80>And live in the present
if you wanted to?</font>

595
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:16,054
<font color=#FFFF80>No. More than a few minutes in your
time and the years would catch up.</font>

596
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:18,766
<font color=#FFFF80>You'd age?</font>

597
00:52:19,297 --> 00:52:20,568
<font color=#FFFF80>Would... you're...</font>

598
00:52:26,473 --> 00:52:28,714
<font color=#FFFF80>I think it is the Ymbryne
from Horace's dream.</font>

599
00:52:29,385 --> 00:52:31,787
<font color=#FFFF80>Are you sure it's not just a bird?</font>

600
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:33,937
<font color=#FFFF80>I mean, I don't know...
wouldn't it change?</font>

601
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:36,931
<font color=#FFFF80>She can't. Not if she's hurt.</font>

602
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:40,735
<font color=#FFFF80>I need to take her inside.
You should go.</font>

603
00:52:42,837 --> 00:52:46,380
<font color=#FFFF80>Please do not say anything else.
I hate goodbyes</font>

604
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:51,084
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll come back tomorrow.</font>

605
00:52:51,394 --> 00:52:55,067
<font color=#FFFF80>There's no hurry.
I'll be here forever.</font>

606
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:03,374
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey.</font>

607
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:07,517
<font color=#FFFF80>Have I been all this damn
island Where the hell were you?</font>

608
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,989
<font color=#FFFF80>I was just on my way back.</font>

609
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,391
<font color=#FFFF80>Sorry, I lost track of time.</font>

610
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:14,264
<font color=#FFFF80>I was having a blast with Worm...</font>

611
00:53:14,804 --> 00:53:16,005
<font color=#FFFF80>and Dirty D?</font>

612
00:53:16,305 --> 00:53:18,037
<font color=#FFFF80>Dirty D?</font>

613
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,939
<font color=#FFFF80>You know what? This is...
this is good.</font>

614
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:24,482
<font color=#FFFF80>This is healthy. This is
you're making real friends.</font>

615
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:27,224
<font color=#FFFF80>Doing teenage stuff.</font>

616
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:30,034
<font color=#FFFF80>I think this is normal. I am sure
that Dr. Golan will approve.</font>

617
00:53:30,056 --> 00:53:31,368
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey, you American.</font>

618
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:33,429
<font color=#FFFF80>Get over here.</font>

619
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:39,014
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey look here there they are,
there's D-bag and worm-man.</font>

620
00:53:39,374 --> 00:53:41,045
<font color=#FFFF80>Did you do this?</font>

621
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:44,118
<font color=#FFFF80>What? No!</font>

622
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:46,059
<font color=#FFFF80>Of course not.</font>

623
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,892
<font color=#FFFF80>It wasn't us.</font>

624
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:51,292
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen Sir, I don't know what happened
here but my son and his friends.</font>

625
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:54,908
<font color=#FFFF80>Have been together all day. And Jake
would never do anything like this.</font>

626
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,009
<font color=#FFFF80>Bollocks! We haven't seen him!</font>

627
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,813
<font color=#FFFF80>You paid us yesterday. Why would we
hang out with him today for free?</font>

628
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:05,556
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake were you with them or not?</font>

629
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:09,630
<font color=#FFFF80>No! I'm sorry!</font>

630
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,243
<font color=#FFFF80>And you don't seriously
think I could do this?</font>

631
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:16,245
<font color=#FFFF80>I think we're done here, sir.</font>

632
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:18,817
<font color=#FFFF80>Well, can pass on a message for me?</font>

633
00:54:19,288 --> 00:54:23,292
<font color=#FFFF80>Can you tell Dr. Golan that if she
hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip</font>

634
00:54:23,592 --> 00:54:26,798
<font color=#FFFF80>maybe my son wouldn't be mopping
around all day in a derelict house</font>

635
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:28,417
<font color=#FFFF80>HAVING A GODDAMN BREAKDOWN!</font>

636
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:30,538
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello?</font>

637
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:32,910
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad, I'm not.</font>

638
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,341
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm fine.</font>

639
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:36,513
<font color=#FFFF80>You're not.</font>

640
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:39,385
<font color=#FFFF80>You are not fine. Jake.</font>

641
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,158
<font color=#FFFF80>Coming here was a terrible...
terrible idea.</font>

642
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:45,070
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm sorry, I lied...</font>

643
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,242
<font color=#FFFF80>Set your alarm for 8:00 am.</font>

644
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,504
<font color=#FFFF80>I want to get to the beach early.</font>

645
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:54,918
<font color=#FFFF80>The rest of the time left on this
crap-O-island, we're sticking together.</font>

646
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:57,049
<font color=#FFFF80>Where are you going?</font>

647
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,462
<font color=#FFFF80>Downstairs for a drink.</font>

648
00:55:47,813 --> 00:55:50,955
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Dearest Peregrine:
I don't wish to alarm you...</i></font>

649
00:55:51,356 --> 00:55:54,258
<font color=#FFFF80><i>but one of my informants sent me this.</i></font>

650
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,472
<font color=#FFFF80><i>It would appear that some of Mr. Barron's
group were in Black Pool, England.</i></font>

651
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:04,476
<font color=#FFFF80><i>"If I recall, Ms. Avocet has a loop there."</i></font>

652
00:56:05,017 --> 00:56:08,891
<font color=#FFFF80><i>"Please warn her and suggest that
she make a new one right away."</i></font>

653
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:10,452
<font color=#FFFF80><i>"Well hidden."</i></font>

654
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:17,868
<font color=#FFFF80><i>And take the greatest care yourself.
With Love, Abe. January 2016.</i></font>

655
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:38,605
<font color=#FFFF80>Who is ready to hit the beach?</font>

656
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:45,922
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh my goodness.</font>

657
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:47,994
<font color=#FFFF80>Unbelievable!</font>

658
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,826
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm right in the middle
of a nesting are?</font>

659
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:53,398
<font color=#FFFF80>What kind of idiot does that?</font>

660
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:57,872
<font color=#FFFF80>Actually, the main nesting
area is over there.</font>

661
00:56:58,342 --> 00:56:59,743
<font color=#FFFF80>I can show you, if you like.</font>

662
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,325
<font color=#FFFF80>It's marvelous to meet
a fellow bird-spotter!</font>

663
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,117
<font color=#FFFF80>John Lamont. Franklyn Portman.</font>

664
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:05,788
<font color=#FFFF80>This is my son, Jake.</font>

665
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:07,660
<font color=#FFFF80>John Newmont.</font>

666
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,831
<font color=#FFFF80>That's a hell of a camera you got there.</font>

667
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:12,504
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh, thank you, is absolutely fantastic.</font>

668
00:57:12,974 --> 00:57:15,416
<font color=#FFFF80>I am here to do some snaps
for a book I'm writing.</font>

669
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,350
<font color=#FFFF80>So, you gentlemen are
here on holiday?</font>

670
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,570
<font color=#FFFF80>So, you are not coming
to the beach today?</font>

671
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,171
<font color=#FFFF80>What's the point?</font>

672
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:36,716
<font color=#FFFF80>That guys gonna cover ******
on some big glossy book,</font>

673
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,666
<font color=#FFFF80>no ones even wanna look at mine.</font>

674
00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:42,459
<font color=#FFFF80>I might just have a nice afternoon nap.</font>

675
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,912
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't suppose you saw uncle Oggie
on you travels this morning, did you?</font>

676
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,934
<font color=#FFFF80>He's usually here by now.</font>

677
00:57:48,274 --> 00:57:49,575
<font color=#FFFF80>I could go look for him.</font>

678
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,007
<font color=#FFFF80>You're not going anywhere</font>

679
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:30,410
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, you're back! Come and play!</font>

680
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:35,925
<font color=#FFFF80>I need to see to Ms. Peregrine first.</font>

681
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:38,166
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you know where she is?</font>

682
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:45,372
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, you're back.
How wonderful!</font>

683
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,474
<font color=#FFFF80>How's it doing?</font>

684
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:49,746
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma said it was an Ymbryne.</font>

685
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:53,259
<font color=#FFFF80>She, not 'it'. Ymbrynes
are always female.</font>

686
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:56,331
<font color=#FFFF80>And Emma was quite correct.
This is Ms. Avocet.</font>

687
00:58:56,762 --> 00:58:59,864
<font color=#FFFF80>Her loop is in Black Pool England.</font>

688
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:04,408
<font color=#FFFF80>That was a private letter, Jake.</font>

689
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:09,583
<font color=#FFFF80>Who is Mr Barron?</font>

690
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:14,657
<font color=#FFFF80>Ms. Peregrine, if my grandpa was
involved with dangerous people</font>

691
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:17,369
<font color=#FFFF80>I need to tell the police.</font>

692
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,501
<font color=#FFFF80>To the police?</font>

693
00:59:20,002 --> 00:59:22,844
<font color=#FFFF80>Are you implying Abe
died an unnatural death?</font>

694
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:26,147
<font color=#FFFF80>I found him in the woods
with eyes missing.</font>

695
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:30,090
<font color=#FFFF80>I'd say that was pretty unnatural.</font>

696
00:59:33,492 --> 00:59:36,665
<font color=#FFFF80>Unless essential. I don't
discuss unpleasant matters.</font>

697
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:39,908
<font color=#FFFF80>An Ymbryne's is a duty to
protect children, Jake.</font>

698
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:42,581
<font color=#FFFF80>I am not a child.</font>

699
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:45,954
<font color=#FFFF80>He wanted you to tell me everything.</font>

700
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,869
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh. How frustrating for you.</font>

701
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,873
<font color=#FFFF80>Between Ms. Peregrine rules and
my ******* not to scare you off.</font>

702
00:59:57,373 --> 00:59:59,475
<font color=#FFFF80>It's like no ones telling you anything?!</font>

703
01:00:00,045 --> 01:00:02,217
<font color=#FFFF80>So why don't you then?</font>

704
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:04,389
<font color=#FFFF80>It's not like you want me here.</font>

705
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:05,820
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch, you can't.</font>

706
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,661
<font color=#FFFF80>You promised.</font>

707
01:00:07,992 --> 01:00:09,433
<font color=#FFFF80>Olive is right.</font>

708
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,806
<font color=#FFFF80>However, I know someone
who can break the rules.</font>

709
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:15,509
<font color=#FFFF80>Want to meet him?</font>

710
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:18,311
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch, do not do this! Please.</font>

711
01:00:18,851 --> 01:00:22,284
<font color=#FFFF80>You didn't want us to spend time together.
That's what you said.</font>

712
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:26,598
<font color=#FFFF80>Well, here we all are.</font>

713
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:28,870
<font color=#FFFF80>Move, Olive.</font>

714
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,943
<font color=#FFFF80>If you're going to be like then I
do not want to be your friend.</font>

715
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:39,318
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch! Leave Victor alone.
It really upsets Bromwyn.</font>

716
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:42,921
<font color=#FFFF80>Stop fussing, Fiona. Don't you
think Jake should meet everybody?</font>

717
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:44,839
<font color=#FFFF80>He's trying to frighten
you away, Jake.</font>

718
01:00:44,863 --> 01:00:47,265
<font color=#FFFF80>He was always jealous of Abe
and now he's jealous of you.</font>

719
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,207
<font color=#FFFF80>Come and play with us instead</font>

720
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:56,653
<font color=#FFFF80>I'd quite like to meet Victor.</font>

721
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,299
<font color=#FFFF80>After You.</font>

722
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,077
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello Victor.</font>

723
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:18,491
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...</font>

724
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:23,035
<font color=#FFFF80>He can't hear you.</font>

725
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:52,790
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello Jake, I'm Victor. Do you
want to know what killed me?</font>

726
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:01,613
<font color=#FFFF80>Ah, there you are.
Is he not with you?</font>

727
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,420
<font color=#FFFF80>Its time for our daily walk.</font>

728
01:02:06,312 --> 01:02:10,684
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma, Who killed Victor? Was it
the people with the white eyes?</font>

729
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:14,789
<font color=#FFFF80>I asked you not to ask questions.
I saw one the night my grandpa died.</font>

730
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,093
<font color=#FFFF80>If it really was one, you
have to tell Ms. Peregrinee.</font>

731
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,705
<font color=#FFFF80>Could you recognize you recognize
him from a photograph?</font>

732
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:24,909
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you have one?</font>

733
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,308
<font color=#FFFF80>Then come on.
There's somewhere I go to be alone.</font>

734
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,741
<font color=#FFFF80>I have things there.</font>

735
01:03:07,293 --> 01:03:10,725
<font color=#FFFF80>- Is this the place?
- No. This is how we get there.</font>

736
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,005
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma! Your shoes! Lead shoes!</font>

737
01:05:35,899 --> 01:05:41,003
<font color=#FFFF80>- Welcome to my secret hideout.
- How? How did you...</font>

738
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:47,388
<font color=#FFFF80>Air. My peculiarity.
It does what I want</font>

739
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:11,969
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake. Before your grandfather retired,
he asked me to keep this safe.</font>

740
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:33,567
<font color=#FFFF80>This is my grandpa's old map.
It shows you where the loops are.</font>

741
01:06:43,986 --> 01:06:48,123
<font color=#FFFF80>That's him, thats the man I saw.
Who is he?</font>

742
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:51,142
<font color=#FFFF80>Thats Barron. He is the Leader.</font>

743
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:56,596
<font color=#FFFF80>Leader of what?
Who are these people?</font>

744
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:59,729
<font color=#FFFF80>Bad people... bad peculiars.</font>

745
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,645
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down.</font>

746
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:05,744
<font color=#FFFF80>These are the ones
he never found.</font>

747
01:07:06,494 --> 01:07:09,107
<font color=#FFFF80>What do you mean "hunting"?</font>

748
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:16,826
<font color=#FFFF80>They raided homes. Whole homes
full of children left for dead.</font>

749
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:18,384
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe took lives...</font>

750
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:19,435
<font color=#FFFF80>To save life's.</font>

751
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:22,739
<font color=#FFFF80>He only retired when you
were born to protect you.</font>

752
01:07:23,229 --> 01:07:24,829
<font color=#FFFF80>From what?</font>

753
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,439
<font color=#FFFF80>If I tell you the rest, you have
to promise not to run away.</font>

754
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,337
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, you belong here.</font>

755
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:39,844
<font color=#FFFF80>You know that I don't.
I'm not like you.</font>

756
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,927
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm just ordinary.</font>

757
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,413
<font color=#FFFF80>No, but you're not.</font>

758
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:47,479
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, only a peculiar can
enter a time loop.</font>

759
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:52,344
<font color=#FFFF80>No, that can't be right.</font>

760
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:54,432
<font color=#FFFF80>I mean... I would know.</font>

761
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:55,501
<font color=#FFFF80>Fine.</font>

762
01:07:56,412 --> 01:07:59,442
<font color=#FFFF80>Then I'll show you
something else.</font>

763
01:08:07,246 --> 01:08:08,577
<font color=#FFFF80>Hurry! You'll miss it.</font>

764
01:08:22,168 --> 01:08:24,868
<font color=#FFFF80>Ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect date to create a loop.</font>

765
01:08:24,879 --> 01:08:28,094
<font color=#FFFF80>But Ms. Peregrinee...
had to make this one in a rush.</font>

766
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,254
<font color=#FFFF80>Why?</font>

767
01:08:30,256 --> 01:08:33,703
<font color=#FFFF80>Because the Germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house.</font>

768
01:08:33,714 --> 01:08:36,059
<font color=#FFFF80>The point is, September
the 3rd, 1943...</font>

769
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,545
<font color=#FFFF80>wasn't perfect.</font>

770
01:08:37,556 --> 01:08:41,515
<font color=#FFFF80>The thing that killed
Victor came back.</font>

771
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:11,160
<font color=#FFFF80>- Wait, watch out!
- Shhh, all bets are off.</font>

772
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:41,553
<font color=#FFFF80>You can see it, can't you?</font>

773
01:09:41,564 --> 01:09:42,835
<font color=#FFFF80>No one else can.</font>

774
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:47,534
<font color=#FFFF80>Its invisible, Jake. That was
Abe's greatest gift of all.</font>

775
01:09:50,863 --> 01:09:53,275
<font color=#FFFF80>He could see the monsters.</font>

776
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,191
<font color=#FFFF80>We call them 'Hollowgasts'.
Hollows. For short.</font>

777
01:10:02,193 --> 01:10:06,399
<font color=#FFFF80>My grandpa told me about people,
who turn into monsters.</font>

778
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,096
<font color=#FFFF80>Is that what they are?</font>

779
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:09,835
<font color=#FFFF80>I will explain everything, Jake.</font>

780
01:10:09,846 --> 01:10:11,904
<font color=#FFFF80>I fear its my duty
now considering...</font>

781
01:10:11,915 --> 01:10:14,071
<font color=#FFFF80>but you should know
that in doing so...</font>

782
01:10:14,072 --> 01:10:16,208
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm breaking a solemn promise.</font>

783
01:10:16,219 --> 01:10:19,390
<font color=#FFFF80>I knew you were peculiar
when you were born</font>

784
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:21,119
<font color=#FFFF80>but your grandfather...</font>

785
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:22,859
<font color=#FFFF80>forbid me to tell you anything.</font>

786
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:26,262
<font color=#FFFF80>His dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood.</font>

787
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,088
<font color=#FFFF80>Well I definitely had that.</font>

788
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:31,806
<font color=#FFFF80>He intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18.</font>

789
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:37,198
<font color=#FFFF80>He hoped his bed-time
stories would pave the way.</font>

790
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:38,933
<font color=#FFFF80>Here's my book.</font>

791
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:52,710
<font color=#FFFF80>Many years ago,</font>

792
01:10:52,721 --> 01:10:56,320
<font color=#FFFF80>a splinter faction emerged
among our people.</font>

793
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,219
<font color=#FFFF80>Disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops.</font>

794
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,572
<font color=#FFFF80>That's Mr. Barron.</font>

795
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:05,801
<font color=#FFFF80>He believed that by harnessing the
essence of an Ymbryne's powers,</font>

796
01:11:05,812 --> 01:11:06,976
<font color=#FFFF80>he and his cronies.</font>

797
01:11:06,977 --> 01:11:11,745
<font color=#FFFF80>Could gain immortality and be
able to live outside loops.</font>

798
01:11:11,756 --> 01:11:13,893
<font color=#FFFF80>He devised an experiment.</font>

799
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:17,952
<font color=#FFFF80>He kidnapped an Ymbryne</font>

800
01:11:17,963 --> 01:11:21,910
<font color=#FFFF80>not knowing or caring whether she
would survive the experiment.</font>

801
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:47,411
<font color=#FFFF80>But the fate of Barron and his
group was more horrifying still.</font>

802
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,484
<font color=#FFFF80>Why didn't Barron turn into one?</font>

803
01:12:39,316 --> 01:12:46,421
<font color=#FFFF80>He did. But years later he found a way to
reverse the effects... to regain humanity.</font>

804
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:50,752
<font color=#FFFF80>They had become not immortal
gods - but Hollows.</font>

805
01:12:50,765 --> 01:12:54,768
<font color=#FFFF80>Invisible beasts, dangerous,
cold-blooded, deadly!</font>

806
01:12:55,078 --> 01:12:59,412
<font color=#FFFF80>Remember I told you they raided loops?
This is why.</font>

807
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:03,688
<font color=#FFFF80>Barron discovered that by consuming
the eyes of other peculiars...</font>

808
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:05,308
<font color=#FFFF80>especially children,</font>

809
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:15,476
<font color=#FFFF80>He began to change.</font>

810
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:36,713
<font color=#FFFF80>Consume enough, and a hollow can
fully regain its human form.</font>

811
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:41,287
<font color=#FFFF80>Just as Barron and some
of his friends did.</font>

812
01:13:50,445 --> 01:13:53,823
<font color=#FFFF80>The rest of them are
stuck as Hollows.</font>

813
01:13:53,834 --> 01:13:57,720
<font color=#FFFF80>Are you saying that
Barron ate my uncle's...</font>

814
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:59,958
<font color=#FFFF80>He needs no more eyes himself,</font>

815
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:03,846
<font color=#FFFF80>but I fear he led a Hollow
to your grandfather, yes.</font>

816
01:14:05,638 --> 01:14:07,673
<font color=#FFFF80>After the first
attacks on Loops,</font>

817
01:14:07,684 --> 01:14:11,443
<font color=#FFFF80>we all got better at hiding
...making new loops... keeping our.</font>

818
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:12,594
<font color=#FFFF80>Whereabouts secret.</font>

819
01:14:12,605 --> 01:14:15,692
<font color=#FFFF80>The Hollows grew more
desperate every year</font>

820
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:18,556
<font color=#FFFF80>and Barron wishes to
help his friends.</font>

821
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:22,702
<font color=#FFFF80>Miss Peregrine! Come quickly!
Miss Avocet's awake.</font>

822
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:31,873
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh Miss Peregrine! They
found my new loop.</font>

823
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,762
<font color=#FFFF80>The children... I tried to save them
but there were so many Hollows...</font>

824
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:42,569
<font color=#FFFF80>- I don't know how I escaped.
- You are safe now.</font>

825
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,062
<font color=#FFFF80>None of us are safe.</font>

826
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:46,452
<font color=#FFFF80>They set up the
machine in my loop.</font>

827
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:48,907
<font color=#FFFF80>They put in in the cellar
at Blackboat tower.</font>

828
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:50,915
<font color=#FFFF80>- They're still there...
- The machine?</font>

829
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:54,152
<font color=#FFFF80>The experiment.
They intend to do it again!</font>

830
01:14:54,163 --> 01:14:56,800
<font color=#FFFF80>This time, he's using
more Ymbrynes.</font>

831
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:59,173
<font color=#FFFF80>He still wants to be immortal.</font>

832
01:15:02,446 --> 01:15:04,811
<font color=#FFFF80>Do Hollows only
attack peculiars?</font>

833
01:15:04,822 --> 01:15:07,535
<font color=#FFFF80>Of course not! They're
monsters, Jake,</font>

834
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:10,466
<font color=#FFFF80>they'll slaughter
anything in their path.</font>

835
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:13,387
<font color=#FFFF80>Well, some sheep on the
island were killed,</font>

836
01:15:13,398 --> 01:15:16,047
<font color=#FFFF80>You don't think they're
here already, do you?</font>

837
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:20,167
<font color=#FFFF80>Have you seen anyone
with white eyes?</font>

838
01:15:22,078 --> 01:15:24,877
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm sorry children,
we can't remain here.</font>

839
01:15:25,015 --> 01:15:26,015
<font color=#FFFF80>What?</font>

840
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:28,517
<font color=#FFFF80>We leave on the first ferry,
off the island tomorrow.</font>

841
01:15:28,527 --> 01:15:29,932
<font color=#FFFF80>Pack anything of importance.</font>

842
01:15:29,943 --> 01:15:32,091
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll make sandwiches
and lead you to bed.</font>

843
01:15:32,101 --> 01:15:34,802
<font color=#FFFF80>Are we leaving for good?
When are we coming back?</font>

844
01:15:34,804 --> 01:15:37,635
<font color=#FFFF80>Never. If Ms. Peregrine's not here
to reset the loop tomorrow night...</font>

845
01:15:37,636 --> 01:15:40,547
<font color=#FFFF80>- the house gets bombed.
- What? Our house?</font>

846
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:43,669
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't cry, Miss Peregrine will find you
another lovely house... somewhere else.</font>

847
01:15:51,567 --> 01:15:55,600
<font color=#FFFF80>Once this loop closes, that's it!
I can't get back to my own time.</font>

848
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:58,212
<font color=#FFFF80>You didn't seem
very happy there.</font>

849
01:15:58,223 --> 01:16:01,044
<font color=#FFFF80>I can't just leave!
I have a family.</font>

850
01:16:01,045 --> 01:16:05,087
<font color=#FFFF80>And you felt ordinary. Like
nothing you do changes anything.</font>

851
01:16:05,088 --> 01:16:09,052
<font color=#FFFF80>And, now you have a chance to do
something that changes everything.</font>

852
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:11,063
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, were in danger...</font>

853
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:14,503
<font color=#FFFF80>and you're the only one
who can see the Hollows.</font>

854
01:16:14,514 --> 01:16:17,811
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah, I see them sure
but, I'm not my grandpa.</font>

855
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:19,084
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm not and I...I</font>

856
01:16:19,821 --> 01:16:22,223
<font color=#FFFF80>can't fight, I can't kill somebody...</font>

857
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:29,960
<font color=#FFFF80>There's only one reason
that I'd stay here.</font>

858
01:16:29,971 --> 01:16:31,781
<font color=#FFFF80>Please!... just go.</font>

859
01:17:00,695 --> 01:17:03,813
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake... Jake, here you are!
Thank God!</font>

860
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:07,181
<font color=#FFFF80>When I heard they found
a body, I freaked.</font>

861
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:35,685
<font color=#FFFF80>- Are there stray dogs around here?
- What are you talking about?</font>

862
01:17:35,695 --> 01:17:37,022
<font color=#FFFF80>Its like,</font>

863
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:42,330
<font color=#FFFF80>when they find an injured animal,
they go for the soft parts first.</font>

864
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,311
<font color=#FFFF80>Same thing happened
to my father.</font>

865
01:17:45,322 --> 01:17:47,855
<font color=#FFFF80>The police are on their way.</font>

866
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:50,516
<font color=#FFFF80>Dad, I gotta go?</font>

867
01:17:50,527 --> 01:17:52,097
<font color=#FFFF80>No... you don't Jake.</font>

868
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:54,490
<font color=#FFFF80>If this wasn't an accident...</font>

869
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:56,556
<font color=#FFFF80>there's a lunatic on the island.</font>

870
01:17:56,567 --> 01:18:01,266
<font color=#FFFF80>I've known everyone on this island,
my whole life except you and him...</font>

871
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,378
<font color=#FFFF80>And he's been in the
pub all afternoon.</font>

872
01:18:03,389 --> 01:18:04,909
<font color=#FFFF80>So have I... I was sleeping.</font>

873
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,170
<font color=#FFFF80>What about the blind fellow?
I mean...</font>

874
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:10,559
<font color=#FFFF80>I assumed he was blind.
The gentleman with the dark glasses.</font>

875
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:12,386
<font color=#FFFF80>Arrived on the same ferry as me.</font>

876
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:19,802
<font color=#FFFF80>- I kept seeing him around.
- Jake! Jake!</font>

877
01:18:26,848 --> 01:18:32,894
<font color=#FFFF80>- Is your son alright?
- No, he has mental health issues.</font>

878
01:18:33,434 --> 01:18:36,837
<font color=#FFFF80>- I can't...
- Let me, I run 5 K's all the time.</font>

879
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,629
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello!</font>

880
01:18:56,102 --> 01:18:59,631
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello! Is that you, young man?</font>

881
01:18:59,642 --> 01:19:04,113
<font color=#FFFF80>You came through?...
You're a peculiar?</font>

882
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:09,741
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh yes, and I'm extremely
grateful to you.</font>

883
01:19:09,752 --> 01:19:13,971
<font color=#FFFF80>It's terribly hard... to
find loops these days.</font>

884
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:18,853
<font color=#FFFF80>So you followed me from
the beach on purpose?</font>

885
01:19:18,864 --> 01:19:23,219
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh no. I've been following
you much further than that!</font>

886
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,933
<font color=#FFFF80>Dr. Golan?!</font>

887
01:19:29,944 --> 01:19:35,144
<font color=#FFFF80>Sometimes when it suits me...
the breadth of</font>

888
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:40,910
<font color=#FFFF80>my peculiarity is purely
limited by my imagination...</font>

889
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:43,361
<font color=#FFFF80>The only thing I can't change...</font>

890
01:19:45,672 --> 01:19:48,166
<font color=#FFFF80>is my eyes.</font>

891
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:56,749
<font color=#FFFF80>Mr. Barron, How do you do?</font>

892
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:04,822
<font color=#FFFF80>I saw you, at your grandfather's.
I was hoping to get.</font>

893
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:08,775
<font color=#FFFF80>Ms. Peregrine's address
from him, but alas...</font>

894
01:20:08,786 --> 01:20:12,911
<font color=#FFFF80>my traveling companion got
to him before I did...</font>

895
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:18,741
<font color=#FFFF80>and as you know, there's no
stopping a hungry Hollowgasts.</font>

896
01:20:18,752 --> 01:20:24,429
<font color=#FFFF80>Speaking of my traveling companion...
he's coming.</font>

897
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:27,765
<font color=#FFFF80>And believe me when I say to you</font>

898
01:20:27,776 --> 01:20:32,857
<font color=#FFFF80>you don't want to be here.
When he arrives.</font>

899
01:20:32,868 --> 01:20:39,958
<font color=#FFFF80>So, lets be on your way...
shall we?</font>

900
01:20:56,995 --> 01:20:58,262
<font color=#FFFF80>I mustn't forget our calendar.</font>

901
01:20:58,273 --> 01:21:00,678
<font color=#FFFF80>Could you fetch it from the
parlor please, Miss Avocet?</font>

902
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:06,182
<font color=#FFFF80>Go and help the others.</font>

903
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:24,807
<font color=#FFFF80>Miss. Peregrinee what a
pleasure to meet you, at last!</font>

904
01:21:24,818 --> 01:21:26,330
<font color=#FFFF80>May we come in?</font>

905
01:21:33,065 --> 01:21:37,162
<font color=#FFFF80>Children, would you make your
way down the stairs please?</font>

906
01:21:37,173 --> 01:21:40,270
<font color=#FFFF80>I give the orders in
this house, Mr. Baron!</font>

907
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,534
<font color=#FFFF80>Not today.</font>

908
01:21:41,545 --> 01:21:45,045
<font color=#FFFF80>You should know that Jake
has served his purpose.</font>

909
01:21:45,056 --> 01:21:46,585
<font color=#FFFF80>If you value his life</font>

910
01:21:46,586 --> 01:21:50,790
<font color=#FFFF80>I suggest everyone does as
they are told! Children!</font>

911
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:56,760
<font color=#FFFF80>Shush! No one tells my
children what to do.</font>

912
01:21:56,771 --> 01:21:59,718
<font color=#FFFF80>Children come down here, please.</font>

913
01:22:03,821 --> 01:22:06,594
<font color=#FFFF80>Ms. Peregrine...
I thought I told you to be quiet!</font>

914
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:15,511
<font color=#FFFF80>Children, for jake's safety, we are
going to do what Mr. Barron asks.</font>

915
01:22:15,512 --> 01:22:18,410
<font color=#FFFF80>He wishes to take me with him
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.</font>

916
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:22,017
<font color=#FFFF80>So for his protection, he would
like me to assume bird-form,</font>

917
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:23,977
<font color=#FFFF80>preferably caged...</font>

918
01:22:24,058 --> 01:22:27,538
<font color=#FFFF80>And he'd like you to make your way into
a lockable room, such as the parlor.</font>

919
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:28,588
<font color=#FFFF80>As he wont release Jake</font>

920
01:22:28,599 --> 01:22:32,078
<font color=#FFFF80>if he fears an attack could be mounted
upon him once he loses his leverage.</font>

921
01:22:33,335 --> 01:22:35,124
<font color=#FFFF80>Correct, Mr. Barron?</font>

922
01:22:35,135 --> 01:22:40,221
<font color=#FFFF80>You are sacrificing yourself
and all of us... for Jake?</font>

923
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:43,598
<font color=#FFFF80>Mr. Barron travels
with a Hollow, Enoch.</font>

924
01:22:43,609 --> 01:22:46,737
<font color=#FFFF80>Once it arrives here,
we're all dead.</font>

925
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:50,398
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch, only Jake can see them.</font>

926
01:22:50,409 --> 01:22:53,022
<font color=#FFFF80>She means he's our only hope.</font>

927
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:42,697
<font color=#FFFF80>It's been my privilege,
to care for you all.</font>

928
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,337
<font color=#FFFF80>Goodbye! My children.</font>

929
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:57,397
<font color=#FFFF80>Now, let him go.</font>

930
01:24:19,665 --> 01:24:23,526
<font color=#FFFF80>Promise me one thing, Jake.</font>

931
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:29,760
<font color=#FFFF80>That you will try to
look after them all.</font>

932
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:31,696
<font color=#FFFF80>I Promise.</font>

933
01:25:09,057 --> 01:25:12,002
<font color=#FFFF80>Its getting dark. You won't even
be able to see their shadows.</font>

934
01:25:12,013 --> 01:25:14,901
<font color=#FFFF80>We have to stay inside. Its the
only place we stand a chance.</font>

935
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,278
<font color=#FFFF80>He's quite right.</font>

936
01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:20,256
<font color=#FFFF80>Now where does Miss.
Peregrine keep her weapon?</font>

937
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:22,180
<font color=#FFFF80>Now... all right children.</font>

938
01:25:22,191 --> 01:25:25,139
<font color=#FFFF80>Make sure all the doors are locked
and the windows are latched.</font>

939
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:28,113
<font color=#FFFF80>Everything must be sealed up tight.
Now quickly, quickly go.</font>

940
01:25:43,927 --> 01:25:47,760
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, I think tonight
you better answer that.</font>

941
01:25:52,804 --> 01:25:56,717
<font color=#FFFF80>Hello?</font>

942
01:25:59,349 --> 01:26:02,436
<font color=#FFFF80>You... you don't know me.
I'm Jake.</font>

943
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:06,895
<font color=#FFFF80>Ah! You're new. Well,
welcome to the family Jake.</font>

944
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:08,274
<font color=#FFFF80>Now I can't talk long,</font>

945
01:26:08,285 --> 01:26:12,481
<font color=#FFFF80>so just tell Miss Peregrine that
I'm at the airbase, and I'm fine.</font>

946
01:26:14,943 --> 01:26:18,523
<font color=#FFFF80>I just wanted to say
that, I miss you</font>

947
01:26:18,534 --> 01:26:22,397
<font color=#FFFF80>and if I disappointed
you, I'm sorry...</font>

948
01:26:22,408 --> 01:26:26,269
<font color=#FFFF80>and you're the best
grandpa in the world.</font>

949
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:53,015
<font color=#FFFF80>- Fiona!
- Got it!</font>

950
01:26:54,016 --> 01:26:59,390
<font color=#FFFF80>Miss. Avocet! Now children, now that
you are all here, there's a few rules.</font>

951
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,271
<font color=#FFFF80>Your primary job is to stay safe.
Leave the Hollow to me.</font>

952
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:05,474
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't want to see any heroics.</font>

953
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:10,349
<font color=#FFFF80>Now, those of you with garden tools,
I must insist that you...</font>

954
01:27:33,629 --> 01:27:35,160
<font color=#FFFF80>No Enoch! Get back!</font>

955
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:03,244
<font color=#FFFF80>Go! Get to the attic.</font>

956
01:28:06,357 --> 01:28:07,418
<font color=#FFFF80>Take her!</font>

957
01:28:21,749 --> 01:28:25,252
<font color=#FFFF80>Go! Go! Get out! All Come on.</font>

958
01:28:42,287 --> 01:28:46,060
<font color=#FFFF80>Alright... crap! Its almost reset.</font>

959
01:28:50,303 --> 01:28:53,506
<font color=#FFFF80>Fiona, is there anything you can do
with that tree?</font>

960
01:28:53,606 --> 01:28:54,637
<font color=#FFFF80>Be careful!</font>

961
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,552
<font color=#FFFF80>We're going through the windows.
Lets go!</font>

962
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,264
<font color=#FFFF80>Come on!</font>

963
01:29:36,652 --> 01:29:38,024
<font color=#FFFF80>Claire! Come on down.</font>

964
01:30:11,952 --> 01:30:13,324
<font color=#FFFF80>Go Fiona!</font>

965
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,171
<font color=#FFFF80>Let's move on!</font>

966
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:50,686
<font color=#FFFF80>- What was that?
- The loop closing. It is gone.</font>

967
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:15,190
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm sorry Jake?
What do we do now?</font>

968
01:31:15,201 --> 01:31:18,137
<font color=#FFFF80>Is there any sign of Barron...</font>

969
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:23,512
<font color=#FFFF80>- and Miss. Peregrinee?
- Gone. Barron must have had a boat.</font>

970
01:31:27,226 --> 01:31:30,923
<font color=#FFFF80>Well, we have to go after them.
We know he is taking her to Blackpool.</font>

971
01:31:30,934 --> 01:31:33,370
<font color=#FFFF80>But Blackpool is miles
away, and the next ferry</font>

972
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:36,843
<font color=#FFFF80>doesn't go for hours..
We'll never make it in time.</font>

973
01:31:36,844 --> 01:31:39,706
<font color=#FFFF80>Not unless we go by boat too!</font>

974
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:29,949
<font color=#FFFF80>So there's a loop here in Blackpool,
its only six months old.</font>

975
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,051
<font color=#FFFF80>January 11th, 2016.
With Miss. Avocet gone...</font>

976
01:33:33,052 --> 01:33:36,920
<font color=#FFFF80>- It can't be reset.
- Won't the loop closes?</font>

977
01:33:36,931 --> 01:33:39,707
<font color=#FFFF80>Then its back to real time.</font>

978
01:33:40,338 --> 01:33:43,410
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, you know what
this means, don't you?</font>

979
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:44,911
<font color=#FFFF80>You're going to die.</font>

980
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:46,604
<font color=#FFFF80>Thats not what I mean.</font>

981
01:33:46,615 --> 01:33:50,275
<font color=#FFFF80>We have to get to our own time.
But you don't.</font>

982
01:33:50,286 --> 01:33:52,932
<font color=#FFFF80>You can continue
to live in 2016.</font>

983
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,301
<font color=#FFFF80>But why would I do that?</font>

984
01:33:55,312 --> 01:33:59,663
<font color=#FFFF80>If we kill Barron,
he'll be gone but time will carry on.</font>

985
01:33:59,674 --> 01:34:02,169
<font color=#FFFF80>He won't go to Florida,</font>

986
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:06,083
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe won't die and
you can go home.</font>

987
01:34:08,952 --> 01:34:10,693
<font color=#FFFF80>I can see my grandpa.</font>

988
01:34:15,798 --> 01:34:17,756
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen! I can explain
everything to them.</font>

989
01:34:17,767 --> 01:34:19,912
<font color=#FFFF80>I can persuade them to
take me to the island.</font>

990
01:34:21,513 --> 01:34:27,318
<font color=#FFFF80>Will you still there?
Our old loop's gone... for good.</font>

991
01:34:28,389 --> 01:34:31,157
<font color=#FFFF80>We wouldn't see
each other again.</font>

992
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,773
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought you wanted me to stay</font>

993
01:34:37,076 --> 01:34:42,610
<font color=#FFFF80>I know you'll choose Abe.
If I minded I wouldn't have told you.</font>

994
01:34:51,598 --> 01:34:55,141
<font color=#FFFF80>So, we found Miss. Avocet's
loop on the map yet?</font>

995
01:34:55,152 --> 01:34:59,044
<font color=#FFFF80>Its here, but its new, she
made it earlier this year.</font>

996
01:34:59,045 --> 01:34:59,967
<font color=#FFFF80>Its my year.</font>

997
01:34:59,978 --> 01:35:03,657
<font color=#FFFF80>If we don't get out before it closes,
we're stuck in January 2016.</font>

998
01:35:03,659 --> 01:35:08,131
<font color=#FFFF80>Great! So time catches up with all of us,
we all die except you!</font>

999
01:35:08,132 --> 01:35:09,780
<font color=#FFFF80>Plan? Loop closes at 4:30.</font>

1000
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:13,836
<font color=#FFFF80>I mean, we need to get in, rescue
the Ymbrynes... and get out.</font>

1001
01:35:13,837 --> 01:35:15,204
<font color=#FFFF80>If we're not dead already.</font>

1002
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:19,411
<font color=#FFFF80>Miss. Avocet said the machine is in the
cellar of the Blackpool tower building.</font>

1003
01:35:19,421 --> 01:35:22,093
<font color=#FFFF80>That means we'll be
indoors with Hollows.</font>

1004
01:35:22,104 --> 01:35:26,237
<font color=#FFFF80>No... we wont! I've got a plan,
but I'm going to need your help.</font>

1005
01:35:57,083 --> 01:36:01,155
<font color=#FFFF80>- This can't be it, can it?
- Loop entrances can be anywhere.</font>

1006
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:03,568
<font color=#FFFF80>The one in london is in a subway tunnel.</font>

1007
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:21,694
<font color=#FFFF80>- Sure, this is it?
- I think so</font>

1008
01:36:23,766 --> 01:36:27,359
<font color=#FFFF80>Miller, there's something
I need you to do first.</font>

1009
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:28,590
<font color=#FFFF80>Alright, I know.</font>

1010
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:35,175
<font color=#FFFF80>Look! There's the tower.
Its not far.</font>

1011
01:36:35,186 --> 01:36:38,067
<font color=#FFFF80>Easy for you say! I'm freezing.</font>

1012
01:36:43,573 --> 01:36:44,944
<font color=#FFFF80>Ready?</font>

1013
01:36:56,033 --> 01:37:00,766
<font color=#FFFF80>All the doors to the cellar are locked.
The only way to reach the Ymbrines is...</font>

1014
01:37:00,767 --> 01:37:04,410
<font color=#FFFF80>- Thats backstage.
- How many Hollows can you see?</font>

1015
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:07,632
<font color=#FFFF80>Four. Its good news.</font>

1016
01:37:07,643 --> 01:37:10,345
<font color=#FFFF80>I think you and I have a very
different definition of good news.</font>

1017
01:37:10,556 --> 01:37:13,425
<font color=#FFFF80>It means Barron's other friends
haven't arrived yet...</font>

1018
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:19,002
<font color=#FFFF80>Means they haven't started the experiment.
We're not too late.</font>

1019
01:37:20,204 --> 01:37:23,829
<font color=#FFFF80>Ok Emma, you ready?
You know what to say.</font>

1020
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,840
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey, Jake.</font>

1021
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,886
<font color=#FFFF80>Our brethren should be
joining us momentarily.</font>

1022
01:37:30,897 --> 01:37:32,092
<font color=#FFFF80>This is a day...</font>

1023
01:37:32,093 --> 01:37:33,568
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey! You down there.</font>

1024
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:36,488
<font color=#FFFF80>We killed your Hollow
friend Mr. Barron</font>

1025
01:37:36,499 --> 01:37:39,469
<font color=#FFFF80>and now we've come for
Miss. Peregrinee.</font>

1026
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,757
<font color=#FFFF80>Bring her and all the other
Ymbrines to the end of the pier</font>

1027
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,985
<font color=#FFFF80>in five minutes... or
face the consequences.</font>

1028
01:37:49,658 --> 01:37:53,350
<font color=#FFFF80>These children must be as
insane as their headmistress</font>

1029
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:57,655
<font color=#FFFF80>Still... the Hollows
will be glad of a feed.</font>

1030
01:38:00,678 --> 01:38:02,278
<font color=#FFFF80>Where are you?</font>

1031
01:38:02,289 --> 01:38:05,800
<font color=#FFFF80>I know you're in here somewhere.</font>

1032
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:10,480
<font color=#FFFF80>Ah... good..., listen to me.</font>

1033
01:38:10,491 --> 01:38:13,208
<font color=#FFFF80>I want you to follow
Mr. Archer...</font>

1034
01:38:13,238 --> 01:38:14,539
<font color=#FFFF80>and Mr. Clark.</font>

1035
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:19,753
<font color=#FFFF80>They are going to take you down to
the pier for a little afternoon tea.</font>

1036
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:22,420
<font color=#FFFF80>Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark,</font>

1037
01:38:22,431 --> 01:38:25,498
<font color=#FFFF80>gather the Hollows and
take them to the pier.</font>

1038
01:38:25,588 --> 01:38:26,880
<font color=#FFFF80>Those children killed Malphus?</font>

1039
01:38:26,891 --> 01:38:29,462
<font color=#FFFF80>Barron has had it for Malphus
since he killed Abe Portman.</font>

1040
01:38:29,472 --> 01:38:34,246
<font color=#FFFF80>Thats Abe Portman for months.</font>

1041
01:38:35,307 --> 01:38:36,977
<font color=#FFFF80>All I needed was a few minutes</font>

1042
01:38:36,988 --> 01:38:40,150
<font color=#FFFF80>to get the location of Miss.
Peregrine's loop from him.</font>

1043
01:38:40,151 --> 01:38:41,714
<font color=#FFFF80>But no.</font>

1044
01:38:41,725 --> 01:38:45,384
<font color=#FFFF80>Malphus couldn't
wait and instead</font>

1045
01:38:45,395 --> 01:38:47,966
<font color=#FFFF80>I had to masquerade as</font>

1046
01:38:47,967 --> 01:38:55,967
<font color=#FFFF80>a psychiatrist for three weeks in Florida.
Have you ever been to Florida?</font>

1047
01:39:01,488 --> 01:39:03,850
<font color=#FFFF80>Did I not tell you to
gather the Hollows?</font>

1048
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:05,031
<font color=#FFFF80>What if it's a trap?</font>

1049
01:39:05,032 --> 01:39:07,924
<font color=#FFFF80>Of course it is Miss. Edwards!
But what of it?</font>

1050
01:39:07,935 --> 01:39:12,118
<font color=#FFFF80>A couple of children against four Hollows.
Lets get this over with.</font>

1051
01:39:31,384 --> 01:39:32,845
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake, I'm atuck!</font>

1052
01:39:39,191 --> 01:39:40,402
<font color=#FFFF80>Hurry up!</font>

1053
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:03,171
<font color=#FFFF80>They are coming!</font>

1054
01:40:27,151 --> 01:40:28,983
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch now!</font>

1055
01:40:47,759 --> 01:40:49,020
<font color=#FFFF80>Go now!</font>

1056
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:03,652
<font color=#FFFF80>Can be seen now.</font>

1057
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:13,170
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma! Go!</font>

1058
01:41:16,843 --> 01:41:18,974
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't just stand there!
Get them!</font>

1059
01:43:05,404 --> 01:43:08,166
<font color=#FFFF80>Alright, good job guys.
Time for Step 2.</font>

1060
01:43:08,177 --> 01:43:09,717
<font color=#FFFF80>Save the Ms. Peregrine.</font>

1061
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:15,093
<font color=#FFFF80>That's... sort of step 3.
First we've got to deal with Barron.</font>

1062
01:43:17,595 --> 01:43:21,267
<font color=#FFFF80>- They should've been back by now.
- I said it was a trap.</font>

1063
01:43:21,268 --> 01:43:26,242
<font color=#FFFF80>If thats true, perhaps we
should move the Ymbrynes now.</font>

1064
01:43:27,053 --> 01:43:28,523
<font color=#FFFF80>You are not serious?</font>

1065
01:43:28,534 --> 01:43:32,786
<font color=#FFFF80>Do I not look serious? Do I
not look like a man who has</font>

1066
01:43:32,787 --> 01:43:34,144
<font color=#FFFF80>trudged the globe looking</font>

1067
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:38,501
<font color=#FFFF80>for just one more eye to eat
in hopes of regaining...</font>

1068
01:43:38,502 --> 01:43:42,009
<font color=#FFFF80>sufficient humanity to
return to his research?</font>

1069
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,876
<font color=#FFFF80>A man who spent years...</font>

1070
01:43:43,877 --> 01:43:48,121
<font color=#FFFF80>hunting Ymbrynes in
preparation for this night?</font>

1071
01:43:48,132 --> 01:43:50,862
<font color=#FFFF80>And 2... no..
3 days in Wales...</font>

1072
01:43:50,863 --> 01:43:53,886
<font color=#FFFF80>Pretending to look at birds.</font>

1073
01:43:54,086 --> 01:43:58,708
<font color=#FFFF80>I assure you I'll will not stand idly by.</font>

1074
01:43:58,709 --> 01:44:02,412
<font color=#FFFF80>To see my destiny derailed.</font>

1075
01:44:08,888 --> 01:44:10,259
<font color=#FFFF80>Hugh, do it now!</font>

1076
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,093
<font color=#FFFF80>Come back here! Get them!</font>

1077
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,976
<font color=#FFFF80>Low, get down!</font>

1078
01:44:36,987 --> 01:44:41,954
<font color=#FFFF80>You think you can
stand in my way?</font>

1079
01:44:41,956 --> 01:44:43,556
<font color=#FFFF80>You Jake,</font>

1080
01:44:43,567 --> 01:44:49,966
<font color=#FFFF80>content to age and die as if you had
not the gift of peculiarity, at all?</font>

1081
01:44:55,277 --> 01:45:02,252
<font color=#FFFF80>I am a higher being.
I hold a secret to eternal life.</font>

1082
01:45:02,253 --> 01:45:05,166
<font color=#FFFF80>- Sorry to interrupt.
- What the...?</font>

1083
01:45:15,814 --> 01:45:17,315
<font color=#FFFF80>Bronwyn.</font>

1084
01:45:23,661 --> 01:45:25,397
<font color=#FFFF80>You missed me again, Jake.</font>

1085
01:45:25,408 --> 01:45:28,344
<font color=#FFFF80>I take it, accuracy is
not you peculiarity.</font>

1086
01:45:39,965 --> 01:45:42,597
<font color=#FFFF80>Abe was a much worthier adversary.</font>

1087
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,711
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't let him get to the birds!</font>

1088
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:02,563
<font color=#FFFF80>You must put me in contact
with your tailor.</font>

1089
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:08,549
<font color=#FFFF80>Ymbrynes... Ymbrynes, here I come!</font>

1090
01:46:20,469 --> 01:46:23,670
<font color=#FFFF80>Cold. Wait till the blood
freezes in your veins.</font>

1091
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:31,258
<font color=#FFFF80>That was your attempt to
rescue your friend? Was it?</font>

1092
01:46:55,899 --> 01:46:58,099
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake!
I'll hold him as long as I can</font>

1093
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,757
<font color=#FFFF80>when are you going to realise you
are a terrible shot with that thing?</font>

1094
01:47:01,768 --> 01:47:03,714
<font color=#FFFF80>Get the others,
I'll meet you at the.</font>

1095
01:47:03,715 --> 01:47:05,216
<font color=#FFFF80>Loop entrance.</font>

1096
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:20,039
<font color=#FFFF80>He's getting out.</font>

1097
01:47:48,793 --> 01:47:52,358
<font color=#FFFF80>Eventually you're going
to run out of breath</font>

1098
01:47:52,369 --> 01:47:56,103
<font color=#FFFF80>and it'll all be over.</font>

1099
01:47:56,114 --> 01:47:59,834
<font color=#FFFF80>Death for your beloved Jake
and Miss Megan Peregrinee...</font>

1100
01:47:59,845 --> 01:48:04,221
<font color=#FFFF80>and everlasting life for me.</font>

1101
01:49:02,396 --> 01:49:04,467
<font color=#FFFF80>Olive! Olive!</font>

1102
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:10,399
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm so sorry, Olive.</font>

1103
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:14,014
<font color=#FFFF80>All these years I never
appreciated you.</font>

1104
01:49:14,025 --> 01:49:17,361
<font color=#FFFF80>I didn't see how lucky I was.</font>

1105
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,473
<font color=#FFFF80>I got so used to having you
there, I never realized.</font>

1106
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,891
<font color=#FFFF80>You never realised, what?</font>

1107
01:50:22,313 --> 01:50:24,685
<font color=#FFFF80>Find your children.
Create new loops.</font>

1108
01:50:27,927 --> 01:50:29,416
<font color=#FFFF80>So Jake,</font>

1109
01:50:29,427 --> 01:50:33,067
<font color=#FFFF80>I see you've inherited your
grandfather's peculiarity.</font>

1110
01:50:33,078 --> 01:50:35,393
<font color=#FFFF80>You're just as
annoying as he was.</font>

1111
01:50:38,506 --> 01:50:43,560
<font color=#FFFF80>Speaking of Abe, if you should
see him in the afterlife,</font>

1112
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:45,432
<font color=#FFFF80>Give him my regards.</font>

1113
01:50:53,609 --> 01:50:56,312
<font color=#FFFF80>Please, we can't risk
him taking you again.</font>

1114
01:51:15,377 --> 01:51:16,543
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch! Where are the others?</font>

1115
01:51:16,554 --> 01:51:18,849
<font color=#FFFF80>There safe. Olive is leading
them back to the ghost ship.</font>

1116
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:20,992
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake needs us.
Barron's too strong.</font>

1117
01:51:28,539 --> 01:51:31,741
<font color=#FFFF80>You've lost Miss. Peregrine.
You've lost everything!</font>

1118
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:32,852
<font color=#FFFF80>Its over!</font>

1119
01:51:46,103 --> 01:51:47,774
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake?</font>

1120
01:51:51,377 --> 01:51:53,349
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake?</font>

1121
01:51:56,622 --> 01:51:58,324
<font color=#FFFF80>Jake?</font>

1122
01:52:04,599 --> 01:52:07,710
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma? Wait, thats not me. It is Barron.</font>

1123
01:52:07,712 --> 01:52:10,744
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't listen to him. He is Barron.
I'm Jake. That's Barron.</font>

1124
01:52:12,045 --> 01:52:15,487
<font color=#FFFF80>Well I got better shot than Jake.
So neither of you move till we sort this.</font>

1125
01:52:15,488 --> 01:52:16,773
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen to me. I'm Jake.</font>

1126
01:52:16,784 --> 01:52:19,790
<font color=#FFFF80>I grew up in Florida and I
wanted to be an explorer.</font>

1127
01:52:19,792 --> 01:52:22,633
<font color=#FFFF80>I never thought nothing would ever
change because I was ordinary.</font>

1128
01:52:22,634 --> 01:52:24,004
<font color=#FFFF80>Thats Jake get Barron.</font>

1129
01:52:24,015 --> 01:52:27,306
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait! I told him all this.
She was my psychiatrist.</font>

1130
01:52:27,308 --> 01:52:29,980
<font color=#FFFF80>You deal with him.
I'll go find Miss. Peregrinee.</font>

1131
01:52:38,027 --> 01:52:44,713
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait. I can prove that I'm me,
because I am not ordinary</font>

1132
01:52:47,615 --> 01:52:49,587
<font color=#FFFF80>I can do something that no one else can</font>

1133
01:52:58,004 --> 01:53:00,235
<font color=#FFFF80>I can see the monsters.</font>

1134
01:53:08,783 --> 01:53:11,796
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, it's me!</font>

1135
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:28,620
<font color=#FFFF80>Enoch!</font>

1136
01:53:44,754 --> 01:53:47,636
<font color=#FFFF80>We need to go.
The loop is closing.</font>

1137
01:53:47,647 --> 01:53:48,767
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah.</font>

1138
01:53:49,858 --> 01:53:51,599
<font color=#FFFF80>Those of us who are leaving.</font>

1139
01:54:57,125 --> 01:54:58,191
<font color=#FFFF80>Emma...</font>

1140
01:54:58,202 --> 01:55:01,457
<font color=#FFFF80>You love your grandfather.
There's nothing more to explain.</font>

1141
01:55:01,458 --> 01:55:04,640
<font color=#FFFF80>No, I promised Miss Peregrine
that I'd look after you all</font>

1142
01:55:04,651 --> 01:55:07,864
<font color=#FFFF80>and with her injured and
you without a loop...</font>

1143
01:55:07,875 --> 01:55:12,751
<font color=#FFFF80>She'll recover and until
then we'll be in 1943.</font>

1144
01:55:12,762 --> 01:55:18,090
<font color=#FFFF80>We'll only age one day at a time.
Like normal people,</font>

1145
01:55:18,092 --> 01:55:22,094
<font color=#FFFF80>- Which can be no bad thing.
- And what about the Hollows?</font>

1146
01:55:22,095 --> 01:55:26,237
<font color=#FFFF80>As long as they are out
there, you are not safe.</font>

1147
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,189
<font color=#FFFF80>We don't need you to
make us feel safe, Jake.</font>

1148
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:33,625
<font color=#FFFF80>Because you made us feel brave.
And thats even better.</font>

1149
01:56:36,267 --> 01:56:38,239
<font color=#FFFF80>Cmon guys, lets go!</font>

1150
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:25,717
<font color=#FFFF80>And then we said goodbye and loop closed.</font>

1151
01:57:25,917 --> 01:57:29,817
<font color=#FFFF80>I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.</font>

1152
01:57:32,775 --> 01:57:36,879
<font color=#FFFF80>I'd never see you again.
I am safe.</font>

1153
01:57:40,492 --> 01:57:43,945
<font color=#FFFF80>Let me give you your birthday present.</font>

1154
01:57:44,145 --> 01:57:47,598
<font color=#FFFF80>Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.</font>

1155
01:57:51,272 --> 01:57:54,862
<font color=#FFFF80>For your travels. Go to her.
Jake.</font>

1156
01:57:54,873 --> 01:57:59,282
<font color=#FFFF80>You have the map.
You can go back to 1943.</font>

1157
01:58:05,003 --> 01:58:09,136
<font color=#FFFF80>Even so, they took a boat.
I don't know where they are.</font>

1158
01:58:11,378 --> 01:58:14,110
<font color=#FFFF80>But you know where they were.</font>

1159
01:58:52,653 --> 01:58:56,356
<font color=#FFFF80>You have no idea how long
it took me to get here.</font>

1160
01:58:58,898 --> 01:59:01,571
<font color=#FFFF80>The closest loop was in
the California desert.</font>

1161
01:59:09,717 --> 01:59:12,360
<font color=#FFFF80>I used it to get
to the Tokyo loop.</font>

1162
01:59:16,463 --> 01:59:19,751
<font color=#FFFF80>That led me to the nearest
loop back in 1942,</font>

1163
01:59:19,762 --> 01:59:23,048
<font color=#FFFF80>where I wound up joining the navy.
Don't ask.</font>

1164
01:59:23,849 --> 01:59:26,351
<font color=#FFFF80>Then I spent 2 months in London trying...</font>

1165
01:59:53,094 --> 01:59:55,805
<font color=#FFFF80>Ready. Full speed ahead!</font>
