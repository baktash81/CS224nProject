1
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,535
From Arthur Kahn to Tom Sanders.

2
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,979
Product Name: Arcamax CD-ROM.

3
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:43,780
Considering the merger,
I thought you should get this at home:

4
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:48,097
Arcamax production lines running
at 29% despite all efforts.

5
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,019
Spot-checks on dada dada....

6
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,861
Speaking of the merger,
are you rich and famous yet?

7
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,903
Congratulations in
advance on your promotion.

8
00:00:58,185 --> 00:00:59,300
"Arthur."

9
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:05,101
Dad, you got E-mail.

10
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:09,178
I'm not a pain in the ass,
I'm being a lawyer.

11
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:10,857
There's a difference.

12
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,984
No more computer games, Matt,
it's time for school. Eliza, where are you?

13
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:16,897
You got E-mail.

14
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,738
Tom, Matt's got toothpaste
all over himself!

15
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:25,493
If you can't get them ready for school,
don't say you'll do it.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,654
You're welcome.

17
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:27,974
I'm here.

18
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:30,534
-And Liza needs a jacket.
-I know she needs a jacket!

19
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,741
A jacket doesn't go, dad.

20
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:34,459
Wear a sweatshirt.

21
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:36,576
That's for girls, a white sweatshirt.

22
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:38,019
Since when?

23
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,422
Leave me alone.

24
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,661
Put your jacket on.

25
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:50,056
Ariel doesn't have a father.
She has two mothers.

26
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:51,658
That's interesting.

27
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,341
He's in a hotel with his secretary
patched in from New York...

28
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,338
...while I'm brushing Cheerios
from my file folders.

29
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,574
It's insanity.

30
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,098
Put your jacket on.

31
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,983
Put this on, sweetie.

32
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:05,056
You can take it off at school.

33
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,136
Listen to your mom.

34
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:09,182
Matt, did you pee?

35
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:13,543
I don't know why you said you'd
help me today, with your promotion.

36
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,502
What's dad got around his neck?

37
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,383
You don't know what this is?

38
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:18,854
It's a tie.

39
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:20,424
Dad's getting a promotion.

40
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,337
-Dad, you got an E-mail.
-Thanks, honey. Let's go.

41
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,774
We're late.

42
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:32,260
Did you get the Disneyland tickets?

43
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:34,336
With everything I have to do?

44
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,257
It's just one call.

45
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:37,494
Who are they for?

46
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:40,736
Mohammed Jafar.
He's foreman of the Malaysian plant.

47
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:44,215
You're the one person I know
who sucks up to the people below you.

48
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:47,823
Matt, don't kick the seat.

49
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,021
-What's on your tie?
-Toothpaste.

50
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:53,097
-Let's go.
-Your tie shouldn't look like a bib.

51
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,378
Hi, Cindy, what's up?

52
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,735
Garvin came by the office this morning?

53
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,578
About the promotion?

54
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:26,537
Matt, will you stop that?

55
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:30,783
He was surprised I was late?
What does that mean?

56
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,142
Did he say it in passing,
or like he really meant it?

57
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,542
I wonder why Garvin came by the office
at eight in the morning?

58
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:43,979
To congratulate you.

59
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,375
He treats everyone like dirt--

60
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,536
Except the top guys.

61
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:53,897
Except the top guys.

62
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,902
When this merger with Conley-White
goes through...

63
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,215
...and they spin off our division...

64
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:01,977
...we're going to be rich.

65
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,498
We're already rich.

66
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,859
No, I mean...

67
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:06,618
...really rich.

68
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,415
My grandmother used to say:

69
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,021
"Don't climb up there too close to God,
He might shake the tree."

70
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:25,979
Tom!

71
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,137
Thanks for this morning.

72
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,736
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

73
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,775
Remember lugging the first ones around?

74
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:02,541
People were amazed. It was like
showing a Polaroid to a bushman.

75
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,663
Now, if it's bigger than a credit card,
it's too inconvenient.

76
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,258
Keeps you on your toes.

77
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,893
Eddie, it's Tom. Cindy said you called.

78
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,544
Sure, I can hold.

79
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,218
How's the job search?

80
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:18,257
28 years at IBM. Did I
tell you what they told me?

81
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,024
I was "surplussed."
Ever hear that word?

82
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,661
What's going on down there?

83
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,817
What? That's crazy.

84
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,737
They should've said, "sodomized."

85
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:32,535
They're not going to sell the
Austin plant. That's just a rumor.

86
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,618
You don't see it coming. You go along,
and then one day there's no room.

87
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,537
No more room for you.

88
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,697
Smaller, faster, cheaper, better.

89
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:45,416
I won't mention names. I'm just telling
you, it's not true. It's a rumor.

90
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,139
I was making 150 a year. Big money.

91
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,576
It's probably what you make, huh?

92
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:53,019
Hang on.

93
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,096
Why don't you call Cindy...

94
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,098
...make an appointment.
I'll see if I can help.

95
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,823
Eddie, they are not
going to sell Austin.

96
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,818
If I'm telling you,
who else are you going to believe?

97
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:05,582
Cindy.

98
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,498
Pretty name.

99
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,056
Used to have fun with the girls.
Nowadays they want your job.

100
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:51,061
Good morning.

101
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,824
-What did Garvin say? Should I see him?
-He didn't say.

102
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,340
He growled.

103
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,655
He was flirting. Did you get Arthur?

104
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:59,577
He's standing by on the DVL.

105
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,736
Lunch with Conley-White is at noon.

106
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:05,415
We'll probably have those sandwiches
with the crusts cut off.

107
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,974
Their jaws were wired shut
at the same prep school.

108
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,903
The merger's still happening?

109
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:11,900
You heard something?

110
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:13,181
No.

111
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,903
Just, I....

112
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,618
What's on your tie?

113
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,416
Garvin didn't mention my promotion?

114
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,177
You said you'd be early today.

115
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,654
People from "Father of the Year"
didn't call?

116
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,100
No.

117
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:26,904
That's a joke.

118
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:31,216
Five seconds to Malaysia.

119
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:32,780
Should I close the door?

120
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:33,980
Do I ever ask that?

121
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,260
Never.

122
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,738
Malaysian video linkup.

123
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,296
You look good. Awake.

124
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,818
What's wrong with Arcamax?

125
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:48,297
The drives are very slow. We're
getting seek times in the 140-160 range.

126
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:51,895
140 isn't a sexy CD player anymore.
Everyone has 140.

127
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:54,454
My guys think there's
a compatibility problem...

128
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,139
...between the controller chip
and the driver's software.

129
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,096
That'll put us back a year.

130
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:03,861
The screen flickers. The current cuts
in and out. It's a design problem.

131
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,943
What do you mean?
All laptops have the same design.

132
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:10,381
I sent you out some drives.
You should get them today.

133
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:13,497
This is bad, Arthur.
How could this happen?

134
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:15,735
Going to bury it until the merger?

135
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:18,783
Don't you say anything.
Does anyone else know?

136
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,823
I'm a grave. What, are you kidding, Tom?

137
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,819
I still think, really,
that Arcamax will be a major, major hit.

138
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,340
I'll call you when I see the drives.

139
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,057
Did you get the macadamia nuts?

140
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,584
Good night, Arthur.

141
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,258
They are so good.

142
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:36,020
He's off the phone. I got to go.

143
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,897
Do you know a Meredith Johnson?

144
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,625
-Yes, years ago.
-She wanted to see you.

145
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:44,059
She's here for the lunch.

146
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,375
The entire company came for this lunch?

147
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,780
Garvin brought up the Operations Group.

148
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:50,902
Meredith is in Operations?

149
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,062
What should I tell her?
Bad day, in-laws in town?

150
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,143
I'm going to see Lewyn about the 900s.
Stop worrying.

151
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,780
If there was bad news
Garvin would've sent Phil Blackburn.

152
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,495
Phil.

153
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,696
Are you coming to see me?

154
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,618
No. Why?

155
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,423
Nothing. How are you?

156
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,503
How are you, Tom?
You look all beat up.

157
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:18,620
I do?

158
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:22,380
You're letting it get to you.
Don't take it personally.

159
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:24,064
Take what personally?

160
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,136
Maybe it's just a rumor.

161
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,499
What's a rumor?

162
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,941
I don't want to spread rumors.
That's how these things get started.

163
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,060
You mean Austin?

164
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:33,180
Who said that?

165
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,334
What am I missing?

166
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:37,664
I can't believe he didn't tell you.
He's so perverse.

167
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:38,701
Tell me what?

168
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,663
So, how's Susan?

169
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,938
Susan's good.

170
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,618
-How's Lonnie?
-Great.

171
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,896
-Did you know she got tenure?
-That's great.

172
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,781
Here's my stop.

173
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,856
I tried to explain to Garvin.

174
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,141
You know him, he's like a child.

175
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:06,775
Fuck your feelings if they interfere
with his surprise.

176
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,301
-What surprise?
-Rumor is you're getting passed over.

177
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:13,624
So I'm not getting the VP job?

178
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:14,654
That's the rumor.

179
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,816
Rumors are always true.

180
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,258
Garvin didn't say anything?

181
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:21,223
Came by the office. I was late,
Susan had a conference.

182
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,740
-You were late? Today?
-Why're you in Seattle?

183
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,463
Good to see you again.

184
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:35,741
Somebody tells Garvin I was talking
to you. You know how he is about leaks.

185
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,141
Leak? I thought it was a rumor.

186
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,820
It was different before.
I could watch your back.

187
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:44,260
Who gets the job, Stephanie Kaplan?

188
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,575
Rumor is he went outside the group.

189
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:49,179
You'd still head up Manufacturing...

190
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,494
...presumably.

191
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,134
Wait a minute.

192
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:57,137
I might be out of a job?

193
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:58,778
Don't get paranoid.

194
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:00,060
I'm a quick learner.

195
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:04,218
You wouldn't make someone VP
and not let them appoint their own team.

196
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,023
How would that look?

197
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,742
Am I out of a job?

198
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:11,257
Come on, Tom.

199
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:13,337
I'm already out on a limb.

200
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,454
Are you okay? You want a Prozac?

201
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,581
No, I'm fine.

202
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:30,459
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.

203
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,014
You sure?

204
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:41,340
Don't worry about me.
I'm a stockholder. Whatever's...

205
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:42,984
...best for the company....

206
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:08,378
Leave a message for Susan, Tom,
Matt and Eliza, after the beep.

207
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,137
Thanks for calling. Bye.

208
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,984
-Obviously, he's disappointed.
-But he took it well?

209
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,216
Overall, I'd say yes.

210
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,695
No bumps before the merger.
I don't want him quitting.

211
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,298
It's up to you.

212
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:28,820
Just one big happy family.

213
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,133
You got that?

214
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:35,141
I have to say, going down to see him
this morning was a masterstroke.

215
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,695
It really put him on the defensive.

216
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:39,583
I'll keep an eye on him.

217
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,383
He'll get on the program.

218
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:44,059
When push comes to shove,
he has no guts.

219
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,499
Let me ask you something.
You know Susan.

220
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,623
If I heard a rumor about the...

221
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,616
...future of the company...

222
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:01,534
...my future...

223
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:04,539
...you know, nothing crazy,
a real rumor...

224
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:08,695
...what would Susan say?
You think she'd say to see Garvin?

225
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:28,543
Here's someone you should meet.

226
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,975
Tom Sanders.
He heads up Manufacturing.

227
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,659
Steven Chase, Crescent Capital.
John Conley.

228
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:34,940
You're John Conley?

229
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:38,655
Junior. Dad's coming on Friday
with members of the Board.

230
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,658
-Catch you at the lunch.
-Tom, come in.

231
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,417
You wanted to see me.

232
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:47,577
Yeah, sorry about this morning.
You know how kids are.

233
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:50,134
Have you met Meredith Johnson?

234
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,379
What's wrong?
That's a hello you'd give to a rash.

235
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:55,695
I'm preoccupied. It's not you.

236
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:58,095
We go way back. He broke my heart.

237
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,778
She's making that up.

238
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,493
I thought your heart was made of plastic.

239
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,417
He said I could be anything I wanted.

240
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:06,496
-He was right.
-It was a line.

241
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,975
-It wasn't a line.
-I didn't know you were acquainted.

242
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:12,660
Wilde said, "I like a man with a future
and a woman with a past."

243
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,417
I heard you were in Operations.

244
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,615
I don't know. Am I?

245
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:23,057
The last few years I've been cleaning
up the mess Bob made of this company.

246
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,775
If it's such a mess, why am I so rich?

247
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,856
Yes, but you're a lot richer now.

248
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,936
We should catch up. Get together.

249
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:31,220
I'd love that.

250
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,897
Plenty of time now.

251
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,342
Flying over Wyoming,
I thought the merger was dead.

252
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:40,896
Conley was choking on the valuation.
The spin-off was Meredith's idea.

253
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,454
Conley thinks it was their idea.

254
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,344
-Really?
-Lit them up like a Christmas tree.

255
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,700
She saved the merger.

256
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,903
You have money now.
You can even buy a new tie.

257
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:56,822
So, what was it
you wanted to see me about?

258
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:02,900
Meredith-fucking-Johnson!
Son-of-a-bitch. Goddamn Garvin.

259
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,020
-What happened?
-I didn't get it.

260
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,141
-You're not the new VP?
-He announced it?

261
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,138
It was a secret.
He's got her installed in the office...

262
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,216
...bouncing quips back and forth.

263
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,181
Who?

264
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,620
-Who's she?
-Will this affect the spin-off?

265
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:18,414
She doesn't know the difference
between software and a sweater.

266
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,018
What aren't you telling us?

267
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,064
I might be out of a job.
You know what it's like out there?

268
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:25,658
What about the spin-off?

269
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,943
They didn't tell me about me!
Would they tell me about the spin-off?!

270
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,778
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,664
This is the worst day of my life.
All right?

272
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,540
Who is she?

273
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,457
Let me guess: attractive?

274
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,064
What does that matter?

275
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,022
Nipples like pencil erasers?

276
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:47,255
She's attractive. Very attractive.

277
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:48,653
Sleeping with Garvin?

278
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,463
That's why he got a Nordic Track.

279
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,185
It's a curse to be me.
Life holds no surprises.

280
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:55,097
This is such a clich?.

281
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,819
How do you think a clich?
becomes a clich??

282
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:00,021
You mean like, "Size doesn't matter"?

283
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,543
I have a thing for you.

284
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:05,583
All right, please,
can we get some work done?

285
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,134
We got a small problem with Arcamax.

286
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,136
-It's not the design.
-It's not the code.

287
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:14,537
Any woman must be twice as good
as a man and work harder for less pay.

288
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:16,457
Clich? grande.

289
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,456
How does a clich? become one?

290
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,901
It is very weird.
We know nothing about this woman.

291
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:22,861
I do.

292
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,697
I had a thing with her.

293
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,859
You are amazing.

294
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,938
It was years ago.

295
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:31,495
You've seen more ass than a rental car.

296
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:34,782
Get a few more women in your life
so you can be a census.

297
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,777
Maybe you can sleep your way up.

298
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,060
Right.

299
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:41,183
Wait, why? Why her and not Tom?
He's not attractive?

300
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,097
Men and women are different.

301
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:44,778
Not in a way that matters to you.

302
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,258
Are you saying I'm a virgin?

303
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:01,704
Meanwhile, you were asking me
about the spin-off.

304
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,176
Garvin said it was her idea.

305
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:13,705
It's always such a pleasure to come here...

306
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:16,294
...and be with the
Advanced Products Group.

307
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:19,064
I feel such a warmth for the people here.

308
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:22,900
I feel a kinship.
And I've always wanted to give you...

309
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,498
Is this seat taken?

310
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:28,661
...the most advanced original
leadership that I could.

311
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,224
How are you?

312
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:33,860
-Sorry you didn't get the promotion.
-I'm sorry you didn't get it either.

313
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,339
How long have you known?

314
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,178
Really? That long?

315
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,224
Every time I've wanted to promote
a woman...

316
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,216
...to break the glass ceiling...

317
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:47,501
...it's always the same story:

318
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,775
"But, Bob.... But, Bob...."

319
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:55,375
I've thought about it often since
my daughter's death, that had she lived...

320
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,695
...it would be extremely rare...

321
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:00,015
...that she ever got to run a company.

322
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,818
So it has a special meaning
for me when I tell you...

323
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:06,015
...that when we announce the merger...

324
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,137
...we will also announce the new VP
for Advanced Operations and Planning...

325
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,340
...in Seattle...

326
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:14,500
...will be Meredith Johnson.

327
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,058
Unbelievable.

328
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,859
Thanks, Bob. Can I have the lights?

329
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:40,855
The Advanced Products Group has been
the heart of DigiCom for the last 10 years.

330
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:44,900
Advanced Products has historically
consisted of four divisions....

331
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,459
You seem to be spending
more time up here.

332
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,419
My son's a freshman at the university.
This way I get to see more of him.

333
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,894
I thought it had to do with the merger.

334
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,774
This merger means everything to Garvin.

335
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:02,097
Give a man a $100 million
and you create a frustrated billionaire.

336
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:06,062
The new compression algorithms
will shift industry standards...

337
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:09,183
...to full-res digitized video
at 60 fields a second...

338
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,542
...with platform-independent
RISC processors supported by...

339
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:14,297
...a 32-bit color-active...

340
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,898
Conley's a conservative company.

341
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,456
Is Meredith conservative?

342
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,139
I don't know.

343
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,297
I thought you knew her.

344
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:25,895
Is there anything you don't know?

345
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:28,696
We offer, through technology...

346
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:32,301
...what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered:

347
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,217
Freedom from the physical body.

348
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,016
Freedom from race and gender...

349
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:41,098
...from nationality and personality,
from place and time.

350
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,938
Communicating by cellular phone
and hand-held computer...

351
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,340
...PDA and built-in fax modem...

352
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:49,423
...we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness.

353
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:57,463
Smart, touching base
with all the division heads.

354
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,014
She didn't name them in her speech.

355
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:03,699
Does it mean something?

356
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,416
Only if she plans to make changes.

357
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,584
Phil said she wasn't planning
on making any changes.

358
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,104
You know Meredith.

359
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:17,454
Wait a minute.

360
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,695
I must know, am I out of a job?

361
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,055
What was she bending your ear about?

362
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,420
Stephanie? Nothing. Just small talk.

363
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,178
What, all of a sudden
there's Stephanie Lite?

364
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:31,417
She was talking about her son
at the university.

365
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,815
Sorry I didn't get to mention you.

366
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:34,895
That's fine.

367
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,977
I'm jammed all day but why
don't you come up at seven?

368
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:40,784
We'll have a drink
and catch up on business.

369
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,260
Great.

370
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:45,098
I remember how you liked
a good bottle of wine. I'll get one.

371
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:54,299
What's she want to see you
at seven about?

372
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:59,061
Probably the Arcamax problems. We must
discuss it before Conley asks questions.

373
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,022
She doesn't give you a boner?

374
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,063
Because, you know,
I definitely have lift-off.

375
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,102
What about you? You got a woody?

376
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,664
She's very nice.

377
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:10,134
-I'll let you know what happens.
-Don't do that.

378
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,980
You have a sexual urge every 20 minutes.
It's a physical certainty.

379
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,381
It's hard-wired into your brain.

380
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:20,174
You can't fight it.
Why would you want to? Live a little.

381
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,223
Ten years from now you'll need a forklift
to get a hard on.

382
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,980
I'll call you.

383
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:26,419
I'll count the minutes.

384
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,335
Where've you been all day?

385
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,224
I didn't get it.

386
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:40,174
No, they went outside the division.
Someone from Operations.

387
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:44,379
What can I say? I got passed over.

388
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,099
What can I say?

389
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,933
So, did you get the tickets for Disneyland?

390
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:55,058
No, I know,
but I promised the guy and it's...

391
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,499
Mohammed Jafar.

392
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:03,540
Thanks a lot. Probably won't be home
for dinner tonight.

393
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,614
I love you too. Bye.

394
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,380
Are there any asset sale triggers?

395
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,174
In the indenture?

396
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,344
Will you do me a favor?

397
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,624
Alan, Brown will go 250 on this, easy.

398
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:11,014
Let's just do this thing.

399
00:23:12,985 --> 00:23:15,340
Not a bad idea for a girl.

400
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,782
Let's talk first thing.

401
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,139
'91  Pahlmeyer.

402
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,817
I've looked all over for it.

403
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:24,665
I like all the boys under me to be happy.

404
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:26,575
Congratulations.

405
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,014
Thank you.

406
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:35,224
I brought the files up for Arcamax
if you want to see them.

407
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,139
Show me your pictures.

408
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,579
The diagrams?

409
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,781
Your family. You have pictures?

410
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,093
Yeah, sure.

411
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,098
Here's.... Here.

412
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:53,975
That's Matthew.
That's Eliza at Halloween.

413
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,176
And here's Susan with the kids.

414
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,219
She looks like she always has food
in the refrigerator.

415
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:04,014
-She never lost the baby weight--
-She doesn't look like a refrigerator.

416
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,255
I mean, she's made a home for you.

417
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,942
In my fridge I've got some champagne
and an orange.

418
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:11,584
Doesn't Eliza look pretty?

419
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,298
She looks like Susan.

420
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:16,858
It can be inhibiting.

421
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,380
-What's that?
-Domesticity.

422
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,098
You'd be surprised.

423
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:23,495
You can't jump her from behind...

424
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,578
...because you get excited by
the way she bends to pick up the soap.

425
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,739
Remember that?

426
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:32,219
I remember that.

427
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:33,659
And you miss it.

428
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:37,299
There's compensations.

429
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:40,537
Of course. Life's a series of trade-offs.

430
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:42,741
I wouldn't trade what I have.

431
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:46,534
I wouldn't want you to.
That's exactly why I can trust you.

432
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:49,016
You have more to lose than I do.

433
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:58,619
I'll bring you up to speed
on the problems with the drives.

434
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,094
You kept in good shape, Tom.

435
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:03,097
Nice and hard.

436
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,339
Thank you.

437
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,224
It's different now.

438
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,056
You're my boss.

439
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:23,824
It's different.

440
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:28,620
Okay.

441
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:31,824
Rub my shoulders and I'll listen
to your problems.

442
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,822
The specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds.

443
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:52,660
We have that on the prototypes.
But the drives coming off-line--

444
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:55,180
-Are the drives here?
-It might be a chip.

445
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,575
-Answer my question.
-I'm trying to.

446
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:02,264
Understand the controller chip
positions the split optics.

447
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:03,699
I'll show you the schematic.

448
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,583
No, no, no, no. Rub.

449
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,814
You can't understand the problem--

450
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,021
-Do you have the drives?
-Arthur sent five--

451
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,736
-I said no calls.
-It's Mr. Garvin.

452
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,338
But after that, nobody.

453
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:22,735
Is it all right if I leave for the day?

454
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:24,497
That's fine, Mrs. Ross.

455
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:33,740
You'd rather talk about other things...

456
00:26:33,905 --> 00:26:36,624
...than answer my question
because you don't know.

457
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:40,664
You don't know what the problem is.
But you can't say, "I don't know"...

458
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:45,296
...because in your mind that means
you lose. You're worthless. Men!

459
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:48,298
-What will you tell Conley?
-I can't lie to them.

460
00:26:48,465 --> 00:26:51,502
Talk about the prototypes. They work.

461
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:53,144
Focus on the positive.

462
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,944
We're on-line. It's not
about the prototypes.

463
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:59,780
-They want to know if you can build it.
-I understand that--

464
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:02,015
Do you have a problem working for me?

465
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,180
No.

466
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:07,541
Hi, Bob.

467
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:11,782
You don't want to hear
about my hard day.

468
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:14,576
Yes, that's hard work.

469
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:17,136
Let me get my docs together.

470
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:23,216
The merger is about people, not Arcamax.
They're comfortable with me and Bob.

471
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:27,060
This isn't about some CD-ROM
that'll be obsolete in a year.

472
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:29,983
If they ask,
then you tell them you don't know.

473
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:31,858
Hi, Bob, I'm here.

474
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:34,096
I've got a great idea about that.

475
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:35,700
Go ahead.

476
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,938
Lewyn, this is Sanders.

477
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:44,815
I've discussed the drives with Meredith.
She says don't tell the Conley people...

478
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,783
...until we know exactly
what the problems are.

479
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:51,301
That is the line for the eight a.m.
meeting tomorrow--

480
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:53,777
Let's get down to business.

481
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:57,700
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Meredith, wait a second.

482
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:06,100
-There, was that so bad?
-That's not so bad, it's just--

483
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:10,503
Come on, while there's still
a chance we might get caught.

484
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:13,618
No, no.

485
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,856
Oh, yes, I think so.

486
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:25,381
Some things never change,
and some things just get better.

487
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,058
Meredith, come on.

488
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:35,295
-Remember all the things we did?
-I remember.

489
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,664
Things nobody knows about you but me.

490
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,177
All our secrets.

491
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,825
Just lie back and let me take you.

492
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,014
I could have anybody and I picked you.

493
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,215
Now you've got all the power.

494
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:05,215
You've got something I want.

495
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,536
Doesn't that make you feel good?

496
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:13,696
Don't stop me. Come on.

497
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,775
Don't worry, I'm not going to bite.

498
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:20,654
Let me do whatever I want.

499
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:25,062
You just lie back and let me be the boss.

500
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:47,944
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

501
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:50,499
What?

502
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:53,136
Look, nobody has to know.

503
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:54,897
Nobody gets hurt.

504
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:58,501
It's just a meeting
between two colleagues.

505
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:02,103
Just another dull day
in the computer business.

506
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,379
No, honey.

507
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:17,460
Don't!

508
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:21,700
Here.

509
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:25,538
-Want to get fucked?
-Do it.

510
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,138
Is that what you want?

511
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,700
Come on.

512
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:31,858
Is that what you want?

513
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:39,697
You just stay hard.

514
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,978
Oh, God.

515
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,258
You bad boy.

516
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:05,617
Come on, baby.

517
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:20,577
Come on. You going to fuck me?
You going to fuck me?!

518
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:26,740
Put it in.

519
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:32,817
God, look at us.

520
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:34,740
Go inside me.

521
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:36,180
Come on.

522
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,419
-I can't do this.
-Do it.

523
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:39,461
I won't.

524
00:31:39,705 --> 00:31:40,421
Now!

525
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,576
-I'm not going to do this!
-Now!

526
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:44,178
You can't just stop!

527
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:46,575
-Come on.
-No! Goddamn!

528
00:31:56,585 --> 00:32:00,260
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

529
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:04,657
This never happened.

530
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,333
You never used to be this way.

531
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:14,417
I have a family now.

532
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,974
A family made you stupid.

533
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:22,181
You take those two champagne bottles
in your refrigerator...

534
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,619
...and fuck them.

535
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,016
You son-of-a-bitch.

536
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:31,944
You get back here
and finish what you started.

537
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,220
You hear me?

538
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:34,341
Do you?

539
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,543
Come back and finish what you started
or you are dead!

540
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,775
You are fucking dead!

541
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,257
Shit, it's dead.

542
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:27,334
You are hereby notified
that we will hold your client liable--

543
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:29,901
I didn't hear you come in.

544
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:31,823
I'm going to take a shower.

545
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,818
-No kiss?
-I just feel kind of shitty, you know.

546
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,304
Screw them.

547
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:40,134
-They don't deserve you.
-Can you get me a beer?

548
00:34:58,345 --> 00:35:01,542
Thanks. Before I forget,
could you do me a favor?

549
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:03,343
The cellular's battery's dead.

550
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:06,497
Sure. I thought they
were supposed to last all day?

551
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:07,780
I thought so.

552
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,173
Who's Meredith Johnson?

553
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:11,334
What?

554
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,543
Meredith Johnson.

555
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:16,420
She called just before you got home.

556
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:18,859
She called?

557
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,095
Yeah, about ten minutes ago.

558
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:27,296
She said the 8 a.m. had been pushed
back to 8:30.

559
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:31,014
-Who is she?
-She's the one, the new VP.

560
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:32,893
She's the one?

561
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,976
She came from the Valley.

562
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:36,420
How old is she?

563
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:39,019
I don't know. 33, maybe.

564
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:41,096
That's young for that job.

565
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,465
-Had you ever heard of her?
-She's a face guy.

566
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:49,255
She made the merger happen.
Now she's Garvin's fair-haired...whatever.

567
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:54,854
Where'd she come from?
Has she any technical background?

568
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:58,335
No. That's the thing with the merger.
Everything's changed.

569
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:02,175
That's not the worst thing in the world.
She'll crash and burn.

570
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:03,824
Then they'll appreciate you.

571
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:06,055
Things aren't easy out there.

572
00:36:06,225 --> 00:36:07,783
So quit...

573
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,381
...rather than let them treat you badly.

574
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:13,378
We might lose everything,
including the stock options.

575
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,501
I don't care about stock options.

576
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:16,893
I'll work full-time.

577
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:19,454
I'm capable of supporting our family.

578
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,899
Just trying to help.

579
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,302
You're too nice sometimes.

580
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:26,696
I don't need you to fight
my battles for me, thanks.

581
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:32,138
Right now some lucky girl
in the building will come after me.

582
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,141
I deserve that, but ask yourself...

583
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,253
...why does a man go with another girl?
He's unhappy at home.

584
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:42,222
Because he's lonely.

585
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:45,417
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

586
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:50,175
Why are you wearing a T-shirt?
You never do.

587
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,779
I don't know. Just a little cold.

588
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,297
What are you going to do?

589
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:00,135
Grin and bear it, like I usually do.

590
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,618
And hope it doesn't get worse.

591
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:19,140
Morning.

592
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,419
Morning, Bob.

593
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:24,418
That's a nice suit.

594
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,539
Nice fabric.

595
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,379
Can I feel it?

596
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:32,817
What is that? Wool?

597
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,976
With a little bit of viscose.

598
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:38,382
That's what makes the pants
drape so well.

599
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,259
You work out?

600
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:46,020
When I get a chance, Bob.
It's been busy lately.

601
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:49,864
I've always liked you.

602
00:37:54,745 --> 00:37:56,576
Now you have the power.

603
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:59,137
You have something I want.

604
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,215
Come on.

605
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:21,343
The computer takes the information
from the database...

606
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:24,781
...and constructs an environment
that is projected in the headset.

607
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:27,823
When the user walks on the pad,
he or she...

608
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:32,536
...feels like they're walking in a hall
with drawers of files on all sides.

609
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,935
The user can stop, open any file...

610
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:39,576
...and look at the data. The laser
scanners are for body representation.

611
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:41,895
-That's amazing.
-It's cool, isn't it?

612
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,100
Where is everyone?

613
00:38:49,265 --> 00:38:52,462
They left 15 minutes ago.
Don Cherry's demo-ing the Corridor.

614
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,138
The meeting's at 8:30.

615
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:57,820
No, 7:30. It got pushed up.
Nobody told you?

616
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:02,217
If someone wants to log on with
a regular computer, what they'll see...

617
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:07,576
...is a model of themselves with a photo
that's pulled up from a data file.

618
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,056
Hey, I know you.

619
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:13,103
The photo bears some
resemblance to me, I admit.

620
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,814
An inside joke here at the company.

621
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,215
We've also constructed virtual help.

622
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:20,535
Users always need on-line help.

623
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,536
We created an angel to help you.

624
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,299
Welcome to the Corridor.

625
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,178
The same face.

626
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:32,940
Angel...

627
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:35,824
...how do I open this drawer?

628
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:37,737
What's the angel saying?

629
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,657
That's between them.

630
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:43,261
We don't see the Corridor
as a product in the marketplace now.

631
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:46,861
This is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential...

632
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,936
...of virtual reality technology.

633
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,498
This looks good.

634
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:55,335
Hold on. What's that?

635
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:57,496
I believe it's your financial records.

636
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,454
Turn that damn thing off.

637
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:01,421
Sorry.

638
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:06,136
In the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access.

639
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:11,174
So glad you could join us.

640
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,144
That was a sweet entrance, my friend.

641
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:18,856
Did the ferry hit an iceberg? You were
going to call me after meeting Meredith.

642
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:22,142
I called you from her office.
Left a message.

643
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:25,980
There was nothing on my machine.
Then you're late again.

644
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:28,295
Thank God Meredith
led the discussion.

645
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:32,780
Hey, pal, I left a message
on your machine, all right?

646
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:34,378
Check it out.

647
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:36,537
Did you get my message?

648
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:40,223
You told Susan the meeting
had been moved to 8:30.

649
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:45,015
I said 7:30. If your wife can't take
a fucking message, get a machine.

650
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:55,816
-There you go, Mr. Sanders.
-Thank you.

651
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,259
You're welcome.

652
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,499
Full house today.

653
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:08,064
Meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the Arcamax.

654
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:10,136
We'd like your read on it.

655
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,935
Meredith said there are problems.

656
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,573
You might have to go back
to the drawing board.

657
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:20,141
I'm sorry if I conveyed that
impression to Meredith.

658
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:23,024
I'm convinced we can manufacture them.

659
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:25,335
How many of the drives meet specs?

660
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:28,136
I don't have that information with me.

661
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:32,617
Meredith told us the line is running
at 29%%%. Is that approximately right?

662
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,336
The seek times are off-specs.

663
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:38,383
There's a power flicker in the screen?

664
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,457
-Right?
-That's right.

665
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,742
With the merger impending,
shouldn't you have told someone?

666
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:47,420
The merger isn't about a CD-ROM
that might be obsolete in a year.

667
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,337
It's about people.

668
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:53,100
-It'll be obsolete in a year?
-The promise of the Arcamax...

669
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:55,825
...was a central factor in this merger.

670
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:59,421
I may be at fault. Tom said the
problem with the drives was serious.

671
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:00,461
Not so serious.

672
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,580
Don't cover up.

673
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:04,623
-I'm not covering anything up.
-Give us worst case.

674
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:08,539
We go back to the drawing boards
and we're down for nine months.

675
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,140
Nine months?

676
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,738
Meredith said six weeks.

677
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:16,856
Nobody likes to go back to the board,
but it can be an advantage.

678
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:18,777
Is there a problem?

679
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:21,823
This isn't an inquisition.
I feel like I'm pulling teeth.

680
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:25,978
John just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines.

681
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:30,781
-I don't know is the honest answer.
-Wait a minute.

682
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:33,736
You are head of Manufacturing.

683
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:37,341
You are in charge of Arcamax.
There are problems with it...

684
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:41,657
...that could take nine months to fix,
which I assume means a year.

685
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,417
And the bottom line is...

686
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,817
...you don't know?

687
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,424
Goddamn it!

688
00:42:49,225 --> 00:42:50,658
Goddamn it!

689
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:52,304
Jesus Christ!

690
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:01,101
I wanted to see you.
It's not going to work out with Meredith.

691
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,461
-Evidently not.
-She set me up.

692
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:04,296
I saw.

693
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,342
-She set me up.
-Sit down.

694
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:09,542
-Why? What'd I do?
-Please, would you just sit.

695
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:15,497
Meredith told me
about your meeting last night.

696
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:16,700
What?

697
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:21,104
What'd she say?

698
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:24,941
She wants to handle the intervention
internally, which is best.

699
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:28,256
-She still cares about you.
-Wait a minute.

700
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:30,214
What'd she say?

701
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:34,544
Not to put too fine a point on it,
she said you sexually harassed her.

702
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,535
I sexually harassed her?

703
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:41,181
-What would you call it?
-She jumped me.

704
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,536
She jumped you? You're in denial.
That's typical.

705
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,217
She almost raped me.

706
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:49,104
You need help.
You must accept responsibility for--

707
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:50,494
What about this?

708
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:51,939
What about that?

709
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:54,861
Looks like she defended herself.

710
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:59,303
Defended herself? The woman can
kick the shit out of both of us!

711
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:02,184
-It may have seemed different to you.
-I didn't harass her.

712
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,824
She harassed me.

713
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:06,624
I've never heard of a woman
harassing a man.

714
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:07,933
Why're you here?

715
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,017
-I'm here as your friend.
-My ass, you're my friend.

716
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:15,815
When Garvin finds out about this,
he'll want to throw you out on your ass.

717
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:18,021
Let's keep this quiet.

718
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:22,656
That's what Meredith wants too.
Resolve this quickly and quietly.

719
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,577
Want your wife to find out?

720
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,656
We'll have to tell her at some point.

721
00:44:26,825 --> 00:44:30,454
They'll get the whole thing
and it'll be on the front page of the paper!

722
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,219
I'm offering you a chance
to make a new life.

723
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:36,104
Keep your family out of this mess.
Keep your job.

724
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,896
Obviously, some kind of lateral move.

725
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:43,137
When you say lateral,
you mean out of the division.

726
00:44:43,425 --> 00:44:45,177
You can't stay here.

727
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,939
She's scared out of her wits.

728
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:52,860
I'm not leaving this division.
I spent ten years here. I built this place.

729
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,576
Now, we got a spin-off going on--

730
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:58,015
We're thinking, you know, Austin.

731
00:44:58,665 --> 00:44:59,734
Austin?

732
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:02,460
I told him what she said.

733
00:45:02,665 --> 00:45:04,383
He said the opposite happened.

734
00:45:05,065 --> 00:45:07,101
He said she harassed him.

735
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:09,184
What?

736
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:10,334
He denies it?

737
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:12,860
You know, the man always denies it.

738
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:14,299
Is he crazy?

739
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:16,376
I offered him a move to Austin.

740
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:20,584
To Austin. That's like a duck making
a lateral move to "a Lorange. "

741
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,662
He's too smart for that.

742
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:25,703
Let's hope he's smart enough
to see he has no options.

743
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:27,298
Take care of this.

744
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:31,777
This is a bomb we're sitting on
that can blow everything sky-high.

745
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:36,575
Meredith is key to the merger. I can't
have her involved in a sex scandal.

746
00:45:36,745 --> 00:45:40,215
And I won't say good-bye to $100 million.
You got that?

747
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:42,615
I get the picture, Bob.

748
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,500
Tenth floor. Down the hall and right.

749
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,783
There were no witnesses?

750
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:45,334
Her assistant left earlier in the night.

751
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:49,544
A cleaning lady was outside the office.
I don't know what she heard.

752
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:52,742
-Did you report that to anyone?
-In the morning, yeah.

753
00:47:52,905 --> 00:47:54,941
What was the company's response?

754
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,858
They believed her.
They suggested I transfer to Austin.

755
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,617
I heard they're selling Austin.

756
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:04,256
The point is, if I go to Austin,
I lose everything, all right?

757
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:07,462
My stock options,
everything that I worked for.

758
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,536
Did you call anyone after the incident?

759
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:10,615
No.

760
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:12,377
Did you tell your wife?

761
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:13,500
Oh, boy.

762
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:14,654
Why not?

763
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:19,740
I didn't want to upset her.
I felt guilty being in that situation at all.

764
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:22,664
How would you characterize
Miss Johnson physically?

765
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:26,943
She's very pretty.
She was Miss Teenage New Mexico.

766
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:28,424
So you kissed.

767
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:32,422
Yes. And then she began to...rub me.

768
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:33,859
Rub you where?

769
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:37,384
You know....

770
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,819
Your penis?

771
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:42,180
Yes.

772
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:44,019
And?

773
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:48,815
I'm uncomfortable talking about it.

774
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:52,902
-Because I'm a woman?
-You act like it's a game.

775
00:48:53,065 --> 00:48:56,262
-Why are you here?
-I want to know what my options are.

776
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:57,699
What your options are?

777
00:48:57,865 --> 00:49:01,460
I want to know whether I can sue her
for sexual harassment.

778
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,616
To do that you must convince a jury...

779
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:07,539
...you were alone with Miss Teenage
New Mexico and you said, "no."

780
00:49:08,185 --> 00:49:09,777
Sexual harassment...

781
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:11,936
...is not about sex.

782
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:14,496
It is about power.

783
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:16,019
She has it...

784
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:17,538
...you don't.

785
00:49:17,865 --> 00:49:20,982
If you sue,
you'll never get another job in computers.

786
00:49:21,145 --> 00:49:25,855
If you don't, you'll go to Austin.
Sue, and it's news. Don't sue, it's gossip.

787
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:28,903
If you sue, no one will believe you.
If you don't, your wife won't.

788
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:33,377
They'll make your life hell for the
three years until the case goes to trial.

789
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:38,175
And, for that privilege,
it'll cost you a minimum of $100,000.

790
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:41,624
Do you not think it's a game, Mr. Sanders?

791
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:43,377
It's a game to them.

792
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:45,855
How do you feel about losing?

793
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,617
That's what Meredith wants.

794
00:49:57,785 --> 00:50:01,380
To resolve it, quickly and quietly.

795
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:12,584
They said she's not going
to press charges. Why?

796
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:16,420
She's accused me. Why stop there?
Why not press charges?

797
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:19,463
Meredith didn't press charges...

798
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:21,377
...because she couldn't.

799
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:23,934
DigiCom is planning a merger
with Conley-White.

800
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,414
It is supposed to happen Friday.

801
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:30,100
They think that we are as conservative
as they are.

802
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:34,816
With a scandal, Conley goes to bed with
Katie Couric, wakes up to Jessica Hahn.

803
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:37,135
Garvin is out $100 million.

804
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:40,263
I think we might make a plaintiff
out of this guy yet.

805
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:44,896
No, a potential plaintiff.
I don't have to sue. I just threaten to sue.

806
00:50:45,065 --> 00:50:48,580
That's a dangerous game.
Are you willing to play it?

807
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:49,701
Fuck them.

808
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:51,856
Now you're talking my language.

809
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,619
For the next three days...

810
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:57,858
...this loose cannon is in a position
to apply a lot of pressure.

811
00:50:58,025 --> 00:51:01,540
And they on you, Mr. Sanders.
They on you.

812
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:07,536
Call security.
Throw him out on the sidewalk.

813
00:51:08,305 --> 00:51:11,422
We have to appear to be impartial.

814
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:14,258
Keep him in his job,
keep paying him, no hassles.

815
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:17,616
I made Tom Sanders.
Who the hell is he to sue me?

816
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:19,815
Sexual harassment, under Title Seven.

817
00:51:20,025 --> 00:51:24,382
He'll file with the Human Rights
Commission if we don't fire Meredith.

818
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:28,300
If he files, it becomes public.
It'd blow the deal.

819
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:31,901
We realize that. So does he.
He's blackmailing us.

820
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:34,135
This is America, goddamn it.

821
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:37,502
The legal system is supposed to
protect people like me.

822
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,257
It gets worse.

823
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:41,336
His lawyer is...

824
00:51:41,505 --> 00:51:42,938
...Catherine Alvarez.

825
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:47,860
Great. She'd change her name to
"TV Listings" just to get it in the paper.

826
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:51,421
I'm trying to get them to mediate.
Keep it quiet.

827
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:54,103
Mediate?

828
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:56,500
I want you to cut his balls off.

829
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:59,574
Did he say mediate or split the difference?

830
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:03,340
I'm just hoping he'll agree.
Alvarez will tell him not to.

831
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:06,099
He'll agree.
He doesn't want this public.

832
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:09,183
We pushed him too hard.
He has nothing to lose.

833
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,894
Really? He hasn't told his wife yet.

834
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,019
How do you know?

835
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:17,423
I know Sanders, remember?

836
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,058
He likes secrets.

837
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:29,661
-I'll be in diagnostics.
-Where were you?

838
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:31,543
They're pulling the drives apart.

839
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:33,974
-John Levin called.
-John Levin with Sematach?

840
00:52:34,145 --> 00:52:35,260
He said it's important.

841
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:39,420
-Why didn't they come this morning?
-Susan called about the benefit.

842
00:52:39,585 --> 00:52:42,145
-Call her and say--
-She said don't try to cancel.

843
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:45,980
-The Lewyns paid for the tickets.
-I'll be there at 7:30.

844
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:48,136
Ask her to bring me a shirt and jacket.

845
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:50,459
Is everything okay?

846
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,185
Everything is fine, thanks for asking.

847
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:57,943
I'll kill Arthur.

848
00:52:58,065 --> 00:53:01,774
We must solve this before Friday
and you just got the drives?!

849
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:03,776
What is Arthur doing over there?

850
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:07,102
All he does anymore is give
macadamia nuts to people.

851
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:09,460
Is he a manager or a stewardess?

852
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:13,065
-He gave you nuts?
-What's slowing it down?

853
00:53:13,665 --> 00:53:14,984
Over here.

854
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,738
Let me show you something.

855
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,097
Arthur was right.

856
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:22,177
There's a compatibility problem
with the controller chip.

857
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:23,574
Is it a bug?

858
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:26,737
Don Cherry debugged Arcamax.
There are no bugs.

859
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:28,543
Fabrication problem?

860
00:53:29,225 --> 00:53:30,340
What're you doing?

861
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:34,943
This is a sophisticated piece
of electronics, not a pickup truck.

862
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:38,495
How bad is it? We have 4,000 of these.
Should I junk them all?

863
00:53:39,225 --> 00:53:43,901
I told Arthur to send ten in heat-sealed
plastic bags. It's a hunch I have.

864
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:46,499
Do what you can.
I don't understand it.

865
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:50,783
In prototypes, no problem.
In manufacturing, it falls apart.

866
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:54,335
Mr. Garvin wants to see you.
He said not to tell anyone.

867
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:57,816
Catherine Alvarez on two.

868
00:53:58,145 --> 00:54:00,215
Thanks. Could you close the door?

869
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:14,744
How are you?

870
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:19,098
Let's agree to mediate.
I don't want this getting out either.

871
00:54:33,505 --> 00:54:37,020
If we get this all over in a week,
my wife needn't know.

872
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:47,462
I do not want to tell my wife.
I don't want to upset her if I don't have to.

873
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:05,173
Wait a second.

874
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,498
Guess what?

875
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:26,302
They locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files.

876
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:29,503
I guess it's starting.

877
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,259
Come in.

878
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:36,414
I'm not interrupting?

879
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:38,257
No, not at all.

880
00:55:50,505 --> 00:55:51,904
Going down?

881
00:55:54,345 --> 00:55:56,859
Don't tell me you're scared of me.

882
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:06,943
I don't want it to be this way.

883
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:09,460
Yeah, we could be fucking right now.

884
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:12,423
-I think of you as a friend.
-Oh, come off it!

885
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:13,495
You called Blackburn--

886
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:16,418
Only to beat you to the punch.
I knew you'd play that card.

887
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,623
I wasn't playing a card.
You were the one that--

888
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:21,457
Alarm.

889
00:56:24,705 --> 00:56:26,297
This isn't a game.

890
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:29,975
You'd have a great job,
the spin-off would make you a millionaire.

891
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:32,500
We'd have fun.
It's not like breaking rocks.

892
00:56:32,745 --> 00:56:34,178
You don't get it.

893
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:38,774
Poor Sanders. You have no idea
what you're up against.

894
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:40,539
As usual.

895
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:43,619
By this time tomorrow
you'll wish you took the Austin job.

896
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,174
We'll see.

897
00:56:45,825 --> 00:56:47,224
We'll see.

898
00:56:49,065 --> 00:56:52,660
I'm trying to figure out whether
to get a fat Barbie for Eliza.

899
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:54,815
Mattel makes a fat Barbie?

900
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:57,181
It's called "Happy to Be Me Barbie."

901
00:56:57,345 --> 00:57:00,223
Does she come with the
"Happy to Be Divorced Ken"?

902
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:01,977
I'm serious.

903
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:03,783
Which is more stigmatizing?

904
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:06,175
Yeah, Barbie's stigmatized.

905
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:10,020
It's that whole male,
36-24-36 image of beauty.

906
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:11,857
Women are oppressed.

907
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:13,663
Women are oppressed?!

908
00:57:13,825 --> 00:57:18,501
80%%% of suicides are committed by men.
They're dropping from heart attacks.

909
00:57:18,665 --> 00:57:21,304
-You're not as tough.
-Sorry. We're just fighting the wars.

910
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:23,137
You start the wars.

911
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:26,422
I'm sorry.
I don't have my own crisis hot-line.

912
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:30,579
-You're taking the Meredith thing well.
-That has nothing to do with it.

913
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:33,463
What was today's rumor?
She was once a man?

914
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:34,740
Just tell her.

915
00:57:34,905 --> 00:57:36,179
Tell her what?

916
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:39,223
Tell her a lot of us have worked
as hard as you...

917
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:43,139
...and you're blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up.

918
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:46,100
What happened?

919
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:49,778
Who got to you?

920
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:51,539
It's not that simple.

921
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:56,017
The thought of losing millions happens
to stick right here in my throat.

922
00:57:56,105 --> 00:58:00,098
This was my big shot.
It's not like I'm being scouted by the NBA.

923
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:01,778
What happened?

924
00:58:02,265 --> 00:58:06,338
Who knows? An old girlfriend,
a bottle of wine, a late meeting...

925
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:08,097
-...fill in the blanks.
-Thanks.

926
00:58:08,745 --> 00:58:13,455
You're like women who think they're in
the hotel room, drunk, to watch TV.

927
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:16,185
Could you possibly be more lame?

928
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:19,063
For your information, Mark,
Tom told me everything.

929
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,616
Everything that happened.

930
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:24,096
And I support him 100%%%.

931
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,575
That is so sweet, but I don't think--

932
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:28,178
Let's not discuss it.

933
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:31,056
Let's just enjoy the evening.

934
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,534
Obviously, something happened.

935
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:47,378
Did you have sex?

936
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:50,263
-Think first. Because if you're lying--
-No, I said, no.

937
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:55,135
She kissed me, and she unzipped
my pants, and-and-and-and-and--

938
00:58:55,305 --> 00:58:56,021
And?

939
00:58:56,105 --> 00:58:57,697
And that was it.

940
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:59,458
How did it get that far?

941
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:02,583
-You think I encouraged her?
-Her hand was in your pants?

942
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:04,736
-Nothing happened.
-How did that happen?

943
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:07,294
Then she accuses me
of sexual harassment--

944
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,058
-She harassed you?
-You don't believe me?

945
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:10,738
Mark doesn't believe you.

946
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:13,783
He's got stock options on the brain.
He's back-stabbing.

947
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:16,664
Everybody's sure you're having
an affair with Cindy.

948
00:59:16,825 --> 00:59:20,022
-We're not having an affair.
-How could you let this happen?

949
00:59:20,105 --> 00:59:22,573
-Nothing happened.
-Something happened.

950
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,056
She's an old girlfriend of yours.

951
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:31,014
Like I'm surprised. That club's
as exclusive as the white pages.

952
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:40,181
-I was going to tell you.
-I can't believe everyone knew but me.

953
00:59:40,345 --> 00:59:44,020
-Nobody knows it.
-You're so naive. Of course they know.

954
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:48,583
I'm old-fashioned.
I greet my inferiors with a handshake.

955
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:49,934
I'll handle it.

956
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:51,174
Jesus.

957
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,138
What does she look like?

958
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,423
She's attractive.

959
00:59:57,705 --> 00:59:59,343
One to ten.

960
00:59:59,705 --> 01:00:00,774
Eight.

961
01:00:02,425 --> 01:00:03,380
Nine.

962
01:00:05,705 --> 01:00:07,616
What does the company say?

963
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:10,902
They want me to transfer to Austin,
do some therapy.

964
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,293
Austin?

965
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:13,858
I'm not moving there.

966
01:00:14,025 --> 01:00:15,777
We're not moving to Austin.

967
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:18,062
-I'm pressing charges.
-For what?

968
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:21,222
Sexual harassment.
We have a mediation tomorrow.

969
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:23,336
When were you going to tell me?

970
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:27,220
That's brilliant.
Show up without your wife.

971
01:00:27,465 --> 01:00:30,263
-I'll handle it.
-Are you crazy? They'll destroy you.

972
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:32,985
-It won't go that far.
-It'll take over our life.

973
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:37,457
Depositions and whispering and legal
fees for some damn personal vindication.

974
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:41,777
And all people remember is that
you were involved in something sleazy.

975
01:00:43,225 --> 01:00:44,738
-Do you have a lawyer?
-Catherine Alvarez.

976
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:46,935
Great. When are we on Hard Copy?

977
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:49,376
But if it had happened to you--

978
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,661
You know how many times
it's happened to me?

979
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:54,743
-You never said this ever happened--
-You're so narcissistic.

980
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,941
Nothing happens until
it happens to you.

981
01:00:57,065 --> 01:01:00,501
-You should've said something.
-I do what women always do.

982
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:04,738
I deal with it. Now go in there tomorrow
and work it out.

983
01:01:04,905 --> 01:01:07,373
Right. I should shut up and fuck her.

984
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:09,695
Apologize and get your job back.

985
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:11,384
Apologize?!

986
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:13,456
The children are sleeping.

987
01:01:14,225 --> 01:01:17,695
Wait, I got a better idea.
Why don't I just admit it?

988
01:01:17,865 --> 01:01:22,416
I'll be the evil male you all complain
about. Then I can fuck everybody.

989
01:01:22,585 --> 01:01:23,938
Tom, stop it.

990
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:25,936
Come, I want to dominate you!

991
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:26,901
You're scaring her.

992
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:28,180
I have a urge!

993
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:29,095
The children!

994
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:32,740
My children that I provide for and protect.

995
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:37,263
They can come between me and my wife,
move us, take my job...

996
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:39,376
...and take the house we have made!

997
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:41,854
And I apologize to them, Susan?

998
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:46,260
They call me a rapist and I apologize.
This is a joke.

999
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:50,822
Sexual harassment is about power.

1000
01:01:51,705 --> 01:01:54,173
When did I have the power?

1001
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,100
When?

1002
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,136
Good morning, I'm Judge Murphy.

1003
01:03:04,305 --> 01:03:06,375
This is a mediation.

1004
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:11,255
Our proceedings are confidential.
Maintain a civil and courteous tone.

1005
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:14,223
Our goal is to determine the nature
of the dispute...

1006
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:16,945
...and how best to resolve it.

1007
01:03:17,265 --> 01:03:20,462
The parties have agreed that
Mr. Sanders will speak first...

1008
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,934
...and be cross-examined by Mr. Heller.

1009
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:26,939
Ms. Johnson will speak next,
and be cross-examined by Ms. Alvarez.

1010
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:28,379
Any questions?

1011
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,059
Let's get started.

1012
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:33,661
I had my cellular phone with me,
so when she called Garvin...

1013
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:38,216
...l called Mark Lewyn to give him
the upshot of our meeting.

1014
01:03:38,465 --> 01:03:39,818
Then she approached you?

1015
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:43,580
Correct. She took the phone
from me and she kissed me.

1016
01:03:43,745 --> 01:03:44,461
Where?

1017
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:47,497
She kissed me in my ear...

1018
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:49,340
...on my neck...

1019
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:50,858
...on my mouth.

1020
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:53,335
She put her tongue in my mouth.

1021
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:55,895
When you asked her to stop, did she?

1022
01:03:56,705 --> 01:03:58,218
No, no.

1023
01:03:58,545 --> 01:04:00,376
She unzipped my pants...

1024
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,456
...and massaged my penis.

1025
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:04,536
-Were you aroused?
-Yes.

1026
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:06,139
Then she slid down...

1027
01:04:06,785 --> 01:04:07,820
...and she...

1028
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,817
...put my penis in her mouth.

1029
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:11,498
Did you climax?

1030
01:04:11,905 --> 01:04:15,500
I grabbed her by the wrists.
I threw her on the ground.

1031
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,576
Then I wanted to leave.

1032
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:19,895
Then what did Ms. Johnson do?

1033
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:21,658
She threatened me.

1034
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:23,816
She said, "You're dead."

1035
01:04:24,465 --> 01:04:27,901
And then, the next day,
Mr. Blackburn told me that...

1036
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:31,899
...she said that I had
sexually harassed her.

1037
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:35,581
Mr. Heller?

1038
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:38,703
-Mr. Sanders, would you like a break?
-No, I'm fine.

1039
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:42,380
You say the bottle of wine
was Ms. Johnson's idea?

1040
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,580
Yes.

1041
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:47,420
But when you were living
with Ms. Johnson...

1042
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:51,817
...didn't you discover wines together
on trips to the Napa Valley?

1043
01:04:51,985 --> 01:04:52,940
Yes.

1044
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:54,379
Romantic trips?

1045
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:56,221
Yes.

1046
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:59,821
But you didn't expect any romance
in her office?

1047
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,822
Did you have a conversation
after lunch about how...

1048
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:06,533
...seeing Meredith gave you a...

1049
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:07,900
...boner?

1050
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:10,937
Someone else said that.

1051
01:05:11,105 --> 01:05:13,983
Isn't the term "boner"
a slang for erection?

1052
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:16,296
You had a conversation about...

1053
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:19,335
...having an erection? A boner?

1054
01:05:19,745 --> 01:05:21,303
Yes, but I didn't say it.

1055
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:23,258
But you laughed.

1056
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:24,860
Yes.

1057
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:26,458
So you condone it.

1058
01:05:27,265 --> 01:05:28,857
It was harmless.

1059
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:30,538
If it's harmless...

1060
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,017
...why are we here today?

1061
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:35,496
Well, it was just...

1062
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:37,418
...what guys talk about.

1063
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,018
About their boners?

1064
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:40,858
Not generally, no.

1065
01:05:41,025 --> 01:05:45,496
Yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation...

1066
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:47,656
...you weren't thinking of sex?

1067
01:05:47,825 --> 01:05:48,940
That's correct.

1068
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:54,295
How would you characterize your
prior relationship with Ms. Johnson?

1069
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:55,978
Highly sexual?

1070
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,977
I don't know how to rate it.

1071
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:00,299
Every day?

1072
01:06:00,545 --> 01:06:03,184
Sometimes twice a day.
Sex in public places.

1073
01:06:03,345 --> 01:06:04,300
Sodomy.

1074
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:05,614
Viewing of pornography.

1075
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:08,985
Vibrators and other mechanical devices.

1076
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:13,143
Sometimes we sat on the
couch and watched television.

1077
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:18,380
But when you became reacquainted,
you no longer saw her as a sexual object?

1078
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:20,979
-She was just your boss now?
-That's correct.

1079
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:24,981
And do you admit having an
erection during your meeting?

1080
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:29,623
She had her top open.
It was an involuntary reflex.

1081
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,059
Reflex.

1082
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:36,496
Do you think her gynecologist gets an
erection when he examines her breast?

1083
01:06:36,665 --> 01:06:38,383
That's completely different.

1084
01:06:38,545 --> 01:06:41,105
Do you admit putting
your penis in her mouth?

1085
01:06:41,785 --> 01:06:42,740
She did.

1086
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:44,664
Oh, I forgot.

1087
01:06:45,465 --> 01:06:46,898
You resisted.

1088
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:52,776
Mr. Sanders,
during your rather fantastic testimony...

1089
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:55,982
...there was one moment that rang true.

1090
01:06:56,785 --> 01:06:58,537
You said, and I quote:

1091
01:06:58,705 --> 01:07:00,024
"I was angry.

1092
01:07:00,305 --> 01:07:02,739
"I felt I was being pushed around."

1093
01:07:02,905 --> 01:07:03,701
Correct.

1094
01:07:03,865 --> 01:07:06,220
The truth is, you felt that way all day.

1095
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:10,857
You'd been expecting a promotion and
she got it. You got angry about it.

1096
01:07:11,025 --> 01:07:12,777
I felt I deserved the job.

1097
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,505
You took that anger up to her office.

1098
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:17,417
You'd show her who's boss.

1099
01:07:17,585 --> 01:07:18,734
That's not true.

1100
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:23,218
Did you tell your wife about your
seven o'clock meeting with Ms. Johnson?

1101
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:25,615
I had a meeting and I'd be home late.

1102
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:27,224
You expected to be late?

1103
01:07:27,865 --> 01:07:31,653
No, but if I got home earlier
my wife would be pleasantly surprised.

1104
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:35,024
So you make it a rule to lie to your wife?

1105
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:36,459
I didn't lie.

1106
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:39,503
When you called your wife,
did you tell her that...

1107
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:42,418
...Ms. Johnson was a
former lover of yours?

1108
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,944
When you got home,
did you tell her what happened?

1109
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:49,461
No, I hoped it would go away.

1110
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:52,185
You hoped you'd get away with it?

1111
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:57,143
Do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably.

1112
01:07:57,425 --> 01:07:58,380
That's okay.

1113
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:01,257
I have no further questions.

1114
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:09,100
I asked to see pictures.
I thought if we put it on that basis...

1115
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:12,143
...it would be clear that things
had changed between us.

1116
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:13,784
Do you have those pictures now?

1117
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:16,015
I'd like copies for my file.

1118
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,738
You can continue.

1119
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:23,013
He said his wife hadn't lost all the weight
gained from pregnancy.

1120
01:08:23,185 --> 01:08:24,982
His children were beautiful...

1121
01:08:25,585 --> 01:08:27,177
...but they made him feel old...

1122
01:08:27,345 --> 01:08:31,054
...and seeing me reminded him
of what it was like to be young...

1123
01:08:31,225 --> 01:08:33,455
...and marriage was a tough trade-off.

1124
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:34,580
Go on.

1125
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:38,897
My assistant, Mrs. Ross,
asked if she could go home.

1126
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:41,101
I wanted her to stay, but felt guilty.

1127
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:44,143
I'd kept her late for weeks
preparing for my new job.

1128
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:46,854
And where was Mr. Sanders
at that point?

1129
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:49,300
He began to rub my shoulders.

1130
01:08:51,385 --> 01:08:52,659
And you let him?

1131
01:08:53,585 --> 01:08:55,177
It was awkward...

1132
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:58,542
...but I thought we'd end
the meeting and leave it at that.

1133
01:08:58,705 --> 01:09:00,457
Then he tried to kiss you?

1134
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:04,140
No, Mr. Garvin called and
then I came back to Tom...

1135
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:07,695
...and said that was it,
and then he began to kiss me.

1136
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:09,139
Did you try to stop him?

1137
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:13,776
Yes. I struggled with him
and told him to stop. But he didn't.

1138
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,141
Did he attack you physically?

1139
01:09:20,465 --> 01:09:21,420
Yes.

1140
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,295
He grabbed me by my hair...

1141
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:27,983
...and forced me down on my knees.

1142
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,899
And....

1143
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,104
He put his...

1144
01:09:34,265 --> 01:09:36,017
...penis in your mouth?

1145
01:09:39,665 --> 01:09:41,735
This is making me uncomfortable.

1146
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:43,220
Want some water?

1147
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:52,334
Thank you.

1148
01:09:59,985 --> 01:10:02,704
He put his penis in my mouth...

1149
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:06,265
...and said that he was going to....

1150
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:09,618
To "fuck you"? Were those his words?

1151
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,775
He said, "Do you want to get fucked?"

1152
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:15,539
And then he reached down
and tore off my panties.

1153
01:10:16,785 --> 01:10:18,582
What did you do then?

1154
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:23,222
He threw me down on the scaffold
and I kneed him in the groin.

1155
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,057
And that was the end of it?

1156
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:30,256
It's strange. I'd think my instinct
would be to run, but I became angry.

1157
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:33,940
I yelled at him. Called him names.
Told him I'd kill him.

1158
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,538
Just yelling.

1159
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:37,856
How did he react?

1160
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:42,098
He seemed to realize what he'd done.
He pulled up his pants and left.

1161
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:46,014
Did you call anyone afterwards?

1162
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:48,340
No.

1163
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:50,177
I didn't know what to do.

1164
01:10:51,305 --> 01:10:54,502
I kept going over the day in my
mind trying to figure out...

1165
01:10:54,665 --> 01:10:57,225
...if somehow this thing was my fault.

1166
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,217
You reported it the next day?

1167
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:03,220
Yes.

1168
01:11:04,425 --> 01:11:07,462
But you didn't bring formal charges.
Why not?

1169
01:11:09,305 --> 01:11:10,977
I talked to Phil Blackburn.

1170
01:11:11,145 --> 01:11:13,136
I knew he was Tom's friend.

1171
01:11:13,305 --> 01:11:15,216
I didn't want to destroy...

1172
01:11:15,385 --> 01:11:19,219
...Tom's marriage or career,
but it's clear we couldn't work together.

1173
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:21,456
I would be too scared.

1174
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,776
I'm scared just sitting here.

1175
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:29,618
Nothing further.

1176
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:31,140
Ms. Alvarez.

1177
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:36,180
Ms. Johnson,
I just want to be clear on one thing.

1178
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,861
Mr. Sanders suggested
the bottle of wine?

1179
01:11:40,025 --> 01:11:42,095
-That's right.
-But you bought it.

1180
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:44,904
I sent my assistant Mrs. Ross
out to buy a bottle.

1181
01:11:45,065 --> 01:11:46,498
That afternoon?

1182
01:11:47,065 --> 01:11:48,817
Did you tell her what kind?

1183
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,900
I said to get a nice Chardonnay.
I knew Tom liked white wine.

1184
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:56,819
From those trips to Napa that
he was an amateur connoisseur.

1185
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:58,976
He'd be impressed by a nice bottle.

1186
01:11:59,145 --> 01:12:00,100
Yes.

1187
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:01,857
Do you remember the wine?

1188
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:03,061
No.

1189
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:05,696
The '91 Pahlmeyer?

1190
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:07,940
That's right.

1191
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:10,744
Do you know where your
assistant got that wine?

1192
01:12:11,545 --> 01:12:14,105
I assume she got it at a liquor store.

1193
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:16,097
Would it surprise you to know...

1194
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,382
...that no liquor store in
Seattle carries that bottle?

1195
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:23,137
Mrs. Ross is very resourceful.

1196
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,738
Very resourceful?

1197
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:28,580
A bottle of wine you can't find
within 500 miles of Seattle.

1198
01:12:30,265 --> 01:12:33,143
I have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine.

1199
01:12:33,705 --> 01:12:38,017
Isn't it true, Ms. Johnson,
that you told Mrs. Ross three weeks ago...

1200
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:41,541
...that you wanted
a bottle of '91 Pahlmeyer...

1201
01:12:41,705 --> 01:12:43,297
...for this meeting?

1202
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:44,739
That's not true.

1203
01:12:44,905 --> 01:12:47,624
And when she couldn't find it, you said....

1204
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:51,303
What was that?
It had such managerial brio.

1205
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:52,978
Here it is.

1206
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,853
"If you don't find the wine...

1207
01:12:56,025 --> 01:12:58,016
"...find a replacement."

1208
01:12:58,185 --> 01:13:00,745
Do you have testimony from Mrs. Ross?

1209
01:13:00,905 --> 01:13:02,020
Yes, I do.

1210
01:13:03,785 --> 01:13:04,900
Ms. Johnson?

1211
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:08,741
The fact is Mrs. Ross
has personal problems.

1212
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,657
She has a drinking problem.

1213
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:14,022
She makes up stories to make
herself seem more important.

1214
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,621
I told Mrs. Ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after Tom and I spoke...

1215
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:19,457
...at the luncheon.

1216
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,934
Maybe she had that bottle at home.

1217
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:24,497
Maybe in her wine cellar.

1218
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:28,579
Any more questions?

1219
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:30,417
No, not for now.

1220
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,214
I think this is a good time for a break.

1221
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:40,336
I got some information on Meredith.
You won't believe it, or maybe you will.

1222
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:43,304
Alan gave me a list,
we can't verify any of this.

1223
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:45,933
-You said you didn't have sex.
-I didn't.

1224
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:47,857
I didn't have sex with her.

1225
01:13:48,025 --> 01:13:50,664
What is it, Tom?
She's trying to quit smoking?

1226
01:13:50,785 --> 01:13:52,901
-It's true.
-How could you do this?

1227
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:54,623
She did it. That's the point.

1228
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:56,417
You saw this woman alone.

1229
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,663
You had wine, a back rub, you kissed.
And then this non-sex sex thing.

1230
01:14:00,825 --> 01:14:03,214
You took off her panties.
Those are facts.

1231
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:04,420
So what?

1232
01:14:04,585 --> 01:14:08,260
-That doesn't happen unless you want it.
-I was cornered.

1233
01:14:08,425 --> 01:14:10,461
-You let it happen!
-I did not!

1234
01:14:10,665 --> 01:14:14,021
How could you? How could you
let that woman into our lives?

1235
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:16,419
Get this.

1236
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:20,737
Ten of her subordinates transferred
in the last five years. All men.

1237
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:21,974
What a red flag!

1238
01:14:22,185 --> 01:14:23,140
Can you see them?

1239
01:14:23,545 --> 01:14:27,379
Yeah, but no one will talk and we can't
subpoena them just for a mediation.

1240
01:14:30,105 --> 01:14:33,017
-Do you want to have lunch?
-I must go back to work.

1241
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:37,255
How about you? Are you hungry?

1242
01:14:41,305 --> 01:14:42,977
How are you holding up?

1243
01:14:43,385 --> 01:14:44,738
Are you married?

1244
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:46,816
Chandler, Hogue and Alvarez.

1245
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,539
-I married Chandler.
-You married your boss?

1246
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:53,539
Classic case of sexual harassment. He
asked me out five times before I said yes.

1247
01:14:53,665 --> 01:14:57,135
Today, if I had said no once,
he would have been afraid to ask again.

1248
01:14:58,105 --> 01:14:59,777
Tom said you're a lawyer.

1249
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:01,224
Ten years.

1250
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:05,133
-Let's switch hats. What do you think?
-I don't look good in hats.

1251
01:15:05,545 --> 01:15:07,854
You're afraid she's telling the truth.

1252
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:10,180
Yes.

1253
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:13,624
What he did, he did out of weakness.

1254
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:15,736
Hardly makes it better, does it?

1255
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:19,859
I can't get in the middle
of your relationship with Tom...

1256
01:15:20,025 --> 01:15:23,904
...but she did break the law
and that makes the difference.

1257
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:28,815
Ms. Alvarez, 48 hrs ago, my husband's
penis was in another woman's mouth.

1258
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:32,660
There's nothing in the law
that'll help me deal with that.

1259
01:15:37,545 --> 01:15:39,137
When did these arrive?

1260
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,062
Came in an hour ago.

1261
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:46,735
Garvin had me send the Corridor
to the hotel for the Conley people to use.

1262
01:15:47,065 --> 01:15:48,100
It's at the hotel?

1263
01:15:48,265 --> 01:15:51,462
Yeah. The Conley people had
such fun with it yesterday....

1264
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:54,264
Getting anywhere with the drives?
I'm counting on you.

1265
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,541
-I have a hunch.
-What is it?

1266
01:15:56,745 --> 01:15:58,417
-I don't know.
-What is it?

1267
01:15:58,585 --> 01:16:00,018
I don't know.

1268
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,336
She got to you, didn't she?

1269
01:16:05,945 --> 01:16:10,177
What else? They're stronger,
they're smarter and they don't fight fair.

1270
01:16:10,345 --> 01:16:12,984
It's the next step in the human evolution.

1271
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:15,739
Keep some of us for sperm
and kill the rest.

1272
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:16,980
What do you have?

1273
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:22,454
If I know something for a fact,
I won't withhold it.

1274
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:25,782
But I can't go out on a limb,
it's too intense around here.

1275
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:31,581
I'm 23. I can't wake up tomorrow and
find I'm out of the computer business.

1276
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:41,463
Why aren't you at the mediation?

1277
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:45,982
I just came back to.... This was
the last thing I needed this week.

1278
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,140
Come in.

1279
01:16:50,025 --> 01:16:52,016
Something's come up.

1280
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:55,097
I need to know exactly
what happened that night.

1281
01:16:55,305 --> 01:16:57,865
Well, it's exactly like I told Phil.

1282
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:00,376
You're not talking to Phil.

1283
01:17:01,745 --> 01:17:06,500
We have Sanders' phone records.
It's possible someone overheard you two.

1284
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:17,897
John Levin called again.

1285
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:20,301
Find out what it's about.

1286
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:22,695
He must talk to you personally.

1287
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:25,577
I don't want to talk to him now.

1288
01:17:27,745 --> 01:17:29,098
Can I talk to you?

1289
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,694
Cindy...

1290
01:17:34,385 --> 01:17:35,898
...are you "a friend"?

1291
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:39,454
A friend?

1292
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:41,574
You know...

1293
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:44,141
..."a friend." A friend.

1294
01:17:45,105 --> 01:17:47,824
I depends on what you mean
by "a friend."

1295
01:17:51,945 --> 01:17:53,173
All right, never mind.

1296
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:28,134
He's heading for the elevator.

1297
01:18:44,145 --> 01:18:46,215
Heading back to the mediation?

1298
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:49,058
-Yeah, I must get back.
-I'll give you a lift.

1299
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:52,945
Don't you think it's time we talked?

1300
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:04,415
I understand you both had
a chance to get it off your chest.

1301
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:07,304
Your version of what happened.
Now I want it to stop.

1302
01:19:07,465 --> 01:19:10,184
What I got off my chest
was not a version.

1303
01:19:10,465 --> 01:19:14,219
It's always a version.
That's the legacy of the modern age.

1304
01:19:14,385 --> 01:19:18,537
We have information but no truth.
Flashes of electrons in a grain of sand.

1305
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:20,263
I'm telling the truth.

1306
01:19:20,785 --> 01:19:24,095
-You must look at this from all sides.
-How many sides are there?

1307
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:28,097
All right, let's say she made a mistake.
So what?

1308
01:19:28,225 --> 01:19:30,341
She made a pass, that's all.

1309
01:19:30,505 --> 01:19:33,895
You could have decided it was flattering.

1310
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:37,899
You could have handled it many ways,
but this vindictiveness...

1311
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,623
...l must say, I'm surprised.

1312
01:19:39,745 --> 01:19:41,542
It's against the law.

1313
01:19:41,665 --> 01:19:42,984
I work for her.
I'm employed by her.

1314
01:19:43,465 --> 01:19:44,784
No. You work for me.

1315
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:46,822
That's what I'm saying.

1316
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:51,655
After all these years, why didn't you
come to me? Not hire this lawyer!

1317
01:19:51,825 --> 01:19:53,099
Maybe I should have.

1318
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:55,825
I mean, why can't you just forget it?

1319
01:19:55,985 --> 01:19:59,614
Work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money.

1320
01:19:59,785 --> 01:20:02,174
-What's wrong with that?
-It's gone too far.

1321
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:04,296
Things can go back.

1322
01:20:05,705 --> 01:20:07,696
Why would he offer to settle now?

1323
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:10,015
He realized how much they got to lose.

1324
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,096
No, it doesn't add up.

1325
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:15,302
Maybe there's a vulnerability
we don't know about.

1326
01:20:16,105 --> 01:20:20,257
I'm still getting messages
from "a friend". I printed out the address.

1327
01:20:20,425 --> 01:20:22,416
Maybe you can check it out.

1328
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:27,299
I hope DigiCom doesn't find him first.
Remember the cleaning lady?

1329
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:30,741
She's out of town. No one knows
where or when she's coming back.

1330
01:20:30,985 --> 01:20:34,102
The Bahamas, probably,
with Mrs. Ross soon to join her.

1331
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:36,256
These guys play hardball.

1332
01:21:24,585 --> 01:21:28,897
Did Mr. Sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

1333
01:21:29,065 --> 01:21:30,498
He's not aware of it.

1334
01:21:30,665 --> 01:21:32,735
Just answer the question, please.

1335
01:21:33,465 --> 01:21:34,341
Yes.

1336
01:21:34,505 --> 01:21:35,620
How?

1337
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:38,741
He'll pat me on my behind or...

1338
01:21:38,905 --> 01:21:40,577
...rub my shoulders.

1339
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:42,019
Rub your shoulders?

1340
01:21:42,505 --> 01:21:44,575
I don't think he means anything by it.

1341
01:21:44,745 --> 01:21:45,939
You don't like it.

1342
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,975
I just feel it's inappropriate.

1343
01:21:49,305 --> 01:21:51,136
I don't see the relevance of this.

1344
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:54,024
We're trying to establish
a pattern of behavior.

1345
01:21:54,185 --> 01:21:57,063
Sexual harassers generally
follow a pattern.

1346
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:58,414
I'll allow it.

1347
01:22:00,225 --> 01:22:02,136
Do you have chiropractic problems?

1348
01:22:02,425 --> 01:22:05,383
Any neck problems, or your back?

1349
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:06,500
No.

1350
01:22:06,745 --> 01:22:10,420
So you would characterize
this behavior as flirting...

1351
01:22:10,665 --> 01:22:11,859
...or sexual?

1352
01:22:13,465 --> 01:22:16,059
-I suppose so.
-But you never said anything.

1353
01:22:16,425 --> 01:22:17,494
He's my boss.

1354
01:22:17,865 --> 01:22:19,218
You didn't report it?

1355
01:22:20,665 --> 01:22:22,656
He's your boss. I understand.

1356
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:24,975
Your job is at stake. Rumors.

1357
01:22:25,185 --> 01:22:27,096
Whether people would believe you.

1358
01:22:27,385 --> 01:22:32,095
And if I ask you if you ever had any
sexual relations with Mr. Sanders...

1359
01:22:32,265 --> 01:22:33,380
...same answer?

1360
01:22:34,305 --> 01:22:35,294
No, I didn't.

1361
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:36,500
Didn't report it?

1362
01:22:37,105 --> 01:22:39,494
-It never happened.
-I understand.

1363
01:22:39,905 --> 01:22:41,736
I have no more questions.

1364
01:22:42,865 --> 01:22:44,059
Barbara called...

1365
01:22:44,265 --> 01:22:47,337
-...about the Disneyland tickets for...?
-Jafar.

1366
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:50,861
He's got the tickets
and an upgrade at the hotel.

1367
01:22:51,025 --> 01:22:52,856
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1368
01:22:54,865 --> 01:22:56,139
They gave me your photos.

1369
01:23:00,705 --> 01:23:01,979
I'll see you later?

1370
01:23:02,225 --> 01:23:03,578
Yes, I'll see you later.

1371
01:23:42,145 --> 01:23:43,021
You know...

1372
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:46,063
...it's funny how you always
assumed you'd get the job.

1373
01:23:46,225 --> 01:23:48,295
Lewyn assumed it would be him or you.

1374
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:53,018
But nobody ever thought for a second
it might be me.

1375
01:23:53,185 --> 01:23:54,459
Isn't that funny?

1376
01:23:56,305 --> 01:23:58,296
That's not true. You were on the list.

1377
01:23:58,465 --> 01:23:59,500
Really?

1378
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:03,499
Let me guess: "Hunter,
not someone you'd follow into battle.

1379
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,465
"A team player. No killer instinct.

1380
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,456
"Doesn't have those tools."

1381
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,536
What is that all a code for?

1382
01:24:10,705 --> 01:24:12,696
What, you on Meredith's side?

1383
01:24:14,785 --> 01:24:17,663
I studied engineering for eight years.

1384
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:21,340
I was the only woman in the department.
You know what I did?

1385
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,384
I worked.
You think I'm on Meredith's side?

1386
01:24:28,945 --> 01:24:30,617
What do you want to do?

1387
01:24:31,585 --> 01:24:32,540
What?

1388
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:37,098
Their offer ends midnight. It's what
Garvin said. You get your job back.

1389
01:24:37,265 --> 01:24:40,940
She's your boss.
Everyone goes back to work.

1390
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,899
Did you find "a friend"?

1391
01:24:44,065 --> 01:24:45,896
Did we get the address?

1392
01:24:46,065 --> 01:24:50,058
Dr. Arthur Friend, a chemistry professor
from the University of Washington...

1393
01:24:50,225 --> 01:24:52,944
...who's been in Nepal
the last three weeks.

1394
01:24:53,105 --> 01:24:55,335
You got messages from a locked office.

1395
01:24:56,145 --> 01:24:58,295
I'm glad we got that one solved.

1396
01:24:58,785 --> 01:25:00,855
Shit, I have to call Lewyn.

1397
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:04,303
The drives we're having
problems with came in.

1398
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:05,739
Only you.

1399
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:10,857
Anyone else would be sabotaging
the company, not solving their problems.

1400
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:12,458
It's Adele and Mark.

1401
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,981
We're not home, leave a message
and we'll call you back.

1402
01:25:18,865 --> 01:25:19,661
What?

1403
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:25,175
Mark's wife's voice is on the machine,
but on Monday it was a man's voice.

1404
01:25:26,385 --> 01:25:29,422
Then the next day Mark said
he never got the message.

1405
01:25:35,185 --> 01:25:37,415
I dialed the wrong number that night.

1406
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:39,420
So?

1407
01:25:42,145 --> 01:25:44,375
That's why the battery was dead.

1408
01:25:44,545 --> 01:25:46,376
What are you talking about?

1409
01:25:51,905 --> 01:25:55,181
That's why Garvin wants to deal.
He's got my phone records.

1410
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:58,622
I've got a ten minute phone bill
while I'm in Meredith's office.

1411
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:02,380
She took the phone away.
I called the wrong number...

1412
01:26:02,545 --> 01:26:05,742
...but I never hung up the phone.
The phone line is open.

1413
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:10,304
Somebody's got this whole
thing on an answering machine.

1414
01:26:18,865 --> 01:26:21,015
It's Levin, not Lewyn.

1415
01:26:22,785 --> 01:26:23,900
What's going on?

1416
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:27,899
I've been getting phone calls.
Some creep has my Visa...

1417
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:31,660
...then, at the office,
everything's turned upside down.

1418
01:26:31,825 --> 01:26:33,338
Have they got the tape?

1419
01:26:33,505 --> 01:26:36,622
What I'm saying is,
it's good I brought it home.

1420
01:26:36,785 --> 01:26:40,061
-My girlfriend and I listened to it.
-Where's the tape?

1421
01:26:42,545 --> 01:26:43,819
It's all here?

1422
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:48,540
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all week!

1423
01:26:48,705 --> 01:26:50,218
You know what this means?

1424
01:26:50,545 --> 01:26:53,105
Do you have any idea what this means?

1425
01:26:53,665 --> 01:26:55,098
Thanks, pal.

1426
01:27:06,865 --> 01:27:09,254
No deal. No, no deal, Catherine.

1427
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:12,622
We're going to bury them.
Everything is on tape.

1428
01:27:12,945 --> 01:27:14,537
Yes, everything.

1429
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:46,854
Put it in.

1430
01:27:51,185 --> 01:27:52,777
God, look at us.

1431
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:54,983
Go inside me.

1432
01:27:56,865 --> 01:27:57,900
I can't do this.

1433
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,737
-Do it.
-I won't.

1434
01:27:59,825 --> 01:28:01,861
Now! Come on, now!

1435
01:28:02,505 --> 01:28:04,894
You can't just stop! You can't!

1436
01:28:05,265 --> 01:28:06,539
No! Goddamn it!

1437
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:20,100
You stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality?

1438
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,742
This never happened.

1439
01:28:25,745 --> 01:28:27,656
You never used to be this way.

1440
01:28:29,985 --> 01:28:33,375
In any judicial proceeding,
this tape would be inadmissible.

1441
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:37,424
I'm worried I'm going to drive to work
and hear it on Howard Stern.

1442
01:28:37,665 --> 01:28:38,700
Is she threatening?

1443
01:28:38,865 --> 01:28:41,538
I don't know how many copies
of this tape there are.

1444
01:28:41,705 --> 01:28:43,935
I didn't put it out there.

1445
01:28:44,905 --> 01:28:48,580
This tape just shows consensual
sex between adults...

1446
01:28:49,265 --> 01:28:51,825
...however it may have
appeared the next day.

1447
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:54,943
Mr. Sanders' regret
is not my client's harassment.

1448
01:28:55,305 --> 01:28:57,819
Ms. Johnson,
is that your position today?

1449
01:28:58,305 --> 01:28:59,260
Yes, it is.

1450
01:29:00,225 --> 01:29:01,260
Ms. Alvarez?

1451
01:29:01,705 --> 01:29:05,254
Just so I'm clear on what today's story is...

1452
01:29:05,505 --> 01:29:08,463
...would you define for me
"consensual sex."

1453
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:11,617
Sex where both parties
are willing participants.

1454
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:15,096
How many times did we hear
Mr. Sanders say "no"?

1455
01:29:15,665 --> 01:29:18,975
I don't know, I was busy listening
to my panties being torn off.

1456
01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:20,374
31 .

1457
01:29:20,465 --> 01:29:21,898
31 times.

1458
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,737
Doesn't "no" mean "no"?

1459
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:28,577
Sometimes "no" means that person
wants to be overwhelmed, dominated.

1460
01:29:28,745 --> 01:29:32,943
The way we're supposed to have sex
nowadays we'd need UN supervision.

1461
01:29:33,105 --> 01:29:34,823
"No" means "no."

1462
01:29:35,305 --> 01:29:37,261
Isn't that what we tell women?

1463
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,576
Do men deserve less?

1464
01:29:40,425 --> 01:29:43,974
When he really wanted to stop
he had no problems doing it.

1465
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,419
And you got angry.

1466
01:29:45,585 --> 01:29:47,496
Of course I did. Anyone would.

1467
01:29:47,745 --> 01:29:50,134
We tell women they can stop at any point.

1468
01:29:50,225 --> 01:29:52,739
Haven't you ever said
"no" and meant "yes"?

1469
01:29:52,905 --> 01:29:55,100
Until the moment of penetration--

1470
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,063
He was willing.
That tape doesn't change anything.

1471
01:29:58,305 --> 01:30:02,935
You controlled the meeting.
You set the time, you ordered the wine.

1472
01:30:03,105 --> 01:30:06,939
You demanded service and got
angry when he didn't provide it.

1473
01:30:07,105 --> 01:30:11,257
So you decided to get rid of him
with this trumped-up charge.

1474
01:30:11,425 --> 01:30:15,179
The only thing you have proven
is that a woman in power...

1475
01:30:15,345 --> 01:30:17,984
...can be every bit as abusive as a man.

1476
01:30:18,145 --> 01:30:21,660
You want to put me on trial?
Let's be honest about why.

1477
01:30:21,825 --> 01:30:24,214
I am sexually aggressive. I like it.

1478
01:30:24,305 --> 01:30:26,375
Tom knew it and you can't handle it.

1479
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,185
It's the same thing since
the beginning of time.

1480
01:30:29,345 --> 01:30:32,382
Veil it, hide it, lock it up
and throw away the key.

1481
01:30:32,465 --> 01:30:35,104
We expect a woman to do a man's
job, make a man's money...

1482
01:30:35,265 --> 01:30:39,099
...then lie down for a man to fuck
her like it was 100 years ago!

1483
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:40,777
Well, no, thank you.

1484
01:30:47,345 --> 01:30:52,055
You won't believe this. I think
the Howard Stern thing got to them.

1485
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:54,455
-What did Phil say?
-You get your job back.

1486
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,981
You get $100,000 in pain and suffering,
and I get fees and expenses.

1487
01:30:58,545 --> 01:30:59,341
Meredith?

1488
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:01,973
She stays through the merger,
then they say...

1489
01:31:02,145 --> 01:31:06,058
...she has to leave for some
whatever emergency. She's out.

1490
01:31:06,225 --> 01:31:08,864
This is total and complete vindication.

1491
01:31:09,825 --> 01:31:11,258
It's over!

1492
01:31:17,825 --> 01:31:21,898
I almost feel sorry for him.
He has no idea, does he?

1493
01:31:30,145 --> 01:31:34,616
I'd like to read this over again before
we sign. Not that I don't trust you.

1494
01:31:34,785 --> 01:31:37,663
Just as long as it's done
by midnight tonight.

1495
01:31:37,745 --> 01:31:40,134
Garvin wants this off his screen.

1496
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:46,064
We want you to make
a presentation on Arcamax...

1497
01:31:46,305 --> 01:31:48,694
...at the merger announcement
tomorrow.

1498
01:31:48,865 --> 01:31:50,776
Nothing technical, four minutes.

1499
01:31:50,945 --> 01:31:51,900
Fine.

1500
01:31:52,065 --> 01:31:53,020
Great.

1501
01:31:53,345 --> 01:31:57,099
Now I've got to go break it to her.
It won't be easy.

1502
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,813
I thought you enjoyed
that kind of thing.

1503
01:31:59,985 --> 01:32:03,261
You go after one of our people,
we'll put the wagons in a circle.

1504
01:32:03,425 --> 01:32:07,213
Once you made your case,
the company behaved appropriately.

1505
01:32:07,385 --> 01:32:08,340
Right?

1506
01:32:08,505 --> 01:32:10,973
-You don't want to know what I think.
-It's terrible.

1507
01:32:11,145 --> 01:32:13,784
Way a thing like this can...

1508
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,458
...tear a company apart.

1509
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:18,822
I told Bob we really need
to take a look at it.

1510
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:21,300
Friends?

1511
01:32:24,025 --> 01:32:24,901
What?

1512
01:32:25,225 --> 01:32:28,262
I hope you still think of me as a friend.

1513
01:32:30,025 --> 01:32:31,299
Good night, Phil.

1514
01:32:34,745 --> 01:32:36,895
Sign it now and I'll read it later.

1515
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,899
Where will you be?

1516
01:32:39,065 --> 01:32:41,454
Here, working on the presentation.

1517
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,981
If not, I'll have somebody
run this by your house later.

1518
01:32:52,265 --> 01:32:53,937
Let me ask you something.

1519
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:56,098
Why'd she do this?

1520
01:32:56,505 --> 01:33:00,259
You've seen her in action.
She's cool, smart and in control.

1521
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:03,542
-How'd she lose control like this?
-I don't know.

1522
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:05,776
You're attractive. Maybe.

1523
01:33:05,945 --> 01:33:09,699
-But not irresistible.
-I'm serious. She's here one day.

1524
01:33:09,865 --> 01:33:12,823
There's a merger going on.
Conley people are touchy.

1525
01:33:12,985 --> 01:33:14,498
She thought you'd go along.

1526
01:33:14,665 --> 01:33:16,576
-There's more to it than that.
-Come on.

1527
01:33:16,745 --> 01:33:19,464
You think too much.
You need to go home...

1528
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,934
...open a nice bottle of champagne...

1529
01:33:22,105 --> 01:33:25,142
...make up with your wife
and get some sleep.

1530
01:33:25,305 --> 01:33:26,658
It's over.

1531
01:33:29,185 --> 01:33:30,413
Thank you.

1532
01:33:30,545 --> 01:33:32,820
Absolutely. You're welcome.

1533
01:33:33,345 --> 01:33:34,460
Good night.

1534
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:35,694
Good night.

1535
01:34:03,905 --> 01:34:05,099
Hi, Stephanie.

1536
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:08,940
Must be difficult,
nobody giving you information.

1537
01:34:09,105 --> 01:34:10,458
It's been a crazy week.

1538
01:34:11,025 --> 01:34:14,859
I had a friend. She was one
of the first women to move high up.

1539
01:34:15,185 --> 01:34:18,621
You know what it's like,
every day putting out fires.

1540
01:34:18,905 --> 01:34:21,419
It turned out the job
wasn't what she thought.

1541
01:34:21,585 --> 01:34:24,304
She was looking the wrong
way when they fired her.

1542
01:34:25,145 --> 01:34:26,373
Interesting.

1543
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:29,503
Truth usually is, once you get to it.

1544
01:34:46,745 --> 01:34:47,973
It's you.

1545
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:49,260
Where is everyone?

1546
01:34:49,425 --> 01:34:53,020
Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago.
Said they were working too hard.

1547
01:34:53,185 --> 01:34:54,618
Sent everyone home.

1548
01:35:52,785 --> 01:35:55,174
-What if Sanders doesn't bring it up?
-He will.

1549
01:35:55,385 --> 01:35:58,263
I talked to him about his
presentation on Arcamax.

1550
01:35:58,385 --> 01:35:59,818
He has no idea.

1551
01:35:59,985 --> 01:36:01,623
When he brings up the line....

1552
01:36:01,745 --> 01:36:04,384
You must pounce because we
don't have the harassment.

1553
01:36:04,545 --> 01:36:07,423
It must be that Sanders is incompetent.

1554
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:11,093
It'll be in public. With reporters.

1555
01:36:11,425 --> 01:36:13,143
Bob's counting on you.

1556
01:36:13,425 --> 01:36:15,655
Let's clean out the database.

1557
01:36:15,825 --> 01:36:17,099
And any backup.

1558
01:36:22,865 --> 01:36:25,425
Catherine, can you hold on one minute?

1559
01:36:31,745 --> 01:36:34,259
Has my contract gone out already?

1560
01:36:34,345 --> 01:36:35,698
Shit.

1561
01:36:36,225 --> 01:36:38,614
What does it say about firing me?

1562
01:36:38,785 --> 01:36:41,697
They can fire me for cause,
can't they? For incompetence?

1563
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:46,504
The problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design.

1564
01:36:46,745 --> 01:36:50,181
It's with the production line
and that's my responsibility.

1565
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:52,263
This whole thing tomorrow...

1566
01:36:52,585 --> 01:36:54,416
...they're setting me up.

1567
01:38:02,465 --> 01:38:04,376
Housekeeping, please.

1568
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:07,742
This is Mr. Conley.

1569
01:38:07,905 --> 01:38:10,465
Could someone come
and turn down my bed?

1570
01:38:10,945 --> 01:38:14,460
My room number?
It's on the phone here somewhere....

1571
01:38:15,785 --> 01:38:16,979
That's right.

1572
01:38:17,065 --> 01:38:18,783
Thank you very much.

1573
01:38:25,225 --> 01:38:29,343
-When does your dad arrive?
-Midnight. They stopped in Houston.

1574
01:38:29,505 --> 01:38:32,224
I'd love for him to get a chance
to see the Corridor.

1575
01:38:32,705 --> 01:38:33,774
You know...

1576
01:38:34,145 --> 01:38:38,457
...l stayed up late last night,
fooling around with it up in my room.

1577
01:38:38,825 --> 01:38:40,258
It's really incredible.

1578
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:48,177
I'm sorry, sir.

1579
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:49,698
Here, thank you.

1580
01:38:49,865 --> 01:38:51,264
-You're welcome.
-Good night.

1581
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:52,983
Have a nice evening.

1582
01:40:07,385 --> 01:40:11,298
You're in the Corridor, our prototype
for a virtual reality database.

1583
01:40:11,465 --> 01:40:13,376
Enjoy the demonstration.

1584
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:18,301
Information accessed during this demo
is for entertainment value only...

1585
01:40:18,465 --> 01:40:21,502
...and should not be duplicated
to another database.

1586
01:40:21,665 --> 01:40:24,896
If you have any questions,
ask the angel.

1587
01:41:14,345 --> 01:41:16,734
Malaysian Operations.

1588
01:41:54,265 --> 01:41:57,462
Searching Malaysian revisions file.

1589
01:41:58,105 --> 01:42:00,414
Why don't we go up to my suite?

1590
01:42:01,465 --> 01:42:04,343
Give my colleagues a chance
to try out the Corridor.

1591
01:42:05,145 --> 01:42:06,578
Good idea.

1592
01:42:32,665 --> 01:42:35,941
"Reduction of air handling capacity
from number 7 air handlers...

1593
01:42:36,185 --> 01:42:39,063
"...to a more appropriate
and cost-effective number 5."

1594
01:42:39,385 --> 01:42:43,697
You can't put number 5 handlers in there.
You'll have dirt in everything.

1595
01:42:46,745 --> 01:42:48,656
My God, she's in the system.

1596
01:43:06,505 --> 01:43:08,302
Angel, I need help.

1597
01:43:10,425 --> 01:43:11,653
Help is here.

1598
01:43:12,265 --> 01:43:14,904
Can I stop files from being deleted?

1599
01:43:15,065 --> 01:43:17,056
I'm sorry. You're not Level 5.

1600
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:24,345
You're supposed to protect the files.

1601
01:43:24,505 --> 01:43:27,303
Sysop controls are restricted to Level 5.

1602
01:43:46,905 --> 01:43:49,294
Show me all communications
with Malaysia.

1603
01:43:49,585 --> 01:43:51,223
Telephone or video?

1604
01:43:51,545 --> 01:43:52,739
Video.

1605
01:44:04,265 --> 01:44:08,019
Show me the last transmission
involving Meredith.

1606
01:44:14,105 --> 01:44:17,939
Sooner or later, Tom will figure out
the changes at the plant.

1607
01:44:18,105 --> 01:44:19,140
He's not stupid.

1608
01:44:19,345 --> 01:44:21,859
Tom will be out of the picture
by Tuesday.

1609
01:44:22,345 --> 01:44:26,099
I don't like to gamble.
I love Tahoe, but I think the risk--

1610
01:44:26,265 --> 01:44:29,701
Think. Who'll believe him?
He's married, with a family.

1611
01:44:29,905 --> 01:44:32,817
He'll have no choice but to take
the settlement and leave.

1612
01:44:32,985 --> 01:44:36,739
Then we say Sanders made the changes
at the plant? He'll deny it.

1613
01:44:36,905 --> 01:44:39,499
He won't know.
He'll be gone by then.

1614
01:45:01,305 --> 01:45:03,865
These things are so darn complicated.

1615
01:45:07,345 --> 01:45:08,778
I think it's upside down.

1616
01:45:20,185 --> 01:45:21,459
There we go.

1617
01:45:32,985 --> 01:45:33,940
Who's first?

1618
01:45:34,505 --> 01:45:36,496
Must have left the system on.

1619
01:45:38,585 --> 01:45:40,735
Give it a try. You'll love it.

1620
01:45:40,945 --> 01:45:42,742
I'd love to try it.

1621
01:45:51,865 --> 01:45:53,901
I am totally screwed.

1622
01:45:54,745 --> 01:45:56,576
I'll make my presentation...

1623
01:45:56,785 --> 01:45:59,219
...Meredith will ask me questions.

1624
01:45:59,385 --> 01:46:01,455
She'll make me look totally incompetent.

1625
01:46:01,625 --> 01:46:04,344
Are you sure there's not
another system somewhere?

1626
01:46:04,505 --> 01:46:07,065
The system has been completely deleted.

1627
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:08,897
So I'm a sitting duck.

1628
01:46:09,385 --> 01:46:12,900
I'll be walking around like
a ghost with a resume.

1629
01:46:36,425 --> 01:46:37,699
It's Mohammed Jafar.

1630
01:46:37,865 --> 01:46:39,139
How are you?

1631
01:46:39,305 --> 01:46:42,741
I don't mean to bug you,
but we're departing Monday--

1632
01:46:42,905 --> 01:46:47,057
It's my fault. Susan got the
Disneyland tickets for you.

1633
01:46:47,305 --> 01:46:48,340
The E-tickets?

1634
01:46:48,505 --> 01:46:52,464
You're comped for all the rides
and at the hotel they'll upgrade you.

1635
01:46:52,585 --> 01:46:55,053
Magnificent. I can't wait to tell my wife.

1636
01:46:55,225 --> 01:46:58,740
She said you were full of shit.
You know how women are.

1637
01:46:58,905 --> 01:47:00,736
Yes, I sure do.

1638
01:47:01,145 --> 01:47:02,897
I miss your face.

1639
01:47:03,145 --> 01:47:06,979
Talk to Arthur. He sees it enough
on the DVL. I'm always--

1640
01:47:12,145 --> 01:47:13,464
Tom, are you there?

1641
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:17,903
Mohammed, on this end,
we back up our files on DAT.

1642
01:47:17,985 --> 01:47:20,180
Do you do the same over there?

1643
01:47:20,505 --> 01:47:22,302
I don't know what we have.

1644
01:47:23,065 --> 01:47:25,454
I'd have to check it out. Why?

1645
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:29,300
I got a real problem here.
I'm up against the wall and...

1646
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:32,818
...l need you to do some
things for me, Mohammed.

1647
01:47:33,985 --> 01:47:36,180
I hope we have what you need, Tom.

1648
01:48:04,465 --> 01:48:05,500
Daddy?

1649
01:48:06,385 --> 01:48:08,774
I never believed what they said about you.

1650
01:48:14,065 --> 01:48:15,498
Thank you, honey.

1651
01:48:16,545 --> 01:48:18,376
Come here, big guy.

1652
01:48:26,785 --> 01:48:28,059
Thank you.

1653
01:48:43,905 --> 01:48:45,258
Those from Malaysia?

1654
01:48:45,745 --> 01:48:48,657
I can't believe it's still coming out.
It started at seven.

1655
01:49:09,945 --> 01:49:11,173
Testing.

1656
01:49:28,705 --> 01:49:30,582
Put these in one of the files.

1657
01:49:55,225 --> 01:49:57,785
Yeah, there's a real talent to fishing.

1658
01:49:59,185 --> 01:50:01,574
First you must choose the right bait...

1659
01:50:01,665 --> 01:50:04,054
...then you must know when to reel it in.

1660
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:07,220
About the other day, I didn't mean....

1661
01:50:07,385 --> 01:50:08,500
Yes, you did.

1662
01:50:09,265 --> 01:50:11,381
I apologize, and...

1663
01:50:11,545 --> 01:50:12,660
...thank you.

1664
01:50:13,945 --> 01:50:15,219
I accept.

1665
01:50:22,465 --> 01:50:25,104
Which brings us to our
Advanced Products Group.

1666
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:27,858
Tom Sanders heads our
manufacturing department.

1667
01:50:28,025 --> 01:50:29,777
Tom, can you come up here...

1668
01:50:29,945 --> 01:50:33,938
...and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call Arcamax?

1669
01:50:42,105 --> 01:50:43,823
Thank you, Meredith.

1670
01:50:46,585 --> 01:50:50,294
Arcamax is our own stand-alone
CD-ROM drive player.

1671
01:50:50,905 --> 01:50:54,454
Now, for a CD-ROM drive to be effective,
it must be portable...

1672
01:50:54,745 --> 01:50:56,178
...it has to be fast.

1673
01:50:56,345 --> 01:51:00,861
Arcamax is twice as fast as any
CD-ROM drive in the world today.

1674
01:51:01,465 --> 01:51:04,662
We've had our problems,
but we are solving them.

1675
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,385
And were the problems with the design?

1676
01:51:07,545 --> 01:51:11,379
No, there are fabrication problems
involving the production line.

1677
01:51:11,545 --> 01:51:12,864
What sort of problems?

1678
01:51:13,585 --> 01:51:17,624
For example, we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock...

1679
01:51:17,785 --> 01:51:19,537
...the control chip on.

1680
01:51:19,705 --> 01:51:22,265
The Malaysians have been
doing it by hand...

1681
01:51:22,425 --> 01:51:24,814
...jamming the chips in with their thumbs.

1682
01:51:24,985 --> 01:51:27,374
And the quality of the air is dirty.

1683
01:51:27,545 --> 01:51:31,379
We should use level 7 air handlers,
we're using level 5.

1684
01:51:31,545 --> 01:51:33,217
And we're ordering our components,

1685
01:51:33,305 --> 01:51:37,537
Like hinge rods and clips,
not from our Singapore supplier...

1686
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:42,618
...but from someone who's a lot
cheaper but also less reliable.

1687
01:51:42,865 --> 01:51:47,017
I'm confused. You set up this line.
You didn't anticipate these problems?

1688
01:51:47,985 --> 01:51:51,978
The line was changed.
The specifications were altered.

1689
01:51:52,305 --> 01:51:55,581
How is that possible? We know
you to be a competent manager.

1690
01:51:57,505 --> 01:52:01,100
You should know.
You ordered the changes.

1691
01:52:02,065 --> 01:52:04,215
I don't know how you got that idea.

1692
01:52:04,705 --> 01:52:06,855
You were in Kuala Lumpur last year.

1693
01:52:08,545 --> 01:52:12,458
To settle a labor dispute.
I've never even seen the line.

1694
01:52:15,025 --> 01:52:16,140
You haven't?

1695
01:52:16,465 --> 01:52:18,695
No, I don't know who told you I--

1696
01:52:23,345 --> 01:52:25,654
You're watching Malaysian Channel 3.

1697
01:52:31,825 --> 01:52:34,385
Perhaps instead of digging up
Malaysian video clips...

1698
01:52:34,545 --> 01:52:36,934
...we should discuss the problems here...

1699
01:52:37,105 --> 01:52:39,983
...the problems in your department
with the line you set up.

1700
01:52:41,025 --> 01:52:42,219
All right.

1701
01:52:47,665 --> 01:52:52,136
The first memo in the file being handed
out is signed by Meredith Johnson.

1702
01:52:52,305 --> 01:52:56,139
It states that manual labor will
be used to install the chips.

1703
01:52:56,305 --> 01:52:58,773
That made the Malaysian
government happy.

1704
01:52:59,185 --> 01:53:02,541
It also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation--

1705
01:53:02,625 --> 01:53:05,503
The Malay government
insisted we fill those jobs.

1706
01:53:05,665 --> 01:53:09,817
The Malaysian government does
not own shares of DigiCom.

1707
01:53:09,985 --> 01:53:11,737
These people here do.

1708
01:53:13,585 --> 01:53:15,177
The second memo...

1709
01:53:15,345 --> 01:53:19,099
...reduces the air handling
capacity in order to cut costs.

1710
01:53:19,425 --> 01:53:24,135
And that's why we're getting dirt in
the split optics, the drive arms.

1711
01:53:24,385 --> 01:53:29,095
The resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70%%%.

1712
01:53:29,425 --> 01:53:33,259
-The third memo regarding--
-The drives are your responsibility!

1713
01:53:34,465 --> 01:53:36,933
These problems were created
because of your incompetence.

1714
01:53:37,465 --> 01:53:39,023
That's what's wrong!

1715
01:53:39,105 --> 01:53:41,016
Passing the buck!
Back stabbing!

1716
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:42,140
I'm not done.

1717
01:53:42,385 --> 01:53:45,024
This so-called evidence of yours
is fooling no one!

1718
01:53:45,265 --> 01:53:49,099
You can protect your turf
and think it means something.

1719
01:53:49,265 --> 01:53:52,462
You weren't told of these decisions
because they're over your head.

1720
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,855
This merger is about synergy...

1721
01:53:55,025 --> 01:53:58,381
...between hardware and software,
between cash flow and capital needs.

1722
01:53:58,545 --> 01:54:00,775
That's a language you can't understand!

1723
01:54:00,945 --> 01:54:02,219
I don't either.

1724
01:54:03,025 --> 01:54:05,903
We're buying this company
because they build things.

1725
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:08,775
You understand what she means?

1726
01:54:16,065 --> 01:54:19,660
I'm trying to convey the sentiments
of everyone here.

1727
01:54:19,825 --> 01:54:21,577
That's what I meant to do.

1728
01:54:26,305 --> 01:54:28,773
Could you step outside for a moment?

1729
01:54:39,985 --> 01:54:42,215
Can you build the darn thing or not?

1730
01:54:43,105 --> 01:54:44,743
Yes, sir, we can.

1731
01:54:47,425 --> 01:54:50,974
They're replacing Meredith.
Garvin's announcing it in ten minutes.

1732
01:54:53,745 --> 01:54:55,019
Ten minutes?

1733
01:55:17,985 --> 01:55:20,055
I'm surprised you didn't come to gloat.

1734
01:55:20,265 --> 01:55:24,781
Gloating is underrated. I actually
came here to pick up the Arcamax files.

1735
01:55:24,945 --> 01:55:26,981
Some smart people underrated you.

1736
01:55:27,185 --> 01:55:28,538
Thank you.

1737
01:55:29,185 --> 01:55:30,698
Not including myself.

1738
01:55:30,865 --> 01:55:33,743
I beat you. I beat you fair and square.

1739
01:55:34,225 --> 01:55:36,102
Garvin lost his nerve.

1740
01:55:36,225 --> 01:55:39,342
It was his brilliant idea
to fire you for incompetence.

1741
01:55:39,585 --> 01:55:40,938
Him and Phil.

1742
01:55:41,105 --> 01:55:42,538
Now I'm being fired.

1743
01:55:43,585 --> 01:55:47,897
I've never seen you play the victim.
It's the only good quality you had.

1744
01:55:48,225 --> 01:55:52,218
I'm playing the game men set up,
and I'm being punished for it.

1745
01:55:52,705 --> 01:55:54,058
It's fine.

1746
01:55:54,385 --> 01:55:58,219
I've had calls from ten
head-hunters with job offers.

1747
01:55:59,505 --> 01:56:02,975
Don't be surprised if I'm back
in ten years to buy this place.

1748
01:56:04,945 --> 01:56:09,336
Did it ever occur to you, Meredith,
that maybe I set you up?

1749
01:56:24,145 --> 01:56:26,705
-This is my son, Spencer.
-How you doing?

1750
01:56:26,865 --> 01:56:28,935
-Good.
-You're at the University of Washington?

1751
01:56:29,105 --> 01:56:31,096
That's great. Very good.

1752
01:56:47,665 --> 01:56:49,098
What a week!

1753
01:56:49,265 --> 01:56:50,857
The Chinese say:

1754
01:56:51,345 --> 01:56:54,621
"May you live in interesting times."

1755
01:56:56,305 --> 01:57:00,457
This merger is the most
interesting merger I've had...

1756
01:57:00,785 --> 01:57:02,298
...since my second marriage.

1757
01:57:03,825 --> 01:57:05,736
The merger is complete.

1758
01:57:06,345 --> 01:57:08,256
The question now is...

1759
01:57:08,865 --> 01:57:12,858
...who do we find to run things
up here in Seattle?

1760
01:57:13,065 --> 01:57:15,454
And what I realized during this...

1761
01:57:15,585 --> 01:57:17,735
...very interesting week...

1762
01:57:18,225 --> 01:57:21,422
...is that I have probably
focused too much on...

1763
01:57:21,585 --> 01:57:25,578
...breaking the glass ceiling,
finding a woman to run things here...

1764
01:57:25,745 --> 01:57:29,374
...when I should have been
looking for the best person...

1765
01:57:29,585 --> 01:57:31,177
...to run things here.

1766
01:57:31,905 --> 01:57:33,224
Someone whose...

1767
01:57:33,345 --> 01:57:37,736
...long service with this company
has established a record...

1768
01:57:38,065 --> 01:57:39,498
...of creativity...

1769
01:57:39,665 --> 01:57:41,257
...sound judgement...

1770
01:57:41,505 --> 01:57:43,780
...and hands-on expertise.

1771
01:57:44,785 --> 01:57:46,377
And that person...

1772
01:57:47,265 --> 01:57:48,937
...is Stephanie Kaplan.

1773
01:57:55,185 --> 01:57:57,335
Congratulations, Stephanie.

1774
01:58:08,065 --> 01:58:10,863
I tell you something,
she's the greatest!

1775
01:58:12,465 --> 01:58:14,057
Thank you.

1776
01:58:14,545 --> 01:58:18,584
First, I'd like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads:

1777
01:58:18,905 --> 01:58:21,703
...Mary Anne Hunter
and Mark Lewyn here...

1778
01:58:21,785 --> 01:58:24,663
...and Don Cherry, where are you?

1779
01:58:25,545 --> 01:58:26,739
There he is.

1780
01:58:26,985 --> 01:58:29,374
And particularly, Tom Sanders...

1781
01:58:29,465 --> 01:58:32,980
...who epitomizes the inventiveness
of this division...

1782
01:58:33,225 --> 01:58:34,704
...its past and its future.

1783
01:58:35,505 --> 01:58:38,065
I'm counting on you to be my right-hand.

1784
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:40,619
Thank you.

1785
01:58:47,145 --> 01:58:50,262
We are heading into a new millennium...

1786
01:58:50,505 --> 01:58:51,540
...a new time.

1787
01:58:52,265 --> 01:58:54,256
You a chemistry major, Spencer?

1788
01:58:56,025 --> 01:58:57,140
Yeah, I am.

1789
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:03,138
I know a chemistry professor there,
Arthur Friend. A. Friend.

1790
01:59:03,785 --> 01:59:05,935
I don't know if he teaches freshmen.

1791
01:59:06,105 --> 01:59:07,777
I'm his research assistant.

1792
01:59:08,825 --> 01:59:11,703
So if Arthur Friend was in Nepal,
for example...

1793
01:59:11,865 --> 01:59:15,380
...you'd have the keys to his
office and computer password.

1794
01:59:20,585 --> 01:59:23,702
We all work so well together
and it's exciting...

1795
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:25,776
...and it's wonderful to see.

1796
01:59:27,065 --> 01:59:28,418
Thank you.

1797
01:59:29,945 --> 01:59:32,015
Your mother's an extraordinary woman.

1798
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:33,937
You just figured that out?
