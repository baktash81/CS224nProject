1
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,590
Okay, everybody. It's 6:00.
Let's close it up.

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,966
Come on.

3
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,594
Come on, you guys.
That's it for the day.

4
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,181
You can play tomorrow, okay?

5
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,476
- Last shot, Claude.
- Come on!

6
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,978
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

7
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,608
- Bobby. Come on.
- Just taking a beer break, man.

8
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,611
- I'm working up an appetite for dinner.
- Put the records away.

9
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,031
- I don't want a happy hour here.
- Hey, I paid a buck for that!

10
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,158
- I wonder how far you got.
- Well, he...

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,203
- So, what happened?
- Anyways, his mom walks in.

12
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,623
- You were still loaded?
- We were both stoned out of our minds.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,003
Anyways, his mom walks in,
and she's giving me the evil eye, you know.

14
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,839
And I realize my shirt's
unbuttoned down to here.

15
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,675
- Down to where?
- Sex pervert!

16
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,844
I just wanted a little closer look.

17
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,054
He does that so people
won't know he's queer.

18
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,140
Yeah, believe it.

19
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,267
Carl, my brother can get us
some tickets...

20
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,310
...to that KISS concert.
- Really? Where?

21
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,271
- Middleton, man.
- KISS?

22
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,232
- Come on.
- Eat it, man. KISS...

23
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,027
Simmons, man.
I like to see him barf up that blood.

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,029
You think that stuff
is real, man?

25
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,698
No, but it ain't costing me
nothing, anyway.

26
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,992
My brother's paying for the tickets.

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,036
- I see. Check you later.
- See you later.

28
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,705
Hey, I think Alan has a crush on Lisa.

29
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,250
- Is that why she's so flat?
- Every chick in there is flat.

30
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
Hey, what about that chick Shelly, man?

31
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,422
- She's sleazy-looking.
- Gee, whatever you say, man.

32
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,965
Hey, there goes Cory.

33
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,721
Now, that is what I call a fox.

34
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,765
She's too stuck-up.

35
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,308
She thinks she's so bad.

36
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,643
Why doesn't she ever
hang around the rec, huh?

37
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,814
- Maybe she has better things to do, okay?
- Like get stoned 24 hours a day.

38
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,317
Now, that sounds good to me.

39
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,403
I heard she ran off with a rock group
last year.

40
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,406
Oh, yeah. I heard she was going with
one of those guys.

41
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,910
What? I heard she was going with
all them guys.

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,620
How do you know, man?

43
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,288
You never even talk to the girl.

44
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,625
She's too stoned to talk to, man.
You can't talk to that girl.

45
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,794
Hey, I'll see you guys later.

46
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,171
Stuffed peppers tonight.

47
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,799
We don't wanna miss that,
do we, Johnny?

48
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,716
Did I ever tell you about the time
I broke into a bike shop?

49
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,802
- About 10 times.
- They told my mother to sign this thing...

50
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,181
...saying I was "incorrectable."
- Incorrigible.

51
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,183
That's right.

52
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:13,355
Cops! Cops, man!
You better get in the bushes!

53
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,819
What are we doing here, man?

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,405
Hell, it's Doberman.

55
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,795
When you two get through making out
in there, I'd like to talk to you.

56
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,714
Go ahead.

57
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,300
You two got any special reason
to be hiding there?

58
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,345
Yeah. We heard you were horny, man.

59
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,305
I lost a contact lens in there.

60
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,475
Oh. Come here. Let me see.

61
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,900
You don't wear contacts.

62
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,360
- I lost both of them.
- Yeah.

63
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,861
All right, let's go.

64
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,411
Assume the position.
Get your hands up there.

65
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,246
What the hell you looking at?

66
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,164
Spread them out.

67
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,382
- How big is this blade, White?
- Three inches.

68
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,218
Almost as big as your dick.

69
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,429
Watch your mouth, kid.

70
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,639
If this blade was any longer,
you'd do time.

71
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,100
If it was any smaller,
you wouldn't have found it.

72
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,102
All right, let's go.

73
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,647
- Told you he was horny.
- Get in there, Carl.

74
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,649
- Let's go.
- We didn't do nothing, man.

75
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,609
Get off of me.

76
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,223
- Jerry, what's the good word?
- Would you believe "Houston"?

77
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,352
- They're coming?
- Day after tomorrow. Mr. Sloan himself.

78
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,729
- That's great. That's great.
- It's hot in here.

79
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,357
Let's step outside.
The damn air conditioning's broke.

80
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,317
Jerry, can I sell you a new Cadillac...

81
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,527
...just to celebrate?
- No way, Freddy.

82
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,322
They're gonna have to bury
me in that old heap of mine.

83
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,824
Boy, I wish I had 10 of these.

84
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,535
You sure take care of that car, Jerry,
I'll tell you.

85
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,456
You two got enough cards on you
to play solitaire.

86
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,042
"Breaking and entering."
That's pretty.

87
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,419
I didn't take nothing, and you know it.

88
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,672
Lighten up. If I wanna know
anything on you...

89
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,468
...all I gotta do is look in the record.
- If you can't find it, you can make it up.

90
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,345
Where'd you get that belt buckle?

91
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,515
- A friend gave it to me.
- What is it?

92
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,643
- It's a leaf.
- What kind?

93
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,437
Poison ivy, I guess.

94
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,274
Your record's not that bad, Carl.

95
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,695
I'd like to see you keep it that way.

96
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,072
- Claude Zachary.
- Who's that?

97
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,283
The one who gave it to me.
He gave me the belt buckle.

98
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,913
- Those two boys you saw running...
- Do we look like cops?

99
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,875
- You look like jerks. Shut up.
- How about it, Carl?

100
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,213
Well, I only saw one of them.

101
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,092
He was carrying a gun or something.
A BB gun.

102
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,803
The one that knocked me down.
I don't know his name.

103
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,807
- Call his father.
- I think I saw him once at Sweetwater.

104
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,350
Right.

105
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,437
I'll be with you in a minute.
I got some business.

106
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,275
Yes. What did he do?

107
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,444
A switchblade?

108
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,573
I'll be right down.
No, officer, thank you.

109
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,575
Right. Bye-bye.

110
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,832
Wanna go for a ride in it sometime?

111
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,210
- Fred, everything all right?
- Just some things about parking tickets.

112
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,047
I told my wife, putting them in
the glove compartment's...

113
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,133
...not the same as paying them.
Cindy, will you please close up?

114
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,551
I'll see you later, Jerry.

115
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,262
Well, how about it, kid?

116
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,182
You know, you could really
use a break.

117
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,225
Why don't you give me a name?

118
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,103
You guys got a lot of laws, right?

119
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,314
Well, let me tell you something.

120
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,983
I only got one law.

121
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,277
A kid who tells on another kid...

122
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,654
...is a dead kid.

123
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,033
Well, that's a good rule, kid.

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,578
- It'll serve you well in jail someday.
- Damn straight.

125
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,457
Richie, I'm writing you up for
illegal weapons concealment.

126
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,918
- You do that, wimp.
- Come on, tough guy, let's go.

127
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,128
Get your hands off me, you pinhead.

128
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,345
I don't know about you, Carl.
You live in a good place.

129
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,306
Your dad's got a good business
with the Caddies there.

130
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,476
You're getting to be more
of a punk every day, you know that?

131
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,854
Let me ask you, you got some need
to louse things up for yourself?

132
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,816
I've got a driving need
to be left alone, okay?

133
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,528
Maybe you could use a weekend on the hill.
You know, away from your friends.

134
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,947
You're almost 15, right?

135
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,242
The fun only lasts for another year, kid.

136
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,953
When you're 16,
you start playing for real.

137
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,124
Well, did they at least
read you your rights?

138
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,667
What rights? You kidding me?

139
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,962
I'd like to see them go after
some real criminals sometime.

140
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,672
Yeah. Me too.

141
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,758
- So, what was it?
- Nothing.

142
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,344
Nothing, Ma.

143
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,597
Come on, honey.
They told me something about a knife.

144
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,144
You must mean the nail file.
Oh, yeah.

145
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,107
We didn't do anything. God.

146
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,527
Except that your friend
had a switchblade knife on him.

147
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,654
It was only a pocketknife.

148
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,199
If Sergeant Doberman didn't find it...

149
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,369
...we wouldn't be having this
discussion right now.

150
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,912
Maybe.

151
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,874
Look, no one's blaming you...

152
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,670
...but you gotta understand that
Richie White is nothing but trouble, period.

153
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,381
I heard he had to leave
the last town he lived in.

154
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,175
And living here is his punishment.

155
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,512
Carl, I'm sick and tired of you
complaining about New Granada.

156
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,392
Now, let's just cool it. I don't wanna
make your mother more upset than she is.

157
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,753
- Did you get arrested?
- Yeah.

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,340
Wow. Hey, Mom,
Richie got arrested.

159
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,966
Yeah, I know.

160
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,053
I busted their skulls, those pigs.

161
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,574
Carl. Hi.

162
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,993
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

163
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,622
Come on, what's wrong?

164
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,835
Honey, we just came from
the police station.

165
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,964
Carl was with that kid, Richie White.
Richie had a knife on him.

166
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,758
They got arrested.
I went to the station and rescued him.

167
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,678
- You should have called me.
- I was there at the agency.

168
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,388
Jerry Cole was right next to me.

169
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,559
I had to make up some excuse about
parking tickets you're supposed to have.

170
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,103
You weren't too hard on Carl,
were you, dear?

171
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,065
I broke his legs.
Didn't you see him crawl?

172
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,900
Come on.

173
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,243
Same old dumb thing.
They wanted Perry and this other chump...

174
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,373
...and they thought it was us.
- We should've stayed on the sidewalk.

175
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,917
Doberman would've grabbed us anyway.

176
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,419
Man, this town's one big bust.

177
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,673
You could get sent to the hill
for just walking down the street.

178
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,509
Won't send me to the hill no more.
I'm an outlaw, Jack.

179
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,637
Them cops want to deal with me,
they'd best do it on the street.

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,268
- Hey, man, you ready for this test?
- I'm better than ready, man.

181
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:16,064
- I just did some speed at breakfast.
- All right.

182
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,485
Okay, you guys.

183
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,698
Now, instead of the identification test
I told you all about...

184
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,658
...l'm going to do something different.

185
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,411
I'm going to put one slide
on the screen of one painting.

186
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,914
I want you all to write a short essay
about it and tell me what you see.

187
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,916
Okay, cool it.

188
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,085
Marcy?

189
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,087
Marcy?

190
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,174
Marcy. Marcy? Marcy!

191
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:49,514
If I can interrupt you and Lisa for a moment
and have you turn the lights off, please.

192
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,654
What?

193
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,532
That stuff I took.

194
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,453
It was supposed to be speed,
but I think it was acid.

195
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,248
- I'm flashing.
- Really?

196
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,297
Oh, my God.

197
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,144
Good morning.

198
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,981
I want to talk to you all this morning
about a shocking incident...

199
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,859
...which occurred yesterday
when some students...

200
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,737
...who might possibly even go
to this school...

201
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:49,282
...caused a major traffic
accident on the freeway.

202
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,870
Because of this, the school board
has decided on the following steps...

203
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,332
...to stop this kind of thing
from going any further.

204
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:03,338
Smoking on or near school grounds
will result in immediate suspension.

205
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,590
Mr. White, you're late.

206
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,385
Why are you late, Richard?

207
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,637
I had to take a piss.

208
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,180
What?

209
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,311
- I mean, I had to urinate.
- Sit down.

210
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:24,317
Now, there will be a 9:30
curfew starting tonight...

211
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,737
...and it will be strictly enforced
by the police department.

212
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,365
I hope that's clear.

213
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:35,120
We have a film that we would like you
to see, and then Mr. Cole...

214
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:39,332
...who is president of
the homeowner's association...

215
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,209
...has a few announcements.

216
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,548
{y:i}Vandalism is one of our country's
{y:i}biggest problems today.

217
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,551
{y:i}Estimates for destruction
{y:i}to school facilities alone...

218
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,303
{y:i}... is over $ 100 million per year.

219
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,766
{y:i}And counting all acts of vandalism
{y:i}to public and private property...

220
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:01,730
{y:i}... some experts push the figure
{y:i}to over $ 1 billion every year.

221
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:06,067
{y:i}A "vandal" is defined
{y:i}as one who willfully...

222
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,280
{y:i}... wantonly, and ignorantly damages...

223
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,867
{y:i}... and destroys valuable
{y:i}or beautiful things.

224
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh, no. So destructive. Look.

225
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,258
{y:i}Maybe you're mad at the school,
{y:i}but busting something doesn't help.

226
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,218
{y:i}I just think it's childish.

227
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,314
I don't know. Sometimes I think
they're really like a herd of baboons.

228
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,274
It's all right. It's okay.

229
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,965
- What time will they be here?
- We meet at the Four Winds at 1:30.

230
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,759
About noon, then, here for drinks?

231
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,471
Yeah, 12:00 is fine. Jerry's stopping by
tonight to check over the plans...

232
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,598
...so make some hors d'oeuvres and crap.

233
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,976
We've gotta give these guys a feeling
for what it's like to live here.

234
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,730
Dad, are the guys from Texas coming
to buy the land across from the rec?

235
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,857
- They're coming to look at it.
- What for?

236
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,404
It's an industrial park. They'll lease out
parts of the land to various companies.

237
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,490
I thought they were building
a drive-in and a bowling alley.

238
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,119
Carl, things didn't turn out
the way we thought, okay?

239
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,205
And the city's gotta make money
on that property.

240
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,918
Besides, we need more of a reason for
people to move here than the bowling alley.

241
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,674
See you about 9, Carl?

242
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,592
Okay, Mom.

243
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,514
The park's for wimps.

244
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,975
And there's so much to do
around here, man.

245
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,103
At the park we can watch
Carl try to pick up Cory.

246
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,772
Will you lay off?
At least I have a chance with her.

247
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,524
She wouldn't even look at you.

248
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:13,028
That girl was so ripped today
it was ridiculous.

249
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,196
Don't talk to me
about being ripped.

250
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,700
- Hey, anybody getting off?
- Hey, Richie.

251
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,036
It's all right, man.

252
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,581
- Hey, Tip.
- Hey, Claude.

253
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,250
- How's it going?
- Pretty good. Just getting mellow.

254
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,711
- Got some hash.
- Excellent. How much?

255
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,798
- Twelve bucks a gram.
- That's pretty steep, don't you think?

256
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,592
It's good stuff.

257
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,886
All right. I'll take it.

258
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,513
I know where I can score
on some good acid too.

259
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,766
No, thanks.
No more acid for me.

260
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,309
Okay.

261
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,853
So they asked my mother
to sign this thing...

262
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,731
...saying I was "incorridable" or whatever.
- Incorrigible.

263
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,900
Yeah, whatever.
She wouldn't do it.

264
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,402
You know, she won't sign that bunk shit.

265
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,073
Hi.

266
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,453
You know, Cory could be here,
and you might not even know it.

267
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,497
- Shut up, man.
- Hey.

268
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,874
Just circulate around.
Just, you know...

269
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,460
Just circulate around.
You might find her.

270
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,923
- I did not, Jeff.
- Jenny, did you see Cory around?

271
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,634
- We each did about two ludes.
- They were rainbows.

272
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,053
Rainbows are ludes.

273
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,723
Get me some beer, man.
We need some beer, man.

274
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,558
We need beer.

275
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,437
- Carl, what's going on? You want a hit?
- No.

276
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,152
You couldn't find Cory?

277
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,615
She's a waste of time. She is.

278
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,579
Hey, boys. Just heard me about a party.

279
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,957
- Where?
- Over at old town.

280
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,668
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

281
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,172
- Come on, where you guys going?
- Party. Come on.

282
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,758
- Richie?
- Richie!

283
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,095
- Come on in!
- You got a light on you?

284
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,764
- Come on.
- Hey.

285
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,850
Hey, man, what's going on?

286
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,810
How's it going? All right.

287
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,478
Hey, Carl, my man.

288
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,273
- How'd you hear about my party?
- Word just got around.

289
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,651
Yeah, word just gets around.
I mean, is this a party or not?

290
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,821
- Go get yourself a beer.
- Hey, where are your parents, anyway?

291
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,823
Reno.

292
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,043
Hey, what's going on, Carl?
Having a good time?

293
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,794
Yeah.

294
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,551
How about a hit, man?

295
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,694
Thanks for getting me busted.

296
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,988
That's okay. Long as you didn't
mention my name to the cops.

297
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,033
No, I don't think
your name popped up.

298
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,994
Because if I ever found out
you mentioned my name to a cop...

299
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,914
...you'd be eating lunch
through a tube.

300
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,582
Yeah.

301
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,757
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

302
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,843
You.

303
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,637
And?

304
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,474
You could do a lot better.

305
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:19,024
- Here, man, knock yourself out.
- Thanks a lot, man.

306
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,567
Where you going, man?

307
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,445
I'm leaving, man.
There's nothing happening here.

308
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,904
Not for you?

309
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,781
Yeah. What could I do?

310
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,453
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, man.

311
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,666
Did I ever tell you about the time
I broke into a bike shop?

312
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,191
Don't worry about it.
They can't... They can't...

313
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,026
{y:i}Okay, party's over.

314
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:07,364
{y:i}It's 9: 15, and anybody who's not
{y:i}in their own home in 15 minutes...

315
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,283
{y:i}... is in violation of curfew.

316
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,079
Wait a minute, you can't come in here!
This is private property.

317
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,456
My father's a lawyer.
I know my rights.

318
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,334
{y:i}I don't care who your father is.
{y:i}Fifteen minutes.

319
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,944
See if he's got any money.

320
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,907
You just remember to keep
your mouth shut, faggot.

321
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,395
{y:i}Now, you take your boy.

322
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:05,065
I mean, he's intelligent.
He's a good kid.

323
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,649
Now, where does that come from?

324
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,361
I mean, he's not born decent.
Nobody's born...

325
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,196
Hey, Carl.

326
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,282
- We're just talking about you...
- Carl, come back here.

327
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,161
- My God.
- Carl. Son, are you all right?

328
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,622
- I got in a fight.
- You got in a fight?

329
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,165
- Who did this?
- Don't touch it.

330
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,792
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,045
- It was dark. I didn't see them.
- Fred, I will handle it. Fred!

332
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,215
Freddy, come on.
Let Sandra take care of it.

333
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,550
- That's what mothers are for.
- He's bloodied up.

334
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,095
- He's all beat to hell.
- Don't get in an uproar.

335
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,180
Come on, come on. Sit down.

336
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:40,100
I don't know what the hell's
gotten into him this past year.

337
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:44,062
He's into that recreation center gang
over his head.

338
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,940
I've talked to him about those kids.
"Stay away from them."

339
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,567
- He wants to be part of the gang.
- It's peer pressure.

340
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,445
Peer pressure. It's powerful stuff,
even when we were kids.

341
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,949
- Well, maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

342
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,995
We ought to make sure that none
of those kids are hanging around...

343
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,790
...when Sloan and his people
arrive tomorrow.

344
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:07,335
Maybe we ought to just shut
the rec center down for the day.

345
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,560
Who did you fight with?

346
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,187
Two guys jumped me.

347
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,899
- Do you know who they were?
- No.

348
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,281
- I'm okay.
- Hey, come on, honey.

349
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,327
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

350
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,414
Do you want to see
the doctor in the morning?

351
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,043
No. He'll pour a bottle
of peroxide on my head.

352
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,379
I'm not gonna be scarred for life, Mom.

353
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,381
Sandy!

354
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,635
Did they take any money?

355
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,804
Four bucks.

356
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,100
Here's five.

357
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,186
It's combat pay.

358
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,271
Thanks.

359
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,607
Carl...

360
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,651
...go a little easier on your father,
will you, honey?

361
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,945
He's under a lot of pressure lately.

362
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,657
Okay.

363
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,035
Good.

364
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,415
- Good night.
- Good night.

365
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:33,963
I guess they thought it was his girl...
Oh, boy, he got me...

366
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,291
I'll tell you one thing, Jerry.

367
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,003
I sure do appreciate the use
of this here buggy.

368
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,963
Just a little New Granada hospitality.

369
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,632
Fred Willat owns the local
dealership here, Mr. Sloan...

370
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,468
Now, Jerry, you just call me Roy.

371
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,430
Jerry Cole takes care of that.
I've got enough trouble...

372
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,516
...taking care of the Cadillac agency,
you know?

373
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:33,106
But like I said, it is a little slow right now.
We're in what we refer to as hiatus.

374
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,985
- The hiatus.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

375
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,947
Hey, Carl.

376
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,493
- Carl, come on.
- I like it. I like it.

377
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,329
Who does your face these days?

378
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,082
- Jesus, Carl, what happened to you?
- I got jumped.

379
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,584
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

380
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,419
Who beat you up? He did a great job.

381
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:57,380
- Never mind.
- Was it the disgusting people...

382
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,674
...from Planet Pork?

383
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:04,846
He's a fox.

384
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,389
Who nailed you, man?

385
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,683
Mark Perry and that gorilla
he hangs out with.

386
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,644
Yeah? Your parents blow up on you?

387
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,105
No, not really.

388
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,815
Hang in there, man.

389
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,692
Thanks.

390
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,528
- Man, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

391
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,990
What are you, into brass knuckles
and baseball bats?

392
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:28,119
- I didn't volunteer for this, man.
- It's okay, man. You look like a fighter.

393
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,121
It's open.

394
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,468
- Anything wrong, officer?
- Not with me.

395
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,471
Why are you hanging around?
Just wanna make the kids paranoid?

396
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,682
Spoke to Jerry Cole.
Said he'd talk to you...

397
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:53,144
...about shutting down today?
- I told him, and I'm telling you now:

398
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,022
The rec stays open.
It's the only place these kids can go.

399
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,526
- That's a little more important...
- Heard there was hash being sold here.

400
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:03,363
- No chance that would happen here?
- No chance.

401
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,324
Look, you know these kids
can't bring drugs to the rec.

402
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,078
All the old familiar faces.

403
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:14,207
You are violating a city ordinance
coming in here.

404
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,750
Whose permission do I need?

405
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:19,004
Ours, faggot. You don't belong here.

406
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,214
Now, let's just make him
feel at home.

407
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,217
Okay, let's just all mellow out, okay?

408
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,638
How you doing, flower child?

409
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,016
- Hit it.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?

410
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,977
- Where's your warrant, pig?
- You need a warrant to search us.

411
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,146
- We got rights.
- Just because we're kids...

412
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:40,025
...you can't push us around.
- Why don't you go to hell too?

413
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,114
Lincoln, I made a narcotics seizure.
Request assistance.

414
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,662
I could search every one of you
if I wanted to.

415
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,956
Search me, then.

416
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,459
Come on. Search me!

417
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,794
Okay, Carl.

418
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,308
Would you like to see
my pockets, officer, sir?

419
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,149
Dangerous weapon, huh?

420
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,988
Rec's closed for the rest of the day.
Everybody out! Tell them.

421
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,631
Get off that car!

422
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,427
White! Off that car!

423
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,161
- What's going on over there?
- Looks like the kids...

424
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,748
The kids must be having some kind
of fun over there. It's a fun day.

425
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,460
You see, Sergeant Doberman...
That's our local police officer.

426
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,045
He's involved in youth work.

427
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,754
Snap out of it, man.

428
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,174
Come on.
Claude's just another lost cause.

429
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,969
Hey, ain't that your old man up there?

430
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,804
That's him.

431
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,307
I'll bet he had that dog
bust the rec on purpose...

432
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,018
...so we wouldn't be here
when those turkeys showed up.

433
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,603
Who the hell are they?

434
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,731
Texas millionaires, man.
They're gonna build an industrial park.

435
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,399
Texas?

436
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:30,362
All they got in Texas
is steers and queers.

437
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,074
Hey, Johnny, come on.
Take a walk with me and Carl.

438
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,536
Come on, Johnny, man,
don't worry about it.

439
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,915
It's just as well you couldn't tell
that pig what you thought of him.

440
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,708
He would have busted your ass too.

441
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,128
- You know that kid Stuart Hatner?
- Yeah. What about him?

442
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,882
- His father got him a brand-new car.
- No kidding. What kind?

443
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:54,302
- Dodge Charger.
- Does he let him drive it, or what?

444
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,597
Yeah, but his father has to come along
with him when he drives.

445
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,059
- Big deal. Who cares, man.
- It's still his car.

446
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:04,479
Must have a great time on dates
with his father along.

447
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,940
What the hell is this sh...

448
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:11,653
- Happy Fourth of July, man.
- What am I gonna do with firecrackers?

449
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,155
Give them to Claude.
Let him smoke them.

450
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,035
If I got a job, I bet you I'd get me
one of them nice Kawasaki 350s.

451
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:24,082
- All I want me is one of those big BMWs.
- What would you do, ride under it?

452
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,544
Hey, there's your wench, man.
Let's go.

453
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:40,098
- May I see your driver's license, please?
- Jesus.

454
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,683
Hi.

455
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,228
You know, that breaking-and-entering stuff
is against the law.

456
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,439
Get lost, retard.

457
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,357
Too bad your friends weren't home.

458
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,317
- What friends?
- Your friends there.

459
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:54,529
Yeah, they could've at least
left the front door open for you.

460
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,450
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

461
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,369
I thought maybe Mark
messed you up after the party.

462
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:04,289
- I didn't get hurt.
- Didn't get helped, either.

463
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,166
See you, Cory. I'm going home.

464
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,962
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Give it back, damn it.

465
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,923
- Not bad.
- Wow.

466
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,218
Why don't you wave it around on
the streets so everybody can see it.

467
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:20,305
- Give it back, Richie. It's ours.
- I just want to check it out.

468
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,891
- Yeah, we'll walk you home.
- I'm not walking home.

469
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,559
She's surfing.

470
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,229
Hey, Richie. Who was that guy
you told me about for guns and stuff?

471
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,524
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, yeah. Listen, I got this friend.

472
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,735
You get this guy on the right day...

473
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,863
...he might give you 150 bucks
for one of these things.

474
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,700
- Maybe throw in a couple of Thai sticks.
- Oh, yeah? Think we could sell it?

475
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:45,163
Maybe. Hey, you know, me and Richie
have our own condo over there.

476
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,165
Yeah, I'll bet you just got married.

477
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,128
- Check this place out.
- Hey, this is neat.

478
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:54,089
I don't think they're gonna finish it.

479
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,549
I haven't seen anybody
around here in a long time.

480
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,426
My father says they're out of money.

481
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,137
Yeah. Who'd want to live here, anyways?

482
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,182
Have a seat.

483
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,142
Hey, where'd you get this box?

484
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:10,814
It was some robbery scheme I planned up.
Worked out pretty decent.

485
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,109
Was that before or after
you broke into a bike shop?

486
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:15,527
Shut up.

487
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,321
Anybody wanna get high?

488
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,117
I knew it, out pops a number.

489
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,495
Whose house is this where
you got this gun?

490
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,290
We don't know.

491
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,754
- You just found it, huh?
- Yeah.

492
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,465
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

493
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,260
Hey, you really think we can
get 150 for it?

494
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,096
- Easy.
- I want to shoot it first.

495
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,807
- We got some shells with it.
- They had some grass too...

496
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:49,602
...but we didn't take that.
- No. We dumped it all over the rug.

497
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,648
- Get lost.
- Come on, you little prude.

498
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,652
Hey, what does "European Living" mean?

499
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,989
It means it's always gonna look
bombed out like this.

500
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,408
How'd you like to go on
a date sometime?

501
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,410
I don't go out on dates.

502
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,370
Well, what do you do, then?

503
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,247
Just see my friends.

504
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,918
I just mean I like you.

505
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:16,713
I like you too.
You have pretty eyelashes.

506
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,299
Yo...

507
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:22,302
...what say we go to the fields tomorrow,
for target practice?

508
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:26,139
- Have a Sunday picnic.
- All right. A picnic with a gun.

509
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:02,342
You alive?

510
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,974
Carl, I'm really sorry, man.

511
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,310
When we looked,
there weren't any bullets in it.

512
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:15,188
Come on. I'm late enough.
My mom's gonna have a cow.

513
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,649
- What about the gun?
- Don't worry about it, baby.

514
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:19,567
- It's in good hands.
- Yeah, sure.

515
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,569
- Bye, Carl.
- Bye.

516
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:23,321
See you later.

517
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:26,282
I bet you love her now that
she almost blew your brains out.

518
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,535
Okay, okay.

519
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,784
Damn!

520
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,092
I admit, we've got a little juvenile
trouble here, but you can't...

521
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:52,721
Let me tell you something, Mr. Cole.
You got more than juvenile trouble.

522
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:56,141
Seems to me you all were in such
a hopped-up hurry to leave the city...

523
00:41:56,307 --> 00:42:00,061
...that you turned your kids into exactly
what you were trying to get away from.

524
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,730
Let's go.

525
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:07,193
- That was very well-put, Roy.
- I thought so.

526
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,613
{y:i}Doberman didn't even write me up.

527
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,950
He just held me for a few hours
while my mom was freaking out.

528
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:16,911
He tried to scare me, you know.
He thinks he's a big deal.

529
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:19,789
Give him a gun, and you'd think
he owned the world.

530
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,958
Yeah, Deputy Dog makes me sick.

531
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:28,214
My mom, she was busy doing some
group thing, group therapy. She's weird.

532
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:29,966
You wanna play basketball?

533
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:33,887
No. Me, Cory, Richie and Abby,
we're going out to the fields. Wanna come?

534
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:37,557
Really? Cory, man, she's a waste of time.

535
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,436
Why don't you shut up, man.
I'm not trying to pick her up, okay?

536
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,355
Listen, I'll meet you, all right?

537
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:46,983
Yeah, there's so much else
to do around here.

538
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,611
{y:i}Yeah, what can you do.
{y:i}Take it easy, huh?

539
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,363
Yeah, I'll see you.

540
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,283
Well, that's the old ballgame.

541
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,578
First the kids put on that sideshow
in front of Sloan, and now this.

542
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:01,748
I told you we should've sent those punks
out of town for the week.

543
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,751
If I ever get my hands on
the little creeps that did this...

544
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,629
- I wanna know what the cops are doing.
- What happened?

545
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,256
They ruined your Cadillac,
that's what happened.

546
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:13,802
Sloan went to get in the car,
whole damn thing blew up right in his face.

547
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,231
How'd you like to live up here?

548
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,316
It would be all right, I guess.

549
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,944
Someday I'd like to live in
a real old city, though.

550
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:35,490
Yeah, I lived in Chicago for three years
before we came here.

551
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,868
I lived in New York. Cooperstown.

552
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:43,665
Baseball Hall of Fame's there.
There's a lot of country there too.

553
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:47,419
Me and my father used to go
backpacking all the time.

554
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:50,505
That was before he got
the dealership here.

555
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:53,299
How come you moved here?

556
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,176
Skiing.

557
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:58,304
We went once, about three years ago.

558
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,354
Shut up.

559
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:08,148
Shut up!

560
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,609
- Jerk.
- Check out Dirty Harry.

561
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:14,779
You couldn't hit an elephant
if it came up and kissed you.

562
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:16,740
Watch this, baby.

563
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:28,710
Come on, it's my turn to shoot, Richie.
Come on.

564
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:33,256
- Hey, it's my turn.
- Hey, wait. Claude didn't shoot yet.

565
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:36,134
- My turn.
- No, it's my turn. I only shot twice.

566
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,887
- I haven't shot yet.
- Well, God.

567
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:40,513
Abby!

568
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,224
Wait, wait. Let me give you a target.

569
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,478
Don't get in front of Cory
when she's got the gun.

570
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,355
- Funny.
- Hit this.

571
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,565
Get out of there, man.

572
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:58,073
I can't hear anything.

573
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,493
When the cops practice,
they wear those ear things.

574
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,787
- Here, let me try it...
- Wait, wait.

575
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,914
- I haven't shot it.
- Claude's gotta use it.

576
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:10,043
I don't wanna use it. I told you.
Just let him use it. I don't care.

577
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,838
It's our last bullet, man.
Make it count.

578
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,137
- All right.
- Great shot, man.

579
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:23,473
I wouldn't wanna have you
for an enemy, man.

580
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,142
That's it for the ammo. Let's split.

581
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,646
Hey, Claude, Abby told me
you got busted yesterday.

582
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:33,316
- Yeah, I did.
- Doberman went right for him.

583
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:36,569
- Like I had see-through pockets.
- What'd you have?

584
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,488
A little hash.

585
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:41,866
- Didn't know there was any hash around.
- Yeah.

586
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,786
Tip sold me some
down at the park Friday night.

587
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:47,330
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

588
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,165
Well, I heard Tipper got busted.

589
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,793
Well, he was doing business
the other night.

590
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:54,087
You think Tip made a deal
with Doberman?

591
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,715
Yeah, I can get a couple of keys...

592
00:45:57,173 --> 00:46:00,844
...but with inflation and the dollar dropping,
it could get pretty heavy.

593
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:06,349
Well, if you're talking a couple of ounces,
we're looking at 75 bucks a drop.

594
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:10,520
Hey, if you wanna play the game,
you gotta pay the price.

595
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,690
I don't make the market.
I'm on the street like everybody else.

596
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:16,818
- Hey, Tip. How's it going, Tip?
- Hey.

597
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,570
I gotta go.

598
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:23,158
- Hey, Tip, how's it going?
- How's it going, Tip?

599
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:25,160
Let's go for a walk, Tip.

600
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:29,622
- I don't really think I wanna see this.
- Me, either.

601
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:33,001
All right, I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

602
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,046
Where's the junk, man?

603
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,131
How come Doberman knew
you sold to Claude?

604
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,632
- How do I know?
- You're lying!

605
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:42,385
Hey, my mom's over there.
I'm gonna scream.

606
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:44,721
I'm gonna blow you away, Tip.

607
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,306
Hey, that's not real.

608
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,017
You may never see anything so real.

609
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,811
You told Doberman who you sold
that hash to, didn't you?

610
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:54,564
I had to. I got busted last month.
I never had a chance.

611
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,233
A kid who tells on another kid
is a dead kid.

612
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,612
Jesus Christ! For God's sake, man,
put the gun away. Don't do that!

613
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:02,364
Goodbye, narc.

614
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,080
Oh, my God. What are you doing?!

615
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:13,166
- Let's get out of here, man.
- First let's dump this chump.

616
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,919
- Hey, I can't swim!
- Grow fins, turkey!

617
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,509
- I'll see you in jail!
- Up yours, lady!

618
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:23,885
Mom!

619
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:25,679
Mom!

620
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:29,224
I'm drowning!

621
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,936
I'm drowning!

622
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:34,562
I'm drowning!

623
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:38,775
- Hey, we get the whiskey.
- No, you don't. It's ours.

624
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,694
- Come on.
- We got it. We got it first.

625
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,988
Carl, give it back. Come on.
I can see it there. Give it back.

626
00:47:44,155 --> 00:47:47,158
- Come on. It's all of ours, not just yours.
- I gotta go, man.

627
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:50,078
My mom has group tonight,
and we don't wanna upset her.

628
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,205
- See you later.
- Take it easy.

629
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,125
Come on, let's get out of here.

630
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:05,260
Bye-bye.

631
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,142
Come on. She ain't the only
girl in the world.

632
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:20,900
One thing led to another
in front of the cop.

633
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:24,487
The cop has as much brains as a damn ant.
I asserted myself, and I said...

634
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,615
...as a salesman, I have good
instincts as a salesman.

635
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:30,618
I said, "Jerry, I don't think these guys
from out of town...

636
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:33,121
...care about the property.
They're not interested.

637
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,166
They're in Las Vegas writing it off."
You know what he says?

638
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:38,126
He says, "How are the Caddies selling?"

639
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:40,962
You think that I enjoyed
being humiliated like that?

640
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:44,632
No. Goddamn it, if he had done such
a good job on those guys from Houston...

641
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,343
...they wouldn't have got scared.

642
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,721
Two kids, three... I don't know
how many kids, scared them out of town.

643
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,223
I know it sounds wrong,
but I'm sure Jerry knows...

644
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,310
Jerry Cole doesn't know anything.
He doesn't know a damn thing.

645
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,645
- He's an idiot.
- Carl, where have you been?

646
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,731
I was just out.

647
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,524
Carl.

648
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:05,070
Come over here. I want to talk to you.

649
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:08,031
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

650
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,784
Sit down.

651
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,411
What is it?

652
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,246
I had a talk with Sergeant Doberman.

653
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:18,166
I had to sit while he warned me
about keeping you in line...

654
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,251
...or I'd find myself in juvenile court.

655
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:22,504
- What? Doberman said what?
- I'm not finished!

656
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:29,678
I saw you at that rec yesterday
when that boy was arrested.

657
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:32,430
Oh, I know you did.
I'll bet you and Jerry Cole...

658
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:34,724
...had Doberman bust the rec
on purpose, huh?

659
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,976
Is that what you think?

660
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:40,689
Do you also think that I put that ounce
of hash in Claude Zachary's pocket?

661
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:43,566
- Do you? You think that too?
- It wasn't an ounce, Dad.

662
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:46,820
- How do you know so much about it?
- Did I get busted?

663
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:48,488
Oh, shit!

664
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:51,991
Fred, let's just discuss this quietly.

665
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,285
It's not necessarily Carl's fault
that Claude...

666
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:57,205
It's never his fault.
It's always his friends' fault, right?

667
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,207
His friends with the knives, the drugs.

668
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:04,004
But those friends of yours are going to
reform school, and you're not gonna follow!

669
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,007
Who's going to reform school?
Jesus Christ.

670
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:15,849
Carl, we don't want you to see
your friend Richie White for a while.

671
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,977
Or Claude Zachary, either.

672
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:22,230
The teen center is gonna be closed
for a while...

673
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:25,734
...at least until they can find
a new counselor.

674
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,027
What's wrong with Julia?

675
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,613
I know you like her, but it's obvious
she can't control the wilder kids.

676
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,073
Bullshit.

677
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:35,910
Don't you ever talk to your mother like
that again, young man, you hear me?

678
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,662
You're crazy.

679
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,414
- Don't leave...
- Get off of me!

680
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:41,833
I said, don't leave when we're
talking to you!

681
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,918
- Fred, stop that!
- Goddamn it.

682
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:47,047
Listen, honey...

683
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,094
And the fern needs a lot of water...

684
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,888
...yet they can live together
in the same environment.

685
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,307
- Sometimes...
- Stop talking!

686
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,769
- Alan, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

687
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:46,731
If tomorrow were the last day of the rest
of your life, would you do nothing?

688
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:50,276
- I don't wanna think about that.
- What do you want to think about?

689
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:53,905
I don't know.
Maybe just having a good time.

690
00:51:54,447 --> 00:51:56,866
Carl, go to the botany box.

691
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,912
Show us an example
of a succulent plant.

692
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:04,165
That's right. And a fern.

693
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:08,086
That's right too. Thank you, Carl.
You guys may not realize it...

694
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:12,215
- The boy with the gun was Richie White.
- But Richie's not in this class.

695
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:15,427
- That's what Tip said.
- Okay, Richie had... But now, look.

696
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:18,304
Anyone? Anyone at all?

697
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,809
- Tip tell you any other names?
- Claude someone.

698
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,356
- Richie. Richie, come on.
- What do you want?

699
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,774
Come on!

700
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:06,061
Richie, wait! I wanna come.

701
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:10,565
Now, you go home. Be a good boy.
Take care of Mommy.

702
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,151
Okay? That's my man.

703
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:17,113
Richie, why aren't you in school?

704
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,658
I forgot my homework.
I'm going right back. Don't worry.

705
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:25,288
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got these too.

706
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,917
You're stealing your mom's car?

707
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,087
Yeah, she only made
three payments on it.

708
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:34,339
The goddamn bank owns it.

709
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,494
Okay, listen.
We make it to Sweetwater...

710
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:07,330
...stash the car, we sell the gun,
then we can move out.

711
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:09,082
Anywhere. My mother won't rat.

712
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,793
She won't tell the pigs.
The pigs won't find out.

713
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,629
- We're running away?
- No.

714
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,341
- Bye-bye, New Granola.
- Bye.

715
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:21,886
Put on some of that
bad rock 'n' roll, boy!

716
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,139
All you got is this old crap, though.

717
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,558
It's better than nothing.
Just put it on, man.

718
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:28,101
All right!

719
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,658
- Check the ashtray, man.
- Why?

720
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,535
Check it, man.

721
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:51,291
My mom's secret stash.
That'll last us a couple of days, boy!

722
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,858
- Oh, it's Doberman.
- Oh, no.

723
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:19,402
- The gun. Ditch it.
- No, I ain't...

724
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:20,653
- Get rid of it!
- No.

725
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:33,833
- Will you get rid of the gun?
- We're burning him. Just shut up.

726
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,343
Jesus Christ!

727
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,740
Watch it!

728
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,955
Look out!

729
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:14,582
You're veering right! Watch it!

730
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:20,422
Split up, man!
He can't follow both of us!

731
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:24,551
Hold it! I order you to stop!

732
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,389
- Hold it right there.
- You son-of-a-bitching pig.

733
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:31,618
Johnny, is that you?

734
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:36,664
Do one tap for yes, two for no.

735
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:42,587
Did you hear anything about Richie?

736
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:46,341
What happened?

737
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,680
He's not dead, is he?

738
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,536
Listen, Johnny...

739
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,830
...you still there?

740
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,542
Tell Claude I'm all right.

741
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:24,963
I'll tell him where I am later.

742
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:27,382
Listen, Johnny...

743
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,762
...it's gonna be all right.

744
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,101
Maybe I'll see you soon, okay?

745
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:41,581
- You made it.
- Yeah.

746
00:59:42,832 --> 00:59:44,668
I'm sorry I'm so late.

747
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:47,128
My dad was acting real suspicious.

748
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:49,714
I thought he overheard when you called.

749
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,426
I was waiting for him to fall asleep,
and I fell asleep.

750
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:01,726
When I heard about it,
I thought about you right away.

751
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:06,523
I mean, I only knew him with you.

752
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:09,150
He still had the gun with him, didn't he?

753
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,069
Yeah.

754
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,906
I think finding that gun was an omen.
So does Abby.

755
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,574
What do you mean?

756
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:20,036
Just that it's weird, us finding it...

757
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:22,038
...then running into you guys.

758
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,332
I know.

759
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,418
What were you gonna do?

760
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,254
I don't remember.

761
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,550
I told him to get rid of the gun
when Doberman started chasing us...

762
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:38,054
...but he wouldn't do it.
I knew it was gonna happen.

763
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:41,808
The first day I ever met him he said:

764
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:46,813
"Hi, I'm Richie White. I'm on probation."

765
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,568
What are you gonna do?

766
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,113
I don't know. I'm scared.

767
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:59,993
I'll go home, I guess. But not right away.

768
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,916
I'm glad you came.

769
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,086
Me too.

770
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:14,174
It's kind of cold in here.

771
01:01:16,384 --> 01:01:18,470
The sleeping bag's warm.
You wanna get in?

772
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:24,726
You know, someday
I'm gonna be a gypsy.

773
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:27,020
- A what?
- Gypsy of the road.

774
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,564
- You know, a truck driver.
- Oh.

775
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:33,193
You don't believe me?
It was in the paper about this lady.

776
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:37,864
She's only 95 pounds.
She's already driven over 100,000 miles.

777
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,367
I cut out the article.

778
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:45,705
She's standing next to this giant truck
and "Gypsy of the Road" is painted on it.

779
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:49,459
You know, my uncle says I can be
a truck driver any time I want.

780
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:54,089
He's got a trucking company in Arvada.
This sleeping bag's pretty big, huh?

781
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:57,092
I always used to like to
play in it when I was little.

782
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,553
You know, I think you're really beautiful.

783
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,306
You are.

784
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:05,975
No, I'm not.

785
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:49,144
Carl.

786
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:51,730
Wake up, Carl.

787
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:56,943
Are you going?

788
01:02:57,485 --> 01:03:01,156
Yeah. I gotta go home
before my dad wakes up.

789
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:05,285
It's barely even light out yet.

790
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,746
He gets up at 6.

791
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:17,756
What are you gonna do?

792
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:24,888
I'm gonna go home and get some money
when my mom's out.

793
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:33,146
Oh, you can keep the sleeping bag.

794
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,191
Will you call me?

795
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,318
Yeah.

796
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:40,779
Come on.

797
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:11,518
- Bye.
- Bye.

798
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:53,101
Okay, you guys. You are to take these
home to your parents.

799
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,604
It's to let them know about
a special emergency meeting.

800
01:04:56,938 --> 01:05:00,900
It will be here tonight in the cafetorium
at 8:00...

801
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:04,279
...and it's to discuss the problems
about you people.

802
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:07,449
Has anyone seen Carl Willat?

803
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:14,372
This is a really serious matter
and his parents really are worried.

804
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:17,334
If you've seen him,
you've gotta be straight with me.

805
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:22,297
We're only concerned about his safety.
Nothing bad is going to happen to him.

806
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:22,482
You little asshole!

807
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:25,485
Come any closer and I'm gonna
blow your eyes out.

808
01:06:28,029 --> 01:06:29,781
That evens it up, huh?

809
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,370
Good shot, man.

810
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:37,997
What were you aiming for, my nose?

811
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,877
Man, you sure get your money's worth.

812
01:06:44,462 --> 01:06:47,549
- You live here, huh?
- Practically.

813
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,218
They suspended me.

814
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:54,097
At least until my hearing, which
I don't even know when it's gonna be.

815
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:57,017
- Are you suspended?
- No.

816
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,561
Just ditching, huh?

817
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:02,731
It's okay. Don't worry.
I used to do it all the time.

818
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,693
I heard about Richie White getting it.
Doberman's out of hand.

819
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,278
What did you get suspended for?

820
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:10,947
Oh, some stupid things. Stolen goods.

821
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,075
I bet they reduce it.
Doberman wanted to put me away anyway.

822
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:16,077
It's a joke, man.

823
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:23,376
If I was you, I'd go home. What are they
gonna do with a kiddie like you?

824
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:24,836
You never did nothing.

825
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:26,629
They gotta catch me first.

826
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:28,673
Forget it.
You won't get past Sweetwater.

827
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,009
They'll pick you up. Believe me, I know.

828
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:34,387
You don't know. All you've ever done
is gone around shooting things...

829
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:36,431
...with this stupid air rifle.

830
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,934
Don't make me mad. We'll have to
start this stupid thing all over again.

831
01:07:40,101 --> 01:07:41,770
It ain't like that at all.

832
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:45,523
Here.

833
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:50,653
Hey, I think you're all right, man.

834
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,491
Any time you want to come say hello,
just leave a message with my secretary.

835
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:56,242
All right?

836
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,172
- Hello?
{y:i}- Has he shown up yet?

837
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,549
No, not yet.

838
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,427
Well, he's run away, then.
That's it.

839
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:17,180
He's got to come home.
Where's he gonna get any money?

840
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,240
That damn cop!
He should be out looking for him...

841
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:37,325
{y:i}... instead of going to that PTA meeting.

842
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:41,162
{y:i}Thank God we kept Carl's name
{y:i}out of the paper, I'll tell you.

843
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:43,623
I'm losing my mind over this.

844
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,584
I'm sorry Richie White got killed...

845
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,839
...but God help me, now maybe Carl
will understand how serious this is.

846
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:10,108
I got a chilly phone call
from Mrs. Rupert this morning.

847
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,986
They're getting that
telephone tree working...

848
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:15,822
...in order to get parents
to the meeting tonight.

849
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:18,450
{y:i}Right down to the wire
{y:i}for the last two days...

850
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,952
{y:i}... of our carnival of values
{y:i}price-slasher sale.

851
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,456
{y:i}At Willat, we say come down
{y:i}with your checkbook and your good credit...

852
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:25,915
{y:i}... and let's talk leases...

853
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:29,961
{y:i}- Anyone talk to the friends? What about...?
- I bet you wish I got shot, too, huh?

854
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:32,088
- Carl?
- Carl!

855
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,799
{y:i}- Stay right... Sandy, you keep him there!
- Carl!

856
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:37,677
Carl, we're your parent...
Honey, we're your parents.

857
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:39,971
All we're trying to do is to protect you.

858
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:42,557
Carl! Sandy!

859
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:45,352
Carl, let me in here immediately! Carl!

860
01:09:45,518 --> 01:09:48,855
Carl, we're sorry.
We all lost our heads the other night.

861
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:25,100
What's Carl doing here?

862
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:28,728
- Look.
- That's Carl.

863
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,608
Oh, my God. It's Carl.

864
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,653
- Hey, Carl, what's going down?
- Hey, what happened?

865
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:44,494
Hi.

866
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:58,758
Lincoln, the gun.

867
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:01,970
I don't know what's wrong with him.

868
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:06,975
Sure, Ed. The gun, Ed.
The public relations, Ed.

869
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:26,786
How you doing, soldier?

870
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:34,711
Tonight we're here to talk about a problem
that has been with New Granada...

871
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,463
...since its incorporation.

872
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:41,801
Youth crime.
That is to say, youth discipline.

873
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,972
I think it would be a mistake for us
to tell ourselves...

874
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:50,894
...that yesterday's tragic event
was an isolated incident.

875
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,271
All of us who are parents
know what it's like...

876
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:57,359
...to wait up for a child who's out late,
to wait for the phone to ring...

877
01:11:57,525 --> 01:12:01,112
...and then when it does,
to be a little afraid to answer it.

878
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:03,365
- Hey, it's Claude.
- Claude!

879
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:05,492
Good to meet you, Claude.

880
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,788
- Hey, man, are you all right?
- Yeah.

881
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:12,290
- Your parents get mad at you?
- Ah, the usual.

882
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:14,167
Same old thing, you know.

883
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,044
You think Doberman will get fired?

884
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:18,630
Ah, hell, fire him.
They'll give him a medal.

885
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,840
Yeah, he's gonna make
a big speech tonight...

886
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:23,134
...and tell how he shot Richie
in self-defense.

887
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:26,221
- Yeah!
- It's all a bunch of crap!

888
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,972
- Right!
- Yeah!

889
01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:32,143
- And all our parents are there to hear it.
- And there ain't nothing we can do about it.

890
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,854
We should go down there
and tell them all to go to hell.

891
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,190
Everybody who's ever messed with me
in one room.

892
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:39,734
That'd be just about everybody in town.

893
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,826
Thank you.

894
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:50,078
First of all...

895
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:53,832
...I certainly expected to see
a few more people here tonight.

896
01:12:53,998 --> 01:12:56,501
As a matter of fact,
this turnout is really pathetic.

897
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,755
I wonder where all those parents are.

898
01:13:00,922 --> 01:13:03,591
What are they doing that's so important?

899
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:07,595
If the death of a 14-year-old boy won't
get them away from their television sets...

900
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:10,348
...for a meeting like this,
I don't think anything will.

901
01:13:10,515 --> 01:13:14,019
It's that kind of apathy that got us
into this mess in the first place...

902
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,729
...as I think we all know.

903
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:20,066
At least, those of us who did bother
to show up at this meeting tonight.

904
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:24,070
Well, I guess we all realize...

905
01:13:24,237 --> 01:13:28,158
...it's time for some tough talk
about the kids in this city.

906
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:09,574
Man, one stick of dynamite would do it.

907
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:13,453
I don't know how many of us
are willing to admit...

908
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,957
...just how deep in trouble
some of the kids in this city are.

909
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:26,549
I don't know how many of you know it,
but right here in New Granada...

910
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:30,679
...we've got one of the highest rates
of vandalism in the state.

911
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:33,473
In a few moments,
Sergeant Doberman is going to tell us...

912
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:36,351
...some of the recommendations
of the police department...

913
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:40,689
...a few measures for dealing with
the problem and preventing future tragedies.

914
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:12,220
As we all know, New Granada is a...
A unique place.

915
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,848
That's why we've all chosen to live here.

916
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:17,225
People don't move into
a planned community...

917
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:20,729
...to be pushed around
and scared to go out at night.

918
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:23,898
They come here to get away
from that sort of thing.

919
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:28,695
And if we're asking them to move here,
then we owe them that security.

920
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:31,823
Now, this isn't just
a New Granada problem.

921
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:36,578
I've talked to city managers and councilmen
and mayors all over the country...

922
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:40,790
...and heard that same stuff about the kids
over and over again.

923
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:44,044
So it isn't as if New Granada
is some kind of a freak...

924
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:46,671
...but we are right on the firing line...

925
01:15:46,838 --> 01:15:50,133
...and we've gotta
meet this problem head-on.

926
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:55,096
We aren't anywhere near our growth factor
in our master plan this year...

927
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,058
...and if we don't grow,
we don't succeed.

928
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:00,060
Now, you think about it.

929
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:02,228
Just the other day,
I passed by the Supreme.

930
01:16:02,437 --> 01:16:06,107
I can remember when that was
our finest apartment house.

931
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:10,904
Three hundred units.
Spacious, decorated, electric kitchens...

932
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:12,906
Where you going?

933
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,283
You leaving?

934
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,494
What?

935
01:16:18,995 --> 01:16:21,539
I deeply regret what happened yesterday.

936
01:16:21,706 --> 01:16:23,833
No one wants to shoot a kid.

937
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,296
This is the last thing that any police officer
wants to happen to him in the line of duty.

938
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:31,341
I did not come here to apologize.

939
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,301
I am sorry.

940
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:35,929
Sorry that he was carrying a handgun.

941
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:38,181
Sorry that he was on drugs.

942
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:41,393
Any other kids in there?

943
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:46,481
There's no way for a kid on drugs
to learn anything.

944
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:50,527
A kid in the classroom on drugs,
that classroom does not exist for him.

945
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,823
There is no way for a kid on drugs
to grow up.

946
01:16:55,740 --> 01:17:02,163
So I'm sorry about Richie White and his
friends pushing pills and pot and angel dust.

947
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:06,793
The first thing we've got to do
is have an early curfew...

948
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,755
...and the second thing we have to do
is close down the places...

949
01:17:10,922 --> 01:17:12,882
...where they've been
selling these drugs.

950
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:15,885
And we took an important step
in that direction yesterday...

951
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:17,929
...when we closed down the teen center.

952
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:21,391
Sergeant, is it true that Richie White's gun
wasn't loaded?

953
01:17:22,434 --> 01:17:26,438
- When somebody points a gun at you...
- Answer the question! Was the gun loaded?

954
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:29,566
Well, how the hell
was I supposed to know?!

955
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:31,234
I don't even think he knew!

956
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:34,821
That kid was violent, wild! You never knew
what he was gonna do next!

957
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:37,741
- Come on.
- All he did was hang around that rec center!

958
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:40,827
And I think you've got some things
to answer for yourself!

959
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:43,621
You have contributed to the problem
of these teenagers!

960
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:46,207
All I have done to these teenagers
is listen to them!

961
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:47,584
Somebody's got a handgun...

962
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:51,463
If I see a person carrying a handgun,
he better have a goddamn good reason!

963
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:53,798
Yeah, like you do, right?

964
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:55,550
Miss Vogel, please. Now, please.

965
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:58,219
Just... Everybody needs to calm down
here for a minute.

966
01:17:58,386 --> 01:18:00,221
I know you've been under a strain, Ed.

967
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:02,891
I appreciate your concern.
We're all concerned here.

968
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,477
But I think we've gotten away
from the main point...

969
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:08,563
...which is that a community
with a juvenile crime problem...

970
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,940
...is not a community
with a high property value.

971
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:13,276
I am interested in the health
of this community.

972
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:14,778
Ed, it's okay. It's okay.

973
01:18:14,944 --> 01:18:17,822
You can have the finest housing
in the world, and we do...

974
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:21,993
...but nobody's gonna pay 80, $ 100,000
to live in a decorator-colored slum.

975
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:26,790
Jerry, can I ask you a question?
What the hell are you talking about?

976
01:18:27,415 --> 01:18:29,709
What do you mean?
I'm talking about the problem.

977
01:18:29,876 --> 01:18:32,253
Yeah, but which problem?
The problem with the kids...

978
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,297
...or the problem with resale values?

979
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:38,468
What makes you think if you shut
the rec down or you put a curfew on kids...

980
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:41,012
...the problem's gonna fly away?

981
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:45,725
- Now, I know you've been upset lately.
- That's right. I'm goddamn upset!

982
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:49,187
My son ran away, and I don't know
where he is tonight! I'm upset!

983
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,023
Your son and some of his friends
are part of this problem.

984
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:56,695
Goddamn it, Jerry, my son and his friends
are part of this goddamn town!

985
01:18:56,861 --> 01:19:00,573
And you people talk about these kids
like they're animals running in the street!

986
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,701
Have you sat down
and talked to your kids?

987
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:05,286
- Has anyone talked to these kids?
- I talk to them!

988
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:08,123
I talk to them six hours a day
until I'm blue in the face!

989
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:10,834
I spend more time with your kids
than you people do.

990
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,169
You think those kids are interested
in learning?

991
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:15,338
Come in and see what goes on
in a classroom.

992
01:19:15,505 --> 01:19:18,049
But no, when we have open school week,
nobody comes.

993
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:20,760
And that includes you, Mr. Willat!

994
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:23,680
Why is everybody pointing fingers
at these kids?

995
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:27,559
What, are they all rotten, and we're good?
What is it, what's going on?

996
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:31,354
- I don't think Jerry meant we don't care...
- The problem is Jerry does not care!

997
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:33,815
I think it's highly inappropriate for us...

998
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:05,847
Eat it, you stinking pig.

999
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,601
We've got a situation out here.
Keep these people calm.

1000
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,687
People! People! People!

1001
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:15,732
We seem to have a situation here!

1002
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:18,902
Please be quiet... Get on the door.
We've got a situation...

1003
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:24,282
Sergeant Doberman will be right back!

1004
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:26,618
That's your goddamn kid out there,
Mr. Willat.

1005
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:28,286
I know the door's locked!

1006
01:20:28,745 --> 01:20:32,540
We got a minor situation out here!
All the doors are locked!

1007
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:34,626
Your kids have locked us in!

1008
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,925
All right, please.
I know how we can handle it.

1009
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:45,428
You people got me acting crazy!
Now, relax!

1010
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,226
It's your kids out there. They got us
surrounded. We're gonna handle it.

1011
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:56,106
It's your fault. I don't know what the hell
we were in here for.

1012
01:20:56,606 --> 01:20:59,025
Carl! Carl!

1013
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,736
Carl! I know you're out there! Carl!

1014
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:09,411
Carl! You have to answer me, son!

1015
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:18,837
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1016
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:22,716
Extra, extra! Read all about it!
Kids trash the school!

1017
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:43,778
They've got guns!

1018
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:46,281
They've got guns!

1019
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:49,034
Sergeant! Do something!
They've got guns!

1020
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,871
Hysteria isn't gonna get us out.
Please be quiet! Will you please be quiet?

1021
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,706
Goddamn it, be quiet!

1022
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:58,418
{y:i}Mother, dear, go to your bedroom.

1023
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:02,756
{y:i}- Go. You better go.
{y:i}- Stop hanging out in the bathroom.

1024
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:05,759
Practice your piano.

1025
01:22:05,925 --> 01:22:09,429
- You need practice on it!
- Go to hell!

1026
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:42,504
Keep cool! Keep cool!
Everybody bear with me.

1027
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,631
The situation's under control.

1028
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:49,969
Mr. Cole. Mr. Cole, bear with me.
Everything is under control.

1029
01:22:50,136 --> 01:22:53,264
I can assure you,
everything is under control.

1030
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:00,313
I don't believe it, man.
It's a wreck.

1031
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,066
We got them swimming in pain!

1032
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:16,079
Hey! Wait!

1033
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:21,626
Carl? Hey!

1034
01:23:36,891 --> 01:23:42,230
Relax! Hold it. Hold it.
Please relax. Bear with me!

1035
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:44,607
Everything's all right.

1036
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:47,527
Be cool, everything's all right,
we'll get out of here.

1037
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:23,229
Johnny?

1038
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:25,106
Johnny!

1039
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,701
Hi.

1040
01:24:37,535 --> 01:24:39,287
Would you do me a favor?

1041
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,582
Would you get me that phone in there?

1042
01:25:01,434 --> 01:25:03,478
Would you dial zero?

1043
01:25:08,566 --> 01:25:09,901
Thanks.

1044
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:30,338
Carl! Hey, Carl!

1045
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:32,507
Come grab yourself some tapes, man!

1046
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:36,511
I've had enough.

1047
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:45,270
Claude!

1048
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:47,188
Claude!

1049
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:52,152
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Oh, I almost got blown up.

1050
01:25:52,318 --> 01:25:54,029
Have you seen Carl?

1051
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:56,031
Not since he was with you.

1052
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:58,116
God, I wish I could find him.

1053
01:25:58,283 --> 01:26:00,243
I just wanna go home.

1054
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:03,204
Come on. I'll take you home.

1055
01:26:06,374 --> 01:26:08,168
You'll be okay.

1056
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:18,553
- Abby!
- What?

1057
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:21,806
- Have you seen Cory?
- No, I haven't seen her. I think she left.

1058
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,827
Holy Christ!

1059
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:55,423
I'm taking your car!

1060
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,343
I want your men to pick up every little punk
on the street!

1061
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:01,179
Round them up and get them out!
I don't care if they're 6!

1062
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:03,807
Ed! Ed! Damn it! Wait up, Ed!

1063
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:07,686
Under the circumstances, don't you think
you ought to let these men handle it?

1064
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:12,649
Ed! Listen, in light of yesterday's tragedy,
I think your presence might...

1065
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:15,694
You are in no fit shape to take...

1066
01:27:39,884 --> 01:27:42,095
{y:i}I see you, Carl Willat!

1067
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,180
{y:i}Hold it right there!

1068
01:27:44,347 --> 01:27:46,766
{y:i}Don't be a fool like Richie.

1069
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:51,438
{y:i}Don't make a move, don't be a fool,
{y:i}don't run like Richie did. Hold it right there!

1070
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:55,150
{y:i}Don't make a move or I'll nail you.

1071
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:26,556
They're gonna send you up to the hill
for a couple of weeks.

1072
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:28,975
And then you're gonna come home...

1073
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:32,437
...and then it's up to you,
and I hope you make the right decision.

1074
01:28:32,604 --> 01:28:35,523
I hope you make the right choices.
I really do.
