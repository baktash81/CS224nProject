Did you see Jeter's homer on Saturday?
Guy's got some swing, man.

10
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,008
Yeah, I was there.

11
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,985
Yeah? It was a good one
to have been at.

12
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,382
It was.

13
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,922
<i>... part of the ongoing slump</i>

Anybody?

20
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,110
- Hey, rookie. How's it going today, man?
- It's going good.

21
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,185
All right.

22
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,516
- Hey, Willy.
- Yeah.

23
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,689
I like those shorts.
They're real sharp, you know.

24
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,758
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,656
- 12 bucks at Target. Yeah.
- Yeah?

26
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,729
Do they make them for men, too?

27
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,063
I'm not the one who puts
a gallon of pomade in my hair, Pezzulo.

28
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,048
Attention.

Roll call working Tuesday,
September 11.

Tour Commander

32
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,789
Patrol Sergeant, you're looking at him.

33
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,486
- Stolzman.
- Sarge.

34
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,961
- Post one. Colovito.
- Sarge.

35
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,532

Nine.

41
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,403
- Lieutenant, you got anything?
- No.

42
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,570
Inspector Fields has something to say.

43
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,580
Listen up. Be on the lookout for this girl.

44
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,049
Zoey Cowley.

45
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,481
Age 11, runaway out of Rhode Island.

46
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,216
Thought to be on a bus
coming in this morning.

47
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,416
This is important. Okay.

48
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,694
As always, protect yourselves.
Watch each other's backs.

49
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,363
Hear about who Giraldi
brought in yesterday?

50
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,434
No, who?

51
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,693
I'll give you one guess.

52
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,864
She's 300 pounds, her dress is
a trash bag with bugs all over it.

53
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,998
Gloria, the "Naked Lady"?

54
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,574
Yeah, and Giraldi said
she asked for you.

55
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,179
You love it, huh?

56
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,746
- I'll catch you at break.
- Yeah.

57
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,566
Hey, Jethro. Jethro.

58
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,029
Hey, how many times I gotta tell you?

59
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,797
You got to take your crew
and your junk out to Ninth.

60
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:52,962
It's a free country, man.

61
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,063
- This is my statue.
- What are you, the statue police?

62
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,335
It's the Jackie Gleason statue.
It's not a bench.

63
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,035
He don't care. He's dead, man.

64
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,942
Get out of here. Get out of here.

65
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,354
Excuse me.

66
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,420
I wonder if I might help you out today
with, like, a taxi or get you a hotel?

67
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,365
Maybe I can help you out with your bag,
you know.

68
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,769
Hello, Officer? Where find bus center?

69
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,274
Hey, Amoroso.

70
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,351
- How you doing?
- How's it going, man?

71
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,013
To be honest, I miss the bus terminal.

72
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,021
- Yeah, what do you got today?
- Loading docks.

73
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,422
Loading docks?
That shipment come in from...

74
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,630
What the...

75
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,737
<i>BT, all units. 8-40. 8-40, ASAP.</i>

76
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,009
<i>BT, all units. 8-40, ASAP.</i>

77
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,075
<i>All units, BT 8-40. 8-40, ASAP.</i>

78
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,487
Excuse me.

79
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,025
Hey, something's up.

80
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,995
<i>We have unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>this morning</i>

81
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,465
<i>that a plane has crashed into one of</i>
<i>the towers of the World Trade Center.</i>

82
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,900
<i>- CNN Center right now...</i>
- Holy shit.

83
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,800
<i>... work on this story, calling our sources</i>

84
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,601
<i>and trying to figure out</i>
<i>exactly what happened, but, clearly,</i>

85
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,802
<i>something relatively devastating</i>
<i>happening this morning there.</i>

86
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,074
<i>We're going to join</i>
<i>another one of our New York affiliates</i>

87
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,341
<i>for their live coverage.</i>

88
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:48,648
<i>Here at the top of this tower, there's</i>
<i>a huge, gaping hole, flames still inside.</i>

89
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,016
Can you believe this?

90
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,216
What schmuck would fly a plane
into the Trade Center?

91
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,524
Maybe they ran out of gas or something.

92
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,531
Yeah, Colovito. Right.

93
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,726
Maybe some jerk-off forgot
which lever to pull on his twin-engine.

94
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,769
That's not a small plane.

95
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,499
Hell, no.

96
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,734
All right, listen up!

97
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,534
Let me have your attention here!

98
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,380
They're telling us it's a commuter plane.

99
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,015
Tower One is being evacuated
as a precaution.

100
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,850
They've asked us to send
a team down to assist.

101
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,943
Sergeant McLoughlin.

102
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,613
I've got a list of names here.

103
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,852
Step out when you hear it.
We're going downtown.

104
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,355

114
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,639
Stolzman.

115
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,410
Hold it right there! Pull it over!

116
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,784
<i>Command post on the air?</i>
<i>Command post.</i>

117
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,518
<i>Field command post. Are there any</i>
<i>injuries going to any particular hospital?</i>

118
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,921
<i>Chief on the air. Go ahead.</i>

119
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:09,134
Come on, everybody. Off the bus.
Get off the bus. Step this way.

120
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,634
I'm gonna cut across
Bleecker to Seventh. Stay close.

121
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,830
You got it.

122
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,269
<i>Central. Mobilization point</i>
<i>is gonna be Pike and South.</i>

123
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,511
<i>That was to evacuate One Police Plaza</i>

124
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,178
<i>at the Gracie Mansion, the Municipal</i>
<i>Building, and any potential targets.</i>

125
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,050
<i>Who is advising this?</i>

126
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,851
<i>Central units, the mobilization point</i>
<i>is now South and Pike.</i>

127
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,893
Yeah. No, no, I got it.

128
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,259
Hey, guys, you won't believe this!

129
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,859
My wife says the other one got hit,
the other tower.

130
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,733
How the hell did the other tower get hit?

131
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,000
She was listening to HOT 97
and they said it.

132
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,407
What? Who gets their news
from HOT 97?

133
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,540
- I told you it was no damn private plane.
- No, I got it.

134
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,984
What special equipment
we got down there?

135
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,415
- What?
- We're prepared for everything.

136
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:09,290
Car bombs, chemical, biological,
an attack from the top.

137
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,423
But not this. Not for something this size.

138
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,158
There's no plan. We didn't make it.

139
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,965
<i>Only emergency transmissions</i>
<i>on this frequency.</i>

140
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,464
<i>All right, all emergency personnel</i>

141
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,975
<i>respond to Vesey and West.</i>

142
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,604
<i>All emergency service units,</i>
<i>please go to Vesey and West.</i>

143
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,710
There could be 50,
60,000 people in there.

144
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,863
<i>Units on West Street to use caution.</i>

145
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,401
<i>Debris is falling from the building</i>
<i>on West Street.</i>

146
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,333
Hey! Looks like
Tower Two did take a hit.

147
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,273
What did I tell you?

148
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,700
No, no, that's the smoke blowing over
from Tower One.

149
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,837
All right, that's enough.
Everybody sit down. Now!

150
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,615
Yo, Dom, let me see your phone
for a sec, yeah?

151
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,010
Hey, let me see your phone.
I got to call Allison.

152
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,417
It's not working!

153
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,588
Nothing's going through.

154
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,691
<i>Emergency service vehicles</i>
<i>are also responding.</i>

155
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,731
Hey, take it easy, will you? Jesus!

156
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,931
- This is gonna be a bitch.
- Relax.

157
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,008
Well, I'm just saying
that it looks like it's gonna...

158
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,236
You think they're bringing you
down there to scratch your ass?

159
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,936
McLoughlin will tell you what to do.

160
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,070
Why the Sarge?

161
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,046
He was Emergency Services
at the Trade Tower.

162
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,845
He's one of the guys who came up
with a plan after the attack in '93.

163
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,113
Anybody knows what to do down there,
it's him.

164
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,882
<i>Command to Division One.</i>

165
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,715
<i>Does anyone over</i>
<i>in Tower One hear me?</i>

166
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,655
<i>Okay, make the turn on Broadway.</i>

00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,322
<i>Go down West Broadway.</i>
<i>We'll meet you outside Five.</i>

<i>Send everything you got</i>
<i>to the World Trade Center now.</i>

00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,106
We got to get that building evacuated!

171
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,542
<i>Which tower?</i>
<i>Which tower are we responding to?</i>

172
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,104
- I got to get a team to go up!
- I'll check in with headquarters.

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,310
<i>Roll every available ambulance you got</i>
<i>to this position.</i>

174
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>Fire out on the north side.</i>

175
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,990
<i>They're now coming out</i>
<i>of the west side</i>

176
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,061
<i>of the World Trade Center.</i>

177
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,161
All right, everybody stay here. I'm gonna
find out what the hell's going on.

178
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,234
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,115
Oh, my God.

180
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,320
Nothing's gonna help them.

181
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,921
No, we'll get up there.

182
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,330
How are you gonna save people
that high up? It's impossible.

183
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,959
We got to try.

184
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,196
Sarge!

185
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,604
Officer? Officer?

186
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,342
The daycare center.
There's kids there. Over there.

187
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,177
Hey, Sarge! There's kids in the...

188
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,650
Yeah, at the daycare at Five.
I know, they got them out.

189
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,815
- Okay, listen up. Where's Kassimatis?
- He's looking for you, Sarge.

190
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,789
We got to evacuate the Tower.

191
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,924
Who knows how to use a Scott Pak?
And don't give me any PBA bullshit.

192
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,965
Hey, Sarge, to tell you the truth,
I haven't used one in like four years.

193
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,761
Look, what did I just say?

194
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,766
Who's coming?

195
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,371
Step forward.

196
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,870
I got it, Sarge.

197
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,405
I'll go.

198
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,752
I'm with you, Sarge.

199
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,618
All right.

200
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,719
All right, we got a team.

201
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,059
We're headed into Building Five.
The rest of you wait for Kassimatis.

202
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,962
Follow me. Stay together.

203
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,844
- Jimeno.
- Sarge.

204
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,575
Take everyone's memo books,
nightsticks, hats. They're useless here.

205
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,781
Put them in the Suburban.
It's over on Church and Vesey.

206
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,617
And meet us back at the police desk
in the lobby of Five. You got it?

207
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,315
Which one's Five?

208
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,124
There's two towers.

209
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,761
North tower is One. South tower is Two.

210
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,627
Right behind it, there's Five,
right in front of us,

211
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,030
which is where the police desk is.

212
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,102
Take the alley. Hurry up. Hey!

213
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,701
Let's go.

214
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,875
They're all dying!

215
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,214
They're all dying!

216
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,662
Grab those bottles.

217
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,961
Get the helmets.

218
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,970
<i>People trapped at 87th and 89th floors.</i>

219
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,200
<i>10-4. They're getting a TVpicture</i>
<i>with numerous injuries.</i>

220
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,072
<i>Numerous injuries out there.</i>

221
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,676
Okay, turn them on.
Double check. Test them.

222
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,316
Massi? Anything more here?
Helmets? Scott Paks?

223
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,616
No, Sarge. Try the E room
near the truck docks in the basement.

224
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,053
Jimmy Lynch is down there.

225
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,887
Thanks.

226
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,389
Okay, there's more stuff down on B-1,
the truck docks.

227
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,999
We'll drop down to the Concourse,
go around One to Two,

228
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,000
and there's some stairs there.

229
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,600
Keep your eyes open. Follow me.
Don't get separated, okay?

230
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,764
Well, Sarge, we got plenty here.

231
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,501
Hundred and ten floors. Fire with fuel.

232
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,203
We're gonna be using up bottles.
We need them.

233
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,412
Sarge, you won't believe this.

234
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,215
Your Suburban on Church? It's gone.
Roof smashed in.

235
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,421
Stay together and stay focused.

236
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,152
- Yo, Dom, where we going?
- Sarge wants more stuff.

237
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,422
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

238
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,225
He knows what he's doing.

239
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,023
What the...

240
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,532
Don't think. Keep moving.

241
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,227
Jesus, Sarge, we got to get up there.

242
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,134
You aren't rescuing anybody
if you can't breathe, Rodrigues.

243
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,672
Stay focused.

244
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,549
This way.

245
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,481
Where's the fire?

246
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,128
Now you're talking.
Got the BT dogs up in here.

247
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,070
What's up, Sarge?
Sarge, I'm telling you we got to get up.

248
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,663
There's a ton of people stuck up there.

249
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,265
- We're going up.
- Yeah? I gotta go with you.

250
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,311
- Sure, Chris. We can use you.
- Yeah?

251
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,744
We need more equipment.
Get a tank on.

252
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,008
A-Rod!

253
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,644
Yo, what's up, Chris?

254
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,845
Yo, what happened to your eye, man?
What happened to your eye?

255
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:56,943
I was carrying this woman out,

256
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,545
something whacked me
in the freaking head.

257
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,750
- She okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got her clear.

258
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,295
Hey, hey, Sarge, we ain't gonna find
any equipment left in One.

259
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,596
- Coming through. Coming through.
- Excuse us. Thanks a lot.

260
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,134
Lynch has got gear down
at the B-1 truck docks next to Two.

261
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,397
There's a staircase right over there
at Ben & Jerry's.

262
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,473
I heard they were
evacuating Two, Sarge.

263
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,565
Must have caught fire from One.

264
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,667
I heard Two got hit,
that there was a second plane.

265
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,179
No, Fields just said one plane,
Tower One. Now, stay together.

266
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,183
You see the TV?
There's a big fire up there.

267
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,811
There ain't no TVs down here.

268
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,288
You guys hear about the Pentagon?
It got hit. A missile or something.

269
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,360
Israel? It's gone. It's nuked.

270
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,156
Whole freaking world's
coming to an end today, Willy.

271
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,389
- Yo, Chris.
- Yeah.

272
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,898
- Nice timing on that transfer.
- Yeah, no kidding, right?

273
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,365
- Jimeno?
- Yeah.

274
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,394
You stay with the cart.

275
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,038
The rest of you, come with me.

276
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,176
Stay safe.

277
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,581
<i>We're receiving... On the 106th floor...</i>

278
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,217
<i>People are trapped at that location.</i>

279
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,397
<i>About five floors from the top,</i>

280
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,802
<i>there's at least 50 people hanging on.</i>

281
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,874
Hey.

282
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,136
Reynolds.

283
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,842
Bridge.

284
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,979
Jimeno. Bus terminal.

285
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,348
- You all right?
- Yeah. You helping evacuate?

286
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,548
Trying. Going up Two. You?

287
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,327
Up One. I'm waiting for my sarge.

288
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,693
Yeah. Well, it's gonna be a long day.

289
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,636
You'll be all right, kid.
A lot of good people here.

290
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,875
<i>Units, also be advised</i>

291
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,504
<i>that people are trapped</i>
<i>on that 60th floor.</i>

292
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,277
<i>Sixtieth floor,</i>
<i>people are trapped up there.</i>

293
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,748
<i>Stuck in the elevator,</i>

294
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,653
<i>the elevator shaft, and we're</i>
<i>chopping through the wall to get out.</i>

295
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,225
Okay, we got enough.

296
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,889
Tower One.

297
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,599
Let's go. Stay together.

298
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,694
<i>Okay, 10th floor.</i>

299
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,569
<i>We've knocked out that fire. We're in</i>
<i>the B stairs. We'll meet you over there.</i>

300
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,140
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>what kind of conditions you got.</i>

301
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,837
Lieutenant?

302
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,538
I was down on B-1.
The shafts there are buckling.

303
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,443
There's gonna be people trapped
in those elevators.

304
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,674
Jeez.

305
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,479
It just took us an hour to get up to 30
in Tower One.

306
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,450
Now they want us over in Two.

307
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,016
- What happened in Two?
- I don't know.

308
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,592
- You guys be careful, okay?
- Yeah, stay safe.

309
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,663
Hey, Will. Let me get that.

310
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,396
Thanks, man.

311
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,839
<i>8- 1, McLoughlin. What's your location?</i>

312
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,845
This is 8-1. We're in the Concourse.
We got gear and are heading to One.

313
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,573
<i>8- 1, 800, negative that.</i>

314
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,410
Rendezvous with me
out on Barclay Street. I got a team here.

315
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,044
<i>We'll all go up together.</i>

316
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,253
8-1, is something going on
with Tower Two?

317
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,580
Run!

318
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,624
The elevator shaft!

319
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,987
Anybody there?

320
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,064
Anyone there?

321
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,901
My legs!

322
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,775
Sound off!

323
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,843
Sound off!

324
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,913
Pezzulo!

325
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,516
Jimeno!

326
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,884
Rodrigues!

327
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,225
Chris!

328
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,262
Antonio.

329
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,067
Chris!

330
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,972
A-Rod!

331
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,106
Antonio!

332
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,578
They're gone.

333
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,544
They're in a better place, really.

334
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,054
All right.

335
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,162
What's everyone's situation?

336
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:11,457
What's everyone's situation?

337
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,594
I'm pinned. Bad.

338
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,559
I can't...

339
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,571
I can't move my legs.

340
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,034
I think I'm okay.

341
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,573
How you doing, Sarge?

342
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,238
I don't think I'm hurt, but I can't move.

343
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,382
I got some movement here.

344
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,392
8-13!

345
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,131
PAPD!

346
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,697
Officers Jimeno, Pezzulo

347
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,404
and McLoughlin are down.

348
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,075
We're trapped on the Concourse level

349
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,541
between Towers One and Two.

350
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,214
We're trapped near
freight elevator Five.

351
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,654
- Oh, thank God.
- It goes down to the B-1 truck dock.

352
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,747
Yeah, here you go. Get some air.

353
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,326
Get some air. Some fresh air.

354
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,065
You're okay, Willy. You're okay.

355
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,360
Got any radio?

356
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,134
Here you go.

357
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,129
No, mine's smashed. It's not working.

358
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,003
All my stuff on the left side is buried.
The mike's gone.

359
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,214
You got to get this...
You got to get this off of me.

360
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,882
It's good to see you, Dom.

361
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,115
Good to see you, Willy.

362
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,657
- You okay? You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

363
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,160
I'm going to get you out.
Don't worry about it.

364
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,357
I'm gonna get you out, Willy.

365
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,934
It's working, Sarge!

366
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,065
Dom's got us covered!

367
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,730
Good. That's good.

368
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,144
How'd you know to run in here, Sarge?

369
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,678
The elevator shaft's
the strongest part of the building.

370
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,517
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,117
How did this happen, Willy?

372
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,994
I'm gonna take care of you.

373
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,262
I'm gonna get you out, buddy.

374
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,071
Looks like there's light! Maybe some air!

375
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,637
I'd say about 20 feet up!

376
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,480
Hey!

377
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,415
8-13!

378
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,475
Officers down!

379
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,654
Hey!

380
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,661
- You ready?
- Come on.

381
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,870
Come on, Dom!

382
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,538
Oh, Jesus.

383
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,577
I can't get this off him by myself, Sarge.

384
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,885
Maybe I should go up and get some help
and then come back for you guys.

385
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,583
No! No! You're gonna get him out!

386
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,757
You're gonna get him out!

387
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,832
All right.

388
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,605
Here we go, Willy.

389
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,533
Come on!

390
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,652
I can't get you out, Willy.

391
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,586
Come on, Dom.

392
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,686
Don't leave us here.

393
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,064
Do me a favor.

394
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,872
You can do it. I know you can do it.

395
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,142
All right.

396
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,117
I'm going to get you out, Willy. All right?

397
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,218
I'll get you out. Yeah, I'll get you out.
All right.

398
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,579
Dom?

399
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,116
Dom?

400
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,523
I'm hurt.

401
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,634
Dom, it's me, Willy.

402
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,433
Look at me.

403
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,438
Stay awake.

404
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,374
Can I get a 3-8, Sarge?

405
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,151
Yeah, Dom. You take a break.

406
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,520
I'm dying, Willy.

407
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,753
No. No, you're not. Dom, stop this.

408
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,562
Don't forget
I really tried to save you guys.

409
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,673
I love you, Willy.

410
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,747
I love you, too, Dom.

411
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,939
Dom's gone.

412
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,505
Dom's gone!

413
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,147
I know.

414
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,126
Jimeno,

415
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,100
can you still see the light?

416
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,532
Can you still see the light?

417
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,493
Yeah.

418
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,130
Yeah!

419
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,270
How far up?

420
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:43,273
I don't know. Maybe 20 feet up.
There's still stuff in the way.

421
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,209
What else do you see?

422
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,820
Beams. Plaster. Nothing.

423
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,924
<i>It is with deep sadness and regret</i>

424
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,997
<i>that I have to advise you</i>
<i>that two hijacked planes</i>

425
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,632
<i>have crashed into the Twin Towers</i>
<i>of the World Trade Center...</i>

426
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,259
<i>... from what remains</i>
<i>of the World Trade Center for 9:00.</i>

427
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,305
<i>One airplane crashed into</i>
<i>World Trade Center Two.</i>

428
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,307
<i>About 15 minutes later, an airplane</i>
<i>crashed into the second one.</i>

429
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,139
<i>About an hour later,</i>
<i>both of them collapsed.</i>

430
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,779
<i>Associated Press is reporting</i>
<i>that a plane or helicopter</i>

431
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,873
<i>crashed at the Pentagon,</i>
<i>and the Pentagon is being evacuated.</i>

432
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:31,944
<i>Whether that fire is in the building itself</i>
<i>or outside, we have not yet confirmed.</i>

433
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,518
<i>This is a live picture of the Pentagon</i>

434
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:39,028
<i>and an Associated Press reporter says</i>
<i>he could see the tail of a large airliner</i>

435
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,098
<i>as it plowed into the Pentagon.</i>

436
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,064
<i>And that fire there in Washington</i>
<i>continues to burn.</i>

437
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,293
Bastards!

438
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,739
<i>... just a few minutes after that,</i>
<i>it wasn't very long,</i>

439
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:56,906
<i>you will see, it happened again.</i>
<i>The second tower came tumbling down.</i>

440
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,348
<i>That was the first tower collapse</i>
<i>that we just saw.</i>

441
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,017
<i>This is the collapse</i>
<i>of the second tower.</i>

442
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,581
<i>And so now, as we stand here,</i>
<i>both towers...</i>

443
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,526
<i>The tops of both towers are gone.</i>

444
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,653
Allison, let's sit outside.

445
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:17,200
<i>Behind somewhere that plume of smoke</i>
<i>that continues to rise over the...</i>

446
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,401
He's probably still at the bus terminal.

447
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:23,701
<i>What is left of those buildings,</i>
<i>we cannot tell you.</i>

448
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,898
<i>We cannot tell you.</i>

449
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,171
<i>- Allison.</i>
- Jerry.

450
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,410
Al, I'm looking at the Tunnel.

451
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,843
There's no one there.

452
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,978
<i>No Port Authorities there.</i>

453
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,589
Al, I don't...

454
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,924
I guess they got called in.

455
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,057
<i>Can you get someone to drive you?</i>

456
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,693
<i>- Allison?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,841
<i>Okay, I'll see you at home</i>
<i>in half an hour.</i>

458
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,471
I'll call Mom and Dad.

459
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,049
Okay.

460
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,513
We got to pick up Bianca.

461
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,755
<i>Both towers came down,</i>
<i>trapping thousands</i>

462
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,883
<i>and thousands of people inside.</i>

463
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,790
<i>We do not know the numbers yet,</i>

464
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:22,298
<i>but we do know thousands of people</i>
<i>work inside those buildings.</i>

465
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,526
<i>That... The buildings are gone.</i>

466
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,570
<i>There are reports</i>
<i>that hundreds and hundreds</i>

467
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,698
<i>of fire and police and rescue crews</i>

468
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,535
<i>are missing or unaccounted for.</i>

469
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,910
<i>Officials seem simply stunned</i>
<i>by the scale of the losses...</i>

470
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,075
They keep showing the same thing
over and over and over.

471
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,413
Jay's there.

472
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,489
They must have called in
every company in the city.

473
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,386
He would have been there early.

474
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,459
Yeah, John, too, probably.

475
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,220
He knows those buildings so well.

476
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,659
<i>They've seen something</i>
<i>no one has ever seen before.</i>

477
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,290
<i>One man who came by said</i>

478
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,232
<i>he had seen this building come down.</i>

479
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,805
<i>It looked as though it was imploding.</i>

480
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:07,071
<i>This was complete chaos and utter hell</i>
<i>that has come to Lower Manhattan.</i>

481
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,577
Oh, my God.

482
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,682
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.

483
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,047
They evacuated those buildings.
All right?

484
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,620
I'm sure most everybody got out.
They're fine.

485
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,558
In the '93 attack,
John said everybody got out real quick.

486
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,326
God. In '93,
the buildings didn't fall down.

487
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,295
All right, well,
I'm going to call everybody and cancel.

488
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:38,364
A Den Mothers meeting right now
sounds pretty dumb, right?

489
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,384
I keep looking for John.

490
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,081
There's so many policemen
running around.

491
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,882
Maybe I'll see him.

492
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,961
- Judy.
- Yeah?

493
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,221
Judy...

494
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,023
- They're here to tell us they're dead.
- No.

495
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,719
No, they're not. They're not.

496
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,067
- Hey, Judy. Jay...
- No. No.

497
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,703
Look, we know he's alive. All right?

498
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,574
They know where he is.
They're communicating with him.

499
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,312
He's alive?

500
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,217
Yes. Yeah, we're gonna go
down there now and help out.

501
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,949
- Oh, thank God.
- Yes!

502
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,650
There you go.

503
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,524
- Thank God. Oh, my God.
- There you go.

504
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,153
Oh, that's good.

505
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,463
- That's good.
- Thank you, God.

506
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,472
PAPD.

507
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,538
8-13.

508
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,211
Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.

509
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,574
We're trapped near
the FE Five vestibule.

510
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,720
Will you please work?

511
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,823
I'm so thirsty.

512
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,433
You're not kidding.

513
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,060
My mouth feels like a beach.

514
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,435
- How's your pain?
- Comes in waves.

515
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,943
Every 20, 30 minutes.

516
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,981
Every wave, I feel the pain less.

517
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,321
But I'm more numb.

518
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,455
The number I get
the more I want to sleep.

519
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,222
What's wrong with sleep?

520
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,833
I wish I could
so this pain would go away.

521
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,901
You're bleeding inside, Will.

522
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,236
You sleep, you don't know
if you're coming back.

523
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,042
Awake, at least you got a shot.

524
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,314
Your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.

525
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,719
That's what I think, anyway.

526
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,553
You know that movie, <i>G.I. Jane?</i>

527
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,387
What's-her-name?

528
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,691
- Yeah, Demi Moore.
- Yeah.

529
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,296
You know the part where
the drill sergeant says,

530
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:58,301
"Pain is good. Pain is your friend.
If you're feeling pain you're still alive"?

531
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,178
I didn't see the movie.

532
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,615
I keep thinking of that line.

533
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,951
Pain is your friend.

534
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,045
It means you're alive.

535
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,550
We'll make it, Will.

536
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,323
Just don't go to sleep.

537
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,436
Sarge, I got a fire here!

538
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,730
Sarge!

539
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,174
There's nothing I can do here!

540
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,705
Sarge!

541
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,921
I'm burning! I'm burning!

542
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,472
Please God.

543
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,406
Where'd that wind come from
all of a sudden, Sarge?

544
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,875
I don't know.

545
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,044
The fire just goes out like that, Sarge?

546
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,282
Why's that?

547
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,682
I don't know.

548
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,048
You're not a big talker, are you?

549
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,352
No.

550
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,621
Well, see, you got to talk to me 'cause...

551
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:36,027
I can't,
'cause my knees are crushed together!

552
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,241
That's why I can't fucking talk!

553
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,139
Oh, God!

554
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,345
Oh, God. Oh, God.

555
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,714
Holy shit!

556
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,752
Dom's gun is cooking off!

557
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,122
Will!

558
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,707
Will! Will, that's it!
All the rounds got to be done, Will.

559
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,733
I can't believe this is happening!

560
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,872
- Not in my whole goddamn life!
- Breathe, Will.

561
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,311
Come on, breathe.

562
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,617
Get your mind right!

563
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,222
<i>Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.</i>

564
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,036
<i>... Pennsylvania. This is where</i>
<i>the United Airlines flight,</i>

565
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,435
<i>I believe it is 176...</i>

566
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,566
<i>I'm sorry, I'm correcting...</i>
<i>United Airlines 93...</i>

567
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,544
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can't make</i>
<i>that kind of assessment yet.</i>

568
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,908
- We just...
- Is that Allison Jimeno?

569
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,346
We grew up together.
Let me talk to her.

570
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,949
Al, it's Brian. I just got in.

571
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,953
- Hi, Brian.
<i>- Allison,</i>

572
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,722
listen, they sent Will down on a bus
with a bunch of the guys.

573
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,685
- So he did go down there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

574
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,399
And did he go in the buildings?

575
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,200
We don't know.

576
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,800
Brian, did he go in the buildings
or did he not go in the buildings?

577
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,638
<i>We're trying to find that out.</i>

578
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:25,147
It's very basic.
Did he go in or did he not go in?

579
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,783
<i>Allison, I'll call you</i>
<i>as soon as we know.</i>

580
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,180
Bianca? Sweetie, I'm sorry.

581
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,621
Brian, I... Brian, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

582
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:35,783
- I'll take Bianca to my place.
- No.

583
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,224
- I'll keep her here. I wanna...
- My parents are there.

584
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,785
They'll take care of her. Okay?
She'll be five houses away.

585
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,865
Want to go play?

586
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,001
<i>... shards of metal coming past...</i>

587
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,160
Brian?

588
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,704
<i>President Bush was in Florida</i>
<i>when the attacks began.</i>

589
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,537
<i>He spoke a short time ago</i>
<i>from an Air Force base in Louisiana.</i>

590
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,134
<i>Here's some of what the President said.</i>

591
00:46:55,245 --> 00:47:00,342
<i>The resolve of our great nation</i>
<i>is being tested.</i>

592
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:05,720
<i>But make no mistake, we will show</i>
<i>the world that we will pass this test.</i>

593
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,216
<i>God bless.</i>

594
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,815
<i>We're told the President's plane</i>
<i>has flown on,</i>

595
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,394
<i>but for security reasons,</i>

596
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,363
<i>the government will not say where</i>
<i>Mr. Bush is going or for how long.</i>

597
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:18,957
I don't know if you guys know it yet,
but this country's at war.

598
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,029
Pastor, I gotta go down there.

599
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,231
- Where?
- New York.

600
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:00,241
You can't. Only emergency responders
are being allowed in.

601
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,717
I've spent my best years
with the Marines.

602
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,883
God gave me a gift
to be able to help people,

603
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,685
to defend our country.

604
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,026
And I feel him calling on me now
for this mission.

605
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,232
Then find a way to listen, Dave.

606
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,271
<i>I'll leave that to you</i>
<i>to determine just how widespread</i>

607
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:40,647
<i>the human loss will be</i>
<i>in New York City alone.</i>

608
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,515
<i>America has changed today.</i>
<i>This is a dark day in this country.</i>

609
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:50,149
<i>It's in bold print in future history books</i>

610
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:53,854
<i>about how America was attacked</i>
<i>within its continental borders</i>

611
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:56,397
<i>to devastating effect by terrorists</i>

612
00:48:56,498 --> 00:49:00,867
<i>in a coordinated assault</i>
<i>using hijacked civilian airliners.</i>

613
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:04,031
- Hey, Mom?
- Yes, sweetie.

614
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:06,869
Dad knows it's
my birthday party Saturday, right?

615
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:10,042
Your birthday, are you crazy?
Of course he does.

616
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:11,237
He's just...

617
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:14,839
He's still working to help people
at the disaster at the Trade Center.

618
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,317
But they keep saying a lot
of those people aren't coming back.

619
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:23,823
I'm not supposed to tell you this, okay?

620
00:49:24,326 --> 00:49:27,193
But he told me that he was gonna
take you to the playoffs next month.

621
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:30,197
- The playoffs? Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

622
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:32,893
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? I knew it.
I knew he was going to.

623
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:34,970
Mom, you better come here.

624
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,243
Stay here, okay?

625
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:51,748
What's wrong?

626
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:53,919
Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.

627
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:57,789
If anything happens to one of them,
they go and tell the other family.

628
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,226
Are you here to tell me something?

629
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:10,128
Don't come in here, Pat. I mean it.
Don't you come into this house.

630
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:11,638
Donna, he's not.

631
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:13,535
We don't know. We don't know.

632
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:16,076
They've declared him as missing,
that's all. He's just missing.

633
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,612
I know. I know. I'm with you. Come here.

634
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:20,675
I know.

635
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:27,082
We got confirmation. John went in.

636
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:44,265
Oh, Dad.

637
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,507
It's okay, baby.

638
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:52,409
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

639
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:55,984
Hey. Hey.

640
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,419
Will's a tough nut. He's gonna make it.

641
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,618
- I know it, honey.
- Dad.

642
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,250
- I just know it. Come on.
- Dad.

643
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,850
- Dad.
- Your mom's out there.

644
00:51:06,962 --> 00:51:08,623
- I'll clean you up.
- Dad.

645
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:10,859
What?

646
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:13,698
How...

647
00:51:16,905 --> 00:51:20,534
How would I tell Bianca
her father's dead?

648
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,947
Missing means missing, Ma.
It doesn't mean dead.

649
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,541
She's very strong.
She's gonna be all right.

650
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:32,352
- Jer.
- Yeah.

651
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:36,752
We've got to call a doctor.
Give her something fast.

652
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:39,820
- Why?
- She could lose it.

653
00:51:40,028 --> 00:51:41,928
What is happening to this world?

654
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:45,826
<i>... of this horrible and vicious</i>
<i>act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.</i>

655
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:50,928
<i>And our focus now has to be</i>
<i>on saving as many lives as possible.</i>

656
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,530
<i>Do we know the number of casualties</i>
<i>at this point?</i>

657
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:56,941
<i>I don't think we really want</i>
<i>to speculate about that.</i>

658
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:03,179
<i>The number of casualties will be more</i>
<i>than any of us can bear, ultimately.</i>

659
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,217
Sounded like a truck bomb.

660
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,819
Like in '93.

661
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:14,520
Blasted out the lobby.
Pushed everything in here.

662
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:17,597
Concourse must have collapsed.

663
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:23,872
You never answered, Sarge.

664
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:26,774
What have we got?

665
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:32,006
How long does this
internal bleeding take?

666
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:36,050
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

667
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:40,716
Twenty-four hours
is the most I've heard of. Maybe 14,

668
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:43,121
16.

669
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:44,990
Just don't sleep.

670
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:52,695
So we've been in six, seven hours.
What does that mean?

671
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:56,030
Another seven, eight hours from now?

672
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:07,177
You remember that earthquake?
Where was it? Turkey?

673
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,816
There was a little girl there.

674
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:13,477
She lived four days
buried in the rubble like this.
