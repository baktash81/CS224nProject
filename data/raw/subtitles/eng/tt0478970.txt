1
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,630
Stark.

2
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,733
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,018
Hello Hank.

4
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:20,836
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,899
I took a detour

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,033
through your defense lab.

7
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:28,236
Tell me that isn't
what I think it is.

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,669
It depends if you think it's a
poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,113
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:39,030
You were instructed to go to Russia.
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,150
you're a soldier-

12
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:40,886
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,117
Then act like one.

14
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:45,417
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed

15
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,401
help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,725
First you trim me to your errand boy

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,287
and now you try to steal my research?

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,504
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,267
Ah.

20
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,492
Easy, Hank.

21
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:07,125
You mention my wife again
and I'll show you ferocity.

22
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,061
Don't look at me,
you said it.

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,450
I formally tender my resignation.

24
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:15,476
We don't accept it. Formally.

25
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:16,981
Hank,

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,030
we need you.

27
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:21,475
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please,

28
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,069
don't let your past
determine the future.

29
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,601
As long as I am alive,

30
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:30,330
nobody will ever get that formula.

31
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,795
We shouldn't let him
leave the building.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,166
You've already lied to him,
now you want to go to war with him?

33
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,203
Yes.

34
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,981
Our scientists haven't come
close to replicating his work.

35
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,122
He just kicked your ass full size.

36
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:51,677
You really want to find out what it's
like when you can't see him coming?

37
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,989
I've known Hank Pym for a
long time, he's no security risk.

38
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,684
Unless we make him one.

39
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,563
You like that?
You like that?

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
Come get you some!

41
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,282
You didn't even move.

42
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,107
Nah.

43
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,955
I mean, what if I come in on
the left side, right...

44
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,066
just out here and see this one and-

45
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,165
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

46
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,268
I'm gonna miss you too, Peachy.

47
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,927
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.

48
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,385
All right, break it up.

49
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:39,005
Scotty!  What's up, man!

50
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,303
- Damn!
- Hey!

51
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,851
Hey, man.

52
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,322
Hey what's up with your eye?

53
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:50,322
Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy.
His going-away present.

54
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,326
Oh, yeah, I still got my scar
from a year ago.

55
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,599
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
You know what?  I'm still the
only one to knock him out.

57
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,238
Well, I definitely didn't.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,067
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

59
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,326
Oh, now, you think I'm gonna
miss my cellmate getting out?

60
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:05,539
Hey, how's your girl man?

61
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,042
Oh, she left me.

62
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,137
Oh.

63
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,653
Yeah, my mom died too.

64
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:11,696
And my dad got deported.

65
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,463
But I got the van!

66
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,484
- It's nice!
- Yeah, right?

67
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,596
Thanks for the hook-up too.
I needed a place to stay.

68
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:21,344
You wait 'til you see this [?],
you're gonna be really happy.

69
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,214
You're gonna be on your
feet in no time, watch.

70
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,394
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,984
And I gotta introduce you to some people,
some really skilled people.

72
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,219
Not interested.

73
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,286
- Yeah right!
- No I'm serious man.

74
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,649
I'm not going back.

75
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:35,277
I got a daughter to take care of.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,260
You know that jobs don't come
easy for ex-cons right?

77
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,109
Look man, I got a masters in electrical
engineering, alright?

78
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,435
I'm gonna be fine.

79
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,203
Welcome to Baskin Robbins.

80
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,995
Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?

81
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,275
Uh, no thanks.  Um, I will have...

82
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:53,756
I'll have a burger please.

83
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:56,045
Oh, we don't...we don't make that.

84
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:59,425
Pretzel.  Hot pretzel, like,
mustard...in mustard dip?

85
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,305
It's ice cream.  Baskin Robbins.

86
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,681
I'll just do with whatever's hot & fresh.

87
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Dude.

88
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,008
Can I see you in the back chief?
Pronto.

89
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:09,111
Sure thing Dale.

90
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:14,616
Darby, could you just, uh...take care
of this idiot?  Thanks.

91
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,028
Hey Dale.

92
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:18,782
Come on in.

93
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,144
Pull up some chair.

94
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,834
Three years in San Quentin, huh.

95
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,338
You found out.

96
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,827
Baskin Robbins always finds out.

97
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:32,753
Look, I'm sorry, alright, but I...
no one would hire me.

98
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,303
Breaking and entering.
Grand larceny.

99
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,986
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, I, y'know, it was...

100
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,261
...I, I don't do it anymore,
I just try to...

101
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,291
Respect.

102
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,175
- I couldn't be happier about it.
- Really?

103
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:44,354
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,193
Oh, thank you, thank you.

105
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,953
You really stuck it to those
billionaire S.O.B.s...

106
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,756
...and the more I read about what
you did and stuff, I'm like...

107
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,902
"Wow, I know this guy?
I'm in charge of this guy?"

108
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:55,996
Yeesh!

109
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,159
Well, I'm very happy in this job, and I'm...

110
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,304
- I really just appreciate the opportunities and...
- Yeah, yeah...

111
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,799
Well, you're fired of course.

112
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,152
I can't really keep you on.

113
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:07,174
Wait, what?

114
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,259
Fired?

115
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:08,982
Yeah.

116
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime,
I mean, I'm a good worker.

117
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:14,092
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

118
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:19,755
I'll tell you what, though, this'd be totally
off the books, off the records, but uh...

119
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:23,469
If you want to grab you one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door,

120
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,832
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

121
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,234
Hey Scotty what's up?

122
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,068
I thought you were supposed to be at work?

123
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,466
I was.  I got fired.

124
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,980
Damn!  They find out who you are?

125
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:12,887
Yeah.

126
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,893
Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.

127
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:16,595
Baskin Robbins don't play.

128
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:18,080
You want some waffles?

129
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,250
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

130
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,407
Oh.  That's Kurt.  He was in Folsom for 5
five years, he's a wizard on that laptop.

131
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:25,934
Nice meet you.

132
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,747
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

133
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:29,454
And who are you?

134
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:30,809
Dave.

135
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,549
Nice work on the Vista job.

136
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:38,189
Vista job?  Yes.  No, no,
I have heard of this robbery.

137
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:41,675
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

138
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,279
I hate violence, I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

139
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,150
You mean you're a pussy?

140
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,218
Yeah.

141
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:49,262
They were overcharging the customers, right?

142
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:52,119
And it added up to millions.  He blows
the whistle and he gets fired.

143
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,291
And what does he do?  He hacks
into the security system,

144
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:58,862
and transfers millions back to the people
that they stole it from.

145
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,843
Posts all the bank records online.

146
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,180
And he drove dude's Bentley into a swimming pool.

147
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,058
What are you doing?

148
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,597
- Hmm?
- Oh...I...

149
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:12,084
Why are you telling my life's
story to these guys?

150
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,249
What do you want?

151
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:14,678
Okay.

152
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,275
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

153
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,491
about this little, perfect job.

154
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:19,292
No way.

155
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,591
No no no wait!  This guy,
this guy fits your M.O.

156
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:22,598
No!

157
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,235
I'm finished man. I'm not
going back to jail.

158
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,404
It's some retired millionaire living
off his golden parachute,

159
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,450
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark.

160
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,302
I don't care. I'm out.

161
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,359
Dr. Pym?

162
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,387
Yes. I'm still alive.

163
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:02,219
I.D.

164
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:04,888
Perhaps that will suffice.

165
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,946
Very sorry sir, please come in.

166
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:13,708
Is that Hank Pym?

167
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,491
Good morning, Hank.

168
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:21,535
Hope.

169
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,369
Would it kill you to call me dad?

170
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,692
Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that
you could find time to join us today.

171
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:30,123
More like, thrilled.

172
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,896
And I'm surprised to receive any
kind of invitation from you, Darren.

173
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,777
What's the occasion?

174
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Oh, you'll see.

175
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:39,086
Won't he Hope?

176
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,975
We're ready for you inside.

177
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,726
Ouch!

178
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:51,140
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

179
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:53,955
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

180
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:56,813
You're in for a treat.

181
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:03,294
Long time no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

182
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,487
How's your face?

183
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,230
After you.

184
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:21,861
Now before we start I'd like to
introduce a very special guest,

185
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:24,350
this company's founder and my mentor,

186
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,571
Dr. Hank Pym.

187
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,550
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

188
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,090
I immediately started researching a particle
that could change the distance between atoms

189
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,379
while increasing density and strength.

190
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:59,190
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the
dust and cobwebs of Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

191
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,339
But just imagine.

192
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,233
A soldier the size of an insect.

193
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,013
The ultimate secret weapon.

194
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,460
An "Ant-Man".
Heh heh.

195
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,498
That's what they called you.

196
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:28,549
Right, Hank?

197
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:35,636
Silly, I know.  Propaganda.

198
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:36,883
Tales to astonish!

199
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,903
Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R.

200
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,399
Hank, will you tell our guests what you
told me every single time I asked you,

201
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:51,101
Was the Ant-Man real?

202
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:53,868
Just a tall tale.

203
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:55,138
Right.

204
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,975
Because how could anything so
miraculous possibly be real?

205
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,172
Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

206
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,356
And with my breakthrough,
shrinking inorganic material,

207
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,281
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

208
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,675
Could that be done?

209
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:22,552
Well,

210
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,320
it's not a legend anymore.

211
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:33,016
Distinguished guests, I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it:

212
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:34,988
the Yellowjacket.

213
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:45,290
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

214
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:50,734
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage.

215
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:55,384
We live in an era in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves

216
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,009
are undermined by constant surveillance.

217
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,556
It's time to return to a simpler age.

218
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:06,418
Only when the powers of freedom can once
again operate openly to protect their interests,

219
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,665
an all-purpose peace-keeping vessel, the Yellowjacket

220
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:12,861
can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape,

221
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,069
completely unseen.

222
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:18,595
Efficient in both preventative
measures and tactical assault,

223
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,587
practical applications include surveillance,

224
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,827
industrial sabotage,

225
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:28,269
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.

226
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:34,894
A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited
influence to carry out protective actions

227
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:39,901
and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets
will create a sustainable environment

228
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:42,129
of well-being around the world.

229
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,127
The Yellowjacket.

230
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:46,784
So it's a suit.

231
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:51,814
Don't be crude, Frank.

232
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,046
It's not a suit, it's a...

233
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,115
it's a vessel.

234
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,562
What's a matter, you're not impressed?

235
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,202
Oh, I'm impressed.  I'm also concerned.

236
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,677
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.

237
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,752
We should have a longer conversation about
that, Frank.  I really value your opinion.

238
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,891
Thank you for coming. Hope?

239
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:14,314
Thank you very much everybody.
I will escort you out now.  Thank you.

240
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,066
You seem a bit shocked.

241
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Darren,

242
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:24,415
there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

243
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,259
So you finally admit it.

244
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,167
We could've done this together, Hank.

245
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,449
But you ruined it.

246
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:35,288
- That's why you're the past and I'm the future.
- Don't do this.

247
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,739
Dr. Cross.

248
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:41,787
You sell to me first, twenty
percent of your asking price,

249
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,733
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

250
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:44,739
Deal.

251
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:56,040
We have to make our move, Hank.

252
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:56,932
How close is he?

253
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,386
He still can't shrink a live subject.

254
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,557
Just give me the suit, let me
finish this once and for all.

255
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:03,638
No.

256
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,638
I have Cross's complete trust.

257
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:06,429
It's too dangerous.

258
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,058
We don't have a choice.

259
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,322
Well, that's not entirely true.

260
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,718
I think I found a guy.

261
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:16,696
Who?

262
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,419
Daddy!

263
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:23,844
Peanut!

264
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,422
Oh! Happy birthday!

265
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,420
I'm so sorry I'm late, I didn't know
what time your party started.

266
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,179
It was on the invitation!

267
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,145
He didn't get an invitation!

268
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,470
But he came anyway.

269
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,607
Well, I'm not going to miss my
little girl's birthday party.

270
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,153
- I'm gonna go tell mommy you're here.
- Oh, you don't...

271
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,270
What are you doing here, Lang?

272
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,202
You haven't paid a dime in child support.

273
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,583
You know, right now if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

274
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:46,223
Good to see you too, Paxton.

275
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,437
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.  Ha ha.

276
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,942
Hey, look what I have for you.

277
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,295
Can I open it now?

278
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,825
Of course sweetheart, it's your birthday.

279
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,816
You're my bestest friend!

280
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,263
What is that thing?

281
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,647
He's so ugly!

282
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:07,552
I love him!

283
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,061
Can I go show my friends?

284
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:11,540
Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.

285
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,234
You're my bestest friend!

286
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,392
Look, the child support is coming.

287
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,463
All right, it's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

288
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,963
I'm sure you'll figure it out, but y'know,
I want you out of my house.

289
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,498
- No, wait, it's my daughter's birthday!
- It's my house!

290
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,045
- So what, it's my kid!
- Relax!

291
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:26,829
You can't just show up here.

292
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,234
You know that, c'mon.

293
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,205
It's a birthday party.

294
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,192
Yeah, I know, but you
can't just show up.

295
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:33,599
- She's my daughter.
- You don't know the first thing about being a father.

296
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:37,857
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life,

297
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,627
your fiance is an ass-hat.

298
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:40,550
He's not an ass-hat.

299
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,053
Hey, watch your language, okay!

300
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,193
Oh, what language.
I said hat.

301
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:48,357
Really, Maggie?
That guy?

302
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,847
Come on, you could marry anyone you want,
you have to get engaged to a cop?

303
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,654
At least he's not a crook.

304
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,213
I'm trying, okay?  I've changed, uh...

305
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,421
I'm straight, I had a job, and...

306
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:05,603
I want to provide.  I've had a lot of time
to think about it, and I love her.

307
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:10,393
So much.  I've missed so much time and
I want to be a part of her life.

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
What do I do?

309
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,966
Get an apartment.

310
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:16,037
Get a job, pay child support.

311
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:19,442
And then we will talk about
visitation, I promise.

312
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,364
You're her hero, Scott.

313
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:26,295
Just, be the person that she
already thinks you are.

314
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,679
(musical horn)

315
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,542
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

316
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,433
Yeah, well uh, unfortunately

317
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:00,413
we can't just do whatever we want.

318
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,611
Would be nice though, right?
Heh heh heh.

319
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:05,933
But there are laws.

320
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:06,946
What laws? Of man?

321
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,459
The laws of nature transcend
the laws of man.

322
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:13,220
And I've transcended
the laws of nature.

323
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,126
Darren, I don't think you understand-

324
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:28,287
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

325
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,959
Goodbye Frank.

326
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,881
You know I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately

327
00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:00,199
and today during my morning meditation, an
interesting thought occurred to me and

328
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,801
I think it might apply to you too.

329
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:02,728
How's that?

330
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,672
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

331
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:09,395
I spent years carrying around my
anger for Hank Pym.

332
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:11,572
I devoted my genius to him.

333
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:14,456
I could've worked anywhere.

334
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,683
I chose my mentor poorly.

335
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:19,474
You didn't even have a choice.

336
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,493
He never believed in you.

337
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:27,588
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

338
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:31,646
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

339
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:34,178
Because his failures as a mentor,

340
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:35,849
as a father,

341
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,550
forced us to spread our wings.

342
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,200
You're a success, Darren.

343
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:48,943
You deserve everything coming your way.

344
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,710
Ooh!

345
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:11,245
Stop cheating.

346
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,827
Hey what's up hotshot?

347
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:16,718
Maybe he didn't hear you.

348
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,547
How was the party?

349
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:26,474
Tell me about that tip.

350
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:27,545
Wha?

351
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,666
I wanna know about that tip.

352
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,422
- Oh baby, it's on!
- Hot dog!

353
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:32,275
It's so on right now!

354
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,753
Calm down, all right, I just need
to know where it came from,

355
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,348
it's gotta be airtight.

356
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:38,145
Okay.

357
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,617
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto

358
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,953
it was mainly reds, and you know
I don't love reds man, y'know, but

359
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,924
there was a rosé that saved the
day, it was delightful.

360
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:47,923
And, he tells me about this girl
Emily that we used to kick it with,

361
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,911
it was actually the first pair of
boobs that I ever touched.

362
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,533
It's the wrong details.  It's wro-
Has nothing to do with the story.

363
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,616
Go.

364
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,978
So, uh.  He tells me that:

365
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,030
She's working as a housekeeper now, right?

366
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:02,555
And she's dating this dude Carlos who's
a shot caller from across the bay and

367
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:05,766
she tells him about the dude that
she's cleaning for. Right?

368
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:09,969
That he's, like, this big-shot CEO that
is all retired now but he's loaded.

369
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,760
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are
on the same softball team

370
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,749
and the get to talking, right.

371
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,774
And here comes the good part.

372
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:17,838
Carlos says:

373
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:22,224
Yo, man. This guy's got a big-ass safe
just sitting in the basement.

374
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,237
Just chillin'.

375
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,400
Of course Ernesto comes to me 'cause
he knows I've got mad thieving skills.

376
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,460
Of course I ask him:

377
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:29,963
Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?

378
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:30,751
And he says

379
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,863
Naw, dog. All she said is that
it's, like, super legit, and

380
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,425
whatever's in it has gotta be good!

381
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
What?

382
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:42,305
Old man have safe.

383
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:44,773
And he's gone for a week.

384
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,927
All right.  There's an old man, he's got
a safe, and he's gone for a week.

385
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:49,527
Let's just work with that.

386
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:50,705
Y'know what I' sayin'.

387
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:42,419
Landlines cut, cell signals jammed.

388
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,128
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

389
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,175
All check.

390
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:47,445
- Check.
- Check.

391
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:49,843
If the job goes bad, you know
I got your back, right?

392
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,192
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen.

393
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:56,936
I love it when he gets cocky.

394
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,496
Damn!

395
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,286
Alarm is dead.

396
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:34,709
Nice!

397
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,567
All right, I'm moving through the house.

398
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:06,152
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

399
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,203
He's got a what?

400
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:09,164
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

401
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:10,775
Aw, man, are we screwed?

402
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,093
Not necessarily.

403
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:02,143
I'm in.

404
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,762
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

405
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,830
Oh, man.

406
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:11,874
What is it?

407
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,647
Well they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

408
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,999
How serious we talkin', Scotty?

409
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:19,398
It's a Carbondale.

410
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
It's from 1910.

411
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,923
Made from the same steel
as the Titanic.

412
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,270
Wow.

413
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,452
Can you crack it?

414
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,038
Well, here's the thing.

415
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,396
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

416
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:31,870
Remember what that iceberg did?

417
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:33,469
Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.

418
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,611
Killed everybody.

419
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:35,989
Man, not kill the old lady.

420
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:38,855
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

421
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:31,893
What're you doing?

422
00:26:31,972 --> 00:26:34,772
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

423
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,216
Ice expands, metal doesn't.

424
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,472
What are you doing now?

425
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:40,534
Waiting.

426
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:42,669
Waiting.

427
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:51,999
Nice.

428
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:57,959
What is it, cash? Jewels?

429
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,553
There's nothing here.

430
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:01,622
What'd you say?

431
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,723
It's a suit.

432
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:04,741
What?

433
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,287
It's an old motorcycle suit.

434
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:09,980
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

435
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,006
No.

436
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,436
It's a bust.

437
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,551
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

438
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,054
I know you needed a score.

439
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,443
I thought we were using mice?

440
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:56,209
What's the difference?

441
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,255
Commence experiment 34-C,

442
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,315
organic atomic reduction.

443
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,026
Darren, maybe we should think-

444
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:06,606
Shrinking organic tissue is the
centerpiece of this technology.

445
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:10,031
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

446
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:36,874
Experiment 34-C results...

447
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:38,502
negative.

448
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:46,324
Sanitize the workstation,
bring in subject 35-C.

449
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:59,312
Why would you lock this up?

450
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:22,535
So weird.

451
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,228
Scott, what's up man?

452
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:03,546
I wonder...what is this?

453
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,370
The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

454
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:39,986
What? Who...who said that?

455
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:47,402
Luis! Luis, I'm here!

456
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,158
It's a trial by fire, Scott.

457
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:52,075
Or in this case,

458
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,590
water.

459
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:20,351
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

460
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,891
Oh, I don't want to see this.

461
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:25,946
Luis!

462
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:32,212
Son of a-!

463
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:49,989
What the hell?

464
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:53,652
Not bad for a test drive.

465
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,109
Keep the suit,
I'll be in touch.

466
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,576
No, no. No.

467
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:58,627
No thank you.

468
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,416
Put it down on the ground!

469
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,781
You are under arrest!

470
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:14,660
No, I didn't steal anything!

471
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,414
I was returning
something I stole.

472
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:29,332
You know, you almost had us convinced
that you were going to change your ways.

473
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:32,010
They were really rooting for you.

474
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,463
It's gonna break their hearts.

475
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,716
You got a visitor.

476
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:41,376
Who?

477
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:42,377
Your lawyer.

478
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:44,428
My lawyer?

479
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:50,014
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

480
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,262
I'm starting to think that you
prefer the inside of a jail cell.

481
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,523
Oh man.

482
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:57,818
Sit down.

483
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:03,985
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

484
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:06,781
I don't even want to
know why you have it.

485
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,620
Maggie was right about you.

486
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:11,210
How do you know about-

487
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:14,654
The way she's trying to keep
you away from Cassie.

488
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:18,210
The moment things get hard,
you turn right back to crime.

489
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,759
The way I see it, you have a choice.

490
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,413
You can either spend the
rest of your life in prison

491
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:30,460
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions.

492
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,605
I don't understand.

493
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,128
I don't expect you to.

494
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:36,726
But you don't have many options right now.

495
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:38,886
Quite frankly, neither do I.

496
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,189
Why do you think I let you steal
that suit in the first place?

497
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:45,244
What?

498
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,844
Second chances don't come
around all that much.

499
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,825
So next time you think you might see one

500
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,926
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

501
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,420
You are my bestest friend!

502
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:23,097
Are you sure you don't
want a different toy?

503
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,453
No, I love this one.

504
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,397
Okay.

505
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:28,397
Well, get some sleep then.

506
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:29,782
- Mommy.
- Hm?

507
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:31,671
Is daddy a bad man?

508
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:35,069
I heard some grown ups say he's bad.

509
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:37,937
No.

510
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,948
Daddy just gets confused
sometimes, you know?

511
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:35,773
Smart choice.
You actually listened for once.

512
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,586
Under the door.

513
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:44,865
Okay. Where to now?

514
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:46,179
Hang tight.

515
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:50,935
What? What?!

516
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:52,139
Where the hell did he go?

517
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,608
I have no idea, he just vanished.

518
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:55,292
Set up a five block perimeter, now!

519
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,003
Get back, get back, get back!

520
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:58,910
Scott. These are my associates.

521
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,134
Huh? You got a camera on an ant?

522
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,222
Yeah, sure, why not?

523
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,466
Where's the car?

524
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:06,031
No car, we've got wings.

525
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,092
Incoming!

526
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,290
Put your foot on the
central node and not the thorax.

527
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,504
Are you ki- How safe's Th-

528
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:23,392
Get on the damn ant, Scott.

529
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:36,803
Why am I on a police car?

530
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,999
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

531
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:42,005
So they can give you a lift
past their five block perimeter.

532
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:42,781
Whoa. All right.

533
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,359
Now, what's the next move?

534
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:45,312
Hang on tight.

535
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,110
Oh, this is easy.
I'm getting the hang of this.

536
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:48,147
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

537
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:50,949
You're throwing 247 off balance.

538
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:53,447
- Wait, his name is 247?
- He doesn't have a name,

539
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:54,615
he has a number Scott, do you have

540
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,910
any idea how many ants there are?

541
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,730
Whoa!

542
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,440
Please...maybe it's 248?

543
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,973
No no no no no
vertigo, vertigo!

544
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,149
No, I think it's 247.

545
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,682
- Wait.
- Hang on.

546
00:38:06,627 --> 00:38:07,627
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

547
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:11,378
I'm controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.

548
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:12,495
What?

549
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:13,609
Can I make one little request?

550
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,639
No.

551
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,931
Stop New York City, time out, time out.

552
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:19,614
Time out.

553
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:21,154
All right, hold on.

554
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:22,989
Just, wait, whoa, uh!

555
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,418
What happens if I
throw up in this helmet?

556
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:28,084
It's my helmet Scott.
Do not throw up.

557
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:29,809
Just set 'er down, all right?

558
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,231
I'm getting light headed.

559
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:32,302
Hang on, Scott.

560
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,419
Yeah, I'm getting a little light...

561
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,504
-t's, it's funny...

562
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:38,935
...hit me, andfarness-

563
00:38:58,643 --> 00:38:59,643
Hello.

564
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,251
Who are you?

565
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:09,314
Have you been standing there
watching me sleep this whole time?

566
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:10,344
Yes.

567
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:11,853
Why?

568
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:15,927
Because the last time you were
here you stole something.

569
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,785
Oh. Oh!

570
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:19,204
Hey, look.

571
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:21,487
Whoa!

572
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:27,537
Paraponera clavata.

573
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:31,048
Giant tropical bullet ants ranked
highest on the Schmidt pain index,

574
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,019
they're here to keep an eye
on you when I can't.

575
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,525
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

576
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:38,484
Who?

577
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,807
Ahhh...hey, um,

578
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,199
whose pajamas are these?

579
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,857
How am I supposed to do this?

580
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,635
Hey, j- just one step at a time.

581
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,255
Ugh.

582
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,055
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you, deal?

583
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,469
Take down the servers and
Cross wouldn't even know.

584
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:18,918
We don't need this guy.

585
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,470
I assume that you've already
met my daughter Hope.

586
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:22,475
I did.

587
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:23,664
She's great.

588
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:25,976
She doesn't think that we need you.

589
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:27,926
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

590
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:31,862
I go to all this effort to let you
steal my suit, and then Hope

591
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,043
has you arrested.

592
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,783
Okay, we can try this and
when he fails I'll do it myself.

593
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:40,400
She's a little bit anxious.
It has to do with this job,

594
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:43,146
which, judging by the fact that
you're sitting opposite me,

595
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,398
I take it that you're interested in.

596
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:46,359
What job?

597
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:48,056
Would you like some tea?

598
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Uh, sure.

599
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:54,484
I was very impressed with how you
managed to get past my security system.

600
00:40:55,557 --> 00:40:57,990
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.

601
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,418
Were you watching me?

602
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:03,236
Scott, I've been watching you for a while,

603
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:05,934
ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

604
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,298
Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp.

605
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:16,624
Vista's security system is one of the most
advanced in the business.

606
00:41:16,678 --> 00:41:19,878
It's supposed to be unbeatable
but you beat it.

607
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:21,984
Would you like some sugar?

608
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:23,339
Yeah, thanks.

609
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,091
You know what, I'm okay.

610
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,011
How do you make them do that?

611
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:38,847
Ants can lift objects
fifty times their weight.

612
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,057
They build, farm, they
cooperate with each other.

613
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:45,128
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

614
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:52,038
I use electromagnetic waves, to
stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

615
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,076
I speak to them.

616
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:58,968
I can go anywhere, hear
anything, and see everything.

617
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:01,311
And still know absolutely nothing.

618
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,126
I'm late to meet Cross.

619
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,380
Uh...Dr. Pym?

620
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:11,238
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

621
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,565
Sorry, I just have one question.

622
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:18,257
Who are you who is she what the hell's
going on and can I go back to jail now?

623
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:19,409
Come with me.

624
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:24,168
Twenty years ago I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

625
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:25,238
Huh?

626
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,599
I learned how to change the distance
between atoms, that's what powers the suit,

627
00:42:29,611 --> 00:42:30,944
that's why it works.

628
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:33,524
Wow!

629
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,445
- Whoa.
- It was dangerous.

630
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:42,581
It was too dangerous.

631
00:42:44,363 --> 00:42:46,463
So I hid it from the world.

632
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:51,048
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

633
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:52,081
Pym Tech.

634
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:53,379
Yes.

635
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:57,749
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

636
00:42:58,053 --> 00:43:00,120
Darren Cross.
He's a big deal.

637
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:03,442
But before he was a big deal
he was my assistant.

638
00:43:03,507 --> 00:43:07,574
I thought I saw something in him,
a son I never had perhaps.

639
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:11,028
He was brilliant, but as we became
close he began to suspect

640
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:13,570
that I wasn't telling him everything.

641
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:17,371
He heard rumors about what
was called the Pym Particles,

642
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:20,969
and he became obsessed with
recreating my formula.

643
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:23,825
But I wouldn't help him so he
conspired against me and

644
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:26,174
he voted me out of my own company.

645
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,780
How could he do that?

646
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:30,830
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

647
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:32,585
She was the deciding vote.

648
00:43:33,702 --> 00:43:38,702
But she came back to me when she saw
how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

649
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,003
The process is highly volatile.

650
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:45,356
What isn't protected by a specialized helmet

651
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,625
can affect the brain's chemistry.

652
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:54,372
I don't think Darren realizes this, and y'know,
he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

653
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,372
So, what do you want from me?

654
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,002
Scott, I believe that everyone
deserves a shot at redemption.

655
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,057
Do you?

656
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,390
I do.

657
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:10,952
If you can help me, I promise I can
help you be with your daughter again.

658
00:44:12,465 --> 00:44:14,932
Now are you ready to redeem yourself?

659
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:15,986
Absolutely.

660
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:20,397
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

661
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,042
What do you want me to do?

662
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:26,845
I want you to break into a
place and steal some shit.

663
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,336
You going to be home for dinner tonight?

664
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:34,776
Uh, yeah.
I'll pick something up, okay?

665
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:35,788
Okay.

666
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:36,716
Good news?

667
00:44:36,728 --> 00:44:38,661
Uh, I don't know.
It's news.

668
00:44:38,954 --> 00:44:41,087
Are you trying to find my daddy?

669
00:44:43,424 --> 00:44:44,424
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

670
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,892
I just want your
daddy to be safe.

671
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:49,646
Hope you don't catch him.

672
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,634
This isn't the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands

673
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:40,398
on game changing weaponry.

674
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:44,382
That's Mitchell Carson,
ex-head of defense at SHIELD,

675
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:47,465
presently in the business
of toppling governments.

676
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:49,192
He always wanted my tech.

677
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:53,159
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

678
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:54,915
and destroy all the data,

679
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,153
Darren Cross is gonna unleash
chaos upon the world.

680
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:06,765
I think our first move should
be calling the Avengers.

681
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:14,156
I've spent half my life trying to keep this
technology out of the hands of a Stark.

682
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:17,804
I'm sure as hell not going to
hand-deliver it to one now.

683
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,459
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

684
00:46:21,472 --> 00:46:24,205
This could change the texture of reality.

685
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,490
Besides they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

686
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:32,765
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

687
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:34,254
Scott, they are ants.

688
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:39,683
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

689
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:44,967
Somebody that can infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

690
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,833
Hank, I'm a thief.
All right, I'm a good thief.

691
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:48,588
But this is insane.

692
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,793
He's right Hank and you know it.

693
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:53,774
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

694
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:57,193
I was against using him when we had
months, now we have days.

695
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:59,167
I'm wearing the suit.

696
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,167
Absolutely not!

697
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:03,532
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

698
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,080
I know this mission better
than anybody here.

699
00:47:05,134 --> 00:47:07,767
We need you close to Cross
otherwise this mission cannot work.

700
00:47:07,815 --> 00:47:10,748
- We don't have time to screw around.
- Hope, please, this is an [?].

701
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:11,881
He is a criminal.
I'm your daughter.

702
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,900
NO!

703
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,693
She's right, Hank.

704
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:54,609
I'm not your guy.

705
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:57,620
Why don't you wear the suit?

706
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,899
You think I don't want to?

707
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:01,596
I can't.

708
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:04,975
I spent years wearing it.

709
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:06,772
It took a toll on me.

710
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:17,167
You're our only option.

711
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:26,242
Before Hope lost her mother,
she used to look at me like

712
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,903
I was the greatest man in the world.

713
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:34,466
And now she looks at me
and it's just disappointment.

714
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:39,049
It's too late for me.

715
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:42,035
But not for you.

716
00:48:43,015 --> 00:48:44,349
This is your chance.

717
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:48,285
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

718
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:52,138
To become the hero that she
already thinks you are.

719
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,047
It's not about saving our world.

720
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,034
It's about saving theirs.

721
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:03,809
Damn, that was a good speech.

722
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:05,762
Scott.

723
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:09,784
I need you
to be the Ant-Man.

724
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,003
In the right hands, the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic.

725
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,487
The suit has power, the man
harnesses that power.

726
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:24,598
You need to be skillful,
agile, and above all,

727
00:49:24,663 --> 00:49:25,996
you need to be fast.

728
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:29,727
You should be able to shrink
and grow on a dime, so

729
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:32,021
your size always suits your needs.

730
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,738
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

731
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:38,911
You charge big,
you dive small,

732
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:40,401
then you emerge big.

733
00:49:43,244 --> 00:49:44,243
Ow!

734
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,732
Ah!

735
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:48,417
Ow.

736
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:49,428
Useless.

737
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:52,999
When you're small energy is compressed

738
00:49:53,034 --> 00:49:55,101
so you have the force of a 200 pound man

739
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,192
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide

740
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:58,435
you're like a bullet.

741
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:00,132
You punch too hard,
you kill someone,

742
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,847
too soft, it's a love-tap.

743
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,478
In other words you have
to know how to punch.

744
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:05,221
I was in prison for three years,
I know how to punch.

745
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:06,301
Show me.

746
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:08,688
- Terrible.
- You want to show me how to punch?

747
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,922
Show me-

748
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,460
That's how you punch.

749
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:16,037
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kiddin'.

750
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:19,114
Hope trained in martial arts
at a, uh, difficult time.

751
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:21,628
Oh, by difficult time, he
means when my mother died.

752
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,652
We lost her in a plane crash.

753
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:27,521
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died,
could you please stop telling me that lie.

754
00:50:27,578 --> 00:50:28,845
We're working here.

755
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:34,685
All right princess,
let's get back to work.

756
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,630
Were you going for the hand?

757
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:45,272
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

758
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:47,414
Do not screw with the regulator.

759
00:50:47,936 --> 00:50:51,503
If that regulator is compromised
you would go sub-atomic.

760
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:53,069
What does that mean?

761
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:56,020
It means that you would
enter a quantum realm.

762
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:56,951
What does that mean?

763
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,073
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

764
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:05,911
become irrelevant as you
shrink for all eternity.

765
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,966
Everything that you know,

766
00:51:09,428 --> 00:51:10,961
and love,

767
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:12,809
gone forever.

768
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,104
Cool. Yeah. I'm-
If it ain't broke.

769
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:22,118
You've learned about the suit, but you've
yet to learn about your greatest allies

770
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:24,086
the ants.

771
00:51:24,587 --> 00:51:27,587
Loyal, brave, and
your partners on this job.

772
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:37,078
Paratrechina longicornis,
commonly known as crazy ants,

773
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:39,805
they're lightning fast and can conduct
electricity which makes them useful

774
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,772
to fry out enemy electronics.

775
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,564
Oh you're not so crazy.

776
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:45,633
Hey!  Heh heh heh

777
00:51:46,288 --> 00:51:47,288
You're cute.

778
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:49,625
Oh! Aaah!

779
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:58,102
That was a lot scarier
a second ago.

780
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,206
Aaah!

781
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,694
It looks like the Futures lab has
its own isolated power supply.

782
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,303
There's a security guard posted
around the clock, we need you

783
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,126
to take him out to deactivate
the security systems.

784
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:17,192
Okay.

785
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,260
Who's next?

786
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:21,632
Paraponera clavata.

787
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,108
I know. Bullet ants, right?

788
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:25,175
Number one on the Schmidt pain index.

789
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:26,071
Hey guys!

790
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:28,038
Remember me from the bedroom?

791
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:28,903
Whoa!

792
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,249
The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed

793
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:36,044
and the only access point is a tube
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.

794
00:52:36,092 --> 00:52:37,759
Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?

795
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:40,463
The tube is protected by a laser grid
and we can only power that down

796
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:41,834
for fifteen seconds.

797
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:46,253
You're going to need to signal the crazy ants
to blow the servers, retrieve the suit,

798
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:49,103
and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.

799
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:50,865
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

800
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:53,540
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

801
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,969
Ideal for ground and air transport.

802
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:58,446
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

803
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:00,570
I'm going to call him Antony.

804
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:02,754
That's good, that's, that's very good

805
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:03,934
because this time

806
00:53:04,373 --> 00:53:07,573
you're really going to have
to learn how to control him.

807
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:10,370
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.

808
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,457
Oh, you okay Dr.-

809
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:22,816
Ah!

810
00:53:23,681 --> 00:53:24,681
Ah!!

811
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:28,221
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

812
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,880
The suit has no weapons
so I made you these discs.

813
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:31,945
Red shrinks.

814
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:34,232
Blue enlarges.

815
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,605
Solenopsis mandibularis.

816
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,306
Known for their bite, the fire ants
have evolved into remarkable architects.

817
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:46,751
They are handy to get you
in and out of difficult places.

818
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:58,009
You can do it Scott, come on.

819
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,542
They're not listening to me.

820
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:04,656
You have to commit,
you have to mean it.

821
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:07,125
No shortcuts, no lies.

822
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:12,323
Throwing insults into the mix will not
do anyone any good, Hope.

823
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:13,812
We don't have time for coddling.

824
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:16,240
Our focus should be on helping Scott.

825
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:17,854
Really?

826
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,701
Is that where our focus should be?

827
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:45,396
Hope!

828
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,124
I don't know why I came
to you in the first place.

829
00:55:06,044 --> 00:55:07,977
We can't do this without her.

830
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:13,766
Oh God.

831
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,544
You gotta lock your doors.

832
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:16,717
I mean, really.

833
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:18,899
There's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

834
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:20,845
Do you think this is a joke?

835
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:24,065
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

836
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:26,346
- You have a daughter.
- I'm doing this for her.

837
00:55:26,438 --> 00:55:29,238
You know when my mother died
I didn't see him for two weeks?

838
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,148
He was in grief.

839
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:32,851
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

840
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:35,535
And he never came back, not
in any way that counted.

841
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:38,814
He just sent me off to boarding school.

842
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:41,155
You know, I thought,

843
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,067
with all that's at stake,
just maybe we might

844
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,094
have a chance at making peace.

845
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,333
But even now he still
wants to shut me out.

846
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,103
He doesn't want to shut you out.

847
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:51,987
- He trusts you.
- Then why are you here?

848
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:53,989
It proves that he loves you.

849
00:55:56,259 --> 00:55:57,992
Hope. Look at me.

850
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:00,347
I'm expendable.

851
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,163
That's why I'm here.

852
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,727
You must've realized that by now.

853
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:10,468
I mean, that's why I'm
in the suit and you're not.

854
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,134
He'd rather lose than fight
than lose you.

855
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,606
Anyway.

856
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:22,907
You know, I didn't know you had a
daughter when I called the cops on you.

857
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:28,505
What's her name?

858
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,292
Cassie.

859
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:32,903
It's a pretty name.

860
00:56:36,512 --> 00:56:37,545
You have to clear your mind, Scott.

861
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:40,192
You have to make your thoughts precise,
that's how it works.

862
00:56:42,621 --> 00:56:43,888
Think about Cassie,

863
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:48,177
about how badly you want to see her,
and use that to focus.

864
00:56:56,624 --> 00:57:01,024
Open your eyes and just think
about what you want the ants to do.

865
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,005
Good.

866
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:48,570
Your mother convinced me to let
her join me on my missions.

867
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:51,041
They called her the Wasp.

868
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:53,474
She was born to it.

869
00:57:55,553 --> 00:58:01,353
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't regret having said yes.

870
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:07,059
It was 1987.

871
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:12,410
Separatists had hijacked a
Soviet missile silo in Kursk

872
00:58:14,446 --> 00:58:17,246
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

873
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,483
The only way to the internal mechanics

874
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:29,842
was through solid titanium.

875
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:43,434
I knew I had to shrink between the
molecules to disarm the missile,

876
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:47,715
but my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

877
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,539
Your mother, she didn't hesitate.

878
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,327
Janet! No!

879
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:04,383
She turned off her regulator

880
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:07,838
and went sub-atomic

881
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,574
to deactivate the bomb.

882
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:14,224
She was gone.

883
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:20,847
Your mom died a hero.

884
00:59:22,987 --> 00:59:28,120
And I spent the next ten years
trying to learn all I could

885
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,467
about the quantum realm.

886
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,887
You were trying to bring her back.

887
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:40,965
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

888
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:47,860
It's not your fault.

889
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:51,855
She made her choice.

890
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,643
But why didn't you tell me this sooner?

891
01:00:01,337 --> 01:00:04,103
I was trying to protect you.

892
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:07,315
I lost your mother.

893
01:00:09,674 --> 01:00:12,374
I didn't mean to lose you too.

894
01:00:13,564 --> 01:00:14,564
I'm sorry.

895
01:00:17,857 --> 01:00:18,924
This is awesome.

896
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,319
It's awesome. Y'know.

897
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:25,097
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

898
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:26,474
It's important.

899
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:31,254
I ruined the moment didn't I.

900
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:32,478
Yes, you did, yes.

901
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,096
I'm going to make some tea.

902
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:42,755
Nailed it!

903
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:53,878
That's a good boy, Antony.

904
01:01:23,423 --> 01:01:26,756
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

905
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:27,796
It's freezing!

906
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,601
You couldn't make a simple flannel lining?

907
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,290
We must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy,

908
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:37,093
it's a device that I invented
from my SHIELD days.

909
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:41,862
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

910
01:01:41,957 --> 01:01:45,624
It's currently collecting dust in one of
Howard Stark's old storage facilities

911
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:46,976
in upstate New York.

912
01:01:47,209 --> 01:01:49,242
Should be a piece of cake.

913
01:01:49,379 --> 01:01:50,846
You're over the target area.

914
01:01:50,905 --> 01:01:53,072
Disengage, now, Scott.

915
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:54,545
Squadron A, go.

916
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:56,183
B, go.

917
01:01:58,189 --> 01:01:59,189
C, go.

918
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:02,894
All right, Antony, please
don't drop me this time.

919
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:06,225
Ah, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this.

920
01:02:06,718 --> 01:02:07,718
Stay calm.

921
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:12,110
Uh, guys, we might
have a problem.

922
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:15,311
Hank, didn't you say this
was some old warehouse?

923
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:16,494
It's not!

924
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:18,929
You son of a bitch!

925
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:22,776
Scott, get out of there.

926
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:24,446
Abort! Abort now.

927
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,070
No, it's okay. It doesn't
look like anyone's home.

928
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:29,942
Antony, get me to the roof.

929
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:32,124
He's gonna lose the suit.

930
01:02:32,144 --> 01:02:33,811
He's gonna lose his life.

931
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:42,660
All right I'm on the roof
of the target building.

932
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:43,918
Somebody's home, Scott.

933
01:02:47,712 --> 01:02:48,545
What's going on down there, Sam?

934
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,767
It's the Falcon!

935
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:53,369
I had a sensor trip but
I'm not seeing anything.

936
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:54,135
Wait a second.

937
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,762
Abort Scott, abort now.

938
01:02:56,285 --> 01:02:57,852
It's okay.
He can't see me.

939
01:02:57,978 --> 01:02:58,978
I can see you.

940
01:02:59,086 --> 01:03:00,086
He can see me.

941
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:04,047
Hi. I'm Scott.

942
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:05,880
Did he just say "Hi I'm Scott?"

943
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:07,075
What are you doing here?

944
01:03:07,105 --> 01:03:08,005
First off,

945
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:09,344
I'm a big fan.

946
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:11,914
'Preciate it. So who the hell are you?

947
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,246
I'm Ant-Man.

948
01:03:13,537 --> 01:03:14,537
Ant-Man?

949
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,794
What, you haven't heard of me?

950
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:19,368
Nah, you wouldn't have heard of me.

951
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:20,536
You want to tell me what you want?

952
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:23,101
I was hoping I could grab a
piece of technology

953
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:24,774
just for a few days, and return it.

954
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:27,511
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

955
01:03:27,585 --> 01:03:29,285
I know exactly how that is.

956
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,505
Located the breach.
Bringing him in.

957
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,643
Sorry about this.

958
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,418
What the hell are you doing?

959
01:03:41,262 --> 01:03:45,329
Breach is an adult male who
has some sort of shrinking tech.

960
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,643
Sorry about that, sorry.

961
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:01,944
That's enough!

962
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:26,304
Antony, a little help.

963
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:40,204
I've lost visual.

964
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:50,806
He's inside my pack.

965
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:51,859
Sorry.

966
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,714
You seem like a really great guy.

967
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:24,124
It's really important to me that
Cap never finds out about this.

968
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:30,003
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous.

969
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:33,070
You jeopardized everything.

970
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:50,117
You got it.

971
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:55,161
Well done.

972
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:55,942
Wait a minute.

973
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:57,674
Did you just compliment me?

974
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,540
He did, didn't he?

975
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,300
Kinda sounded like he did.

976
01:06:02,113 --> 01:06:03,513
I was good, wasn't I?

977
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:08,441
Hey, how about the fact that I
fought an Avenger, and didn't die?

978
01:06:08,441 --> 01:06:10,574
Now let's not dwell on the past.

979
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:12,864
We gotta finish our planning.

980
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:16,487
Don't mind him.

981
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:18,608
You did good.

982
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:27,287
Darren!

983
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:32,007
How the hell'd you get in here?

984
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:34,897
You left the front door open, Hank.

985
01:06:35,331 --> 01:06:37,065
It's official. You're old.

986
01:06:38,115 --> 01:06:39,115
The plans!

987
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:41,796
He will kill him.

988
01:06:45,726 --> 01:06:48,126
Well to what do I owe this pleasure?

989
01:06:49,523 --> 01:06:50,657
I have good news.

990
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:51,844
Really?

991
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:53,756
What's that?

992
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:55,751
Pym Tech,

993
01:06:56,737 --> 01:06:58,337
the company you created,

994
01:06:59,127 --> 01:07:03,360
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

995
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:07,082
We're anticipating 15 billion
in sales tomorrow alone.

996
01:07:14,052 --> 01:07:15,052
You're welcome.

997
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:22,439
I know this is odd, but
I'd like you to be there.

998
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:25,232
This is my moment,
I want you to see it.

999
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:27,022
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1000
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:28,107
I'll be there.

1001
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,061
What did you see in me?

1002
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,650
I don't know what you mean.

1003
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:52,889
All those years ago,
you picked me.

1004
01:07:53,262 --> 01:07:54,396
What did you see?

1005
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,020
I saw myself.

1006
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:00,857
Then why did you push me away?

1007
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:05,335
Because I saw too much of myself.

1008
01:08:17,237 --> 01:08:20,436
He knows, he's baiting you.
We have to call it off.

1009
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:21,769
We're all taking risks.

1010
01:08:21,835 --> 01:08:23,068
What if he saw me here?

1011
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:24,385
He didn't. There's no way.

1012
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,840
How do you know that?

1013
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Darren, hi.

1014
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:36,762
Hope.

1015
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,592
Where are you right now?

1016
01:08:39,254 --> 01:08:40,387
I'm at home, why?

1017
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,767
I just saw Hank.

1018
01:08:42,004 --> 01:08:44,270
I still get nothing but
contempt from him.

1019
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:47,545
Don't let him rile you up, he's just...
he's a senile old man.

1020
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:50,149
We need to start everyone
working around the clock,

1021
01:08:50,163 --> 01:08:52,230
get the assembly line up and running.

1022
01:08:52,275 --> 01:08:53,808
And I'm tripling security.

1023
01:08:53,908 --> 01:08:59,141
Full sensors at all entrances, and
exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.

1024
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
Great. Good idea.

1025
01:09:00,725 --> 01:09:01,725
Thank you, hope.

1026
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:04,374
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1027
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:10,530
He's tripling security, he's lost his mind,

1028
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:11,862
and he's on to you.

1029
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,013
But he's not on to you.

1030
01:09:14,274 --> 01:09:18,641
He's adding full body scanners to all
entrances and closing exterior vents.

1031
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:20,923
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1032
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:23,337
The water main.

1033
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:26,669
You can't add security to a water main.

1034
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:30,270
The pressure is too strong, but if
we can decrease it, that's how I get in.

1035
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:34,167
Somebody would have to reach the building's
control center to change the water pressure.

1036
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,479
I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross,
how are we supposed to do that?

1037
01:09:36,556 --> 01:09:38,023
So we expand our team.

1038
01:09:38,864 --> 01:09:39,931
What do we need?

1039
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:43,572
A fake security guard on the inside
to depressurize the water system,

1040
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:46,982
somebody else to hack into the power supply
and kill the laser grid,

1041
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:48,213
and a getaway guy.

1042
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:50,398
No, no. No, no no.

1043
01:09:50,488 --> 01:09:53,122
Not those three wombats. No way.

1044
01:09:53,825 --> 01:09:55,524
Thank you for the coffee ma'am.

1045
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:57,812
It's not too often that you rob a place,

1046
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:58,950
and then get welcomed back.

1047
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:00,838
Because we just robbed you!

1048
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:06,399
You know that he was arrested for
stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1049
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:07,701
Two smoothie machines.

1050
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:09,049
Are you sure they can handle this?

1051
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:10,827
Oh we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1052
01:10:10,863 --> 01:10:14,230
You'll forgive us if we're
not instilled with confidence.

1053
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:17,181
Wait, everybody, just kick back
and relax a little bit, man,

1054
01:10:17,228 --> 01:10:18,627
we know our business.

1055
01:10:18,657 --> 01:10:21,157
We broke into this spooky-ass
house, didn't we?

1056
01:10:21,164 --> 01:10:22,164
I let you.

1057
01:10:22,374 --> 01:10:25,240
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

1058
01:10:25,895 --> 01:10:28,195
Look, it's okay.
They can handle this.

1059
01:10:28,276 --> 01:10:29,243
Yeah, we can handle it.

1060
01:10:29,298 --> 01:10:30,131
You got their credentials?

1061
01:10:30,174 --> 01:10:31,041
He's in the system.

1062
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:32,324
I'm in the system?

1063
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:33,786
The system!

1064
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,063
The system?

1065
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:37,337
Yeah. We're doomed.

1066
01:10:37,349 --> 01:10:40,549
All right, there's something
you guys need to see.

1067
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:45,025
When you get to this corner, there's
gonna be three offices on your left side.

1068
01:10:45,111 --> 01:10:46,111
Damn!

1069
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,239
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1070
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:51,699
Now look,

1071
01:10:51,988 --> 01:10:55,354
this is gonna get weird, all right.
It's pretty freaky but it's safe.

1072
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,677
There's no reason to be scared.

1073
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,486
Aw, no no daddy don't get scared.

1074
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,100
Really?

1075
01:10:59,166 --> 01:10:59,766
Yeah.

1076
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:00,797
Good.

1077
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:06,435
Oh!

1078
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:10,334
This is the work of the gypsies.

1079
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:11,403
That's, that's, that's witchcraft.

1080
01:11:11,452 --> 01:11:12,719
Oh, that's amazing.

1081
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,977
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1082
01:11:15,024 --> 01:11:16,891
- That's some kind of wizardry.
- Sorcery!

1083
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:18,226
How'd you do that bro?

1084
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:20,843
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1085
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:22,403
Ahh!!  Ahh!!!

1086
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:26,481
I thought daddy didn't get scared?

1087
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:32,599
I gave them each half a Xanax and
Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1088
01:11:32,644 --> 01:11:34,177
Fell right asleep.

1089
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,758
Hey, look. I want to thank you for-

1090
01:11:37,855 --> 01:11:38,988
No, please don't.

1091
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:42,760
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

1092
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:46,695
I'm just glad that you might have a
slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1093
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:48,383
Hey. Thank you, you know,

1094
01:11:48,756 --> 01:11:50,056
for that pep talk.

1095
01:11:50,114 --> 01:11:54,180
You know, the honest truth is I actually went
from despising you to almost liking you.

1096
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,251
You really should write poetry.

1097
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:00,629
Get some sleep Scott.

1098
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:54,471
All right, just so we're clear, everyone
here knows their role, right?

1099
01:12:54,532 --> 01:12:55,132
Dave?

1100
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,062
Wheels on the ground.

1101
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:56,640
Kurt?

1102
01:12:56,698 --> 01:12:57,565
Eyes in the sky.

1103
01:12:57,654 --> 01:12:58,054
Luis?

1104
01:12:58,093 --> 01:13:00,326
Aw, man, you know it, you know
what, I get to wear a uniform,

1105
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:01,388
that's what's up.

1106
01:13:01,438 --> 01:13:02,038
Luis.

1107
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:04,604
I'm sorry, I mean, I'm good, I'm good,
I'm just excited, and plus

1108
01:13:04,662 --> 01:13:07,262
you're girlfriend's really hot, so
you know that makes me nervous too,

1109
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:08,326
and you are very beautiful ma'am.

1110
01:13:08,386 --> 01:13:09,386
Oh my lord.

1111
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:09,817
She's not my-

1112
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:12,744
Hey, you know what, I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover,

1113
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,979
like a whistling, y'know I' saying,
to like, blend in.

1114
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:16,517
No. Don't whistle.

1115
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:18,870
No whistling, it's not the
Andy Griffith Show.

1116
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:19,879
No whistling.

1117
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,068
All clear sector one.

1118
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:45,385
Step up.

1119
01:13:48,226 --> 01:13:49,226
All clear.

1120
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:55,744
We're set.

1121
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:56,914
Wish me luck.

1122
01:14:09,651 --> 01:14:10,651
Dude, is online.

1123
01:14:11,456 --> 01:14:13,590
(whistling "It's a Small World")

1124
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:25,132
Hey. What are you doing?

1125
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:29,275
Uh, boss-man said to secure the
area, so, I'm securing.

1126
01:14:31,825 --> 01:14:32,825
I'm the boss.

1127
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,340
Oh!

1128
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:35,446
Utilities work room 3-

1129
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:50,601
Water level is dropping.

1130
01:15:10,218 --> 01:15:11,218
Whoa!

1131
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:21,461
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1132
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,167
I see it!

1133
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:31,912
All right, come on, I gotta get up there,

1134
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:34,102
that's it, that's it guys, yeah!

1135
01:15:34,378 --> 01:15:35,578
That's it, yeah...

1136
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:38,683
Yes! You got it!

1137
01:15:39,032 --> 01:15:40,365
You got it, come on!

1138
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:46,979
All right, let's fly Antony.

1139
01:15:57,634 --> 01:15:59,701
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1140
01:15:59,845 --> 01:16:01,979
Pym's pulling up, right on time.

1141
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,325
Pshhh. Got a Crown Vic right outside a'heah.

1142
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:07,977
This is problem?

1143
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:11,833
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly
used car for under-cover cops, man,

1144
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:13,703
yes, this is a problem.

1145
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:18,033
It's Pym.

1146
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,542
Oh, no.

1147
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,911
I'm employing the bullet ants.

1148
01:16:24,006 --> 01:16:25,806
Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna.

1149
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:30,019
I don't remember what it's called
but I feel bad for this guy.

1150
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:37,889
Ow! Ow!!

1151
01:16:41,187 --> 01:16:44,620
See, that's what I'm talkin' bout, that's
what I call it, an unfortunate casualty,

1152
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,567
in a very serious operation.

1153
01:16:56,302 --> 01:16:57,769
Signal decoy in place.

1154
01:16:58,175 --> 01:17:00,375
Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.

1155
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,396
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1156
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,853
Scott, we have problem.

1157
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,738
Problem? What's the problem?

1158
01:17:08,967 --> 01:17:11,334
Dave! Dave, that's not
part of plan!

1159
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:12,363
Listen to me.

1160
01:17:12,645 --> 01:17:16,045
If I don't get into this
building people will die.

1161
01:17:17,557 --> 01:17:19,157
That's awfully dramatic.

1162
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:23,225
Are you kidding me?

1163
01:17:25,718 --> 01:17:26,718
Ha ha ha!

1164
01:17:27,472 --> 01:17:28,472
Problem solved.

1165
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,292
Well.

1166
01:17:47,357 --> 01:17:48,357
How do I look?

1167
01:17:58,791 --> 01:17:59,791
There he is.

1168
01:18:01,438 --> 01:18:02,438
Just in time.

1169
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:03,886
Come on.

1170
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:15,461
Twelve point verification.

1171
01:18:15,547 --> 01:18:17,647
Little over the top,
don't you think Darren?

1172
01:18:17,713 --> 01:18:18,880
Confirming authorization.

1173
01:18:18,918 --> 01:18:20,851
No you can never be too safe.

1174
01:18:20,925 --> 01:18:21,925
Access granted.

1175
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:32,882
I want to hand it to you,
Darren, you really did it.

1176
01:18:33,444 --> 01:18:36,109
And you only know
the half of it, Hank.

1177
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:03,458
Arriving at second position.

1178
01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:06,704
All right, top speed, Antony.
Let's go.

1179
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:20,074
Proceeding to command position.

1180
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,120
I'll be right back Antony.

1181
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,930
All right guys,
I'm in position.

1182
01:19:42,938 --> 01:19:44,871
I'm going to signal the ants.

1183
01:19:45,136 --> 01:19:46,136
No no nooo.

1184
01:19:48,094 --> 01:19:50,327
Did you see that?
Ha ha ha, ha ha!

1185
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:52,066
(musical horn)

1186
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,507
Assume formation.

1187
01:19:57,466 --> 01:19:59,233
All right you cute little crazies,

1188
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,854
let's fry these servers.

1189
01:20:13,555 --> 01:20:15,022
Let's go get it buddy!

1190
01:20:25,462 --> 01:20:26,462
Whoo-haa!

1191
01:20:27,762 --> 01:20:31,095
Servers are fried.
Data backup completely erased.

1192
01:20:31,346 --> 01:20:33,413
Headed to the particle chamber.

1193
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:41,237
Hello Dr. Cross.

1194
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,507
My associates agree to your terms.

1195
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,872
Wonderful.

1196
01:20:48,995 --> 01:20:51,562
Mr. Carson introduced me to
these fine gentlemen here,

1197
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:53,352
they're representatives of Hydra.

1198
01:20:53,386 --> 01:20:54,986
They're not what they were.

1199
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:56,822
They're doing some interesting work.

1200
01:20:57,365 --> 01:20:58,964
And I'm enjoying myself.

1201
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:06,613
You tried to hide your technology from me,
and now it's going to blow up in your face.

1202
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:09,620
Wow.

1203
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:11,411
Wow!

1204
01:21:12,422 --> 01:21:14,389
I mean, I saw the punch
coming a mile away

1205
01:21:14,401 --> 01:21:16,434
but I just figured it'd be
all pathetic and weak.

1206
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:18,032
Well you figured wrong.

1207
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:20,029
I know this van.

1208
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:23,115
Anybody home?

1209
01:21:23,216 --> 01:21:24,116
- Shh.
- Shh.

1210
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:25,459
-Shh!
-Shh!!

1211
01:21:28,358 --> 01:21:29,958
All right guys I'm here.

1212
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,033
Setting the charges.

1213
01:21:54,929 --> 01:21:57,596
Great job guys.
I'll take it from here.

1214
01:22:07,285 --> 01:22:08,285
Good boy Antony.

1215
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:11,992
Final position.

1216
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:22,595
Guys? How we lookin'
on that laser grid?

1217
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:24,238
- Almost!
- No you're not.

1218
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:26,848
- I'm getting close!
- No you're not.

1219
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,713
San Francisco PD!
Man in the van!

1220
01:22:33,585 --> 01:22:34,818
I know you're in there!

1221
01:22:34,851 --> 01:22:36,951
- Make it go faster.
- Don't. Seriously.

1222
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,825
Ready to jump.
Do you read Kurt?

1223
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,494
So close.

1224
01:22:46,605 --> 01:22:48,005
- Freeze!
- Okay, wait a minute wait a minute,

1225
01:22:48,054 --> 01:22:50,687
there was a black guy that looked exactly like me
who attacked us and put us in the back

1226
01:22:50,901 --> 01:22:52,234
of this disgusting van.

1227
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:54,034
- Get out.
- Take it easy!

1228
01:22:55,803 --> 01:22:56,803
Go! Go now!

1229
01:22:59,531 --> 01:23:01,731
- Wait!
- What? What d'you mean wait?

1230
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:13,035
What? What?

1231
01:23:14,768 --> 01:23:15,768
Hello guy.

1232
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:19,750
Heh heh heh heh heh.

1233
01:23:23,305 --> 01:23:24,305
Oh sh- Gah!

1234
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:31,595
I always suspected you had a
suit stored away somewhere,

1235
01:23:31,685 --> 01:23:34,952
which begs the question,
who is the new Ant-Man?

1236
01:23:35,548 --> 01:23:39,881
Who is the man that my beloved
mentor trusted even more than me?

1237
01:23:41,585 --> 01:23:43,685
Scott Lang.

1238
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,833
The martyr.

1239
01:23:46,971 --> 01:23:49,671
He took on the system
and paid the price,

1240
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:53,457
losing his family and his only
daughter in the process,

1241
01:23:53,603 --> 01:23:55,669
exactly your kind of guy, Hank.

1242
01:23:57,791 --> 01:24:01,858
He escapes his jail cell without
leaving any clue as to how,

1243
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,001
and then,

1244
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:06,123
he disappears magically,

1245
01:24:07,652 --> 01:24:12,884
despite having no money to his name,
and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit,

1246
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:17,770
the only thing that can rival my creation.

1247
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:20,299
Darren, don't do this.

1248
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:25,495
If you sell to these men,
it's going to be chaos.

1249
01:24:25,829 --> 01:24:29,563
I already have, and for twice
the price, thanks to you.

1250
01:24:30,836 --> 01:24:34,202
It's not easy to successfully
infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1251
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,235
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1252
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:41,278
Oh I'll sell them the Yellowjacket but
I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1253
01:24:41,335 --> 01:24:42,802
They don't run on diesel.

1254
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:46,044
If you want the fuel you'll
have to come to me.

1255
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:52,021
What do you call the only man who can arm
the most powerful weapon in the world?

1256
01:24:52,256 --> 01:24:54,589
The most powerful man in the world.

1257
01:24:55,176 --> 01:24:56,408
You proud of me yet?

1258
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:59,518
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1259
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,461
It's been too late for
a long time now.

1260
01:25:04,186 --> 01:25:05,186
Darren.

1261
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:08,834
What are you doing?

1262
01:25:08,882 --> 01:25:12,115
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1263
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:17,140
This is not who you are. It's the
particles altering your brain chemistry.

1264
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:27,450
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait wait.

1265
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,220
You're right.

1266
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:31,738
I have to be the one to do it.

1267
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,740
Here we go.

1268
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:39,335
Drop. Your. Gun.

1269
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:45,709
You know I came to the house
the other night to kill him

1270
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:46,412
but you were there.

1271
01:25:46,423 --> 01:25:50,023
You're sick and I can help you
just put the gun down.

1272
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,244
I wasn't ready to kill you then.

1273
01:25:52,912 --> 01:25:54,312
But I think I am now.

1274
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:56,341
Drop your gun now!

1275
01:25:56,814 --> 01:25:58,947
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1276
01:26:12,815 --> 01:26:13,815
Dad!

1277
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:24,950
Hank. No, no. Hank.

1278
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:28,630
Hank. Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1279
01:26:28,714 --> 01:26:30,281
All right, you're gonna be just fine.

1280
01:26:30,938 --> 01:26:35,205
Take the suit off or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1281
01:27:00,373 --> 01:27:03,973
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech,
request immediate backup.

1282
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:05,079
Go, go, go.

1283
01:27:17,898 --> 01:27:20,297
Get me to the roof
and radio ahead.

1284
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,408
I want to make sure the
helicopter's ready to take off.

1285
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,972
You two, kill anything that
comes out of that vault.

1286
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:29,712
Dad,

1287
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
can you move?

1288
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,230
Yes.

1289
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,774
We need to get him out of here.

1290
01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:39,368
Go. Get. That suit.

1291
01:28:21,611 --> 01:28:22,611
Hey Scotty.

1292
01:28:23,642 --> 01:28:25,308
Hey did I save your life?

1293
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:27,168
Scotty?

1294
01:28:27,898 --> 01:28:28,898
Scotty?

1295
01:28:31,163 --> 01:28:32,163
Thank you Luis.

1296
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,457
Hey are we the good guys?

1297
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,547
- Yeah.
- We're the good guys right?

1298
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:37,354
Yeah, we're the good guys.

1299
01:28:37,419 --> 01:28:39,219
Feels kinda, kinda weird, y'know.

1300
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:41,169
Yeah. But we're not done yet.

1301
01:28:41,547 --> 01:28:44,214
Get outta here before
this place blows.

1302
01:28:49,985 --> 01:28:50,985
Oh, dammit!

1303
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:52,667
That guy.

1304
01:28:54,513 --> 01:28:56,580
Hey! We're getting out of here.

1305
01:29:01,242 --> 01:29:04,575
The charges are set. We've got
to find a way out of here and fast.

1306
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,768
Don't worry.

1307
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:07,784
I'm not going to die.

1308
01:29:09,157 --> 01:29:10,790
And neither are you.

1309
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:12,734
It's not a keychain.

1310
01:29:17,532 --> 01:29:18,766
All the chaos in hand.

1311
01:29:18,774 --> 01:29:20,874
Multiple shots fired.

1312
01:29:30,419 --> 01:29:32,386
And there's a tank.

1313
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:43,071
A little help.

1314
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:46,294
I got him.

1315
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:48,073
We need a doctor.

1316
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:53,219
(musical horn)

1317
01:29:56,369 --> 01:29:57,369
Let's go!

1318
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:14,776
Antony!

1319
01:30:28,404 --> 01:30:29,404
Go!

1320
01:30:30,762 --> 01:30:32,629
You're going to regret that.

1321
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,310
Wait a minute.
Get out of that van.

1322
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:46,041
- What?
- Get out of that van.

1323
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:48,933
Too loud there's a tank
I can't hear you.

1324
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,486
Hey! Hey!

1325
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,384
Are you crazy?
Put the gun down!

1326
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,541
The window!

1327
01:31:03,913 --> 01:31:07,213
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

1328
01:31:07,282 --> 01:31:09,515
It was never just a heist.

1329
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:32,331
Put the gun down.

1330
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:44,028
I got him, I got him,
there he is, go go go go

1331
01:32:00,275 --> 01:32:02,275
Got to set her down somewhere.

1332
01:32:31,586 --> 01:32:33,586
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1333
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,455
Playing "Disintegration" by The Cure.

1334
01:33:14,132 --> 01:33:15,131
Call 911!

1335
01:33:34,068 --> 01:33:35,068
It's okay.

1336
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:41,798
Police! Put your hands up.

1337
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:42,824
Get 'em up.

1338
01:33:44,575 --> 01:33:45,575
Scott?

1339
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:46,854
Paxton.

1340
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,554
You have to listen to me-

1341
01:34:15,294 --> 01:34:17,560
Paxton. Turn around, take me back.

1342
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:19,742
I am taking you back. To prison.

1343
01:34:19,796 --> 01:34:22,296
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1344
01:34:22,393 --> 01:34:23,860
In the bug zapper, it-

1345
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:27,219
You need to desist right now!

1346
01:34:27,226 --> 01:34:28,793
Your delusions are out of hand!

1347
01:34:28,837 --> 01:34:32,770
All units we have a 236
in progress at 840 Winter Street.

1348
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:34,147
It's Cassie!

1349
01:34:51,745 --> 01:34:52,811
Don't be scared.

1350
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:55,367
Paxton let me help.

1351
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:57,274
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

1352
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:59,240
Maggie, what's going on?

1353
01:34:59,316 --> 01:35:00,883
- He's got Cassie!
- Who's got Cassie?

1354
01:35:00,963 --> 01:35:02,663
That thing, that thing, I don't know what it...!

1355
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:12,866
Are you a monster?

1356
01:35:14,603 --> 01:35:16,270
Do I look like a monster?

1357
01:35:17,686 --> 01:35:18,753
I want my daddy.

1358
01:35:21,072 --> 01:35:22,539
I want your daddy too.

1359
01:35:23,241 --> 01:35:24,241
Aaaaah!

1360
01:35:26,174 --> 01:35:26,974
There you are.

1361
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:28,309
Daddy, is that you?

1362
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,540
Hi Peanut.

1363
01:35:32,231 --> 01:35:35,231
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1364
01:35:47,819 --> 01:35:50,086
Now where'd you go, little guy?

1365
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:56,629
There you are.

1366
01:35:57,087 --> 01:35:58,087
Ha ha ha ha.

1367
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:01,460
Not just me.

1368
01:36:12,686 --> 01:36:13,686
Get him!

1369
01:36:14,664 --> 01:36:16,164
Go! Go!

1370
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,413
Scotty needs us, y'know I' sayin'.

1371
01:37:11,608 --> 01:37:13,474
Ain't nothin' gonna stop us.

1372
01:37:16,408 --> 01:37:19,175
- Back it up. Back it up slow.
- Yeah.

1373
01:37:20,123 --> 01:37:21,123
- Back it up.
- Yep, yep.

1374
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:22,803
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1375
01:37:22,813 --> 01:37:23,913
All we gonna do is, we j-,

1376
01:37:23,994 --> 01:37:25,361
- we just back it up.
- Right, that's it.

1377
01:37:25,403 --> 01:37:26,403
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1378
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:28,725
- Backin' up?
- Yep.

1379
01:37:28,807 --> 01:37:31,074
- Just back it, b-b-b- back it up.

1380
01:37:37,442 --> 01:37:38,842
You insult me, Scott.

1381
01:37:43,873 --> 01:37:46,606
Your very existence is
insulting to me.

1382
01:37:49,756 --> 01:37:53,889
Y'know it would be much easier
to hit you if you were bigger.

1383
01:37:54,713 --> 01:37:55,713
Yeah, I agree.

1384
01:38:18,493 --> 01:38:19,493
Cassie!

1385
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:29,211
Let me show you just how
insignificant you are.

1386
01:38:31,019 --> 01:38:32,286
Cassie, I'm coming!

1387
01:38:34,453 --> 01:38:35,653
Waaaah!

1388
01:38:46,346 --> 01:38:47,913
That's a messed-up looking dog.

1389
01:38:47,953 --> 01:38:50,687
I'm going to destroy everything you love.

1390
01:38:52,282 --> 01:38:53,782
Freeze! S.F.P.D.!

1391
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,377
I can't break through.

1392
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,417
It's titanium, you idiot.

1393
01:39:12,237 --> 01:39:13,470
Get her out of here.

1394
01:39:13,545 --> 01:39:14,545
Come on.

1395
01:39:15,776 --> 01:39:16,910
Sorry sweetheart.

1396
01:39:17,019 --> 01:39:19,119
You have to help daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1397
01:39:19,211 --> 01:39:20,878
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

1398
01:39:20,924 --> 01:39:21,924
Behind me.

1399
01:39:23,594 --> 01:39:26,061
I'm going to have to shrink between
the molecules to get in there.

1400
01:39:26,157 --> 01:39:27,290
Get away from us!

1401
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:30,833
Daddy, help!

1402
01:39:30,846 --> 01:39:32,046
I love you Cassie.

1403
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:51,125
Aaaaaaah!!!!

1404
01:40:02,102 --> 01:40:03,436
Daddy where are you?

1405
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,267
...go sub-atomic...

1406
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,017
...go sub-atomic...

1407
01:40:09,594 --> 01:40:10,594
Oh no.

1408
01:40:23,127 --> 01:40:27,560
You would enter a reality where
all concepts of time and space (echos)

1409
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:35,040
become irrelevant. (echos continue)

1410
01:40:47,146 --> 01:40:48,479
And as you shrink...

1411
01:40:50,697 --> 01:40:52,464
for all eternity...

1412
01:40:55,683 --> 01:40:57,583
everything that you know...

1413
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:00,541
and love...

1414
01:41:02,316 --> 01:41:03,916
gone forever.

1415
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,868
(Cassie's voice echos)

1416
01:41:30,754 --> 01:41:31,754
Daddy!

1417
01:41:32,022 --> 01:41:33,022
Cassie!

1418
01:41:40,713 --> 01:41:41,713
Come on daddy.

1419
01:41:46,064 --> 01:41:49,031
Do not mess with the regulator.

1420
01:42:19,162 --> 01:42:20,162
Daddy!

1421
01:42:24,284 --> 01:42:25,551
I love you so much.

1422
01:42:26,424 --> 01:42:27,424
I love you too.

1423
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:29,309
So much.

1424
01:42:30,249 --> 01:42:31,249
Ahem.

1425
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:36,296
There's a big hole in the roof.

1426
01:42:39,048 --> 01:42:40,048
Sorry.

1427
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:44,163
Is she all right?

1428
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,220
She's fine.

1429
01:42:46,982 --> 01:42:47,982
Mommy.

1430
01:42:50,995 --> 01:42:52,528
She's fine, she's fine.

1431
01:43:01,706 --> 01:43:03,306
Scott, please.

1432
01:43:03,646 --> 01:43:05,512
You don't remember anything?

1433
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,310
Hank, I, I don't.

1434
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:09,648
There must be something else.

1435
01:43:11,723 --> 01:43:17,723
Well I suppose the human mind just
can't comprehend the experience, but

1436
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,310
you made it.

1437
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:23,279
You went in

1438
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:25,431
and you got out.

1439
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:29,165
It's amazing.

1440
01:43:30,178 --> 01:43:31,178
Scott.

1441
01:43:32,019 --> 01:43:33,219
I'll walk you out.

1442
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:39,439
Get some rest.

1443
01:43:47,846 --> 01:43:48,846
Can it possibly...?

1444
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,430
When did this happen?

1445
01:44:09,456 --> 01:44:10,523
Nothing's happening.

1446
01:44:10,531 --> 01:44:12,731
Well hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1447
01:44:13,561 --> 01:44:16,561
Well if that's the case, uh,
shoot me again.

1448
01:44:17,032 --> 01:44:19,465
Yeah, I don't know what you're doing
grabbing me and kissing me like that.

1449
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:22,507
I was a little surprised myself.
I have to get somewhere.

1450
01:44:22,595 --> 01:44:25,195
I'll see you later Hank.
Really, Hope.

1451
01:44:26,148 --> 01:44:27,281
- Scott.
- Yeah.

1452
01:44:28,164 --> 01:44:30,431
- You're full of shit.
- Oh yeah.

1453
01:44:31,626 --> 01:44:33,326
Well Scott I met with my Captain today.

1454
01:44:33,405 --> 01:44:36,738
He wanted a report of the
night you got out of jail.

1455
01:44:36,823 --> 01:44:38,890
Something happened with the cameras, and

1456
01:44:38,945 --> 01:44:40,678
circuits got fried, and...

1457
01:44:42,212 --> 01:44:44,712
But I told him you were
processed correctly.

1458
01:44:44,774 --> 01:44:45,774
Really?

1459
01:44:46,263 --> 01:44:47,263
Well yeah.

1460
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:52,157
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back
to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1461
01:44:52,231 --> 01:44:53,364
Thank you Paxton.

1462
01:44:53,978 --> 01:44:54,978
I'm blown away.

1463
01:44:56,527 --> 01:44:58,193
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1464
01:44:58,248 --> 01:45:00,115
Oh well, that's my pleasure.

1465
01:45:01,326 --> 01:45:04,126
But no, no this one, I,
I did it for you.

1466
01:45:06,548 --> 01:45:07,715
This is awkward.

1467
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:08,797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1468
01:45:09,389 --> 01:45:11,622
I mean what do we even
talk about after all that?

1469
01:45:11,675 --> 01:45:12,375
- Oh I know.
- What?

1470
01:45:12,398 --> 01:45:14,798
- I did my first cartwheel today.
- What?

1471
01:45:15,444 --> 01:45:20,044
Yeah. She has been practicing all
week, but today was the magic day.

1472
01:45:20,169 --> 01:45:22,235
I recorded it on my phone here.

1473
01:45:22,505 --> 01:45:25,072
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1474
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,457
- Yeah it is.
- Yeah it is.

1475
01:45:26,491 --> 01:45:28,524
This is a professional gymnast,
there's no way that's her.

1476
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,673
Yeah, that's her.

1477
01:45:30,863 --> 01:45:32,163
Good boy.

1478
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,953
Sweetie that's pretty amazing, Peanut.

1479
01:45:39,675 --> 01:45:40,675
Sorry.

1480
01:45:42,215 --> 01:45:43,215
It's work.

1481
01:45:44,402 --> 01:45:45,402
Yeah?

1482
01:45:47,936 --> 01:45:48,936
All right.

1483
01:45:48,996 --> 01:45:50,829
Here's the deal.
Just give me the facts.

1484
01:45:50,887 --> 01:45:52,554
Just the facts, only the facts.

1485
01:45:52,704 --> 01:45:53,704
Breathe. Focus.

1486
01:45:55,047 --> 01:45:55,847
Keep it simple.

1487
01:45:55,897 --> 01:45:57,197
No no no,
no doubt, no doubt.

1488
01:45:57,204 --> 01:46:00,504
Okay, so I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1489
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:03,573
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism
exhibit, and you know me, I'm more like

1490
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:05,140
a Neo-cubist kind of guy, right?

1491
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,359
But there was this one Rothko that
was sublime, bro, oh my God-

1492
01:46:07,506 --> 01:46:08,506
Luis.

1493
01:46:09,116 --> 01:46:12,049
Okay sorry sorry I'm j- y'know
uh, I just get excited and stuff.

1494
01:46:12,137 --> 01:46:13,137
But anyway, anyway.

1495
01:46:13,256 --> 01:46:14,189
Ignacio tells me:

1496
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:16,684
Yo, I met this crazy fine writer chick
at the spot last night, like,

1497
01:46:17,473 --> 01:46:19,073
fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.

1498
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:20,415
And he goes up to the bartender and goes:

1499
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:21,674
Look at the girl I'm with?
Y'know I' sayin'

1500
01:46:21,772 --> 01:46:23,072
She's crazy stupid fine right?

1501
01:46:23,157 --> 01:46:24,190
And the bartender's all like:

1502
01:46:24,215 --> 01:46:25,815
Yeah, crazy stupid fine.

1503
01:46:26,383 --> 01:46:29,683
So this writer chick tells Ignacio:
Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of

1504
01:46:29,749 --> 01:46:33,716
guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains, y'know I' sayin?

1505
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,254
Ignacio's like: For real?

1506
01:46:35,335 --> 01:46:38,635
And she's like: Yeah. You know what, I
can't tell you who my contact is, because

1507
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,076
he works with the Avengers.

1508
01:46:40,099 --> 01:46:41,099
Oh no.

1509
01:46:41,222 --> 01:46:43,789
Yeah, this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man.

1510
01:46:43,872 --> 01:46:45,205
Like he comes up to him and he says, y'know:

1511
01:46:45,237 --> 01:46:48,704
I'm looking for this dude who's mo' unseen
who's flashing this fresh tat, who's got, like,

1512
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:50,776
bomb moves, right? Who you got?

1513
01:46:50,802 --> 01:46:53,935
And she's like: Well, we got everything
nowadays, we got a guy who jumps,

1514
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:56,607
we got a guy who swings, we got
a guy who crawls up the walls,

1515
01:46:56,649 --> 01:46:57,749
you gotta be more specific.

1516
01:46:57,803 --> 01:46:59,970
And he's like: I'm looking for a guy who shrinks.

1517
01:46:59,974 --> 01:47:02,007
And I'm like: Daaamn!
I got all nervous 'cause

1518
01:47:02,106 --> 01:47:03,506
I keep mad secrets
for you, bro.

1519
01:47:03,531 --> 01:47:04,398
So I asked Ignacio:

1520
01:47:04,495 --> 01:47:05,295
Did bad-ass

1521
01:47:05,325 --> 01:47:06,525
tell the stupid fine writer chick

1522
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:07,541
to tell you to tell me

1523
01:47:07,965 --> 01:47:10,898
because I'm tight with that man
that he's looking for him?

1524
01:47:10,964 --> 01:47:11,964
And?

1525
01:47:12,074 --> 01:47:13,074
What'd he say?

1526
01:47:16,456 --> 01:47:17,956
He said yes.

1527
01:47:25,857 --> 01:47:27,357
There's something I want to show you.

1528
01:47:30,358 --> 01:47:33,558
I realized...
We can't destroy our...

1529
01:47:35,059 --> 01:47:37,559
All we can do is make sure 
it is in the right hands.

1530
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:50,060
This is an advanced prototype that
your mother and I worked on together.

1531
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:52,061
She never got to use it.

1532
01:47:54,162 --> 01:47:56,000
And now I realize that we were...

1533
01:47:56,663 --> 01:47:58,463
We were working on it for you.

1534
01:48:05,063 --> 01:48:07,263
Maybe it's time we finished it.

1535
01:48:14,564 --> 01:48:15,864
It's about damn time.

1536
01:48:23,865 --> 01:48:24,565
Hey Cap!

1537
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:41,126
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.

1538
01:48:42,027 --> 01:48:44,127
- If we call Tony...
- Nah, he won't believe us.

1539
01:48:44,128 --> 01:48:44,728
Even if he did...

1540
01:48:44,729 --> 01:48:46,429
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

1541
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:49,330
We're on our own.

1542
01:48:51,131 --> 01:48:52,231
Maybe not.

1543
01:48:54,832 --> 01:48:55,932
I know a guy.
