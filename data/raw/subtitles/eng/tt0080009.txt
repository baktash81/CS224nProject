1
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,435
- Good night.
- Good night, Sir John.

2
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,446
Begging your pardon, sir.

3
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:48,083
We met on this selfsame road
the other day...

4
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:52,283
...and I said, "Good night," and
you replied, "Good night, Sir John."

5
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,291
I may have.

6
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,123
- Did so again today.
- So I did.

7
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,701
Why call me "Sir John" when I be
plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?

8
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:07,034
Just a whim of mine.
I'm Parson Tringham by the way.

9
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,773
I made a discovery about you
while tracing some family trees...

10
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:14,642
...for our new county history.
I'm an antiquarian, you know.

11
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,078
You, Durbeyfield,
are directly descended...

12
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,652
...from the knightly house
of the d'Urbervilles.

13
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,791
- Did you really not know that?
- Never heard it before, sir.

14
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,594
Raise your head a little so that I can
see your face from the side.

15
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,887
Yes, that's the d'Urberville
nose and chin.

16
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,159
- A trifle coarser than of old, but still.
- Daze my eyes.

17
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,101
According to the records, your line
goes back to Sir Pagan d'Urberville...

18
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,740
...who came from Normandy
with William the Conqueror.

19
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,706
I've been slaving away
and living rough all these years?

20
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,245
Well, I thought you might already
know something about it.

21
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:52,010
It is true, I got an old silver spoon
at home and a graven seal...

22
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,646
...but I never paid them much heed.
Where do we d'Urbervilles live today?

23
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,418
You don't live anywhere.

24
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:04,190
You lie buried in your family vault
at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill...

25
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:08,768
...laid out in lead coffins with your
effigies under marble canopies.

26
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,633
- And where be our family mansions?
- You haven't any.

27
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,102
No land neither?

28
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,766
None at all?

29
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,504
You had an abundance of land
in the old days.

30
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,438
What can I do about it, sir?

31
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,915
Well, as to that....

32
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:28,180
- Can I do nothing?
- Nothing whatever...

33
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,325
...save possibly chasten yourself
by thinking:

34
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,892
"How are the mighty fallen."

35
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,551
Good night...

36
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,630
...Sir John.

37
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,604
Won't you take a quart of beer
with me, sir?

38
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,905
There's a grand brew to be had
at The Pure Drop.

39
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,377
Though not so good as at Rolliver's.

40
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,821
Sir John d'Urberville.

41
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,962
That's who I am.

42
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,566
What is this?

43
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:29,067
- It is our club dance, sir.
- Club dance?

44
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,440
- But where are your partners?
- They've not finished work yet.

45
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,979
They'll be here by and by.

46
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,084
- Will you join us till then, sir?
- With pleasure...

47
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,652
...but one partner won't go far
among so many.

48
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,846
One's better than none.

49
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,959
It is sad work a-footing it
with no one to give you a squeeze.

50
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,594
Don't be so forward.

51
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,232
- What are you doing?
- I've a mind to enjoy myself. Come on.

52
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,062
You're full of nonsense.
Suppose someone sees us.

53
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:58,967
All right, go on. Don't wait for me.
I'll catch you up in five minutes.

54
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,317
Sir? Hey, hey, hey, sir?
Hey, sir?

55
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,948
Life has found me
a great gentleman.

56
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,561
- Noblest in the county!
- Lord, oh, Lord.

57
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,960
If it isn't your father
riding home in his cart.

58
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:39,003
There bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I!

59
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,403
Father's tired, that's all.

60
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,135
He sent for the cart
because our own horse died.

61
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,539
You know that very well.

62
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:49,672
Rows and rows
of knightly ancestors, I got.

63
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,117
Bain't be a man in the whole
of Wessex with finer skeletons than I.

64
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,285
I'm glad you've come.
Where are you off to?

65
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,182
I thought I'd change and help you.

66
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,790
You bide here. I want to tell you
what's happened.

67
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,190
We've been found to be the greatest
gentlefolk in the county...

68
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,854
...reaching back long before
Oliver Crumble's time...

69
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,661
...back to the days
of the pagan Turks.

70
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,430
With monuments and vaults...

71
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:48,166
...and crests and coats of arms,
and the Lord knows what all!

72
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,436
Is that why Father made such
a mommet of himself in that cart?

73
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:54,479
Our true name is d'Urberville.

74
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,516
That's why he came home in style,
not because he'd been drinking.

75
00:11:58,686 --> 00:11:59,914
Where is he now?

76
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,079
It was a parson told him
the pedigree of the matter.

77
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:06,192
- But where is he now?
- Well, to tell you the truth...

78
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,490
...he was that upset, he's gone off
to Rolliver's to get up his strength.

79
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,360
Much strength he'll find
at the bottom of a pint pot.

80
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:17,300
Very well, I'll go and get him.
We'll be back afore you know it.

81
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,840
Now, look, be a good girl
and put the little ones to bed for me.

82
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,614
There it is.

83
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,685
That?

84
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,485
That spoon may be small,
but my family was great.

85
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,652
- Jack, I've got a project.
- We owned carriages, estates...

86
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,162
- ...and mansions without number.
- Listen to me.

87
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,732
Is there any money in it?

88
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,565
It is well to be kin to a coach,
even if you don't ride in one.

89
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:54,264
I've been thinking since
you brought me the news.

90
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,274
- I've got a project.
- Which reminds me, woman.

91
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,175
You better find that dang seal
of ours, or I'll do you a mischief.

92
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:05,409
Listen. There's a great lady
by the name of d'Urberville...

93
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:07,383
...living out by Trantridge.

94
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,955
Well, she's nothing compared
with us.

95
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,115
Younger branch of the family,
no doubt.

96
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,457
I'll wager they don't go back
to King Norman's day.

97
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,224
That's as may be, but she's rich.

98
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,561
Lot of good her money will do us.

99
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:27,168
It could do. We must send
our Tess to claim kin.

100
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,208
- Claim kin?
- Why shouldn't two branches...

101
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:34,040
...of the same family
be on visiting terms?

102
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:37,150
It would certainly put her
in the way of a grand marriage.

103
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,448
Then she ought to go there tomorrow.
Let's drink to that. Mrs. Rolliver!

104
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:46,082
There you are, my poppet.
We was just on our way.

105
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,227
But you're asking me to go begging.

106
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,928
Begging. What are you saying?

107
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,205
It is all in the family.

108
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,003
If they was in need, I should
take them in without a word.

109
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:11,014
We all have to take the ups
with the downs, Tess.

110
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,743
Now, you must go and see her...

111
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,787
...and ask her for some help
in our trouble.

112
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:20,757
If the lady received me at all, it
would be enough if she were friendly.

113
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,987
You must not expect her to help us.

114
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,391
Come, come, my dear.

115
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:28,433
With your pretty face,
you could coax her into anything.

116
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,366
I'd rather try to get work.

117
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:35,809
Durbeyfield, you decide.

118
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,742
If you say she must go, she'll go.

119
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:48,583
Well, girl, do you want to go visiting
this grand kinswoman of ours?

120
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:52,157
- I'd much sooner not, Father.
- There, she doesn't want to!

121
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:56,524
I don't like my children making
themselves beholden with strange kin.

122
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:01,568
I'm the head of the noblest branch
of the family...

123
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,000
...and I got my pride to think of.

124
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,467
All this bragging about your ancestors.

125
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,377
It isn't them as will buy us
a new horse.

126
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,733
It's all new.

127
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,904
Well, my beauty...

128
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,070
...what can I do for you?

129
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,385
- I came to see Mrs. d'Urberville.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

130
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,282
She's an invalid.

131
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:05,656
What was your business with her?
I'm her son.

132
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,892
It wasn't business, it was....

133
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,592
I can hardly say what.

134
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,364
- Not business, sir, no.
- Pleasure, then?

135
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,764
No, sir.

136
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,197
It is so very foolish, I....

137
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,639
- I fear I can't tell you.
- Never mind.

138
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,006
I like foolish things.

139
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,948
Try again, dear.

140
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:33,712
I came, sir, to tell you that...

141
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,388
...we are of the same family as you.

142
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,417
Poor relations?

143
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,230
- Yes.
- Stokes?

144
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,727
No, d'Urbervilles.

145
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,369
Yes, yes, I meant d'Urbervilles.

146
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,595
Tell me...

147
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,302
...do you like strawberries?

148
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:00,906
- Yes, when they're in season.
- Here, they already are.

149
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,343
Our name has become Durbeyfield...

150
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,953
...but we have several proofs
that we're d'Urbervilles.

151
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,953
That's who the antiquarians
hold we are, so Mother said...

152
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,388
...we should make ourselves
beknown to you...

153
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,586
...as we've lost our horse...

154
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,231
...and we are the oldest branch
of the family.

155
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,264
I see.

156
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,235
So you've come to pay me
a courtesy call, really...

157
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,168
...as one relation to another.

158
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:32,745
- I suppose I have.
- Yes. Well, there's no harm in that.

159
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,880
I would rather take it
from my own hand.

160
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,617
Don't be so coy, my pretty cousin.

161
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:52,197
There.

162
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,447
Come, this one too.

163
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,656
It's the perfect place.

164
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,521
Believe me.

165
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,560
You'll look a regular posy!

166
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,392
- What's the matter?
- A thorn.

167
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:31,266
Cousin, beauty has its price.

168
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:38,503
I'm not very hungry. Truly, I'm not.

169
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,044
Nonsense.

170
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,773
You must eat something
before you go.

171
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,919
It's no mean ride
from here to your village.

172
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,433
I shall see what I can do for you.

173
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:05,698
But listen, Tess, no more
of this d'Urberville nonsense.

174
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,773
Plain Durbeyfield, understand?

175
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,240
It's quite a different name.

176
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,538
I wish for no better, sir.

177
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:21,254
"In reference to your daughter
and further to her visit...

178
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,686
...we write to inform you
of our willingness...

179
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,986
...to consider engaging her services...

180
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:33,030
...in the managing of a poultry farm
of modern character.

181
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,137
If, after a suitable period,
your daughter...

182
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,706
...proves satisfactory,
we should guarantee her...

183
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,811
...comfortable accommodation
and a good wage.

184
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:50,814
Your earliest reply would be
greatly appreciated."

185
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,178
So you charmed them after all,
did you?

186
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,686
Let me see that letter.

187
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,848
- Who wrote it?
- Who?

188
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:03,395
Mrs. d'Urberville, of course.
Look at the signature.

189
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,925
Me? Manage a poultry farm?

190
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,332
- I truly don't think I should go.
- Poultry.

191
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:16,966
It is just her way of getting you there
without raising your hopes too much.

192
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,009
She's going to own you as kin.

193
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:21,670
Hey! The seal!

194
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,543
This is it!

195
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,882
It's the same as ours.
Look at it, lad.

196
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:30,512
A ramping, great, big lion
with a castle on top.

197
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,491
There's no denying it, girl.

198
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,150
Mrs. d'Urberville recognized
her own flesh and blood.

199
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,228
But she never even saw me.

200
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,730
Well, you couldn't expect her to throw
her arms round your neck...

201
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,994
...her being an invalid.

202
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,472
But her son made you welcome.
He called you "cousin," didn't he?

203
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,106
I'd rather bide here with you.

204
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,360
Goodbye, Father.

205
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:22,330
- You're off, then?
- Yes. Goodbye, Father.

206
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,409
Goodbye, girl.

207
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,470
You're a comely sight.

208
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:30,474
This young cousin of yours...

209
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,582
...tell him that, being so come down
in the world...

210
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,113
...I'll sell him the title.

211
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,452
Yes, I'll sell it, but a fair price.

212
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,187
Not less than
a thousand pounds, mind.

213
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,958
That's right, tell him
I'll take a thousand pounds.

214
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:51,297
Well, now I come to think on it...

215
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:55,464
...he can have it for a hundred.
I won't stand on trifles.

216
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,172
Fifty.

217
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,710
Twenty pounds, tell him,
and not a penny less.

218
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:07,586
- Family honor is family honor.
- Come, it's time to go.

219
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,722
I want to walk a little ways
with Tess.

220
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,519
So do I, now she's leaving
to marry our gentleman cousin.

221
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,422
I'll hear no more of that.

222
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,689
Mother, how could you have put
such nonsense into their heads?

223
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,595
She's going to work for a rich relation,
my dears...

224
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,635
...and help us earn enough money
to get a new horse.

225
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:40,214
Oh, Mother, I wish our Tess
hadn't gone to be a lady.

226
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,171
Don't hold my arm!
Grab me round the waist!

227
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,355
Ungrateful little minx. Why abandon
me as soon as you feel safe?

228
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,520
The danger came of your foolishness.

229
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:27,223
I say, what a temper.

230
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,267
When people are on top of a hill,
they have to get down somehow.

231
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:32,200
But not at a gallop, surely.

232
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:35,864
Fancy being asked that
by a brave little beauty like you.

233
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,704
I always go downhill at a gallop.

234
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:41,143
You can't beat it
for stirring the blood.

235
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,112
But perhaps you needn't
do so again.

236
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,047
Perhaps not.

237
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,982
It all depends.

238
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,454
One little kiss on those ruby lips
or even on that satin cheek...

239
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,220
...and I drive at a snail's pace,
word of honor.

240
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:58,193
But I don't want to be kissed, sir.

241
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,737
Stop, stop, I beg you!

242
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,805
Very well, do as you wish.
I don't mind.

243
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:14,037
But I thought you'd protect me,
being a kinsman.

244
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,040
Kinsman be hanged.

245
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:25,754
You're mighty sensitive
for a village lass.

246
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,904
- Oh, my hat!
- Whoa, boy.

247
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,347
You look even prettier without it!

248
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:05,089
- Come along, now. Up you get.
- No, sir.

249
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:07,460
- You won't ride with me?
- No, I shall walk.

250
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,228
It's four miles to Trantridge, at least.

251
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,600
I wouldn't care if it were 20.

252
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,648
You watch out for Dollop, the bailiff.
He's a devil.

253
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:31,115
Not Mr. Alec. Spends half
his time on horseback...

254
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,885
...and the rest of it chasing
the likes of us.

255
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:38,322
His mother's a queer old soul,
but no real trouble.

256
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,929
It is a mercy for us she's blind.

257
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,432
- Mrs. d'Urberville's blind?
- Stone-blind.

258
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,806
Their real name is Stoke.

259
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,539
How's that?

260
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:55,738
It were Mr. Alec's father
had the notion.

261
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,440
He bought the name
of an old extinguished family...

262
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,085
...to make himself important.

263
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:03,188
Whatever are you doing?
Missus is waiting for her birds.

264
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,347
Quick, it slipped my mind entirely.

265
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:08,187
Now, you catch hold
of Phena there...

266
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,056
...and that one.

267
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,453
That one there and the white one.

268
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,484
So you are the new young woman.

269
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:09,349
Well, how are my birds?

270
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,328
This is Strut.

271
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:29,332
He doesn't seem so lively today,
does he?

272
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:34,945
He's alarmed at being handled
by a stranger, I suppose.

273
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,516
And Phena?

274
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:44,821
Yes, yes.

275
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:48,791
They are a little frightened.
Aren't you, my poor dears?

276
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:50,690
Never mind.

277
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,957
They'll soon get used to you.

278
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,964
Can you whistle?

279
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,230
Whistle, ma'am?

280
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,871
Yes, whistle tunes.

281
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,502
A little.

282
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,973
Then you will have to practice
every day.

283
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:09,081
I think a lot of my fowls, but there are
also my bullfinches to consider.

284
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,049
I had a young lad who whistled
to them very well, but he left.

285
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,811
They've been neglected for days.

286
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:17,513
Master Alec whistled to them
this morning, ma'am.

287
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,149
Him.

288
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:47,885
Nor art nor nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you, Cousin Tess.

289
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:52,013
To see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away...

290
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,160
...without producing a single note.

291
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:58,058
- It is all a part of my work, sir.
- Never mind. I'll teach you.

292
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:02,926
I won't lay a finger on you.
See? I'll stay exactly where I am.

293
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,668
Now you watch me.

294
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:09,404
Don't screw up your lips too tight.

295
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:11,441
Do it like this.

296
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,575
Blow gently.

297
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:24,280
Gently.

298
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,691
Try.

299
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:33,699
No, no. Try again.

300
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,694
Again.

301
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:46,511
There. You'll manage splendidly
now I've started you off.

302
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:52,007
Tell me, Tess, don't you find
my mother a little odd?

303
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,120
I hardly know her, sir.

304
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,715
Well, I'm not in her good books
at the moment.

305
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,328
But you should find favor
if you treat her livestock well.

306
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:12,930
If you meet with any difficulties...

307
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,698
...don't go to Dollop...

308
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,501
...come to me.

309
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:38,916
What? Don't you fancy
a dance, then?

310
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,120
I'm mortal tired.

311
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:46,163
- When are you all going home?
- Soon enough, soon enough.

312
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,865
Well, my beauty.

313
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,166
What are you doing here
this time of night?

314
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,070
I'm waiting for the others, sir...

315
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,370
...not being acquainted
with the road home.

316
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,139
I only have a saddle horse.
Come to the inn with me.

317
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,976
I'll hire a trap for us both.

318
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:08,151
No, no. Thank you,
but I promised to wait for them.

319
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:13,520
Very well. Silly girl.
Please yourself.

320
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,745
What's that creeping
down your back?

321
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,880
Well, I declare!

322
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,022
It is treacle!

323
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:16,786
- You dare laugh at me, you hussy.
- I can't help it.

324
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,787
No more than the others.

325
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,622
You think you're the queen
of Trantridge...

326
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,524
...just because you're first favorite
with him.

327
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,827
She never said anything.
Leave her.

328
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:30,662
I'll show you. I'm worth two of your
sort for all your airs and graces.

329
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,566
If I'd known what sort you were...

330
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,969
...I'd never have lowered myself
by accepting your company.

331
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,339
- I'll show you.
- Hey there, workfolk.

332
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,542
What's all the row about?

333
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,549
Quickly, jump up beside me.

334
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:03,024
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

335
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:22,042
- Where are we?
- Passing through The Chase.

336
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,882
The Chase?

337
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,388
It is out of our way, surely.

338
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,427
This forest is one of the oldest
and loveliest in England, Tess.

339
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,621
Don't you think it deserves
to be seen...

340
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,198
...on a glorious God-given
night like this?

341
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:36,665
Yes, but....

342
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:39,464
No buts. There's a good girl.

343
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,670
I'll be honest with you.
I'm happy.

344
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:46,368
I'm trying to prolong the moment.

345
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,306
You were shivering a while back.

346
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:53,111
Now I can feel your warmth
against me.

347
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:57,347
- Are you still cold?
- No, not now.

348
00:35:58,057 --> 00:36:00,958
I'll let my animal
walk a little further.

349
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,560
He'll make better progress
once he's rested.

350
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:07,260
Tell me...

351
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:10,925
- ...what news of your parents' horse?
- They have no horse.

352
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:14,766
They have since Monday last.

353
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:17,602
- Did you...?
- Forgive me for mentioning it.

354
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:19,938
I thought they would have
written to you.

355
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,842
- I don't know what to say.
- It's nothing.

356
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:30,079
I knew how important it was
for your father to have a new horse.

357
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,917
Really.

358
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:34,025
It's you he should thank.

359
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,086
I'm grateful to you.

360
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,561
Truly I am.

361
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,057
But I almost wish
you hadn't done this.

362
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,264
Yes, I almost do.

363
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:49,374
- Is that a reproach?
- Oh, no.

364
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,340
It is very kind of you, I'm sure.

365
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:57,349
I've been in torment
ever since you came to us.

366
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:04,017
- Then I'll leave tomorrow, sir.
- That's absurd.

367
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,058
I don't want you to leave.

368
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,751
That's the last thing I want.

369
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,963
Is there no hope for me?

370
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,362
None at all?

371
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:19,566
Tess.

372
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,570
I'm dying for you.

373
00:37:22,775 --> 00:37:24,538
Can't you see?

374
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:44,925
Forgive me.

375
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,189
Oh, please forgive me.

376
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,564
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing. Nothing.

377
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:54,940
You're bleeding.

378
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,670
Oh, my God.

379
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:05,947
How ever could I have
done such a thing?

380
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,331
It's me.

381
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,472
Don't be so foolish.
Open the door.

382
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,611
You'll force me
to make a noise, Tess.

383
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:30,021
My mother has sharp ears.
She'll hear.

384
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:37,555
Enough of this nonsense, darling.
Open up.

385
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,186
Why sneak away...

386
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,159
...like a thief?

387
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,761
And at this hour in the morning?

388
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:18,568
Nobody would've prevented
you leaving.

389
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,937
At least let me drive you home.

390
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,642
Unless you'd care to come back.

391
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,751
I shan't come back.

392
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:06,875
- What are you crying for?
- I was only thinking...

393
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,519
...I was born over there.

394
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:13,953
Well, we all have
to be born somewhere.

395
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:17,391
I-- I wish I'd never been born.

396
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:23,126
- There or anywhere else.
- You're absurdly melancholy, Tess.

397
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:25,862
You can hold your own for beauty
against any woman.

398
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:27,471
Queen or commoner.

399
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:32,235
I tell you that as a practical man
who wishes you well.

400
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:36,142
If you're wise, you'll let the world
get a clearer sight of that beauty...

401
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:37,942
...before it fades.

402
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,752
Why not make the most of life?

403
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,320
We didn't fare so badly
together, did we?

404
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,358
- I was blinded for a while, that's all.
- That's what all women say.

405
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,061
How dare you talk like that?

406
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,427
Has it never struck you what all
women say, some women may feel?

407
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,535
- All right. I was wrong, I admit it.
- Please, please stop.

408
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:00,171
I should like to get down here.

409
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:12,574
I'm a bad lot, I suppose.
A damn bad lot.

410
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:17,347
I was born bad,
and I warrant I'll die bad.

411
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:20,592
Listen, Tess...

412
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,058
...if circumstances should arise,
do you understand?

413
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:27,960
If you're ever in the least trouble,
the least difficulty...

414
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,734
...just send me one line, and you shall
have whatever you need by return.

415
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,573
You really won't come back?

416
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,154
Goodbye, my four months' cousin.

417
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:53,689
Goodbye.

418
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:06,981
Tess?

419
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:00,311
It is no use her pretending
she hates it...

420
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:04,006
...and wishes it in the churchyard
and herself beside it.

421
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:05,843
She loves that child of hers.

422
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:10,148
Poor little mite.
It don't look long for this world.

423
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:40,916
Good evening, Durbeyfield.

424
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:44,317
- What's your business?
- My business?

425
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:48,850
The child. I must baptize it before
the Lord gathers it to his bosom.

426
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,585
What child are you speaking of?

427
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,162
All my children are baptized.
You ought to know.

428
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,732
Durbeyfield, don't play games
with the Almighty.

429
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,391
I don't play, sir, I work!

430
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,197
I work! Like a beast of the field.

431
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:03,170
You can tell the Almighty that
from me.

432
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,707
- My baby's dying.
- You ought to have been more careful.

433
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:10,871
Like it or not, Jack,
that child was born.

434
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,846
It is here, under your own roof.

435
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:15,009
- Not true.
- Father, come to your senses.

436
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:16,916
For pity's sake, let the vicar in!

437
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,114
He shan't set foot inside this house.

438
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,953
Not over my dead body!

439
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,526
There's enough disgrace
on my name as it is.

440
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:30,735
O merciful God, take pity.

441
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:33,132
Take pity on him.

442
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,998
Send down your anger on me.

443
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:38,734
But have mercy on my child.

444
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,941
My child.

445
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:07,132
I should like to ask you
something, sir.

446
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:10,331
Well, speak, girl. I'm listening.

447
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:19,678
Each of us shares
in your sad affliction, my child.

448
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,820
We're all members
of the suffering body of Christ.

449
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:24,853
My son was baptized.

450
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:28,117
Baptized? By whom?

451
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:31,160
By me, last night.

452
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:34,562
What procedure did you follow?

453
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:39,301
I woke my little brothers
and sisters...

454
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:41,939
...and made them
kneel down to pray.

455
00:50:43,008 --> 00:50:47,172
'Liza-Lu held the prayer book open.

456
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:48,869
I lit a candle.

457
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,947
And then?

458
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:57,412
Then I held my child like this
over the basin.

459
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:58,954
Yes.

460
00:50:59,124 --> 00:51:02,025
I poured some water on his forehead,
and I said:

461
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:04,791
"I baptize thee...

462
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:09,024
...in the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost."

463
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:15,335
- Did you make the sign of the cross?
- Yes, I did that too.

464
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:20,039
Will it be just the same
as if you'd baptized him?

465
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,877
In the sight of God, I mean.

466
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:25,676
Yes, my dear girl.
It will be the same.

467
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,880
Then you'll give him
a Christian burial?

468
00:51:29,855 --> 00:51:32,415
That's another matter.

469
00:51:32,591 --> 00:51:34,991
Another matter? Why?

470
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,391
Well, that would concern
the village as a whole.

471
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,498
Not just the two of us,
you understand.

472
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,228
Won't you do it, sir?

473
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,629
Just this once?

474
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:48,363
I'm sorry.

475
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,540
I beg you, please.

476
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,944
I told you.
It's out of the question.

477
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,543
Then I don't like you.

478
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,250
I shall never come
to your church again.

479
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:05,684
Never.

480
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,256
Never!

481
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,677
- Hey, Mr. Crick.
- Eh?

482
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:47,084
What, here already?
We didn't expect you afore tomorrow.

483
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,447
It is quite a step from here
to Weatherbury.

484
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:53,318
- Marlott, sir. I come from Marlott.
- Yes, Marlott.

485
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,550
Well, that's even further.

486
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,795
Quite sure you can stand it here?

487
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,056
It is comfortable enough
for rough folk...

488
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:03,530
...but we don't live
in a cowcumber frame.

489
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,930
I'm accustomed to that.

490
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:12,543
I used to know your part
of the county when I were a lad.

491
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,208
Good. Right you are.

492
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:16,779
Well, you'll want a rest
and a morsel of food.

493
00:55:16,948 --> 00:55:19,712
I'd rather begin now,
to get my hand in.

494
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:21,545
Oh, come on.
You must be famished.

495
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,349
No, thank you.
A little milk will suffice.

496
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:31,789
Well, if you can swallow that,
so be it.

497
00:55:34,232 --> 00:55:37,326
It is what I hain't touched for years.

498
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:43,900
It lies in my innards like lead.

499
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:57,219
To my thinking, the beasts
aren't giving all they should.

500
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,879
That's because there's
a new hand come amongst us.

501
00:56:00,058 --> 00:56:01,753
I've known it happen afore.

502
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:07,558
They do say that the milk goes up
into their horns at such times.

503
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:11,600
Anyone would think we were
back in the Middle Ages.

504
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:17,169
I don't appear to be making
much progress.

505
00:56:17,342 --> 00:56:20,277
Take it gentle, sir. Take it gentle.
Whoa, now.

506
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:25,940
- It is skill that does it, not strength.
- So my aching fingers tell me.

507
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:47,570
Mrs. Crick's too proud to come
milking with us, and that's a fact.

508
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:51,200
Still, there's little enough
to wherrit about.

509
00:56:51,376 --> 00:56:54,140
And we do eat like gamecocks.

510
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:57,010
No, you'll like it here.

511
00:56:57,182 --> 00:57:00,618
Mr. Crick, he's a very kindly man.

512
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:06,318
Just fancy. He has his own
family pew in church.

513
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:13,326
<i>Dairyman Dick all the week</i>
<i>On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick</i>

514
00:57:34,886 --> 00:57:37,286
Who's that playing?

515
00:57:37,856 --> 00:57:40,381
Mr. Clare.

516
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,658
Mr. Clare.

517
00:57:44,863 --> 00:57:47,696
Him that's learning to milk.

518
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:50,767
Angel Clare, he's called.

519
00:57:54,372 --> 00:57:56,602
Angel.

520
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,609
It is no common name.

521
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:06,374
He never says much to us,
more's the pity.

522
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:08,416
Why?

523
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,515
Does he scorn common folk?

524
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:17,992
Quite the opposite.
He often makes mock of old families.

525
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,059
It is quite simple.

526
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:27,126
He's a parson's son
with a mind to be a farmer.

527
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:32,934
He's already tried his hand
at sheep farming.

528
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:37,139
Now he's learning dairy work
with Mr. Crick.

529
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:44,552
But what does he hold against
old families?

530
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,791
He says they're...

531
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:55,464
...worm-eaten.

532
01:00:56,521 --> 01:00:59,012
That be your soul trying to escape.

533
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,091
It is bread, that's all.

534
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,457
No, it is when you sneeze,
you're like to blow your soul away.

535
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:11,864
As I see it, no soul can leave
its mortal shell afore a body dies.

536
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:15,164
What if a man falls down
in a faint, Master Crick?

537
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,398
Well, that's a different matter.

538
01:01:19,577 --> 01:01:24,810
The spirit bides there inside you,
but you cannot feel it.

539
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:30,384
But we can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies.

540
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:35,386
How's that, then, maidy?

541
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:39,420
Only have to lie
on the grass at night...

542
01:01:39,597 --> 01:01:43,033
...and look straight up
at some bright star.

543
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:48,062
And stare at it with all your might.

544
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,903
And by and by, you'll feel
you're falling into the sky...

545
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:56,205
...miles and miles from your body...

546
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,577
...which you'll don't seem
to need at all.

547
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:55,901
Tess!

548
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:59,106
Why run away like that?

549
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:06,214
- Are you afraid?
- No, sir. Not of outdoor things. No.

550
01:03:06,384 --> 01:03:10,081
- But you have your indoor fears, eh?
- Heavens, yes.

551
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:12,119
Of what?

552
01:03:13,658 --> 01:03:14,955
I couldn't rightly say.

553
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,594
Of the milk turning sour?

554
01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:19,161
No.

555
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,128
Fear of life, in general?

556
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,591
Yes, sir.

557
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:27,499
So have I. Very often.

558
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:30,732
Life's a puzzle. Don't you think?

559
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:33,843
Perhaps...

560
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,806
...now you put it that way.

561
01:03:50,595 --> 01:03:53,860
It is no use. It won't take.

562
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:59,668
If this continues, I shall have
to call on Conjurer Trendle.

563
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,930
I don't say I believe in him, mind.

564
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:05,166
But if nothing else works,
I shall have to try it, shan't I?

565
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:09,040
Somebody here's in love, I'll be bound.
That can cause it, so I've heard.

566
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:12,614
Conjurer Fall,
to the side of Casterbridge.

567
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:15,581
He had the knack of it
when I was a lad.

568
01:04:15,753 --> 01:04:19,052
It is a pity. He must be feeding
the worms by now.

569
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:23,751
My grandpa used to go to Conjurer
Mynterne out at Owlscombe.

570
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:25,987
But there's no folk
like him these days.

571
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,996
Somebody's in love, I tell you.

572
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:33,937
- What's the matter?
- The blasted butter won't come.

573
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:35,504
- Why is that?
- To my mind--

574
01:04:35,673 --> 01:04:39,006
How warm it is today.

575
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:43,177
I think I'd be better out-of-doors.

576
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:47,044
They do say it happens
when people are in love.

577
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:49,618
I remember as a girl....

578
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,935
Don't push.

579
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:24,153
He looks so sad.

580
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:29,419
Whatever can he be thinking of?

581
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:33,051
Well, not of us.
You can rely on that.

582
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:40,903
You're a fine one to talk, Izz.

583
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:44,633
- I saw you.
- What did you see?

584
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,168
It was the other day.

585
01:05:47,345 --> 01:05:50,610
I saw you kissing his shadow.

586
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:57,914
Here he comes again.

587
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:00,721
Dear eyes....

588
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,128
Dear face....

589
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,765
Dear Mr. Clare.

590
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:16,500
It is terrible to think he'll never wed
any one of us.

591
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:23,744
More likely, he'll ask us to milk
his cows for so much a year.

592
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:44,965
What are we going to do?

593
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:47,331
We shall have to take
the stone-bridge road.

594
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:49,166
We'll be late.

595
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:24,904
- Doesn't he go to church?
- No, never.

596
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:27,744
I wish he would.

597
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,941
You look like cats afraid of water.

598
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:36,951
Only on account
of our Sunday best, sir.

599
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,783
Very well. I'll carry you
just as you are.

600
01:07:39,957 --> 01:07:42,391
No, no, I'm far too heavy.

601
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,222
Nonsense. I could carry
all four of you at once.

602
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:47,887
Hold on to me. That's it.

603
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:05,340
I should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes.

604
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,746
There's nothing in that.

605
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:10,250
There's a time for everything
under heaven.

606
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,390
A time to kiss and a time to cuddle.

607
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,821
Shame on you, Izz.
That's scripture.

608
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:19,326
I always heed the prettiest
verses in church.

609
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:12,448
If you helped me, perhaps I could
climb along the bank.

610
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,011
Tess.

611
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:21,715
I've gone to three-quarters of this
trouble for your sake alone.

612
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:04,093
She's angry. She doesn't understand.
She'll kick over the bucket.

613
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:07,594
Forgive me, my darling Tess.
I don't know what came over me.

614
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,560
There's only one excuse for it.

615
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,067
I love you.

616
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,433
Yes, I love you.

617
01:11:38,162 --> 01:11:39,561
Angel?

618
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:40,992
Angel.

619
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:44,794
Hello, Mercy. Forgive me.
I didn't see you.

620
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,936
Forgive me.

621
01:11:47,104 --> 01:11:48,469
Welcome home.

622
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:50,436
- How are you?
- Very well.

623
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:53,667
God be praised. You look radiant
with health, I see.

624
01:11:53,844 --> 01:11:55,812
The open air, probably.

625
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,106
Have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers?

626
01:11:58,282 --> 01:12:00,546
Are they here? I had no idea.

627
01:12:00,718 --> 01:12:04,779
No, I'm only paying my parents a brief
visit to settle some urgent business.

628
01:12:04,955 --> 01:12:06,513
Then I won't detain you.

629
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:10,592
I have my Bible class
to take, in any case.

630
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,490
<i>Au revoir</i>, Angel.

631
01:12:35,152 --> 01:12:38,280
- Angel!
- Angel! My boy.

632
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:42,688
I apologize, Father. I had no time
to warn you of my arrival.

633
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,886
Perhaps you've forgotten how
to write. With a pen, remember?

634
01:12:46,063 --> 01:12:47,928
I brought you farmhouse delicacies.

635
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:50,965
Black puddings
and a bottle of mead.

636
01:12:51,135 --> 01:12:53,330
Black puddings?

637
01:12:53,971 --> 01:12:56,235
It's true your mother and I
have regretted...

638
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:58,431
...hearing so little of your news.

639
01:12:58,609 --> 01:13:00,167
You must bear with him, Father.

640
01:13:00,344 --> 01:13:02,642
Spending all his time
with sheep and cattle...

641
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:06,374
...takes one closer to nature
but further from Oxford.

642
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,211
I would remind you, Felix...

643
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:10,853
...that a university education
means nothing...

644
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:13,285
...unless it redounds
to the glory of God.

645
01:13:13,457 --> 01:13:15,755
It can also redound
to the glory of man.

646
01:13:15,926 --> 01:13:18,224
Only in the second place.

647
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,090
How far are you
in your apprenticeship?

648
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:22,858
It's drawing to a close.

649
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:29,029
What counts is spiritual cleanliness.
Isn't that so, Father?

650
01:13:29,206 --> 01:13:31,470
The two go together, my boy.

651
01:13:31,642 --> 01:13:34,133
Father tells us you intend
setting up on your own.

652
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:35,539
Yes.

653
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:38,112
- In what part of the world?
- I don't know yet.

654
01:13:38,282 --> 01:13:40,250
The colonies perhaps.

655
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,884
Heaven preserve us.

656
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:44,543
It would suit the type of
farming I have in mind.

657
01:13:45,055 --> 01:13:47,523
- What colony?
- The choice is wide.

658
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:49,556
Or I may settle in a foreign country.

659
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:53,287
Some places offer land to immigrants
on very favorable terms.

660
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:55,454
Brazil, for example.

661
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:58,328
Wonders will never cease.

662
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:02,563
Nothing's settled yet.
I came here to discuss it.

663
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,570
That among other things.

664
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:09,007
Shall we take a drop of good
Mrs. Crick's delicious mead?

665
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:13,479
Oh, forgive me, I forgot.

666
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,177
Strong drink is the root of all evil.

667
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,788
Take us into your confidence.

668
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:32,402
- Is it something serious?
- Not serious, but important.

669
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:35,302
The truth is...

670
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:38,805
...don't you think it's time
I considered marrying?

671
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:40,967
Yes, indeed, my boy. Yes, indeed.

672
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:43,578
Your mother and I have debated
the same question.

673
01:14:43,747 --> 01:14:46,443
Really? And what sort of wife
would you favor...

674
01:14:46,617 --> 01:14:50,553
- ...for a budding farmer like myself?
- A truly Christian, God-fearing woman.

675
01:14:50,721 --> 01:14:54,088
One who will be a help and
a comfort to you in all things.

676
01:14:54,258 --> 01:14:58,194
- The rest matters little.
- You mustn't hesitate, dear son.

677
01:14:58,362 --> 01:14:59,590
Not hesitate?

678
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:03,763
To marry your heart's desire:
Mercy Chant.

679
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:06,698
She may be rather
fond of overdecorating a church...

680
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:11,432
...with fripperies, flowers,
scraps of lace and so forth...

681
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:14,236
...but that's merely a girlish fancy.
It'll pass.

682
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:16,504
Mercy is a pure and virtuous girl.

683
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,945
Oh, yes. I know she's pure
and virtuous.

684
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:24,178
But honesty compels me to inform you
that I have other plans.

685
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:26,746
- Other plans?
- Very much so.

686
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:29,620
Mercy Chant appeals more to you
than she does to me.

687
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:33,320
I'm not disputing her merits.
I'm speaking of my own inclinations.

688
01:15:33,497 --> 01:15:34,828
My dearest boy!

689
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:38,229
Angel, please remember
you're addressing your parents.

690
01:15:38,341 --> 01:15:39,638
I'm aware of that.

691
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:43,845
I already know the woman
I intend to marry.

692
01:15:44,013 --> 01:15:47,176
Her name is Teresa Durbeyfield.

693
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:52,678
Father, Mother, I respect you both.

694
01:15:52,855 --> 01:15:55,483
I also respect Mercy Chant
and have no doubt...

695
01:15:55,658 --> 01:15:58,923
...she'll find a worthy husband
with or without your help.

696
01:15:59,095 --> 01:16:00,960
As for me...

697
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,825
...my mind's made up.

698
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:44,273
- It is you.
- Tess.

699
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,000
I want to ask you this now.

700
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,002
Will you be my wife?

701
01:16:51,547 --> 01:16:54,607
I love you with all my heart
and soul.

702
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,477
But what's the matter?

703
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:00,984
I....

704
01:17:01,891 --> 01:17:03,654
I cannot....

705
01:17:04,427 --> 01:17:06,657
I cannot be your wife.

706
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:10,891
- Don't you love me?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

707
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:15,299
I would rather belong to you
than to anyone in the world.

708
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:17,632
But forgive me.

709
01:17:20,276 --> 01:17:22,574
I cannot marry you.

710
01:17:55,378 --> 01:17:59,314
<i>It was the good Lord who put this</i>
<i>nice young parson's son your way.</i>

711
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,279
<i>You must believe that.</i>

712
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:03,680
<i>But with respect to your question...</i>

713
01:18:03,853 --> 01:18:07,118
<i>...I tell you quite private</i>
<i>but very strong...</i>

714
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:10,725
<i>...on no account say a word</i>
<i>about your bygone trouble.</i>

715
01:18:10,893 --> 01:18:15,523
<i>Never a word, my girl,</i>
<i>least of all to him.</i>

716
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:18,223
Mother, Mother....

717
01:18:22,938 --> 01:18:25,634
Tess, why does the idea
of becoming my wife...

718
01:18:25,808 --> 01:18:28,902
- ...displease you--?
- But I never said that.

719
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:31,974
It would please me so much.

720
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:37,079
- It is simply that I cannot.
- Why?

721
01:18:37,253 --> 01:18:39,483
Is there someone else?

722
01:18:42,224 --> 01:18:44,988
Don't I deserve to know the truth?

723
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:48,659
- Well?
- Not now.

724
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,731
- When, then?
- Later.

725
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,925
But why?

726
01:18:55,271 --> 01:18:58,206
I'll tell you when we get home.

727
01:18:58,374 --> 01:19:01,468
You may stop loving me
when you know.

728
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:04,444
Let me wait till then.

729
01:19:33,409 --> 01:19:36,674
Londoners will drink it at their
breakfasts tomorrow, won't they?

730
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:39,542
Yes, but watered down,
in case it goes to their heads.

731
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:42,946
Strangers we've never seen....

732
01:19:53,362 --> 01:19:55,830
You saw me once before,
you know that?

733
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:57,863
I did?

734
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:00,365
You wouldn't dance with me.

735
01:20:00,536 --> 01:20:04,233
- It was at Marlott.
- Of course.

736
01:20:04,907 --> 01:20:07,137
- That's incredible.
- You remember now?

737
01:20:07,309 --> 01:20:10,142
Tessy, Tessy....

738
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:16,241
- Now, my girl.
- Yes.

739
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:20,249
I may never again be brave
enough to tell you my story.

740
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:22,287
Then get on with your precious story.

741
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:25,518
I was born at such and such a place
in such and such a year--

742
01:20:25,694 --> 01:20:28,060
I was born at Marlott...

743
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,596
...and I grew up there.

744
01:20:30,766 --> 01:20:34,532
I was in the sixth form
when I left school.

745
01:20:34,703 --> 01:20:37,638
They said I would make
a good teacher.

746
01:20:39,842 --> 01:20:42,811
But there was trouble in my family.

747
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:47,380
Father was no great worker.

748
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:51,179
He drank, and I....

749
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:53,753
My parents, they....

750
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,750
It was then
that something happened.

751
01:20:58,494 --> 01:21:02,021
Something which
changed my life. I....

752
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:07,628
They....

753
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:12,598
They discovered that we were
not Durbeyfields...

754
01:21:12,775 --> 01:21:15,209
...but d'Urbervilles.

755
01:21:15,744 --> 01:21:18,338
Well, go on.

756
01:21:18,981 --> 01:21:21,245
Well, that's it.

757
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:23,112
What?

758
01:21:23,285 --> 01:21:26,721
Well, the d'Urbervilles
are an old family.

759
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:28,720
I know.

760
01:21:31,427 --> 01:21:33,520
On account of...

761
01:21:34,563 --> 01:21:38,329
...being of that name,
my mother thought that....

762
01:21:40,336 --> 01:21:42,566
We were sent....

763
01:21:46,675 --> 01:21:49,166
- I had a--
- A what?

764
01:21:50,145 --> 01:21:53,046
I was told you hated old families.

765
01:21:54,483 --> 01:21:55,950
And is that all the trouble?

766
01:21:57,419 --> 01:21:59,387
None of that matters, Tess.

767
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:01,887
Say you'll be my wife.

768
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:06,255
Say it, Tess. Say it, my dear love.

769
01:22:07,429 --> 01:22:10,057
Yes, yes, yes.

770
01:22:19,675 --> 01:22:21,199
<i>My youth...</i>

771
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:23,641
<i>...my simplicity...</i>

772
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:26,747
<i>...and the strangeness</i>
<i>of my situation...</i>

773
01:22:26,915 --> 01:22:29,816
<i>...may perhaps lessen my fault.</i>

774
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:36,252
<i>But since I committed it...</i>

775
01:22:36,425 --> 01:22:38,586
<i>...I am guilty.</i>

776
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:44,056
<i>I must be guilty...</i>

777
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:48,499
<i>...because the Lord saw fit</i>
<i>to take my child.</i>

778
01:22:50,205 --> 01:22:53,470
<i>If what I havejust written...</i>

779
01:22:53,642 --> 01:22:58,511
<i>...failed to pass my lips</i>
<i>in your presence...</i>

780
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:03,448
<i>...when I had repeated it</i>
<i>a thousand times in my heart...</i>

781
01:23:04,953 --> 01:23:08,252
<i>...it was for fear</i>
<i>of losing you forever.</i>

782
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,419
<i>For love ofyou...</i>

783
01:23:13,595 --> 01:23:18,760
<i>...I shall conquer that fear</i>
<i>and bring you this letter.</i>

784
01:23:20,703 --> 01:23:23,729
<i>Once you receive it, Angel...</i>

785
01:23:23,906 --> 01:23:28,206
<i>...you will hold the rest</i>
<i>of my life in your hands.</i>

786
01:23:29,144 --> 01:23:31,078
<i>I hope...</i>

787
01:23:31,246 --> 01:23:33,942
<i>...I tremble...</i>

788
01:23:34,116 --> 01:23:36,311
<i>...I love you.</i>

789
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:13,382
Tess.

790
01:24:15,357 --> 01:24:17,518
Darling.

791
01:24:26,168 --> 01:24:30,229
Happiness seems to put an edge
on my appetite.

792
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,265
I'm starving.

793
01:27:20,876 --> 01:27:23,106
Oh, look! They're coming!

794
01:27:23,278 --> 01:27:27,442
Faster, faster, Mrs. Crick!
They'll beat us to the church!

795
01:27:40,095 --> 01:27:41,426
Angel!

796
01:27:41,597 --> 01:27:43,758
Angel, please, I must speak to you.

797
01:27:43,932 --> 01:27:46,093
What's the matter?

798
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:49,931
I want to confess
all my past faults. All of it!

799
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:53,700
Later, sweetheart. Once we're married
we'll tell each other everything.

800
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:57,208
I have some failings
of my own to confess.

801
01:28:07,089 --> 01:28:09,489
I require and charge you both...

802
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:13,788
...as you will have to answer
at that dreadful Day of Judgment...

803
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:17,197
...where the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed.

804
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,295
That if either of you know
any impediment...

805
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:24,235
...why you may not be lawfully
joined in matrimony...

806
01:28:24,406 --> 01:28:26,738
...ye do now confess it.

807
01:28:31,413 --> 01:28:35,315
Wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife...

808
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:37,918
...to live together after God's
just ordinance...

809
01:28:38,086 --> 01:28:40,281
...in the holy estate of matrimony?

810
01:28:40,455 --> 01:28:43,151
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor and keep her...

811
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:46,419
...in sickness and in health
and forsaking all other...

812
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:51,157
...keep thee only unto her,
so long as ye both shall live?

813
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,732
I will.

814
01:29:09,985 --> 01:29:13,546
Welcome, sir. Welcome, ma'am.

815
01:29:13,722 --> 01:29:17,089
Mr. Plunkett told me to make
you at home.

816
01:29:17,259 --> 01:29:20,160
The rooms you rented
are on the first floor...

817
01:29:20,328 --> 01:29:22,853
...but Mr. Plunkett had to leave
for Manchester...

818
01:29:23,031 --> 01:29:26,523
...so you'll have the whole house
to yourselves.

819
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:31,435
You'll find it very comfortable here.
The house is inclined to be damp.

820
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,402
But I lit a good fire in the drawing
room early this afternoon.

821
01:29:36,578 --> 01:29:40,776
As for food, look,
I've prepared you a cold supper.

822
01:29:40,949 --> 01:29:44,680
And there's a nice bottle of wine
to go with it.

823
01:29:44,853 --> 01:29:46,684
Tomorrow, if you wish...

824
01:29:46,855 --> 01:29:53,055
...I'll bring you some of my husband's
excellent cider. He makes it himself.

825
01:29:54,796 --> 01:29:57,390
The usual offices.

826
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:03,237
Your bedroom.

827
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,843
A little surprise, ma'am.

828
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:15,972
I took the liberty. My son picked it
in the woods. It's a good bed.

829
01:30:16,151 --> 01:30:18,881
I think you'll find it to your liking.

830
01:30:19,054 --> 01:30:21,818
And now I'll leave you to yourselves.

831
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:24,049
Cheerio.

832
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:34,396
Which are my hands,
and which are yours?

833
01:30:35,103 --> 01:30:37,537
They're all yours.

834
01:31:05,867 --> 01:31:07,528
Open it.

835
01:31:08,036 --> 01:31:09,833
It's for you.

836
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,020
Family jewels.

837
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:30,986
- Are they for me?
- But of course.

838
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:34,820
Truly?

839
01:31:36,031 --> 01:31:37,794
Put them on.

840
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:39,957
Put them on now.

841
01:32:27,082 --> 01:32:30,051
My God, how beautiful you are.

842
01:32:31,653 --> 01:32:32,915
Come and see.

843
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:55,875
I have a confession to make,
my love.

844
01:32:58,847 --> 01:33:01,907
- You have something to confess?
- Why not?

845
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:04,779
You think far too highly of me.

846
01:33:04,953 --> 01:33:06,853
Listen.

847
01:33:07,022 --> 01:33:09,081
I want you to forgive me...

848
01:33:09,257 --> 01:33:12,852
...and not be angry with me
for failing to tell you earlier.

849
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:17,059
I said nothing for fear of losing you.

850
01:33:18,733 --> 01:33:21,099
I shall be brief, darling.

851
01:33:32,347 --> 01:33:34,542
Not long before we met...

852
01:33:34,716 --> 01:33:37,207
...I lived in London for a time.

853
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:39,376
There...

854
01:33:39,554 --> 01:33:42,921
...I met a woman older than myself.

855
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:47,123
Ours was a false relationship.

856
01:33:47,762 --> 01:33:49,753
A sad one.

857
01:33:50,265 --> 01:33:52,665
It was all over in a few weeks.

858
01:33:57,906 --> 01:34:00,067
That's all there is to tell.

859
01:34:01,943 --> 01:34:04,070
Do you forgive me?

860
01:34:04,279 --> 01:34:05,803
Angel....

861
01:34:09,918 --> 01:34:13,945
You're so utterly good and gentle.
I was mad to fear your resentment.

862
01:34:14,122 --> 01:34:17,182
I have a confession too, Angel.
Something of the same kind.

863
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,624
Tell me at table. We'll talk over
supper. I'm hungry, aren't you?

864
01:34:20,795 --> 01:34:22,558
I told you...

865
01:34:22,731 --> 01:34:25,131
...I have a confession like your own.

866
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,131
What confession?

867
01:34:29,037 --> 01:34:31,369
I shall be just as brief.

868
01:34:40,648 --> 01:34:42,707
His name is d'Urberville.

869
01:34:42,884 --> 01:34:44,408
Like mine.

870
01:34:45,587 --> 01:34:48,420
Alexander d'Urberville.

871
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:53,617
His family bought the title.

872
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:56,593
Their real name is Stoke.

873
01:35:01,336 --> 01:35:04,703
It was fate that drove me to work...

874
01:35:04,873 --> 01:35:09,833
...for false relations as a way
of helping my own folk to live.

875
01:35:12,213 --> 01:35:13,874
Alec....

876
01:35:14,849 --> 01:35:17,010
Alexander...

877
01:35:17,185 --> 01:35:19,653
...took advantage of me...

878
01:35:20,688 --> 01:35:24,249
...relying on his strength
and my fear.

879
01:35:27,062 --> 01:35:30,327
I became his mistress in despair.

880
01:35:30,498 --> 01:35:32,466
Without love.

881
01:35:34,769 --> 01:35:36,862
Like yours...

882
01:35:37,605 --> 01:35:41,166
...my sad union ended
after a few weeks.

883
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,771
I bore a child...

884
01:35:48,316 --> 01:35:50,944
...which died very young.

885
01:35:53,855 --> 01:35:57,450
My life was in ruins
till the day I met you.

886
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,730
I'm going out.

887
01:37:34,556 --> 01:37:36,285
You don't forgive me?

888
01:37:40,428 --> 01:37:44,023
- I forgive you, Angel.
- Yes, I know.

889
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:47,023
But you....

890
01:37:48,636 --> 01:37:50,331
You don't forgive me?

891
01:37:50,605 --> 01:37:53,631
You were one person.
Now you're another.

892
01:37:55,276 --> 01:37:57,335
Have mercy.

893
01:38:00,648 --> 01:38:02,206
- Angel?
- Have mercy.

894
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:04,943
Angel, what do you mean
by that laugh?

895
01:38:07,055 --> 01:38:10,047
How can you speak to me like this?
It frightens me.

896
01:38:10,825 --> 01:38:14,158
- How can you?
- You are not the woman I loved.

897
01:38:14,996 --> 01:38:18,727
- Well, who am I, then?
- Another woman in her shape.

898
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,231
He says....

899
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:27,169
He says I'm not the woman he loved...

900
01:38:27,342 --> 01:38:29,970
...but another woman in her shape.

901
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:37,240
Angel! Angel, please.
I was a child...

902
01:38:37,418 --> 01:38:40,319
...a child when it happened.
I knew nothing of men.

903
01:38:40,488 --> 01:38:43,355
You were sinned against.
That I grant you.

904
01:38:45,059 --> 01:38:48,392
- So you don't forgive me.
- I forgive you.

905
01:38:48,563 --> 01:38:50,827
But forgiveness isn't all.

906
01:38:51,766 --> 01:38:53,563
Nor love me?

907
01:38:54,035 --> 01:38:56,560
I cannot help associating
your lack of firmness...

908
01:38:56,738 --> 01:38:58,501
...with the decline of your family.

909
01:38:58,673 --> 01:39:02,575
Decrepit families imply deficient
willpower and decadent conduct.

910
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:04,803
I thought you were a child of nature.

911
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:08,745
But you were the last in a line
of degenerate aristocrats.

912
01:40:50,818 --> 01:40:52,786
Breakfast is ready.

913
01:41:35,263 --> 01:41:36,992
You can get rid of me.

914
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,066
What did you say?

915
01:41:43,037 --> 01:41:45,005
You can get rid of me.

916
01:41:46,941 --> 01:41:48,465
By divorcing me.

917
01:41:50,244 --> 01:41:51,506
Good God.

918
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:56,749
How can you be so simple?

919
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,712
You're too much of a child,
too immature.

920
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,949
Too ignorant, I suppose.

921
01:42:15,169 --> 01:42:16,898
Leave that!

922
01:42:17,238 --> 01:42:19,706
You're my wife, not my servant.

923
01:42:24,078 --> 01:42:25,511
I'm your wife...

924
01:42:27,215 --> 01:42:29,308
...but you don't want
to live with me.

925
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:34,448
You mean to go, don't you?

926
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:38,950
I couldn't stay
without despising myself.

927
01:42:40,161 --> 01:42:42,595
And what is worse,
without despising you.

928
01:42:45,299 --> 01:42:48,200
How can we live together
while that man exists?

929
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:51,366
He is your natural husband...

930
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,101
...not I.

931
01:43:04,452 --> 01:43:07,216
Can you honestly tell me to stay?

932
01:43:09,957 --> 01:43:11,254
No.

933
01:43:23,104 --> 01:43:26,562
But it's absolutely necessary
that one of us remain here...

934
01:43:27,008 --> 01:43:28,703
...to avoid a scandal.

935
01:43:31,512 --> 01:43:34,743
We must at least
keep up appearances.

936
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:38,142
Oh, yes, we must.

937
01:43:41,522 --> 01:43:43,513
But what will you do?

938
01:43:46,994 --> 01:43:50,555
- I can go home.
- Are you sure?

939
01:43:53,334 --> 01:43:56,735
Yes. If you leave me,
I shall go home.

940
01:43:58,139 --> 01:43:59,936
Then so be it.

941
01:44:29,036 --> 01:44:31,732
- Cross-in-Hand, sir.
- Yes, I know.

942
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,037
Come.

943
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,654
Now, let's be clear about this.

944
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:51,087
There's no anger in our hearts,
even though something happened...

945
01:44:51,258 --> 01:44:53,988
...between us which I cannot
endure at present.

946
01:44:54,161 --> 01:44:57,619
I shall let you know where I go,
and if I think I can bear it...

947
01:44:57,798 --> 01:45:00,790
...if I'm capable of it,
I shall come to fetch you.

948
01:45:01,168 --> 01:45:02,829
I shall wait.

949
01:45:03,004 --> 01:45:06,132
Until then, you'd do better
not to try and join me.

950
01:45:07,541 --> 01:45:10,942
Until then, I must not join you.

951
01:45:11,612 --> 01:45:13,136
Just so.

952
01:45:16,484 --> 01:45:18,918
- May I write to you?
- Oh, yes.

953
01:45:19,086 --> 01:45:21,384
If you're ill or in need of anything.

954
01:46:00,661 --> 01:46:05,792
A very good day to you, Mr. Clare!
I've brought you some groceries.

955
01:46:05,966 --> 01:46:08,264
There's a chicken,
some sausages, some bacon.

956
01:46:08,436 --> 01:46:10,768
- Thank you so much.
- I've put in some butter...

957
01:46:10,938 --> 01:46:12,963
- ...some flour, eggs--
- That's too much.

958
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:15,870
Newlyweds are always hungry, sir.

959
01:46:16,043 --> 01:46:19,240
From tonight onwards,
I shall cook for you myself.

960
01:46:19,413 --> 01:46:22,576
The truth is, you see, for some time,
I shall be needing less.

961
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:25,514
Because, in fact, I shall be alone
for a day or two.

962
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:28,086
My wife has been obliged
to rejoin her parents.

963
01:46:28,255 --> 01:46:30,587
Mercy on us.
Is there an illness in the family?

964
01:46:30,758 --> 01:46:33,192
Nothing of that kind.
It was arranged beforehand.

965
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,727
So as far as my meals are concerned
during Mrs. Clare's absence...

966
01:46:36,897 --> 01:46:39,832
- ...I'll talk to you later.
- Shall I leave the basket?

967
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,491
Indeed, the basket will do for today.
Many thanks.

968
01:47:52,173 --> 01:47:54,937
I was passing on my way home, sir.

969
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:58,601
I only wanted to wish you well.
You and Mrs. Clare.

970
01:47:58,779 --> 01:48:02,613
She's not here. I'm on the point
of leaving myself, as you see.

971
01:48:02,783 --> 01:48:05,809
I'm leaving England.
I've made up my mind to go to Brazil.

972
01:48:05,986 --> 01:48:08,113
- Brazil?
- Yes.

973
01:48:09,123 --> 01:48:12,581
Well, then please tell Mrs. Clare
I hope the journey agrees with her.

974
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:16,491
She's not going at present. I'll go on
to get the measure of the place...

975
01:48:16,664 --> 01:48:18,564
...and see what life there is like.

976
01:48:31,979 --> 01:48:35,437
- How is Retty?
- Oh, as high-strung as ever.

977
01:48:36,817 --> 01:48:40,184
- And Marian?
- Marian's taken to drink, sir.

978
01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:44,450
- Really?
- Yes. Mr. Crick has got rid of her.

979
01:48:44,625 --> 01:48:48,061
And you, Izz, are you well?

980
01:48:49,597 --> 01:48:53,124
With you gone, sir, how could I be?

981
01:48:55,302 --> 01:48:58,135
There, it is said.

982
01:48:59,206 --> 01:49:00,935
Goodbye, sir.

983
01:49:04,879 --> 01:49:06,642
Goodbye, Izz.

984
01:49:25,766 --> 01:49:27,199
Izz!

985
01:49:48,022 --> 01:49:50,513
If I were to ask you
to come with me now...

986
01:49:51,492 --> 01:49:53,357
...come to Brazil with me...

987
01:49:53,727 --> 01:49:55,388
...would your answer be yes?

988
01:49:56,964 --> 01:50:00,900
To come with you, I should
leave everything this minute.

989
01:50:01,068 --> 01:50:03,662
You know what it would mean
in the eyes of society?

990
01:50:03,837 --> 01:50:05,327
I wouldn't care.

991
01:50:05,506 --> 01:50:07,030
Do you love me so much?

992
01:50:07,207 --> 01:50:10,199
I've-- I've always loved you.

993
01:50:10,377 --> 01:50:12,140
More than Tess?

994
01:50:17,985 --> 01:50:19,316
No.

995
01:50:20,554 --> 01:50:22,749
Not more than her.

996
01:50:24,525 --> 01:50:27,358
Nobody could have loved you
more than Tess.

997
01:50:29,163 --> 01:50:31,529
She'd have given her life for you.

998
01:50:32,566 --> 01:50:34,591
I could do no more.

999
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:36,239
All is vanity.

1000
01:54:14,353 --> 01:54:17,516
- Good night, my pretty.
- Night, sir.

1001
01:54:18,491 --> 01:54:22,188
It is late for a maid to be
roaming the lanes by herself.

1002
01:54:23,996 --> 01:54:26,226
Have you lost your way, then?

1003
01:54:27,633 --> 01:54:31,626
Step up here beside me,
and I'll take you part of the road.

1004
01:54:33,105 --> 01:54:37,201
Why, you can scarce put
one foot afore the other.

1005
01:54:37,843 --> 01:54:40,243
Ride with me, I say.

1006
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:47,642
But I know you.

1007
01:54:47,987 --> 01:54:52,219
You be Mr. Stoke d'Urberville's
fancy woman!

1008
01:54:52,892 --> 01:54:57,226
You weren't too proud
to cock a leg for him, eh?

1009
01:54:59,798 --> 01:55:02,028
Trollop!

1010
01:55:18,784 --> 01:55:21,651
If it isn't my little Tess!

1011
01:55:28,794 --> 01:55:32,230
Poor poppet, what a state you're in.

1012
01:55:33,632 --> 01:55:36,066
You're so cold.

1013
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:42,864
Here.

1014
01:55:43,042 --> 01:55:47,035
Get that inside you.
It will warm your bones.

1015
01:55:48,981 --> 01:55:51,449
Go on, my love, drink it.

1016
01:56:01,026 --> 01:56:02,960
Get along.

1017
01:56:03,762 --> 01:56:08,256
You mustn't let yourself go.
Even bad luck runs out in the end.

1018
01:56:08,434 --> 01:56:10,265
Take my word for it.

1019
01:56:10,436 --> 01:56:12,427
I can't go on.

1020
01:56:12,605 --> 01:56:14,971
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1021
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:17,836
Oh, no, I can't go on.

1022
01:56:18,444 --> 01:56:19,968
I'd like....

1023
01:56:23,282 --> 01:56:26,046
If I had the courage, I'd like to die.

1024
01:56:26,218 --> 01:56:29,312
Don't talk such flummery.

1025
01:56:29,488 --> 01:56:32,582
Why didn't you come
to see me sooner?

1026
01:56:32,758 --> 01:56:34,692
I'm going to take you in hand,
my girl.

1027
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:38,421
- Do they still have work here?
- In this wretched place?

1028
01:56:38,998 --> 01:56:42,627
There's always work here
for them as can abide it.

1029
01:56:52,311 --> 01:56:56,247
Come. You have some
of my nice soup.

1030
01:57:01,053 --> 01:57:03,044
After that...

1031
01:57:03,756 --> 01:57:09,251
...you must take off those slummocky
clothes and prettify yourself...

1032
01:57:17,269 --> 01:57:20,033
...just to make me jealous again.

1033
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:24,702
My little Tessy.

1034
01:58:46,225 --> 01:58:48,056
Are you the new hand?

1035
01:58:58,337 --> 01:59:00,430
It is you, is it?

1036
01:59:03,108 --> 01:59:05,167
Be they all you've done?

1037
01:59:05,344 --> 01:59:07,005
It is a mighty poor show.

1038
01:59:07,579 --> 01:59:10,810
- She's not accustomed to it.
- I don't keep useless hands here.

1039
01:59:10,983 --> 01:59:14,214
We're only paid for what we do,
so where's the difference?

1040
01:59:14,386 --> 01:59:17,116
No arguments.
I want the whole lot cleared.

1041
01:59:17,289 --> 01:59:18,813
I'll stay late.

1042
01:59:19,491 --> 01:59:21,254
You'd better.

1043
01:59:29,434 --> 01:59:31,561
Never you mind that Groby.

1044
01:59:32,337 --> 01:59:35,738
It is just his way.
No, Lord love us.

1045
01:59:35,908 --> 01:59:37,671
It is not like it was at the dairy.

1046
01:59:38,277 --> 01:59:40,768
<i>Dairyman Dick all the week</i>

1047
01:59:40,946 --> 01:59:43,938
<i>On Sundays, Mr. Richard Crick</i>

1048
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:48,236
It don't do to pray here, missy.

1049
02:00:51,483 --> 02:00:54,418
There be a curse on this place.

1050
02:00:55,854 --> 02:01:00,257
- This is the Cross-in-Hand, isn't it?
- So it is.

1051
02:01:00,559 --> 02:01:05,394
On account of a malefactor
they tortured here in ancient times.

1052
02:01:05,564 --> 02:01:09,261
They did nail his hand to a post,
and then they hanged him.

1053
02:01:10,535 --> 02:01:14,665
The sinner's bones be down
there to this day, I'm told.

1054
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:39,116
Oh, my dear. What do you think
of these kind people?

1055
02:03:39,284 --> 02:03:42,048
Tuesday. Delighted.

1056
02:03:59,838 --> 02:04:02,636
- Goodbye.
- Till evening.

1057
02:04:03,341 --> 02:04:04,603
What?

1058
02:04:05,777 --> 02:04:07,608
What are you finding?

1059
02:04:07,779 --> 02:04:09,713
An old pair of boots.

1060
02:04:09,881 --> 02:04:11,678
Are there two of them?

1061
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:14,410
- Yes.
- Well, how extraordinary.

1062
02:04:16,054 --> 02:04:17,919
Still in good condition.

1063
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:21,116
It's wicked to throw away
a good pair of boots like that.

1064
02:04:21,293 --> 02:04:22,954
They could be of use to the poor.

1065
02:04:23,128 --> 02:04:26,291
- You must take them home with you.
- I will.

1066
02:04:26,465 --> 02:04:29,229
- They're a little muddy.
- Yes.

1067
02:05:19,885 --> 02:05:21,352
Sir.

1068
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,852
Over there. Mr. Groby.

1069
02:06:14,472 --> 02:06:17,566
I knew nothing
of your circumstances.

1070
02:06:17,742 --> 02:06:19,903
Nothing at all
until your mother wrote me.

1071
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:21,375
- My mother?
- She wrote...

1072
02:06:21,546 --> 02:06:25,243
...what you should have told me
a long time ago.

1073
02:06:26,017 --> 02:06:28,042
I came at once.

1074
02:06:29,955 --> 02:06:31,445
Tess.

1075
02:06:39,464 --> 02:06:41,557
Why did you never say anything?

1076
02:06:41,733 --> 02:06:43,792
I had nothing to ask of you.

1077
02:06:44,436 --> 02:06:46,461
That isn't so.

1078
02:06:47,072 --> 02:06:51,236
You wear your ridiculous pride
like a hair shirt.

1079
02:06:51,543 --> 02:06:54,706
And you've put me even more
in the wrong than I was.

1080
02:06:54,879 --> 02:06:56,847
Against my will.

1081
02:06:58,183 --> 02:07:00,845
I'd have done my duty by the child.

1082
02:07:01,353 --> 02:07:03,548
On my honor, I would.

1083
02:07:03,722 --> 02:07:05,417
Honor.

1084
02:07:06,591 --> 02:07:09,116
I want to take you away
from this wretched place.

1085
02:07:09,294 --> 02:07:11,285
It's unworthy of you.

1086
02:07:11,463 --> 02:07:16,628
What is this strange temptation
misery holds for you?

1087
02:07:17,269 --> 02:07:19,464
Come to your senses.

1088
02:07:19,638 --> 02:07:21,469
Come away with me.

1089
02:07:26,444 --> 02:07:28,844
Your father's ill.
Did you know?

1090
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:30,672
Yes.

1091
02:07:30,915 --> 02:07:32,849
They fear the worst.

1092
02:07:33,285 --> 02:07:37,654
Your family will be evicted if he dies.
They're quite as destitute as you.

1093
02:07:39,557 --> 02:07:42,856
I'm offering you my help, sincerely.

1094
02:07:43,895 --> 02:07:46,420
No one else seems to care.

1095
02:07:46,898 --> 02:07:50,265
Who is this husband
of yours anyway?

1096
02:07:50,502 --> 02:07:54,336
- How could he abandon you like this?
- Please leave me alone!

1097
02:07:54,506 --> 02:07:56,030
Tess!

1098
02:10:24,589 --> 02:10:29,117
There's a point beyond which
obstinacy becomes stupidity.

1099
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:34,298
Are you in love with this drudgery?

1100
02:10:37,302 --> 02:10:40,635
I may be a sham d'Urberville,
but my finger can do more for you...

1101
02:10:40,805 --> 02:10:43,706
...than all your blue-blooded
ancestors.

1102
02:10:47,178 --> 02:10:48,907
I'm right.

1103
02:10:50,014 --> 02:10:51,777
You know I am.

1104
02:10:56,754 --> 02:10:59,518
Forget about all this.

1105
02:10:59,691 --> 02:11:02,819
And forget about that mule
you call your husband.

1106
02:11:06,931 --> 02:11:09,399
Go on, hit me.

1107
02:11:09,667 --> 02:11:11,828
I shall not cry out.

1108
02:11:12,537 --> 02:11:15,005
Once victim, always victim.

1109
02:11:15,373 --> 02:11:16,635
That's the law.

1110
02:11:16,808 --> 02:11:19,072
I was your master once.

1111
02:11:20,712 --> 02:11:23,010
I shall be so again.

1112
02:11:24,215 --> 02:11:26,445
If you're any man's wife...

1113
02:11:26,851 --> 02:11:28,944
...you're mine.

1114
02:11:29,654 --> 02:11:31,189
<i>My own dear husband...</i>

1115
02:11:31,189 --> 02:11:32,383
<i>My own dear husband...</i>

1116
02:11:32,624 --> 02:11:36,355
<i>...I shall die soon unless</i>
<i>I get word from you.</i>

1117
02:11:36,594 --> 02:11:40,121
<i>All my letters have</i>
<i>remained unanswered.</i>

1118
02:11:41,766 --> 02:11:44,564
<i>Have you even received them?</i>

1119
02:11:45,336 --> 02:11:47,804
<i>I long for one thing only...</i>

1120
02:11:47,972 --> 02:11:50,805
<i>...and that is to see you again.</i>

1121
02:11:50,975 --> 02:11:53,535
<i>Come back to me, Angel.</i>

1122
02:11:53,711 --> 02:11:58,171
<i>Come back and save me from</i>
<i>the thing that threatens me.</i>

1123
02:12:33,217 --> 02:12:37,517
Any reasonable person would
call this a ludicrous situation.

1124
02:12:38,556 --> 02:12:40,615
I offer to help you...

1125
02:12:40,792 --> 02:12:43,317
...you and all your family.

1126
02:12:43,494 --> 02:12:45,086
But no.

1127
02:12:45,263 --> 02:12:47,788
You prefer to turn
yourselves into gypsies.

1128
02:12:47,966 --> 02:12:49,194
Please go away.

1129
02:12:49,367 --> 02:12:51,335
In other words, Mrs. Clare...

1130
02:12:51,502 --> 02:12:54,096
...you're asking me
to let you starve in peace?

1131
02:12:54,272 --> 02:12:56,604
Go away!

1132
02:12:56,841 --> 02:12:59,241
You'll be civil yet.

1133
02:13:06,551 --> 02:13:10,180
What's to become of me
and my poor little mites?

1134
02:13:10,355 --> 02:13:14,052
We be the Durbeyfield family.
It is written there, isn't it?

1135
02:13:14,225 --> 02:13:17,126
Oh, it is written plain enough,
I grant you...

1136
02:13:17,295 --> 02:13:19,354
...but the rooms have been taken.

1137
02:13:19,530 --> 02:13:22,090
You never sent the deposit.

1138
02:13:22,266 --> 02:13:25,326
He means the money to be
paid on account, Mother.

1139
02:13:25,503 --> 02:13:28,301
There's more in life than money, sir.

1140
02:13:28,473 --> 02:13:31,408
You cannot leave these fatherless
children in the street.

1141
02:13:31,576 --> 02:13:33,441
- It would be a crime!
- Missus.

1142
02:13:33,611 --> 02:13:36,239
Hospitality's sacred,
even among the pagan Turks!

1143
02:13:36,414 --> 02:13:38,507
Please, missus, it is your own fault.

1144
02:13:38,683 --> 02:13:40,207
We'll see about that.

1145
02:13:40,385 --> 02:13:43,115
We're true descendants
of the knightly d'Urbervilles.

1146
02:13:43,287 --> 02:13:45,881
Nobody leaves us in the streets
like horse apples...

1147
02:13:46,057 --> 02:13:47,888
...not in the home of our ancestors.

1148
02:13:48,059 --> 02:13:51,085
Our bones are in the crypt there,
laid out in their coffins!

1149
02:13:51,262 --> 02:13:54,993
- Mother, I beg you. Don't take on so.
- No, my girl. What's true is true.

1150
02:13:55,166 --> 02:13:59,102
Your poor father's eyes are on us.
We mustn't shame him.

1151
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:03,263
The Lord will protect his own,
and the wicked shall be punished.

1152
02:14:03,441 --> 02:14:05,170
Bain't you stopping here, then?

1153
02:14:05,343 --> 02:14:07,607
No, my good man, we're going on.

1154
02:14:07,779 --> 02:14:11,681
Good man? My beasts are spent.
I ought to be getting back to Marlott.

1155
02:14:28,566 --> 02:14:31,160
No, wait! Wait!

1156
02:14:31,602 --> 02:14:33,570
Now, unload it all.

1157
02:14:33,738 --> 02:14:35,672
- Where?
- Here.

1158
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,467
- Here?
- Yes, here.

1159
02:14:37,642 --> 02:14:39,701
We shall camp beside our church...

1160
02:14:39,877 --> 02:14:42,846
...until the town of our ancestors
finds us shelter.

1161
02:14:43,014 --> 02:14:46,643
Now, come on, children.
Set to work.

1162
02:16:31,923 --> 02:16:35,290
Why am I on the wrong
side of this door?

1163
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:53,127
- Who's there?
- It's me, Father. Angel.

1164
02:18:04,982 --> 02:18:07,951
My boy. My poor boy.

1165
02:18:08,119 --> 02:18:11,350
I've been ill,
but I'm quite all right now.

1166
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:32,405
<i>Why have you treated me</i>
<i>so monstrously, Angel?</i>

1167
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:34,942
<i>I do not deserve it.</i>

1168
02:18:35,413 --> 02:18:38,382
<i>I have thought it over carefully...</i>

1169
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:42,041
<i>...and I can never, never forgive you.</i>

1170
02:18:42,586 --> 02:18:46,955
<i>You are cruel.</i>
<i>I shall try to forget you.</i>

1171
02:18:47,558 --> 02:18:52,052
<i>All I have received at</i>
<i>your hands is injustice.</i>

1172
02:20:17,681 --> 02:20:20,206
Mr. Durbeyfield.

1173
02:20:21,952 --> 02:20:23,476
Beg pardon?

1174
02:20:23,654 --> 02:20:25,918
You are Mr. Durbeyfield?

1175
02:20:27,324 --> 02:20:28,848
They don't live here no more.

1176
02:20:29,026 --> 02:20:30,755
Since when?

1177
02:20:30,928 --> 02:20:33,692
Since John Durbeyfield died.

1178
02:20:33,864 --> 02:20:35,957
Do you know where they went?

1179
02:20:48,979 --> 02:20:52,676
"John Durbeyfield, 1832 to 1888.

1180
02:20:52,850 --> 02:20:54,841
More properly d'Urberville...

1181
02:20:55,019 --> 02:20:58,011
...of the once powerful
family of that name...

1182
02:20:58,189 --> 02:21:00,521
...and descended through
an illustrious line...

1183
02:21:00,691 --> 02:21:04,183
...from Sir Pagan d'Urberville,
one of the knights of the Conqueror.

1184
02:21:04,361 --> 02:21:06,795
How are the mighty fallen."

1185
02:21:07,331 --> 02:21:09,731
Oh, yes. How indeed.

1186
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:13,097
May I? For the poor.

1187
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:17,104
I prefer to settle
the mason's account.

1188
02:21:17,274 --> 02:21:20,539
He has never been paid
for his work.

1189
02:21:22,012 --> 02:21:24,003
They were an odd family.

1190
02:21:24,181 --> 02:21:27,708
Mr. Tringham would have done
better to keep his mouth shut.

1191
02:22:03,821 --> 02:22:06,449
I should like to see Mrs. Clare.

1192
02:22:07,324 --> 02:22:09,053
Mrs. Clare.

1193
02:22:09,226 --> 02:22:10,887
Tess.

1194
02:22:11,295 --> 02:22:14,856
Yes, I know. She's not here.

1195
02:22:15,232 --> 02:22:17,564
You are Mrs. Durbeyfield?

1196
02:22:17,902 --> 02:22:19,529
Yes.

1197
02:22:19,837 --> 02:22:21,702
Where is she living?

1198
02:22:21,972 --> 02:22:23,872
I don't know.

1199
02:22:24,675 --> 02:22:26,472
I'm her husband.

1200
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:29,243
I guessed as much.

1201
02:22:29,613 --> 02:22:31,808
Then tell me where she is.

1202
02:22:31,982 --> 02:22:33,574
Please tell me.

1203
02:22:33,751 --> 02:22:37,482
Leave her. Leave her in peace.

1204
02:22:37,755 --> 02:22:40,383
My poor girl has suffered enough.

1205
02:22:41,192 --> 02:22:45,526
She don't care
to see you, sir. Never.

1206
02:23:00,844 --> 02:23:02,835
Mrs. Durbeyfield...

1207
02:23:03,013 --> 02:23:05,345
...take pity on a lonely, wretched man.

1208
02:23:05,516 --> 02:23:08,144
Tell me where to find her.

1209
02:23:08,752 --> 02:23:10,549
I beg you.

1210
02:23:11,488 --> 02:23:14,719
- She's at Sandbourne.
- Sandbourne?

1211
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:18,028
But where? It's a large town
these days.

1212
02:23:18,195 --> 02:23:20,925
That's all I know. Sandbourne.

1213
02:23:49,893 --> 02:23:52,054
Excuse me.

1214
02:23:52,229 --> 02:23:54,390
I'm looking for a Mrs. Clare.

1215
02:23:54,565 --> 02:23:57,500
Would you by any chance
know her address?

1216
02:23:58,769 --> 02:24:02,830
No. Hey, George.
You got a Clare on your round?

1217
02:24:03,007 --> 02:24:05,066
Clare?

1218
02:24:05,242 --> 02:24:07,608
No. We get a lot
of visitors here, you know.

1219
02:24:07,778 --> 02:24:09,769
Or a Durbeyfield. Miss Durbeyfield.

1220
02:24:09,947 --> 02:24:12,814
- D'Urberville at The Herons.
- That's it, d'Urberville!

1221
02:24:12,983 --> 02:24:16,384
- Is a boarding house, sir. Can't miss it.
- Whereabouts?

1222
02:25:12,543 --> 02:25:13,771
Yes?

1223
02:25:13,944 --> 02:25:16,469
Please excuse me
for calling at this hour...

1224
02:25:16,647 --> 02:25:19,844
...but do you have a Teresa
d'Urberville staying with you?

1225
02:25:20,017 --> 02:25:23,748
- Mrs. d'Urberville, you mean?
- Yes.

1226
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:26,014
Please come in.

1227
02:25:30,361 --> 02:25:33,228
Would you tell her that a relative
is anxious to see her?

1228
02:25:33,397 --> 02:25:35,627
It's rather early.
What name shall I give?

1229
02:25:35,799 --> 02:25:37,733
- Angel.
- Mr. Angel?

1230
02:25:37,901 --> 02:25:42,099
No, Angel. It's my Christian name.
She'll understand.

1231
02:25:47,845 --> 02:25:50,575
I'll just go and see if she's awake.

1232
02:26:53,243 --> 02:26:55,108
Tess.

1233
02:26:55,279 --> 02:26:58,043
I came to ask your forgiveness.

1234
02:27:01,518 --> 02:27:03,748
It's too late.

1235
02:27:04,154 --> 02:27:06,054
Too late?

1236
02:27:06,223 --> 02:27:08,657
My darling wife...

1237
02:27:08,826 --> 02:27:10,987
- ...I've come to fetch you.
- Don't.

1238
02:27:11,462 --> 02:27:14,727
Don't come near me, Angel, please.

1239
02:27:16,433 --> 02:27:18,560
Too late.

1240
02:27:18,869 --> 02:27:20,666
Too late.

1241
02:27:20,838 --> 02:27:23,306
I'm not the man I was.

1242
02:27:24,508 --> 02:27:26,772
I've suffered too.

1243
02:27:27,811 --> 02:27:30,371
I humbly beg you to forgive me.

1244
02:27:32,149 --> 02:27:34,276
Yes.

1245
02:27:34,485 --> 02:27:36,953
Oh, yes, yes.

1246
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:40,112
But I tell you, it's too late.

1247
02:27:43,627 --> 02:27:47,290
Don't you know it all? Don't you--?

1248
02:27:48,932 --> 02:27:52,732
- How did you find your way here?
- I had to--

1249
02:27:53,637 --> 02:27:55,571
I saw your mother.

1250
02:27:59,276 --> 02:28:01,574
I waited and waited for you...

1251
02:28:01,745 --> 02:28:04,077
...but you didn't come.

1252
02:28:04,781 --> 02:28:07,944
I wrote to you, and you didn't come.

1253
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:15,758
He has been good to me,
to all of us.

1254
02:28:18,829 --> 02:28:21,127
He has won me back to him.

1255
02:28:21,298 --> 02:28:23,789
He's upstairs.

1256
02:28:27,337 --> 02:28:28,895
Go now, Angel.

1257
02:28:29,573 --> 02:28:31,905
Go, please.

1258
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:36,536
And never come back anymore.

1259
02:30:05,335 --> 02:30:07,769
Good morning, my dear.

1260
02:30:21,685 --> 02:30:24,176
Well, what's the matter now?

1261
02:30:28,091 --> 02:30:30,457
Are you feeling unwell?

1262
02:30:30,794 --> 02:30:33,388
Is that why you have the vapors?

1263
02:30:34,665 --> 02:30:36,690
Yes?

1264
02:30:38,168 --> 02:30:39,897
No?

1265
02:30:42,339 --> 02:30:44,398
Yes, I know.

1266
02:30:44,574 --> 02:30:47,065
We're moping as usual.

1267
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:52,539
For God's sake.

1268
02:30:53,483 --> 02:30:55,644
Try and make an effort.

1269
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:05,485
Did you have a bad dream?

1270
02:31:11,134 --> 02:31:13,967
Brazil, perhaps?

1271
02:31:31,054 --> 02:31:35,388
These morning hysterics
of yours are in poor taste.

1272
02:31:38,462 --> 02:31:41,056
Don't forget we're lunching
with the Bennetts.

1273
02:31:41,231 --> 02:31:43,791
I'd like you to look presentable.

1274
02:31:45,902 --> 02:31:48,871
A genuine d'Urberville.

1275
02:33:59,069 --> 02:34:02,630
I came to tell you that I've killed him.

1276
02:34:09,646 --> 02:34:11,671
I've done it.

1277
02:34:12,616 --> 02:34:14,777
I don't know how.

1278
02:34:17,921 --> 02:34:19,786
I don't know.

1279
02:34:19,956 --> 02:34:23,448
That-- That time I hit him
with my glove.

1280
02:34:24,895 --> 02:34:27,591
The blood in his mouth.

1281
02:34:28,398 --> 02:34:31,162
I thought I might be capable of....

1282
02:34:33,003 --> 02:34:35,198
Yes.

1283
02:34:35,972 --> 02:34:38,873
Yes, it was from that day on.

1284
02:34:39,042 --> 02:34:41,340
What do you mean?

1285
02:34:42,012 --> 02:34:43,809
I mean I've killed him.

1286
02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:56,187
I won't desert you.

1287
02:34:56,926 --> 02:35:00,123
I shall protect you by every
means in my power.

1288
02:35:00,296 --> 02:35:02,787
Whatever you may or may
not have done, I love you.

1289
02:35:03,866 --> 02:35:05,800
I love you.

1290
02:35:06,536 --> 02:35:08,231
Will they hang me?

1291
02:35:18,247 --> 02:35:22,411
We must get out at the next
station and head north on foot.

1292
02:35:22,585 --> 02:35:25,884
They'll be looking for us
in the Wessex ports.

1293
02:35:26,055 --> 02:35:29,354
Once we reach the north,
we'll go abroad.

1294
02:36:21,244 --> 02:36:23,576
I have the makings of a meal here.

1295
02:36:23,746 --> 02:36:25,873
Even a bottle of wine.

1296
02:39:25,728 --> 02:39:28,060
Rest at last.

1297
02:43:30,627 --> 02:43:32,861
We must leave at once.

1298
02:43:37,168 --> 02:43:41,932
We must leave here as soon as possible.

1299
02:43:42,988 --> 02:43:46,721
My life couldn't be a matter of weeks?

1300
02:43:48,583 --> 02:43:50,009
Why not wait for them here?

1301
02:43:51,117 --> 02:43:52,880
Since they'll catch me in any case.

1302
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:55,558
I'm going to save you.

1303
02:43:56,058 --> 02:43:57,120
Do you hear?

1304
02:43:57,303 --> 02:43:58,768
I'm going to save you.

1305
02:45:21,185 --> 02:45:23,045
Can't we rest here?

1306
02:45:24,046 --> 02:45:29,005
I'm afraid not. By day this place
is visible from miles around.

1307
02:45:31,213 --> 02:45:33,608
There are no stars tonight.

1308
02:45:38,237 --> 02:45:42,004
Perhaps we could have made
our souls take flight together.

1309
02:45:51,179 --> 02:45:53,476
Do they sacrifice to god here?

1310
02:45:55,129 --> 02:45:58,997
No. To the sun I believe.
It's a Pagan temple.

1311
02:46:01,873 --> 02:46:04,067
Older than the ages.

1312
02:46:06,198 --> 02:46:08,665
Older than the D'Urbervilles.

1313
02:46:17,764 --> 02:46:20,396
Do you think
we shall meet again after death?

1314
02:46:28,291 --> 02:46:31,759
I'm afraid Angel. I'm afraid.

1315
02:47:43,003 --> 02:47:44,800
There's no use sir.

1316
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:48,442
The whole country's roused.

1317
02:48:03,538 --> 02:48:07,804
She's sleeping. Just a little longer.

1318
02:48:28,047 --> 02:48:29,571
Have they come for me?

1319
02:48:31,085 --> 02:48:32,677
Yes.

1320
02:48:47,395 --> 02:48:48,692
I'm ready.
