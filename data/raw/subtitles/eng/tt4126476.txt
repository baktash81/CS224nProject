that Darcy was not in love
with Elizabeth?

355
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:38,607
I think that it was the most
revolutionary feminist novel

356

that I'd ever read.

357
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:44,134
That a woman of that era
would have the strength
to reject Darcy

358

-when he treated her poorly--
-That's a load.

It was Darcy's very attitude
that attracted Elizabeth
to him.

361
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,494
Darcy's attitude
was rude and mocking.

362
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,973
I think he was lucky
to be with a woman

363
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,758
with as much integrity
as Elizabeth.

364
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,629
The only reason
he even asked her to marry him

365
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:03,676
-was she wouldn't stop
throwing herself--
-Throwing herself at him?

366
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:07,070
-He was pursuing her.
-She's clearly not satisfied
with her life

wherever she can get it.

368
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,466
Well, I think
that it's obviously
all in his head

369
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,729
that she had
any feelings for him at all.

370
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,950
