00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:07,650
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

3
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,484
Money, money, money!
Hey!

4
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,269
You got a date with justice, One-Eyed Bart.
- Too bad, Sheriff.

5
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,553
I'm a married man.

6
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:26,797
One-Eyed Betty!

7
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,693
I think you dropped something, mister.

8
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:47,098
Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart.
You've reached the end of the line.

9
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,287
I always wanted to go out with a bang.

10
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:01,632
Oh no!
- The orphans!

11
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:05,876
Hate to leave early, but our ride is here.

12
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,764
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

13
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,727
Ride like the wind, Bull's-eye!

14
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:28,219
Hold 'em steady.

15
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:34,117
Woody, hurry!

16
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,052
No ...

17
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:08,903
Glad I can catch the train.
- Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,916
To infinity and beyond.

19
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:31,028
Reach for the sky.
- You can't touch me, Sheriff.

20
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:34,618
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

21
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:46,297
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force fields dogs.

22
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,798
Evil Doctor Pork Chop.

23
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,805
That’s Mr. Evil Doctor Pork Chop to you.

24
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:57,787
Buzz, shoot your laser on my badge.
- Woody, no, I'll kill you.

25
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,139
Just do it.

26
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,928
You're going to jail, Bart. Ah, watch out!

27
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:11,663
Mom!
- No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I’m not here.

28
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,554
Oh, no, Molly!
- No, it's ok, Mom.

29
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,274
It's a 50 foot baby from outer space.

30
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:20,910
And she's on a rampage!
Run for your lives!

31
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:24,635
Does the red light mean it's going?

32
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,320
Come on say "Happy Birthday" to Molly.

33
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:31,058
Happy birthday.
- Oh. Charming.

34
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,694
Look how tall you're getting.

35
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,225
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

36
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,477
Good work, Buzz.

37
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:24,414
Ok places, everyone. Come on, come on.
Get in position.
- Wait, I can't find my other eye.

38
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:27,259
All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine, give it back.

39
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,883
You saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

40
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,289
Buzz, mind if I squeeze in next to you?

41
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,883
Yes. No.  I mean, why would I mind if
I squeeze .. squeeze in next to .. you?

42
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,315
Is it hot in here?
- Oh, here they come.

43
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:47,400
Sarge, you got it?
- Mission accomplished.
- Hooray!

44
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:50,780
Careful. Careful.

45
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,187
All right guys. We've got one shot at this.

46
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,851
Everybody ready?
- We're ready, Woody. Let's do it.

47
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,180
Ok Buzz, make the call.

48
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:17,802
Target is on approach.
- Just like we rehearsed it guys.

49
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,220
Hello. Hello.
Anyone there?

50
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:42,385
Molly, stay out of my room.
- I wasn't in your room.

51
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:47,204
Then who was messing with my stuff?
- It wasn't me.

52
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:58,283
Well, that went well.
- He held me! He actually held me!

53
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:05,194
Uh, this is just sad.
- Who we kidding? The kid's 17 years old.
- We ain't ever getting played with.

54
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:13,034
Guys, hey, hold up. We need a staff meeting.
Everyone, a staff meeting.

55
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,303
Oh, not again.
- Oh come on. Sling, gather everyone up.

56
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:19,423
Uh, we are together, Woody.

57
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:25,405
Ok. Uh, first off ... we all knew
"Operation Playtime" was a long shot.

58
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:30,261
More like a misfire.
- But we've always said this job
isn't about getting played with

59
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:32,891
it's about ...
- Being there for Andy.
We know.

60
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,256
But we can try again, right?

61
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:39,333
I'm calling it guys. We're closing up shop.
- What?

62
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,271
Andy's going to college anyday now.

63
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,475
That was our last shot.

64
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:48,028
We're going into attic mode folks.
Keep your accessories with you at all times.

65
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,337
Spare parts, batteries ...
Anything you need for an orderly transition.

66
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:55,110
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished. Over the hill.

67
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:57,963
Hey, hey, hey. Come on guys. We all
knew this day was coming.

68
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:02,943
Yeah, but now it's here.
- Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see ...

69
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:05,527
Hey Sarge! What are you doing?
- War's over folks.

70
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,635
Me and the boys are moving on.

71
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,952
Moving on?
- You're going AWOL?
- We've done our duty.

72
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,219
Andy is grown up.
- Let's face it ...

73
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,566
When the trash bags come out,
we army guys are the first to go.

74
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,131
Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

75
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:23,157
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck folks.

76
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,984
You're gonna need it.
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

77
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,012
We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

78
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:33,232
How do you know?
- We're being abandoned.

79
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,344
We'll be fine, Jessie.
- So why did Sarge leave?

80
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,919
Should we leave?
- I thought we were going to the attic?

81
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,811
Oh I hate all this uncertainty.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a minute. Quiet!

82
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:44,197
No one's getting thrown out, ok?

83
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:49,465
We're all still here. I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way ...

84
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,851
Wheezy and Etch and ...
- Bo Peep.

85
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,737
Yeah, even, even Bo.

86
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,557
All good toys who've gone
on to new owners.

87
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,227
But through every yard sale,
every spring cleaning ...

88
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,151
Andy held onto us.

89
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:08,387
He must care about us
or we wouldn't be here.

90
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:12,919
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm.

91
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,363
And we'll all be together.
- Exactly.

92
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,051
There's games up there and books and ...
- The racecar track.

93
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,223
The racecar track, thank you.
- And the old TV.

94
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:26,629
There you go, the old TV. And those
guys from the Christmas decorations.

95
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,200
Well, they're fun, right?

96
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:33,199
And some day, if we're lucky, Andy
may have kids of his own.

97
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,051
And he'll play with us then, right?

98
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:39,014
We'll always be there for him.
- Come on guys ...

99
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:42,824
Let's get our parts together, get ready
and go out on a high note.

100
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:46,841
I'd better find my other eye.
- Where'd you leave it this time?

101
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:50,666
Some place dark and dusty.

102
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,651
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

103
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:57,423
Don't worry, Andy's going to take
care of us. I guarantee it.

104
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,220
You guarantee it, huh?
- I don't know, Buzz.

105
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:29,556
What else could I say?

106
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,814
Well, whatever happens, at least
we'll all be together.

107
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,250
For infinity and beyond.

108
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:39,145
Can I have your stereo?
- No.
- Why not?

109
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,352
Can I have your computer?
- No.

110
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,658
Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

111
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:53,118
Ok Andy, let's get to work here.
Anything you're not taking to college ...

112
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,335
either goes to the attic, or it's trash.

113
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:58,392
Mom, I'm not leaving til Friday.
- Come on, it's garbage day.

114
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:02,209
Mom!
- Look, it's simple.
Skateboard: college.

115
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:04,422
Little League trophy: probably attic.

116
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,498
Apple core: trash.

117
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:09,894
You can do the rest.
- Why do you still have these toys?

118
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,477
Molly, out of my room!
- Three more days and it's mine.

119
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:18,356
Molly! You're not off the hook either.
You have more toys than
you know what to do with.

120
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:20,392
Some of them can make other
kids really happy.

121
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,965
What kids?
- The children at the daycare.

122
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:26,008
They're always asking for donations.
- What's daycare?
- Sh Sh Sh.

123
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:29,984
Mom!
- No buts. You choose the toys
you want to donate, I'll drop
them off at Sunnyside.

124
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,204
Poor Barbie.
- I get the Corvette.

125
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:47,108
Andy, come on. You need to start
making decisions.

126
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:49,883
Like what?
- Like, what are you going
to do with these toys?

127
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:53,579
Should we donate them to Sunnyside?
- No!
- Maybe sell them online?

128
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,824
Mom, no one's going to want those old toys.

129
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:59,403
They're junk.
- Fine. You have til Friday.

130
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,148
Anything that's not packed for
college or in the attic ...

131
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,496
is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

132
00:13:57,075 --> 00:14:00,542
What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot!
That's what's happening!

133
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,132
You need a hand?
- I got it.

134
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,353
Here. So you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

135
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,672
If I say "no", will I still get your room?

136
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:25,168
No.
- Then, yes, I'll miss you.

137
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,902
I can't breathe.
- This can't be happening.

138
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:30,071
Quiet! What's that sound?

139
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,076
Andy!

140
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:46,383
That's not trash.
That's not trash!

141
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,554
Think, Woody. Think, think, think.

142
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,462
Buster, come here boy. Come here.

143
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,455
Ok boy, to the curb.
Heeyah!

144
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,896
No, Buster! No!

145
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:10,014
Get up, Buster.

146
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,107
We're on the curb!
- Oh, I knew it come to this.

147
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:30,558
Pull everyone! Pull!

148
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,616
It won't rip!

149
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:44,877
Oh for goodness ... It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene.

150
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:48,011
There's gotta be a way out.
- Oh Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

151
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,864
Point, point, point!

152
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:56,376
Push! Push!
- I can hear the garbage truck!

153
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,796
It's getting closer.

154
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,185
Buzz! Jessie!

155
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:50,678
Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.
- Junk. He called us junk.

156
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,939
How could he?

157
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,747
This doesn't make any sense.
- I should have seen this coming.

158
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,610
It's Emily all over again.
- The Sarge was right.

159
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:03,466
Yeah and Woody was wrong.
- Wait a minute. Hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

160
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,846
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.
- Should we be hysterical?

161
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:09,331
No. Yes.
- Maybe, but not now.

162
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:13,590
Yee haw! Fellas, I know what to do.

163
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:22,325
What the heck?

164
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:25,917
Oh, we should have done this years ago.
- Jessie wait. What about Woody?

165
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:28,765
He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college.

166
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,206
Now, we need to go.

167
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:34,200
You're right. Come on.

168
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:39,236
Buzz?
- Woody.
- What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

169
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:42,565
It's under control, Woody. We have a plan.
- We're going to daycare.

170
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:45,234
Daycare! What, have you all lost your marbles?

171
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:50,667
Well didn't you see? Andy threw us away.
- No, no, no. He was putting you in the attic.

172
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:53,498
Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?
- That was a mistake.

173
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:57,694
Andy's mom thought you were trash.
- Yeah, after he put us in a trash bag.

174
00:17:57,695 --> 00:18:02,433
And called us junk!
- Yeah, I know it looks bad.
But guys, you gotta believe me.

175
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:06,619
Sure thing, college boy.
- Andy's moving on, Woody.

176
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,083
It's time we do the same.

177
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:12,273
Ok, out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

178
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,426
Come on Buzz, give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing.
- Woody, Woody.

179
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,504
We need to figure out what's best for everyone.

180
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:26,907
Oh great, great. It'll take us
forever to get back here.

181
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,065
Oh it's all right, Barbie.
You'll be ok.

182
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,551
Molly and I have been growing
apart for years.

183
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:47,359
It's just .. I can't believe she
would throw me away!

184
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,473
Welcome to the club, Toots.
- Ok, everyone listen up ...

185
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,767
We can get back to Andy's
but we gotta move fast.

186
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:56,693
We'll hide under the seats
til we get back home.
- Get it through your
vinyl noggin Woody ...

187
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:00,290
Andy doesn't want us anymore.
- He was putting you in the attic!

188
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,595
He left us on the curb!
- All right, calm down, both of you!

189
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:07,795
Ok. Fine, fine. Just wait until you
see what daycare's like.
- Why? What’s it like?

190
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:12,681
Daycare is a sad, lonely place for
washed up old toys who have no owners.

191
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:20,128
Quite the charmer, aren’t you?
- Oh, you'll see, as soon as we get to daycare

192
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,651
you'll be begging to go home.

193
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,329
Can anyone see anything?
- There's a playground.
- Wow!

194
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,589
We hit the jackpot, Bull's-eye.
- So much for sad and lonely, huh?

195
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,988
Ok calm, down guys.
Let's keep this in perspective.

196
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,509
Perspective? This place is perfect.
- Woody, it's nice.

197
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,204
See? The door has a rainbow on it.

198
00:19:56,931 --> 00:20:00,502
Hey, there.
- Wow. I haven't seen you in ages.

199
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:04,571
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.
- Is this Bonnie?

200
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:07,951
Look how big you are.
- Say hi, Sweetie.

201
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,498
Hi.
- Hey, how are your kids?

202
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:14,808
Molly and Andy?
- Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.
- What?

203
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,576
Can you believe it?
- You sure they won't miss these?

204
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,798
No, they never get played with.

205
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:25,127
Do you see any kids?
- Where's she taking us?

206
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,447
Look.
- Wow.
- What? What is it?

207
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,066
I can't see.

208
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,162
Ok, everyone recess. Come on.

209
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:56,821
So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

210
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,831
Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, schmexit.

211
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:02,496
Let's get played with.
- Careful these toys might
be jealous of new arrivals.

212
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:05,477
I want to see.
- It's my turn.

213
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:13,091
New toys!

214
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:22,243
Howdy, glad to meet you.
- Buzz Lightyear at your service.

215
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:31,092
Oh, thank you.
May I? Oooh.

216
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,517
The Claw.

217
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,616
Well, hello there.

218
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:48,990
I thought I heard new voices.
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

219
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:53,435
I'm Lotso, hugging bear.
But please call me Lotso.

220
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,688
Buzz Lightyear. We come in ...

221
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:59,563
First thing you gotta know about me,
I'm a hugger.

222
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:03,472
Oh, look at you all. You been
through a lot today haven't you?

223
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,585
Oh, it's been horrible.
- Well, you're safe now.

224
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:10,344
We're all cast-offs here.
We've been dumped, donated ...

225
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:14,013
yard sales, second-handed
and just plain thrown out.

226
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:19,053
But just you wait, you'll find being donated
was the best thing to ever happen to you.

227
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:23,565
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with everyday?

228
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,989
All day long. Five days a week.

229
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,779
But what happens when the kids grow up?
- Well now, I'll tell you.

230
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,896
When the kids get old, new ones come in.

231
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:35,906
When they get old, new ones replace them.

232
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:40,019
You'll never be out-grown or neglected,
never abandoned ...

233
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,866
or forgotten.
No owners means no heartbreak.

234
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:50,137
Yee haw!
- It's a miracle!
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

235
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:54,612
Because we're Andy's toys!
- So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

236
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:58,034
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

237
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:02,230
Now let's get you all settled in.
Ken? Where is that boy? Ken!

238
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:06,359
New toys.
- Far out. Down in a jiff, Lotso.

239
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,291
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

240
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:17,197
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.
- Now folks, if you wanna
step right this way ...

241
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,134
Hi. I'm Ken.
- Barbie.

242
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:33,252
Have we ever met?
- Uh uh. I would have remembered.

243
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,935
Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

244
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:42,153
Come on, Ken. Recess don't last forever.
- Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

245
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:48,241
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

246
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:51,447
What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

247
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:59,008
Folks, if I could share ... Here at
Sunnyside we've got just about
anything a toy could ask for ...

248
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:04,009
Spare parts, super glue and enough fresh
batteries to choke a hungry, hungry hippo.

249
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:07,706
Think you're getting old?
Well, stop your worrying.

250
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:11,397
Our repair spot will keep you stuffed,
puffed and lighted up.

251
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:16,737
And this ... Well, this is where I live.
Ken's dream house.

252
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:21,875
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy and
a whole room just for trying on clothes.

253
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:28,448
You have everything.
- Everything, except
someone to share it with.

254
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,810
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me.

255
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:34,746
Here we are.

256
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:42,180
Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't
you come meet our new friends?

257
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:46,284
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together - me and him.

258
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:51,597
Abandoned by the same owner.
But we don't need all
this at Sunnyside ...

259
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:54,836
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

260
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:57,460
We control our own destiny.

261
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:59,810
Oh, watch out for puddles.

262
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:02,510
Here's where you folks will be staying.

263
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:05,152
The Caterpillar Room.

264
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,273
Look at this place!
- Wow!

265
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:11,986
Holy moley guacamole!
- Jackpot, baby!

266
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,114
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

267
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:18,241
It's so beautiful!

268
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,161
Huh? What the ... ?

269
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,063
Oh, hey, little guy.

270
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:26,492
How long's it been since you all
got played with?

271
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:29,676
It's been years.
- Well, just you wait ...

272
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:34,506
in a few minutes, that bell's gonna
ring and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreaming of.

273
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:37,840
Play. Real play. I can't wait!

274
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:40,398
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be heading back.

275
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:45,022
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
- Thank you. Bye.

276
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:48,101
Will I see you again?
- Oh, I'll see you tonight ...

277
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:52,702
In my dreams.
- Ken, let's get a move on.

278
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:55,630
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

279
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:58,946
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.
Ah heck, you don't know me from GI Joe ...

280
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:02,996
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were ...
- Made for each other?

281
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:08,274
Yay!
- Yes!
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso!

282
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:12,641
It's so exciting!

283
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:21,492
Sounds like kids to me.
- Oh, I want to get played with.

284
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:27,136
Why can't time go faster?
- How many are there out there?
- Oh, they sound so sweet!

285
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:36,804
Look everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

286
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:41,606
But we need to go home.
- We could have a whole new life here, Woody.

287
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:45,839
A chance to make kids happy again.
- Why don't you stay?

288
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,248
Yeah, Woody stay with us.
- Come on, Woodster.

289
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,978
You'll get played with.
- I can't. No. No.
Guys, really, no!

290
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:56,560
I have a kid. You have a kid - Andy.

291
00:26:56,561 --> 00:27:00,160
And if he wants us at college
or in the attic ...

292
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,844
Well, our job is to be there for him.

293
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,816
Now I'm going home.
Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.

294
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:13,102
Come on, Buzz.
Buzz?

295
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:19,654
Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.

296
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:23,074
What?
- What's important now is that we stay together.

297
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,922
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

298
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:30,089
Look under your boot, Buzz. You too, Jessie.
Whose name is written there?

299
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:37,019
Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.
- Of course he does. He cares about all of you.

300
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,836
He was putting you in the attic. I saw ...
You can't just turn your back on him now!

301
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:43,310
Woody, wake up! It's over!

302
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:45,799
Andy is all grown up.

303
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:53,074
Ok. Fine. Perfect.
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

304
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,707
So this is it?
After all we've been through ...

305
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:23,487
Bull's-eye, no.
You need to stay.

306
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:29,247
Bull's-eye, no. I said stay!

307
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,261
Look, I don't want you left alone
in the attic, ok?

308
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:37,793
Now stay.

309
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:43,751
Bonnie?

310
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,635
I ... I gotta go.

311
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,948
Bonnie, you in here?

312
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,936
Come on, Come on ...
No, no!

313
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:56,377
What? What the heck?

314
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:00,017
Ah, that's better.

315
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:04,685
Bonnie!
Oh, there you are.

316
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:06,906
Come on, Honey. It's time to go home.

317
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,397
No, no, no, no ...

318
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,607
Reach for the sky.

319
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:20,884
Bluebells, cockleshells, eeny, miney ...

320
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,747
You're my favorite deputy.

321
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:32,564
Bonnie!
- Coming!

322
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:37,432
Oh, great!

323
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,622
Oh, it's gonna be ok, Bull's-eye.
- Woody's going to college with Andy.

324
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,790
It's what he always wanted.
- Ah, he's crazy.

325
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,840
College is no place for a toy.
- Toys are for playtime.

326
00:31:57,841 --> 00:32:01,031
Oh speaking about playtime ...
They're lining up out there!

327
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,830
How many?
- There must be dozens.

328
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:05,842
Oh, I can hardly wait!
- Places, everyone.

329
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,008
At last I'm going to get played with.

330
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,093
Uh Rex ...
- Come to Poppa.

331
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:22,473
There's a snake in my boot.

332
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:26,821
I'd like to join your posse boys, but
first I'm gonna sing a little song.

333
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:28,811
A sheriff!

334
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:33,495
Move over, Mr. Prickle Pants.
We have a guest.

335
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:35,515
You want some coffee?

336
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:39,816
It's good for you but don't drink too much
or you'll haveta .. haveta ...

337
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,524
Be right back!

338
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,095
Hey. Hello. Hi, excuse me.
- Sh!

339
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,689
Can you tell me where I am?
- Shhh!

340
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,476
The guy's just asking you a question.
- Well, excuse me, I'm trying
to stay in character.

341
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:57,707
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron Von Shush.
- Sh!

342
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,406
Hello, I'm Trixie.
- Sh!
- Sh!

343
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:04,832
Guys. Hey. Guys, look.
I don't know where I am.
- We're either in a cafe in Paris ...

344
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:08,087
or a coffeshop in New Jersey.
I'm pretty sure I just came back
from the doctor ...

345
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:12,633
with life-changing news.
- We do a lot of improv here. Just
stay loose, have fun. You'll be fine.

346
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,532
- No, no, no, no. I ...

347
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,521
Who wants lunch?

348
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:21,890
I have the secret ingredient.
Jelly beans.

349
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:26,742
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
- Poisoned?

350
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:29,758
Who would do such a mean thing?

351
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,044
Agh! The scary witch! Look out!

352
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:38,685
She using her witchy powers.

353
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:39,996
I know where to hide.

354
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,859
She'll never find us in here.

355
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,263
What's wrong?

356
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:53,185
Agh! She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

357
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:55,986
You're doing great.
- Are you classically trained?

358
00:34:55,987 --> 00:35:00,256
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here.
- There is no way out.

359
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:04,645
Just kidding. Door's right over there.
- Well, Cowboy. You just jumped
right in, didn't ya?

360
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,027
I'm Dolly.
- Uh, Woody.

361
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:10,337
Woody. Really? You're gonna stick
with that? Cause now's your chance
to change it. New room and all ...

362
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:13,008
That's coming from a doll named Dolly.

363
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:16,599
Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

364
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,677
Well, actually ...
- Of course he's not, Pea Brain ...

365
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:21,193
He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have ...

366
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:22,812
My hat!
- Told you.

367
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:25,513
I found a spaceship!
- Showtime!

368
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:29,568
Quick. Get in. Strap in your seatbelts,
close your tray tables.

369
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:32,360
Hold on, it might get a little bumpy.

370
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:35,714
Three, two, one. Blast off!

371
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:42,990
Yee haw! You saved us, Cowboy!
You're our hero!

372
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,935
I got a kink in my slink.

373
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:59,412
My tail! Where's my tail?

374
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:07,931
Someone need a hand?

375
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:09,661
Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

376
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,930
Here's your arm.
- Gimme that.
- Honey, the mustache?

377
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:15,047
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

378
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:20,239
Andy never played with us like that.
- We're just gonna have
to make the best of it.

379
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,480
But these toddlers, they don't
know how to play with us.
- They're too young.

380
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,418
And they're sticky.
- We should be in the Butterfly Room.

381
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,770
With the big kids.
- That's right.
- You said it.

382
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,677
We'll get this straightened out.
I'll go talk to Lotso about
moving us to the other room.

383
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,912
Blast. Try that one.

384
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:41,605
It's locked.
- Same here.

385
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:43,467
Try the windows.
- Uh negatory.

386
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:47,467
It's a Fenster-Sneckler 380.
Finest child-proof lock in the world.

387
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:51,159
We're trapped!
- Wait. Did anyone notice the transom?

388
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:55,039
Oh great. How do we get up there?

389
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,987
All right, everyone. On three!

390
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:01,621
One ... two ...
- Three!

391
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,554
Let go!

392
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,429
Go!

393
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:24,400
He did it!
- Yes, sir!

394
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,116
Way to go, Buzz!

395
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:34,794
They think they had a fun playtime.
- Sh. They might hear you.

396
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:39,155
Ok, now you start.
- I ...
- Love ...
- You!

397
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,964
See? That time I said "love".

398
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:42,616
Ok, now me first.
- Ok, ok, ok.

399
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,074
I ...
- Love ...
- You!

400
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,338
You see what I mean?
It changes every time!

401
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,151
You are so smart.
- Come on, Romeo. You're late.

402
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:52,163
I'm going to miss you.

403
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,597
All right. Place your bets.
Come on, everybody.
- Any splits?

404
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,554
Here we go.
- Come on.

405
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:05,817
That's it. No more bets.

406
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,361
Come on, right here.
- Come on, duck!
- Come on, duck!

407
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:11,683
I won!

408
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:16,085
Stretch takes the round.
- You lost.

409
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:19,224
Ok, minimum bet: five monopoly.
Coyotes wild.

410
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:21,260
Change of two double A's.

411
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,259
Hey, what do you guys think of
the new recruits? Any keepers?

412
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,560
Oh please ... landfill!

413
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,971
Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

414
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,650
But that, that, uh, space guy ...
He can be useful.

415
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:34,806
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

416
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,612
Neither are you, Chunk.

417
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,298
You got a little piece for yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

418
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,024
Hey, lay off, Twitch!

419
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:44,202
Barbie's different.
- Oh, Mr. Softy over here.

420
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:48,511
What do you expect from a girl's toy?
- I'm not a girl's toy! I'm not!

421
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:52,194
Why do you guys keep saying that?
- All them toys are disposable.

422
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:55,262
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

423
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:04,140
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

424
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:07,340
Let me go!
- Take him to the library.

425
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,846
No!

426
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,126
1225 Sycamore.

427
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:42,744
Woody, what are you doing?

428
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:46,172
I gotta get outta here.
- You're leaving?

429
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:50,007
But didn't you have fun today?
- Well, of course I did.
More than I've had in years.

430
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:53,546
But, you see, I belong to someone else.
- Who's "Ydna"?

431
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:57,392
I believe it's pronounced "Ydnay".
- Guys, it says Andy.

432
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,937
He's my Bonnie.
And he's leaving soon.

433
00:40:59,938 --> 00:41:02,024
I gotta get home.
- Where's home?

434
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,208
Elm Street. 234 Elm.

435
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:07,468
Do you have guys a map?
We're on it, Cowboy. Trixie?

436
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,170
I'll fire up the computer.

437
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:18,197
Unhand me you, cowards.
I demand to talk to Lotso.

438
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:22,726
Zip it, Buck Rogers.
You won't talk to Lotso
til we say you can ...

439
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:28,721
Ken, what's going on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

440
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,202
Uh, he got out Lotso.
- Got out?

441
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:35,518
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!
This isn't how we treat our guests.

442
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,732
FAO my Schwartz! There you go. I'm so sorry.

443
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,006
Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

444
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:47,686
The children in the Caterpillar Room are
not age-appropriate for me and my friends.

445
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:50,917
We respectfully request a transfer
to the Butterfly Room.

446
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,781
Well, request granted.
- But Lotso ...

447
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:57,390
Hush now, Kenneth. This toy showed initiative.

448
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,894
Leadership. Why I say, we've
found ourselves a keeper.

449
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:04,150
Hear that everyone? We got a keeper!

450
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:08,749
We're calling you up to
the big leagues, son.

451
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,639
From now on you'll have anything you want.

452
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,322
Excellent! I'll go get my friends.
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

453
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:19,931
Those Caterpillar kids need
someone to play with.

454
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:23,323
But my friends don't belong there.
- Oh none of us do.

455
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:27,316
I agree, which is why for the good,
of our community ...

456
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:33,949
We ask the newer toys, the stronger
ones, to take on the hardships the
rest of us can't bear anymore.

457
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,023
I guess that makes sense.

458
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:41,527
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

459
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:45,411
A family man, huh? I understand.

460
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:48,219
Put him back in the timeout chair.

461
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,919
Unhand me!

462
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,567
Bring in the bookworm.

463
00:42:56,497 --> 00:43:02,089
Ah! Here it is.
It was filed under "Lightyear".

464
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:10,393
Let's see here ...
Accessories, maintenance ...

465
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:15,318
Oh, here we go. Remove screws
to access battery compartment.

466
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:16,767
What are you doing?

467
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,720
Let go of me.

468
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:25,405
To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure
back to its original factory settings,

469
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:29,505
slide the switch from 'Play' to 'Demo'.

470
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,850
Stop! No, no, no!

471
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:37,531
What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

472
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,621
I'll see what it was.

473
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,846
What do you see? Anything?
- No, just a dark hallway.

474
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:49,202
Wait, wait, I see Andy.
- What?

475
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:52,428
That's impossible.
- No, no. I really see him.

476
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,228
In his room. Ohh! My other eye!

477
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:57,885
The one I left behind!

478
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:02,411
This is so weird. He's packing up.

479
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:08,409
Uh oh. Here comes Buster.
Out of the way. Get away!

480
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:11,420
Ok. Andy's out in the hall.

481
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:15,486
He's looking in the attic.
Wait, there's Mom.

482
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:18,038
Why is he so upset?

483
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:21,850
Oh no. Oh, this is terrible!

484
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:26,392
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us.

485
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:29,561
He's looking for us?

486
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:33,794
Andy does want us! I just knew it!
- I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

487
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:37,868
Well, then Woody was telling the truth.
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him!

488
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:42,314
Hey, you didn't believe him first.
- Guys, we gotta, we gotta go home!

489
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:48,662
Lotso!
- Hey there. How are you all
doing this fine evening?

490
00:44:48,663 --> 00:44:53,540
Thank goodness. Have you seen Buzz?
- There's been a mistake. We have to go.

491
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:57,533
Go? Why? You just got here,
in the nick of time too.

492
00:44:57,534 --> 00:45:00,898
We were running low on volunteers
for the little ones.

493
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,994
They just love new toys,
now don't they?

494
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:06,945
Love? We have  been chewed,
kicked, drooled on ...

495
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:09,800
Just look at my pocket book.

496
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:14,264
Hmm, well here's the thing, Sweet
Potato, you ain't leaving Sunnyside.

497
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:17,944
Sweet Potato?
Who do you think you're talking to?

498
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:22,352
I have over 30 accessories and I
deserve more respect ...

499
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,408
Ah, that's better.

500
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:27,628
Hey! No one takes my wife's mouth,
except me!

501
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:29,794
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

502
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:34,850
Come on guys. We're going home.
- Whoa, there Missy!
You're not going anywhere.

503
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:37,529
Oh yeah? Who's going to stop us?

504
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:42,904
Buzz, you're back. Buzz?

505
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,941
Watch out!

506
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,866
Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso.

507
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:58,496
Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence. Minions of Zurg.

508
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:02,409
You are in the custody of the Galactic Alliance.
- Galactic Alliance?

509
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,322
Good work, Lightyear. Now lock 'em up.

510
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:08,261
Yes, sir.

511
00:46:16,868 --> 00:46:19,364
Where do you think you're going?

512
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,557
Buzz, we're your friends.
- Spare me your lies, Temptress.

513
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:29,041
Your emperor is defeated and I'm immune
to your bewitching good looks.

514
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,735
Hey, Mungo. Get your paws off my wife.

515
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:38,533
Let go of me, you drooling doofus.
- Not him. I think this potato needs
to learn himself some manners.

516
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:42,005
Take him to the box.
- Hey, put me down, you moron!

517
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:44,646
Where are you taking me to?
Bad baby. Bad baby.

518
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:49,575
Ken, what's going on?
- Barbie. I told you to
wait in the dream house.

519
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:52,932
What are you doing with my friends?
- Get in.

520
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:56,159
Barbie, wait.
- Don't touch me!

521
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,973
We're through!
- Barbie, I ...

522
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,224
And give me my scarf back.
- Ow!

523
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:09,118
Lightyear, explain our overnight accommodations.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

524
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,627
Prisoners sleep in their cells.
Any prisoner caught outside their cell,
spends the night in the box.

525
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,850
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

526
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:20,782
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

527
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:23,965
Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.

528
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,086
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night ...

529
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:29,277
... in the box.
We get it!

530
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:32,174
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

531
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:35,714
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

532
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:38,172
Don't worry, Commander.
Any doubt I had ...

533
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:40,882
got pounded out of me at the Academy.

534
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:45,229
Listen up folks. We got a way of
doing things here at Sunnyside.

535
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:51,516
If you start at the bottom, pay your dues,
life here can be a dream come true.

536
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,930
But if you break our rules,
step out of line ...

537
00:47:54,931 --> 00:48:01,954
try to checkout early,
well, you're just hurting yourself.

538
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:07,347
Woody! What did you do to him?
- You all get a good night's rest ...

539
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:11,697
You got a full day of playtime tomorrow.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

540
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:19,655
1225 Syca ...

541
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:23,889
Who is Velocistar237?

542
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,830
That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.
That's nothing. Let me just take care of that.

543
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:30,864
Just a dinosaur ...

544
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:33,965
All right. Sycamore. Ok. Enter.

545
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:37,141
Please don't be far. Please. Please.

546
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,246
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!
- Yay!

547
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:46,153
Look at me! I'm big toy on campus!

548
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:49,916
Hello. I'll see you at the Sock Hop.
- Ok, Potsie.

549
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:53,181
Hey, wait, listen ... If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare ...

550
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:56,147
you tell them that Woody made it home.
- You came from Sunnyside?

551
00:48:56,148 --> 00:49:00,075
But, how'd you escape?
- Well, it wasn't easy.

552
00:49:00,795 --> 00:49:03,335
What do you mean "escape"?

553
00:49:03,336 --> 00:49:06,572
Sunnyside is a place of ruin
and despair.

554
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:10,380
Ruled by an evil bear who
smells of strawberries.

555
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:15,140
Lotso?
- The guy may seem plush and
huggable on the outside ...

556
00:49:15,175 --> 00:49:19,576
but inside, he's a monster.
- But, how do you know that?

557
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:23,137
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

558
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:30,066
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

559
00:49:30,897 --> 00:49:33,942
He was a good toy. A friend.

560
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:37,961
Me and him, we had the same kid. Daisy.

561
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,822
I was there when Lotso got unwrapped.

562
00:49:44,796 --> 00:49:51,362
Daisy loved us all.
But Lotso ... Lotso was special.

563
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:55,700
They did everything together.

564
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,210
I've never seen a kid
and a toy more in love.

565
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:03,034
One day we took a drive.

566
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:06,454
At a rest stop, we had a little playtime.

567
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:10,350
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

568
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:20,829
She never came back.

569
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:28,091
Lotso wouldn't give up.

570
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,899
It took forever, but we finally
made it back to Daisy's.

571
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,721
But by then, it was too late.

572
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,930
Something changed that day inside Lotso.

573
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,501
Something snapped.
- She replaced us.

574
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:05,068
Come on.
- No, she only replaced you.

575
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:08,616
She replaced all of us.
Didn't she?

576
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,425
She don't love you no more.

577
00:51:13,426 --> 00:51:16,161
Now, come on!

578
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:23,436
We were lost. Cast off.

579
00:51:23,437 --> 00:51:26,323
Unloved, unwanted.

580
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,398
Then we found Sunnyside.

581
00:51:43,536 --> 00:51:46,670
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

582
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,844
He wasn't anyone's friend.

583
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:55,667
He took over Sunnyside and
rigged the whole system.

584
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:59,526
So, how'd you get out?
- I got broke.

585
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:04,842
Bonnie found me. Took me home.
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

586
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:11,499
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys, they don't stand a chance.

587
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,152
But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

588
00:52:14,153 --> 00:52:18,473
Returning now would be suicide.
- But what about your Andy?

589
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:21,882
Isn't he leaving for college?

590
00:52:40,016 --> 00:52:42,110
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

591
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:48,764
Oh, Bull's-eye. I miss Woody too.

592
00:52:50,803 --> 00:52:54,218
But he ain't ever coming back.

593
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,334
Rise and shine, campers!
- Commander Lotso, sir.

594
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,589
All quiet. Nothing to report.
- Excellent, Lightyear.

595
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:27,531
Come on. We need you back at Star Command.
- Wait! What have you done with my husband?

596
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:30,418
Big Baby.

597
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:37,326
Sweet heart!

598
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:41,542
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of "Lincoln Logs".

599
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:43,915
Uh, I don't think those were "Lincoln Logs".

600
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:48,013
You all get ready.
You got a play date with destiny.

601
00:55:09,895 --> 00:55:14,771
Uh, hello?
- You shouldn't have come back, Cowboy.
They've cracked down hard since you left.

602
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:19,550
More guards, more patrols. You and your
friends ain't ever gonna get outta here now.

603
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,213
I made it out once.
- You got lucky once.

604
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:25,224
Want my advice? Keep your heads down.

605
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:27,694
You'll survive.
- Yeah, for how long?

606
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:31,065
I've been here years.
They'll never break me.

607
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:34,287
There's only one way toys leave this place.

608
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,385
Poor fella.
Trash truck comes at dawn.

609
00:55:38,386 --> 00:55:43,261
Then it's off to the dump.
- Look, I appreciate your concern, Old Timer.

610
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:46,209
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now we're leaving.

611
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:49,702
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I'd sure be grateful.

612
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:55,905
Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing
you gotta get through is the doors.

613
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,187
Locked every night.
Inside and out.

614
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:01,905
Keys are left on a hook in the office.
- Got it. What else?

615
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:04,639
Lotso's trucks patrolling all night long.

616
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,808
Hallway, lobby, playground ...
- Yeah, yeah. What about the wall?

617
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:12,960
8 feet high.
Cinder block. No way through it.
You go over or under.

618
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,568
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.
- It's not.

619
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:18,573
Your real problem's the monkey.

620
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:23,259
The monkey's the eye in the sky.
He sees everything.

621
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,990
Classrooms ...

622
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:38,172
Hallways ...

623
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:49,201
Even the playground.

624
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,972
He can unlock doors, sneak past guards ...

625
00:56:58,973 --> 00:57:02,314
climb the wall, but if you
don't take out that monkey ...

626
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:05,025
you ain't going nowhere.
Do you want to get out of here?

627
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:08,165
Get rid of that monkey!

628
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:10,597
Recess. Come on, kids.

629
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:20,255
Hey guys.
- Woody?
- Woody!

630
00:57:24,502 --> 00:57:27,092
Thank goodness!
- You're alive!
- Of course I'm alive.

631
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:31,314
My hat. Wait. Where's Buzz?

632
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:35,395
Lotso did something to do with him.
- He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again.

633
00:57:35,396 --> 00:57:38,781
Oh no!
- Oh yes. Return of the astro nut.

634
00:57:38,782 --> 00:57:43,561
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I ... I was wrong.

635
00:57:43,562 --> 00:57:45,787
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

636
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:49,231
No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys.

637
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,596
From now on, we stick together.

638
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:53,757
But, Andy's leaving for college.

639
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:58,563
College! Flag down the mailman!
We gotta get you home before
Andy leaves tomorrow!

640
00:57:58,598 --> 00:58:01,412
Tomorrow? But that means ...
- That means we're busting out of here.

641
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:03,845
Tonight.
- What? Impossible!

642
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:06,773
There's no way out of here.
- No, there is a way out.

643
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:10,695
One way.

644
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:20,829
Slinky Dog?
- Present.

645
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,253
Green guys? Cowgirl?

646
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,871
Here.
- Horse?

647
00:58:27,728 --> 00:58:30,008
Piggy Bank.
- Yup.

648
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:32,366
Tyrannosaurus?
- Here.

649
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:34,476
Barbie?
- Here.

650
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:39,368
Potato Head?

651
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:43,208
Hey! Hey! Super Troop Man. Wake up!

652
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:45,972
Impossible.

653
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:03,445
Little late for a stroll isn't it,
Potato Head?

654
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,916
That's Mr. Potato Head to you smoothie!

655
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:17,755
You ascot-wearing pink nosier!
You're not a toy!

656
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:20,229
You're an accessory!
You're a purse with legs!

657
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:24,479
Take him back to the box!
- No, not the box!

658
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,527
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I like ascots.

659
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:32,313
Ok check.
- Good work, Lightyear.

660
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:35,120
All right. Resume your ...
uh ... space guy thing.

661
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:37,651
Yes, sir, well-groomed man.

662
00:59:37,686 --> 00:59:40,427
Ken? Ken?

663
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:45,782
What do you want?
- I can't take it here, Ken.

664
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,954
I want to go to the Butterfly Room.
With you.

665
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:51,431
Yeah, well, you should have
thought of that yesterday.
- I was wrong.

666
00:59:51,432 --> 00:59:54,261
I want to be with you Ken, I do,
in your dream house.

667
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:58,467
Take me away from this!
Take me away!

668
00:59:59,169 --> 01:00:03,509
Darn it, Barbie. Ok, but things
are complicated around here.

669
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:07,163
You gotta do what I say.
- I will Ken. I promise.

670
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:11,338
Wait! I'll do anything!
I'll change your diapers!

671
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,520
Get the tape!

672
01:01:06,782 --> 01:01:09,665
And this is where the magic happens.

673
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:14,179
Look at all your clothes!
I can't believe you never
brought me up here!

674
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,441
Tennis whites. Mission to Mars.
- Check this out.

675
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:21,377
Kung Fu Fighting. Canvas Hero
with matching sports pennant.

676
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:25,235
Flower Power. Oh, Ken!

677
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:28,061
No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie.

678
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:34,198
No one.
- Ken, would you model
a few outfits for me?

679
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,893
Just a few.

680
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:11,659
Go get the key!
- Where is it? Where is it?
Where's the key? Where's the key?

681
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:15,160
Bingo.

682
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:28,453
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!

683
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,432
Make a move, Porky.

684
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:34,357
No fighting. Break it up.

685
01:02:39,818 --> 01:02:42,555
You can't hit each other.
That's my job.

686
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,510
Help! Prison riot!

687
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:53,039
Get the tortilla.

688
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:34,539
Ready?
- Ready.

689
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:44,872
Uh, Barbie?

690
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,346
No more games, Ken.
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

691
01:03:48,347 --> 01:03:51,913
And how do we switch him back?
- You can't make me talk. You can't!

692
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,778
But I'd like to see you try.

693
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:49,603
Let's see ... Hawaiian surf trunks.

694
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:52,169
Oh, Barbie, those are vintage!

695
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,254
It's ok. Go ahead, rip them.
I don't care. They're a dime a dozen.

696
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:58,047
Ooh, glitter tux.

697
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:01,395
Who cares? Who cares?
Those things are tacky.

698
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:06,211
Ooh, a Nehru jacket.
- Barbie, not the Nehru!

699
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:08,844
This is from what? 1967?

700
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:12,071
The Groovy Formal Collection, yes!
- What a shame.

701
01:05:12,072 --> 01:05:14,418
Oh no! No! No!

702
01:05:14,419 --> 01:05:16,907
There is an instructional manual!

703
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:22,747
Lotso switched Buzz to demo mode.
- Where's that manual?

704
01:05:23,491 --> 01:05:28,558
I don't know why this couldn't wait
until morning Ken, but here you go.

705
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:44,348
What's taking so doggone long?

706
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,247
So, how do we fix Buzz?

707
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:09,489
What are you looking at, Feathers?

708
01:06:17,834 --> 01:06:20,948
Yeah, fly away, you coward.
Uh oh.

709
01:06:22,227 --> 01:06:24,571
Well, that's just great.

710
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,518
Oh give it up. No one can hear you.

711
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:38,170
What?
- I said, no one can hear you.

712
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:41,333
What?
- He said, "no one can" ...

713
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:44,503
Shh. Be quiet.
- Woody, you're back.

714
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:52,067
Stop him! Don't let him get out!
- Star Command: I've been taken
hostage by my own prisoners.

715
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:57,901
Quick.  Open his back, there's a switch.
- Unhand me Zurg scum!

716
01:06:57,902 --> 01:07:00,623
The Galactic Court will show you no mercy.

717
01:07:01,106 --> 01:07:04,435
It's not working. Why is it not working?
Where's the manual?

718
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:07,863
Here we go. There should be a little
hole under the switch.
- Little hole ... Got it!

719
01:07:07,864 --> 01:07:10,979
To reset your Buzz Lightyear,
insert paper clip ...

720
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:14,398
Rex, use your finger!
- What?
- Ok. Now what?

721
01:07:15,046 --> 01:07:18,918
Let's see. Caution do not hold button
for more than five seconds.

722
01:07:21,173 --> 01:07:24,121
It's not my fault.

723
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:32,704
Starlog, I've awakened from hyper
sleep on a strange planet.

724
01:07:32,705 --> 01:07:35,188
Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me.

725
01:07:35,189 --> 01:07:39,035
I am surrounded by unknown creatures.

726
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:42,284
Friend or foe?

727
01:07:42,982 --> 01:07:45,180
Amigos. We're all amigos.

728
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:49,213
I must have crashed and
my memory's been erased.

729
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:53,602
Has anyone seen my spaceship?
- We gotta switch him back.

730
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:56,528
How do we do that ?
- I don't know, this part's in Spanish.

731
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:02,592
We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo.
- My ship has landed well.

732
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,580
Good luck, Cowboy.

733
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,184
Here they come.

734
01:08:15,276 --> 01:08:17,642
Come on, Buzz.

735
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:20,806
What took you so long?
- Things got complicated.

736
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:23,021
Where's Potato Head?
- We haven't seen him.

737
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:29,045
Buzz.

738
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:35,593
My desert flower.

739
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:39,481
Did you fix Buzz?
- Uh, sort of.

740
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,931
Behind you. Someone's coming.

741
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,301
You would not believe what I've
been through tonight.

742
01:08:48,302 --> 01:08:51,394
Darling, are you ok?
- I feel fresh, healthy ...

743
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:53,845
It's terrible.
- You've lost weight.

744
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:56,077
And so tall.

745
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:59,201
Ah, you're a sight for detachable eyes.

746
01:09:05,332 --> 01:09:06,931
All clear.

747
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:11,316
Come on. Come on.

748
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:14,624
We're almost there.

749
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:20,534
Back up. Back up.

750
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,745
Come on.

751
01:10:36,306 --> 01:10:39,966
Miss, you are the prettiest
flower in the room.

752
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:43,292
And together, we'll fight evil.

753
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:49,305
Woody!

754
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:53,820
Come on, we're almost there.
- After you.

755
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:03,163
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

756
01:11:05,388 --> 01:11:07,954
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

757
01:11:13,418 --> 01:11:17,002
Open.
- Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

758
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:23,902
Is it safe?
- I guess I'll find out.

759
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:33,834
Woody, are you ok?
- Yeah, come on down.

760
01:11:33,835 --> 01:11:36,124
But not all at once.
- What did he say?

761
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,444
I think he said, all at once.
- No. No, no, no, no, no!

762
01:11:44,135 --> 01:11:46,960
Thanks Jess.
- You're welcome.

763
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:50,554
Almost there guys.
Slink, you think you can make it?

764
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:53,866
I might be old, but I still
got a spring in my step.

765
01:11:56,074 --> 01:11:58,390
He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins!

766
01:11:58,391 --> 01:12:01,274
Ok, climb across.

767
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:05,413
You lost, little doggie?

768
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:11,289
Well, well, look who's back.

769
01:12:18,885 --> 01:12:23,247
I'm sorry, Cowboy. They broke me.

770
01:12:23,248 --> 01:12:26,847
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

771
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:29,900
He don't want you no more.
- That's a lie.

772
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:32,251
Is it? Tell me this Sheriff ...

773
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:36,023
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

774
01:12:36,024 --> 01:12:40,307
You think you're special, Cowboy?
You're a piece of plastic.

775
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:43,286
You were made to be thrown away.

776
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,813
Speak of the devil.

777
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:54,736
Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room

778
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,367
and you need to avoid that truck.

779
01:12:57,368 --> 01:13:01,448
Why don't you come on back
join our family again?

780
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:05,585
This isn't a family, it's a prison.
You're a liar and a bully.

781
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:09,641
And I'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours.

782
01:13:09,642 --> 01:13:13,415
Jessie's right.
Authority should derive from
the consent of the governed,

783
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,740
not from the threat of force.

784
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:19,303
If that's what you want.

785
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:23,130
Barbie, wait!
Don't do this, Lotso!

786
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:27,720
She's a barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

787
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:30,895
Not to me there's not.

788
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:34,012
Fine. Then why don't you join them?

789
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:42,886
Oh Ken!
- Everyone listen. Sunnyside can be cool
and groovy if we treated each other fair.

790
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:47,299
It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid,
and he put himself on top.

791
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,113
Anyone concur with Ken?

792
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:55,481
I didn't throw you away, your kid did.

793
01:13:55,482 --> 01:14:00,494
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.
Chew on that when you're in the dump.

794
01:14:00,495 --> 01:14:02,727
Wait. What about Daisy?

795
01:14:03,808 --> 01:14:09,244
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Daisy. You used to do everything with her.

796
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:12,850
Yeah, then she threw us out.
- No, she lost you.

797
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:15,517
She replaced us.
- She replaced you.

798
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:17,695
And if you couldn't have her,
then no one could!

799
01:14:17,696 --> 01:14:20,655
You lied to Big Baby and
you've been lying ever since.

800
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:24,403
Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

801
01:14:24,404 --> 01:14:27,993
She never loved me!
- As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

802
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:39,462
Mama.
- What? You want your mommy back?
She never loved you! Don't be such a baby!

803
01:14:41,423 --> 01:14:44,491
Push them in. All of them.

804
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:47,314
This is what happens when
you dummies try to think.

805
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:50,771
We're all just trash waiting
to be thrown away.

806
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:53,624
That's all a toy is.

807
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:57,146
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

808
01:14:58,565 --> 01:15:02,424
No, no, wait a minute! Baby, wait!

809
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,174
He's gone.
- Holy cow.

810
01:15:11,769 --> 01:15:13,713
Come on. Hurry.

811
01:15:20,024 --> 01:15:22,498
Oh for crying out loud!
- Come on.

812
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,119
No!
- Woody!

813
01:15:31,564 --> 01:15:33,972
Oh boy. Incoming!

814
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:37,532
Come on.

815
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,520
Barbie, no!

816
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,707
Woody!

817
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:50,071
No!

818
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:56,519
Can you hear me? Is everyone ok?

819
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,824
Of course not, you imbecile!
We're doomed!

820
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:03,267
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

821
01:16:05,408 --> 01:16:07,660
We all here ? Slinky? Rex?

822
01:16:11,412 --> 01:16:16,019
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!
- Miss, where are you?

823
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:28,515
They'll never make it.

824
01:16:37,996 --> 01:16:40,392
Look out!

825
01:16:51,577 --> 01:16:54,615
Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

826
01:16:58,069 --> 01:17:03,390
Buzz, are you ok?
Buzz? Buzz?

827
01:17:13,566 --> 01:17:18,963
That wasn't me was it?
- Oh Buzz, you're back.

828
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:21,669
Yes, I'm back.
Where have I been?

829
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,938
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
- Woody!

830
01:17:25,973 --> 01:17:29,627
So, where are we now?
- In a garbage truck on the way to the dump.

831
01:17:42,927 --> 01:17:45,946
Hold on! We're going in!

832
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:03,963
Have you got all your pieces?
- The Claw.

833
01:18:03,964 --> 01:18:07,179
My babies!
- Hey guys! No! No!

834
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:10,511
No!

835
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:18,254
Hang on.

836
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:34,079
Woody, what do we do?
- We'll be ok if we stay together.

837
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:40,433
It's a magnet. Watch out!

838
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:42,283
Don't worry, Slink.
We'll get you down.

839
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,111
I don't wanna take a look at this.

840
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:51,033
Quick, grab something metal.

841
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:58,559
You heard the guy.

842
01:19:00,264 --> 01:19:03,733
It's not working.

843
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:09,641
Help! Help me! I'm stuck!

844
01:19:09,642 --> 01:19:14,223
Help please! Help!
- Woody!

845
01:19:16,392 --> 01:19:18,893
Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

846
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,310
Go! Go!

847
01:19:38,936 --> 01:19:42,149
Thank you, Sheriff.
- We're all in this together.

848
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,988
Right guys?

849
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,402
Guys?
- Woody, down here.

850
01:19:55,186 --> 01:19:59,439
Woody, look, I can see daylight.
We're going to be ok.

851
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:04,140
I don't think that's daylight.

852
01:20:09,175 --> 01:20:11,871
Run!

853
01:20:27,062 --> 01:20:31,113
Sheriff, the button. Help me.

854
01:20:31,114 --> 01:20:33,341
Come on.

855
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:36,169
Go! Go! Hit the button!

856
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:45,675
Hurry!

857
01:20:47,605 --> 01:20:51,207
Just push it! Push it! Push it!

858
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:54,464
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

859
01:20:54,465 --> 01:20:57,631
No! No!
- Lotso!

860
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:28,547
Buzz, what do we do?

861
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:18,958
You know all that bad stuff
I said about Andy's attic?

862
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:22,089
I take it all back.
- You're darn tootin'.

863
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,592
You said it.

864
01:23:29,174 --> 01:23:32,523
Oh darling, you were so brave.

865
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:37,733
You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

866
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,800
My boys.
- Daddy!

867
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,565
Hey, where is that furball Lotso?

868
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:45,841
Yeah, I'd like to loosen his stitching.

869
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:48,743
Forget it, guys.
He's not worth it.

870
01:23:58,315 --> 01:24:01,672
Hey!
- Whatcha got?
- I had me one of these when I was a kid.

871
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:05,686
Strawberries.

872
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:11,420
Hey buddy! You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

873
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:21,726
Come on, Woody. We gotta get you home.
- That's right, college boy.

874
01:24:21,827 --> 01:24:25,720
Wait, what about you guys?
I mean ...

875
01:24:25,721 --> 01:24:28,413
Maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

876
01:24:28,414 --> 01:24:32,760
We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him ...

877
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:35,058
Together.

878
01:24:35,059 --> 01:24:39,084
I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'll check.

879
01:24:39,085 --> 01:24:43,627
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done.

880
01:24:43,628 --> 01:24:46,813
He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time.

881
01:25:02,868 --> 01:25:05,952
Come on, Buster.
- Honey, you've got everything?

882
01:25:05,953 --> 01:25:08,892
Yeah, just a few more boxes in my room.
- Ok, come on!

883
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,550
Ok. All clear.

884
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:35,932
Oh, there you are!

885
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:48,442
Buzz ... this isn't goodbye.

886
01:25:48,684 --> 01:25:53,008
Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.
- Yeah, but not too much fun.

887
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:58,470
Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.
- He's a good kid ...

888
01:25:58,471 --> 01:26:01,476
Tell him to get a haircut.
- Sure thing.

889
01:26:02,944 --> 01:26:07,161
Jessie, you'll be ok in the attic?
- Of course I will.

890
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:11,027
Besides, I know about Buzz's Spanish mode.

891
01:26:11,028 --> 01:26:12,435
My what?

892
01:26:16,774 --> 01:26:19,734
You know where to find us, Cowboy.

893
01:26:33,044 --> 01:26:36,591
Did you say goodbye to Molly?
- Mom, we've said goodbye like ten times.

894
01:26:48,864 --> 01:26:51,609
Mom, it's ok.

895
01:26:53,760 --> 01:27:00,311
I know. It's just ... I wish
I could always be with you.

896
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:04,036
You will be, Mom.

897
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:21,829
Hey, aren't you going to say goodbye to Buster?

898
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:25,299
Of course I am. Who's a good dog?
Who's a good doggie?

899
01:27:41,143 --> 01:27:46,407
Get the rest of your things.
- Ok Buster. Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

900
01:27:59,703 --> 01:28:04,994
Hey, Mom. So, do you really think
I should donate these?

901
01:28:04,995 --> 01:28:08,010
It's up to you, Honey.
Whatever you want to do.

902
01:28:34,098 --> 01:28:37,687
Don't go in there! The bakery is haunted!

903
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:41,207
Are you crazy? You'll wake up all the ghosts.

904
01:28:41,451 --> 01:28:43,914
Look out! The ghosts are throwing pies.

905
01:28:46,984 --> 01:28:51,888
Mom!
- Andy?
- Hi.
- Wow, look at you.

906
01:28:51,889 --> 01:28:55,673
I hear you're off to college.
- Yeah, right now actually.

907
01:28:55,734 --> 01:28:59,997
So, what can we do for you?
- Uh, I have some toys here.

908
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:04,527
You hear that, Bonnie?
- So, you're Bonnie?

909
01:29:05,837 --> 01:29:11,001
I'm Andy.
Someone told me you're
really good with toys.

910
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:15,404
These are mine, but I'm going away now ...

911
01:29:15,405 --> 01:29:18,253
So I need someone really special

912
01:29:18,254 --> 01:29:19,883
to play with them.

913
01:29:25,965 --> 01:29:29,787
This is Jessie. The roughest, toughest
cowgirl in the whole west.

914
01:29:29,788 --> 01:29:34,133
She loves "critters", but not more
than her best pal, Bull's-eye.

915
01:29:37,357 --> 01:29:38,509
Here.

916
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:56,589
This is Rex, the meanest, most terrifying
dinosaur who ever lived.

917
01:30:02,661 --> 01:30:08,441
The Potato Heads. Mr. and Mrs.
You gotta keep them together,
because they're madly in love.

918
01:30:09,596 --> 01:30:12,476
Now Slinky here, is as loyal as
any dog you could want ...

919
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:15,801
And Hamm ... he'll keep your money safe ...

920
01:30:15,802 --> 01:30:21,272
but he's also one of the most
dastardly villains of all time
... Evil Doctor Pork Chop.

921
01:30:24,132 --> 01:30:28,908
These little dudes are from a strange
alien world - Pizza planet.

922
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:38,524
And this is Buzz Lightyear,
the coolest toy ever!

923
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:41,745
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers.

924
01:30:41,746 --> 01:30:45,140
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

925
01:30:46,926 --> 01:30:49,426
To infinity and beyond.

926
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:54,456
Now, you gotta promise to take
good care of these guys ...

927
01:30:56,788 --> 01:30:59,908
They mean a lot to me.

928
01:31:04,746 --> 01:31:06,238
My cowboy!

929
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:12,919
Woody? What's he doing in there?

930
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,596
There's a snake in my boot.

931
01:31:17,718 --> 01:31:20,618
There's a snake in my boot.

932
01:31:33,849 --> 01:31:38,850
Now, Woody ... he's been my pal for
as long as I can remember ...

933
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:41,621
He's brave, like a cowboy should be ...

934
01:31:41,888 --> 01:31:47,199
and kind and smart, but the thing
that makes Woody special ...

935
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:51,626
is he'll never give up on you. Ever!

936
01:31:53,327 --> 01:31:57,001
He'll be there for you no matter what.

937
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,804
You think you can take care of him for me?

938
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:04,248
Ok, then.

939
01:32:15,941 --> 01:32:18,996
Oh, no! Doctor Pork Chop is
attacking the haunted bakery!

940
01:32:19,904 --> 01:32:21,707
The ghosts are getting away!
Woody'll stop them!

941
01:32:22,299 --> 01:32:23,294
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

942
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:20,543
Thanks, guys.

943
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:26,383
Look, Mommy!
They're all playing together.

944
01:33:26,389 --> 01:33:28,973
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

945
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:46,087
So long, partner.

946
