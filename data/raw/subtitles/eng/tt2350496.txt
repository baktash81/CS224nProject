1
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,089
It's raining today.

2
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,206
Don't play in the playground.

3
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:16,627
It will be very muddy.

4
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:19,251
If you slip, you'll
break your head.

5
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,211
- Play inside.
- Okay.

6
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:25,880
And don't walk under trees.

7
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,690
One fell nearby yesterday.

8
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,922
And an overpass collapsed,
we saw it on the news.

9
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:34,101
But it has stopped raining.

10
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:37,010
It can always start again.

11
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:39,993
Here he is.

12
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:41,430
Hey!

13
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,599
Wait a minute!

14
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,443
Did you remember all the spices?

15
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,971
No, Auntie, I think
I forgot something.

16
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,274
I knew it! I could
smell it up here!

17
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,024
Here.

18
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,606
Thank you, Auntie.

19
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,964
Just a little bit does it.

20
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,561
Okay.

21
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,354
This new recipe will
do the trick for you.

22
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:39,603
Auntie.

23
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:42,354
I know you're laughing.

24
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:45,428
Don't believe me now.
But one day you'll see.

25
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,635
Mm.

26
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,017
Smells perfect!

27
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:54,066
One bite of that and he'll
build you a Taj Mahal.

28
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,115
The Taj Mahal is a tomb, Auntie.

29
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,878
I know that!

30
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,650
Take it back.

31
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,562
Fernandes. Fernandes,
this is Shaikh.

32
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,450
Shaikh, Mr. Fernandes.

33
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:33,554
Shaikh used to work in Saudi
Arabia as a chief accountant.

34
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:37,042
He will take over your responsibilities
when you leave next month.

35
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,706
Shaikh comes with
very good references.

36
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,819
Very pleased to meet you, sir.

37
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,835
Mr. Shroff speaks
very highly of you.

38
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:47,130
I had him join us early so that you can
train him in all that you do in Claims.

39
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,464
Good luck.

40
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:58,525
Mr. Shroff said you've
been here for 35 years.

41
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:02,490
Your colleagues will
miss you a lot.

42
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,967
How does it feel, sir?

43
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:11,965
I mean, your golden years are
about to start. How does it feel?

44
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,994
- Oh, fantastic.
- Fantastic.

45
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,813
Can we start the training?

46
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,361
Sure.

47
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,708
But it's lunchtime right now.

48
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,810
You come at 4:45.

49
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,316
Four forty-five, 4:45.

50
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,218
Okay, sir, no problem.
I'll come later then.

51
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,659
Thank you very much, sir.
Nice to meet you.

52
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,250
<i>In today's class the recipe is</i>

53
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,482
<i>the all-time favorite
Paneer Do Pyaza.</i>

54
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,733
Auntie.

55
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,845
Auntie.

56
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,498
- Are you asleep?
- What happened?

57
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,738
Auntie, the lunchbox is back.

58
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:44,437
So? Go on.

59
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,514
It's completely empty.

60
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,954
Completely?

61
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,467
Yes!

62
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,278
It's like he's licked it clean!

63
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,666
What did I tell you?

64
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,290
This is just the beginning.

65
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,923
Oh.

66
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,882
Auntie, turn the tape
off. Rajeev is back.

67
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,428
Okay.

68
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,817
Good, you came back early.

69
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,882
How was lunch today?

70
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:30,166
It was good.

71
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,274
Um...

72
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,558
Just good?

73
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,797
Good, as usual.

74
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:44,914
You sent the lunchbox back empty

75
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:46,677
so I thought...

76
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:50,195
Your cauliflower was really good.

77
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,412
It was very good.

78
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,706
Hello. Ah.

79
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,666
Just reached home.

80
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,124
I was waiting for your update.

81
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,956
Okay.

82
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,103
Oh. Oh-ho. Was it so boring?

83
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,203
What can you do?

84
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,472
Auntie?

85
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,599
Auntie.

86
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,405
What happened now, sir?

87
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,929
I'm retiring next month.

88
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,361
I'll be canceling the
lunchbox service.

89
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,282
Okay, sir. I'll make a note of it.

90
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,452
I'll settle up at the
end of the month.

91
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,233
Okay, sir. No problem.

92
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,615
Fine.

93
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,217
And...

94
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,711
Who made the lunch today?

95
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:10,450
We did, sir. Why?

96
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,028
The food was good!

97
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:16,053
- What?
- It was good, very good.

98
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:18,716
Maintain the same standard. Okay?

99
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,322
What's with him today?

100
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,146
The cauliflower did it for us!

101
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:29,970
Let's make it again tomorrow.

102
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,668
Here, serve this.

103
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,914
Hey, hey.

104
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,592
What is this?

105
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,634
Mr. Fernandes, a ball
went inside your balcony.

106
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,073
Please, can we have it?

107
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,706
Please, sir?

108
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,737
- Do I look like your servant?
- No.

109
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:05,682
Please. We'll not play here.
We'll play on another side.

110
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:09,715
If you play in front of this door again,
I'll chase you down in the street.

111
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:15,538
- Please. Please.
- Sir, we'll play on the other side.

112
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,295
Mr. Fernandes, please. Sorry.

113
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,500
Huh?

114
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,330
Ila!

115
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,875
Oh, Ila.

116
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:53,938
Ila.

117
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,410
Yes, Auntie, I'm here.

118
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:58,450
- Did you call out to me earlier?
- Yes.

119
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,826
I was changing Uncle's diaper.

120
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,572
What did Rajeev say?

121
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,322
Nothing.

122
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,541
What?

123
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,635
Auntie, the lunchbox
went to someone else.

124
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,065
I don't think Rajeev got it.

125
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,650
It went to someone else who
liked it and finished it.

126
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:22,556
But the delivery men
never make a mistake.

127
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,915
What is it?

128
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,850
Good morning, sir. How are you?

129
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,363
Good morning.

130
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,258
Sir, I came by yesterday.
You were not to be seen.

131
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,049
I was right here. You were late.

132
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,562
I was here at 4.45.

133
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,378
I was here. You were late.

134
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,491
No problem, sir.

135
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,796
Are these Claims files, sir?

136
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,973
This is the Claims Department.

137
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,841
Uh... Uh...

138
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,900
When do we start the training, sir?

139
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,593
Let's do it.

140
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,281
Definitely, sir?

141
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:17,012
Let's do it after lunch.

142
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,370
- I'll come back then.
- Yes, come back.

143
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,257
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes.

144
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:24,087
You'll definitely be here?

145
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,644
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

146
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:58,833
<i>Thank you for sending
back an empty lunchbox.</i>

147
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,104
<i>I had made that food
for my husband.</i>

148
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,123
<i>And when it came back empty, I thought
he would say something to me.</i>

149
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:11,732
<i>For a few hours, I thought the way to
the heart is really through the stomach.</i>

150
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,425
<i>In return for those hours,</i>

151
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,004
<i>I am sending you Paneer.</i>

152
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,984
<i>My husband's favorite.</i>

153
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:19,477
<i>Ila.</i>

154
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:25,522
Auntie, this letter
business is strange.

155
00:21:25,522 --> 00:21:28,093
Ila, you owe a thank you.

156
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,473
What happens if this
goes to Rajeev?

157
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,106
So good.

158
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:36,529
Rajeev ate someone else's food
yesterday and didn't notice.

159
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,522
Let him notice today.

160
00:21:42,642 --> 00:21:44,370
Should I write something else?

161
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,482
No. Keep it short!

162
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,068
Auntie!

163
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,881
Auntie.

164
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:14,034
Are you asleep?

165
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,185
What happened?

166
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:16,465
Auntie.

167
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,033
The lunchbox has come back.

168
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,019
It's empty again, but with a reply.

169
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,089
- A reply?
- Yes.

170
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,657
What does it say?

171
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,961
And it's not in
Rajeev's handwriting.

172
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,529
Read it!

173
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,721
Uh... "Dear, Ila, the food
was very salty today."

174
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,065
What else does it say?

175
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,561
"Dear, Ila, the food
was very salty today."

176
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:39,281
What? No "Thank you," no "Hello"?

177
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:41,778
"Dear Ila, the food was
very salty today."

178
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,121
Who does he think he is?

179
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:46,129
He empties the lunchbox
and then complains!

180
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,740
Wait a minute.

181
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:52,210
Here, use this.

182
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:55,319
No, I don't like all this.

183
00:22:55,346 --> 00:22:59,441
I'll tell the delivery man the box
is going to the wrong address.

184
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,533
He should've thanked you!

185
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,433
No, I really don't like this.

186
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:06,546
Why? It's not like you know him.

187
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:22,267
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

188
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:23,989
Good.

189
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:32,403
I couldn't find you at
your desk, so I came here.

190
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,428
You were reading in the canteen,
so I didn't want to disturb.

191
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,777
Your lunchbox has an amazing aroma.

192
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:49,243
I could taste the food
without eating it!

193
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,286
Your wife, sir,

194
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,196
she has magic in her hands.

195
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,560
My wife is dead.

196
00:26:59,442 --> 00:27:02,737
<i>Dear Ila, the salt was fine today.</i>

197
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:05,553
<i>The chili was a bit
on the higher side.</i>

198
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,569
<i>But I had two bananas after lunch.</i>

199
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,140
<i>They helped to extinguish
the fire in my mouth.</i>

200
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:13,905
<i>And I think it'll also
be good for the motions.</i>

201
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:23,157
<i>There are so many people in this city
who eat only a banana or two for lunch.</i>

202
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,936
<i>It's cheap and it fills you up.</i>

203
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,056
<i>Hello.</i>

204
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:51,291
<i>My husband came home
late last night.</i>

205
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,329
<i>He didn't say a word.</i>

206
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:01,020
<i>This morning he went to work.
My daughter went to school.</i>

207
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:05,048
<i>And I started cooking
with Deshpande Auntie.</i>

208
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:08,859
<i>She lives in the flat above us.</i>

209
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,403
<i>Her husband has been in a
coma for the last 15 years.</i>

210
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:16,794
<i>One day he woke up and started
staring at the ceiling fan.</i>

211
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:19,473
<i>Since then he does just that.</i>

212
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,001
<i>He stares at the fan all day</i>

213
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,929
<i>and falls asleep at night.</i>

214
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:27,569
<i>In the morning he wakes up
and stares at the fan again.</i>

215
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,297
<i>He doesn't say anything.</i>

216
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,738
<i>This has been going
on for 15 years.</i>

217
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:34,556
<i>Even the doctors
have lost hope now.</i>

218
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:38,041
<i>It's an old "Orient" model fan.</i>

219
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:40,507
<i>It is never switched off.</i>

220
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,363
<i>Auntie thinks that the
fan keeps him alive.</i>

221
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,083
<i>One day the power went off.</i>

222
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,019
<i>And so did the fan.
Uncle's heartbeat slowed.</i>

223
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:55,099
<i>Luckily the power came back on.</i>

224
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:02,935
<i>After that, Deshpande Auntie
had a generator installed.</i>

225
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,812
<i>Deshpande Uncle stares at the fan.</i>

226
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:08,912
<i>My husband stares at his phone.</i>

227
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,491
<i>As if nothing else exists.</i>

228
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:14,170
<i>Maybe nothing else does...</i>

229
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:20,052
What do we live for?

230
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,014
Madam.

231
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:35,088
<i>Dear Ila, your husband
sounds like a busy man.</i>

232
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,297
<i>Life is very busy these days.</i>

233
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:41,625
<i>There are too many people, and
everyone wants what the other has.</i>

234
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:46,769
<i>Years ago, you could find a place to
sit in the train every now and then,</i>

235
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>but these days, it's difficult.</i>

236
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:51,089
<i>If Mr. Deshpande wakes up now,</i>

237
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,482
<i>he will see the difference and probably
go back to his Orient ceiling fan.</i>

238
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:00,602
<i>When my wife died, she got
a horizontal burial plot.</i>

239
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:03,921
<i>I tried to buy a burial plot
for myself the other day,</i>

240
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:07,185
<i>and what they offered
me was a vertical one.</i>

241
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:10,161
<i>I've spent my whole life
standing in trains and buses,</i>

242
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,853
<i>now I'll have to stand
even when I'm dead.</i>

243
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,817
<i>Why don't you have another child?</i>

244
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,450
<i>Sometimes having a child
can help a marriage.</i>

245
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,958
<i>Rajeev?</i>

246
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:46,259
<i>How is this?</i>

247
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,732
It's nice.

248
00:30:49,906 --> 00:30:52,018
You forgot.

249
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:57,019
The last time I wore this
was for our honeymoon.

250
00:30:57,682 --> 00:31:01,976
I thought I'd try it today and
see if it needed altering.

251
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,457
But look. It fits perfectly.

252
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,800
- Doesn't it?
- Yes.

253
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,529
In fact, it's loose.

254
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,554
Yes, it looks good.

255
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,569
After our honeymoon, we had no
idea that Yashvi was on the way.

256
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,977
We didn't find out for a while.

257
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,854
We didn't find out for two months!

258
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:44,025
We didn't have much then.

259
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:46,650
Mm.

260
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:49,941
When she arrived, our luck turned.

261
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,228
These days things are so
expensive, luck is not enough.

262
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,201
And why do you make
cauliflower every day?

263
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:58,932
Did you buy it in bulk?

264
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:12,336
Rajeev.

265
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,784
Mm-hm?

266
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,457
What if Yashvi had a
little brother or sister?

267
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,068
You had a brother.

268
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,074
And he...

269
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:30,842
Please don't make cauliflower
every day, it gives me gas.

270
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,656
Hm?

271
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,760
Rickshaw, bus, airplane...

272
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:34,550
Everything gets stuck
in Mumbai traffic.

273
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,433
This road has been
jammed for hours.

274
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:41,521
You see that building?
That tall tower.

275
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:45,877
A woman jumped off along with
her little girl this morning.

276
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,617
Jumped with her little girl?

277
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,119
Yes, she jumped.

278
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:54,932
What was her name?

279
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:58,834
How would I know, sir?
I'm not related to her.

280
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,795
Must be family problems.

281
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,090
Do you know someone
in that building?

282
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,210
Is she completely dead?

283
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:38,614
<i>Hello.</i>

284
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:41,104
<i>This morning, my
husband went to work...</i>

285
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,697
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

286
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,583
I'm busy, actually.

287
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,456
What about the training?

288
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:51,249
This is lunch time.

289
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,013
Please come back later.

290
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:03,771
Everybody told me not to
expect anything from you.

291
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:12,594
My name is Aslam Shaikh.
I am an orphan.

292
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,116
I gave myself this name.

293
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,600
I've taught myself
everything I know.

294
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,584
And I will teach myself
this job too. That's all.

295
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:23,577
Thank you very much.

296
00:36:24,338 --> 00:36:25,556
Listen.

297
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,078
Come here.

298
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,408
You go to my desk.

299
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:42,481
There are files from
the Ahmedabad sector.

300
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:46,395
Calculate the amounts, prepare the pay
orders, and send them to Accounts.

301
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:48,689
Thank you very much, sir.

302
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,288
Okay.

303
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:52,017
Thank you so much, sir.

304
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:54,032
Sir, I'll be right back.

305
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:56,048
No, don't come back. You go work.

306
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,200
Yes, sir.

307
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,931
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay.

308
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:07,130
<i>This morning, my husband went
to work and Yashvi to school.</i>

309
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:10,747
<i>I switched on the
radio, the news was on.</i>

310
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:14,480
<i>When my brother died,
everyone said the same thing:</i>

311
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,408
<i>"He should have had courage.</i>

312
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:19,195
<i>So what if he failed his exams?</i>

313
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:21,394
<i>He should have had courage."</i>

314
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,885
<i>What went through
that woman's mind?</i>

315
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:29,401
<i>Perhaps she took off
all her jewelry.</i>

316
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:32,211
<i>Bracelets, earrings,</i>

317
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:34,578
<i>her wedding necklace.</i>

318
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:38,224
<i>What did her daughter
ask on the way?</i>

319
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,086
Mom, what are we going to play?

320
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,380
<i>It must have been so
difficult to get to the roof.</i>

321
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:54,999
<i>Doesn't it take courage to
jump from tall buildings?</i>

322
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:04,208
<i>Dear Ila, please don't
think like that.</i>

323
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:07,184
<i>Things are never as
bad as they seem.</i>

324
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,480
<i>One day I was on the
train on my way to work.</i>

325
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:12,986
<i>And then suddenly I felt something.</i>

326
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,632
<i>Someone touching me.</i>

327
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:17,745
<i>Down there.</i>

328
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,233
Are you laughing?

329
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:08,857
Yes, Auntie.

330
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,600
I just remembered a joke.

331
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,360
Tell me the joke!

332
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,736
I forgot.

333
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:16,720
- You forgot?
- Yes.

334
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,408
Soak five almonds in
water every night

335
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:21,456
and eat them in the morning.

336
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:23,312
It's a tonic for memory.

337
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:25,174
I will right away, Auntie.

338
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,954
How are you, sir?

339
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,352
Going to the station?

340
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,734
Yes.

341
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:39,163
I get off at Bombay Central.

342
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:41,747
I live in Dongri.

343
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:44,336
- And you, sir?
- I live in Bandra.

344
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,997
Sir, can I ask you a question?

345
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,917
Yes.

346
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,259
People in the office say...

347
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:10,294
You were walking and kicked a cat.

348
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,864
It got hit by a bus,

349
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:18,096
and you just went on your
way. Didn't even look back.

350
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,675
Is this true, sir?

351
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:24,624
Actually, it wasn't a cat.
It was a blind man.

352
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,603
He asked for directions so I pushed
him, and he got hit by a bus.

353
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,967
You better be careful.

354
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,316
Thank you.

355
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,115
Give me a cigarette.

356
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:50,737
- I'll pay you later.
- Okay.

357
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,274
You're joking, right?

358
00:40:57,777 --> 00:41:00,828
Have you always lived in Bandra?

359
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:04,593
Yes, always.

360
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:08,185
I keep moving around.

361
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:11,312
First I was at Muhammad Ali Road,

362
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:13,040
then I went to Dubai,

363
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:14,935
then to Saudi Arabia.

364
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:18,064
I used to keep going back
and forth from Saudi,

365
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:22,098
but once I met Meherunissa
I never went back.

366
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,520
I cut the vegetables here,

367
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:28,720
so when I get home I can
just throw them in the pan.

368
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:31,412
Where did you learn to cut
vegetables like that?

369
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,069
I worked in a hotel in Saudi.

370
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:35,824
- A hotel?
- Yes.

371
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:40,337
Cooking, room service,
cleaning, accounts.

372
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:41,883
All in one.

373
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,816
It's dry in Saudi.

374
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:47,216
There's no such thing
as entertainment there.

375
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,328
You pray, you work,
you pray, you work.

376
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:52,272
And nothing else. Here
I get some free time.

377
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:55,472
Now I cook and wait
for Meherunissa.

378
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:57,880
She comes back in the evening.

379
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,304
We eat, then go for a walk.

380
00:42:00,305 --> 00:42:02,395
Very good.

381
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:07,922
But I love her, sir.
No matter what.

382
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:11,444
What do you do in the evenings?

383
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:15,832
I watch TV...

384
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,297
sometimes...

385
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:28,793
Sir, come with me.

386
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,322
- Where?
- My house.

387
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:35,612
I'll make pasandas for you.

388
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:37,840
- What?
- Pasanda.

389
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:41,456
- What is that?
- It's a special lamb dish

390
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:44,443
that you chop like this.

391
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:47,060
- A lamb dish?
- Yes, sir.

392
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:48,986
And I'm a specialist.

393
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:50,480
Yes, I'll come.

394
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,208
- Come now.
- Today?

395
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:53,874
Please come now!

396
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:57,456
I have some important work at home

397
00:42:57,457 --> 00:43:00,784
but I'll come next time.

398
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,608
- For sure next time?
- Yes.

399
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:04,016
Promise?

400
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:05,712
I'll be expecting you.

401
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:07,376
I'll come next time.

402
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,541
- Okay, sir. See you, bye.
- Bye-bye.

403
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:56,147
<i>Hello.</i>

404
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:58,640
<i>My husband came
home late last night.</i>

405
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,982
<i>He got a call and
went back to work.</i>

406
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,995
<i>Yashvi fell asleep.</i>

407
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:07,705
<i>When I got married, I took some
things without telling my mother.</i>

408
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:10,928
<i>Among those things I
found an old diary.</i>

409
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:15,728
<i>Grandma wrote all her recipes in it.
I found one for spring apples.</i>

410
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:17,558
<i>Spring apples are in season.</i>

411
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:20,852
<i>I think you will like it.</i>

412
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:23,514
Excellent.

413
00:44:23,825 --> 00:44:25,206
How are you, sir?

414
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:26,897
Can I sit?

415
00:44:27,761 --> 00:44:29,142
Sit.

416
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:31,475
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

417
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:34,484
Thank you very much.

418
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:38,581
Here.

419
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:40,436
Try.

420
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:42,039
Sure?

421
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:43,893
Yeah.

422
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:06,841
What happened?

423
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:12,047
- Who made this?
- Why?

424
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:16,408
A restaurant near my house.

425
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:18,421
Why?

426
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:20,628
It's great.

427
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:24,757
Just great. Sir, book a
lunchbox for me as well.

428
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,960
It's shutting down soon.

429
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:28,855
But it has such great food!

430
00:45:29,777 --> 00:45:32,631
There's no value for
talent in this country.

431
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:39,099
You're right, sir, talent has
no value in this country.

432
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:41,199
You need magic in the hands.

433
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,633
Anyone can make food
but you need magic.

434
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:03,344
<i>Dear Ila, your grandmother's
recipe was very good.</i>

435
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:06,063
<i>Even better than my
favorite aubergines.</i>

436
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:09,235
<i>Yesterday even I found
something from many years ago.</i>

437
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:13,430
<i>I found old TV shows that
my wife used to record.</i>

438
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:18,616
<i>You must have been a child when they
played on TV, or not even born yet.</i>

439
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:26,896
<i>My wife used to love them.</i>

440
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:29,903
<i>I don't know why I
wanted to see them.</i>

441
00:46:29,904 --> 00:46:31,888
<i>I watched them for hours.</i>

442
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:37,431
<i>I went through them show by
show, episode by episode.</i>

443
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,360
<i>And then finally, after
staying up all night,</i>

444
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:44,150
<i>I realized what it was
that I was looking for.</i>

445
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,664
<i>Every Sunday when she
watched the shows,</i>

446
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:51,152
<i>I was outside repairing my
bicycle or just smoking.</i>

447
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:55,184
<i>Andi would glance through the window
every now and then just for a second,</i>

448
00:46:55,185 --> 00:46:58,288
<i>and I would see her
reflection on the TV screen.</i>

449
00:46:58,289 --> 00:46:59,792
<i>Laughing.</i>

450
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:02,480
<i>Laughing at the same
jokes over and over.</i>

451
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:05,848
<i>Each time as if she was hearing
it for the very first time.</i>

452
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,690
<i>I wish I had kept on
looking back then.</i>

453
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,141
I sent all the pay orders, sir.

454
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:31,675
An apple and a banana for you.

455
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,216
Okay. Have.

456
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:36,467
No, sir.

457
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:38,581
No, have.

458
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:40,591
Have.

459
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:41,777
Okay, sir.

460
00:47:48,176 --> 00:47:51,827
- What is this?
- Sir, uh, paper.

461
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,646
Could I have some water please?

462
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:08,624
- How is it? Good?
- Mm. I love this.

463
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,316
Yeah. Thank you.

464
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:20,342
Nowadays everyone
uses e-mail, not paper.

465
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,574
- What paper?
- The letter.

466
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:26,518
We are in the era of e-mail.

467
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,298
<i>Hello.</i>

468
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:36,821
<i>My mother loves the old TV shows.</i>

469
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,593
<i>When I was little I would watch
them with her for hours.</i>

470
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:43,187
<i>I wanted to tell you something.</i>

471
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,326
<i>Every cigarette takes five
minutes off your life.</i>

472
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:48,504
<i>My father has lung cancer.</i>

473
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:50,864
<i>When the pain is too much,</i>

474
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:53,752
<i>he says he should have smoked more</i>

475
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:56,505
<i>to avoid going through all this.</i>

476
00:48:57,296 --> 00:48:58,742
<i>Don't mind.</i>

477
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,634
Oh, Ila.

478
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:49,716
Yes, Auntie.

479
00:49:50,065 --> 00:49:51,856
Did you get my carrots?

480
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:54,264
Yes, here they are.

481
00:49:55,185 --> 00:49:56,501
Here!

482
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,763
They only cost 10 rupees.

483
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,000
What else did you get?

484
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:06,770
The usual things, Auntie.

485
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:12,208
<i>What's the other name
for "aubergine"?</i>

486
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,839
<i>"Eggplant."</i>

487
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,037
<i>It's vegetarian, so how come
it has "egg" in its name?</i>

488
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:20,816
<i>He's on new medicine these days.</i>

489
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:22,547
It helps,

490
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,976
but he sleeps all day.

491
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,931
Ma, where is the TV?

492
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:35,095
There are no good programs
on TV these days.

493
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,840
Do you need some money?

494
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:43,931
We're doing okay, child.

495
00:51:45,872 --> 00:51:48,752
This new medicine
seems very expensive.

496
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:52,785
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

497
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:54,904
How?

498
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:56,881
Where will you get the money?

499
00:52:01,712 --> 00:52:05,625
If my son were alive, I wouldn't
have to ask anyone for money.

500
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:14,385
- I'll talk to Rajeev.
- No, no! There is no need.

501
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:20,913
I'll arrange for
about 5,000 for now.

502
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:22,895
We're the girl's side.

503
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:26,166
Does it look nice? Asking
for money all the time?

504
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,023
It's fine, you can
pay it back slowly.

505
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:32,438
No.

506
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:35,700
I have some money.

507
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:39,347
I can handle it.

508
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,756
Okay, fine.

509
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,578
But don't tell your father.

510
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,964
The 5,000 should cover
the cost of the medicine

511
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,918
for this month.

512
00:52:57,904 --> 00:53:00,115
Next month something will turn up.

513
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,127
Do you want to see him?
Shall I wake him?

514
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,023
It's late, we should go home.

515
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,307
Okay.

516
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:10,746
<i>Dear Ila, you won't believe
what happened to me yesterday.</i>

517
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:15,887
<i>In the evening, as I was walking
to the station with Shaikh...</i>

518
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:18,799
<i>Shaikh and I, we work together.</i>

519
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,971
<i>I felt like stopping to
look at a painter's works.</i>

520
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,242
<i>All his paintings are
exactly the same.</i>

521
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,399
<i>But when you look
close, real close,</i>

522
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,528
<i>you can see that they are different.
Each slightly different from the other.</i>

523
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:36,527
<i>A different car here, a different
man daydreaming on the bus there.</i>

524
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:38,831
<i>A stray dog gallantly
crossing the street.</i>

525
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:41,556
<i>Whatever catches the
painter's fancy on that day.</i>

526
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:46,100
<i>And in one of them, I saw myself.</i>

527
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,040
<i>At least I think it's me.</i>

528
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:53,078
<i>And then I treated myself
to an auto rickshaw.</i>

529
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:58,640
<i>The old houses of boys I used to play
with when I was a child are gone now.</i>

530
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,884
<i>My old school too.</i>

531
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:04,886
<i>But some things are still the same.</i>

532
00:55:05,617 --> 00:55:07,983
<i>The old post office... Still there.</i>

533
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:13,817
<i>And the hospital where I was born and
where my parents died. And my wife.</i>

534
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:20,889
<i>I think we forget things if we
have no one to tell them to.</i>

535
00:55:21,808 --> 00:55:23,504
Did you say something, sir?

536
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:24,655
What?

537
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:26,386
Did you say something?

538
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:27,634
No.

539
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:44,560
What are you playing?

540
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:46,554
Blind Man's Bluff.

541
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,847
Can I tell you what
we used to play?

542
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,159
What?

543
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,476
Look.

544
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,127
Let's untie this first.

545
00:55:58,128 --> 00:55:59,858
Should I do it?

546
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,192
I'll do it.

547
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:09,332
We used to play house.

548
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:12,815
- Ah-uh.
- Mm.

549
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,579
This was the baby.

550
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,596
I was the father.

551
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:20,089
And your uncle used
to play the mother,

552
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,170
my wife.

553
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,926
<i>Hello.</i>

554
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,415
<i>I want to tell you something.</i>

555
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,626
<i>My husband is having an affair.</i>

556
00:57:20,912 --> 00:57:25,043
<i>I thought I should confront him,
but I don't have the courage.</i>

557
00:57:25,232 --> 00:57:26,994
<i>Where would I go?</i>

558
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,973
<i>There is one place.</i>

559
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:34,256
<i>My daughter learned in school
that in Bhutan everyone is happy.</i>

560
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:38,868
<i>They don't have Gross Domestic Product,
only Gross National Happiness.</i>

561
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,271
<i>What if we had that here?</i>

562
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:26,393
Madam.

563
00:58:59,376 --> 00:59:02,295
You look very
distracted today, sir.

564
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,094
- Did I do anything wrong?
- No.

565
00:59:12,624 --> 00:59:14,575
Tell me something, Shaikh.

566
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:15,727
Yes, sir.

567
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:19,119
Have you ever been to Bhutan?

568
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,435
Bhutan?

569
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:26,326
I was thinking instead of Nasik,
I could settle in Bhutan.

570
00:59:27,728 --> 00:59:29,786
I've only been to Saudi.

571
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:32,335
Bhutan is good as well.

572
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:36,729
The economy is down there,
one rupee here is five there.

573
00:59:37,328 --> 00:59:39,091
So one can go there.

574
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:43,674
My mother always used to say...

575
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,615
Always says:

576
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:49,234
"Sometimes the wrong train will
get you to the right station."

577
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:52,914
Your mother says?

578
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,247
But you told me you were an orphan.

579
00:59:59,248 --> 01:00:00,825
I am, sir,

580
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:04,847
but when I say "my mother always
says" people take it more seriously.

581
01:00:04,848 --> 01:00:06,709
And it feels good.

582
01:00:14,288 --> 01:00:15,473
Right.

583
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,163
<i>You are listening
to Radio Bhutan...</i>

584
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:05,455
<i>How can we go to Bhutan together?</i>

585
01:01:05,456 --> 01:01:07,601
<i>I don't even know your name.</i>

586
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:22,129
How are you, sir?

587
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:32,436
A banana and apple.

588
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:36,820
Here, try this.

589
01:01:37,776 --> 01:01:39,407
Here, taste this.

590
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:42,158
You are glowing today, sir.

591
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:44,184
What is it?

592
01:01:47,696 --> 01:01:51,281
You look 10 years younger.

593
01:01:59,056 --> 01:02:01,364
Your mother says:

594
01:02:02,768 --> 01:02:05,775
"The wrong train will get
you to the right station."

595
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,686
Mother is always right, sir.

596
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:11,640
- How is it?
- I love this.

597
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:15,155
- Variety.
- Variety, sir.

598
01:02:29,103 --> 01:02:30,714
Auntie.

599
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,055
Auntie.

600
01:02:35,056 --> 01:02:36,754
Yes, what?

601
01:02:37,616 --> 01:02:40,208
Auntie...

602
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:43,183
Do you have a tape of
that movie <i>Saajan</i>?

603
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:46,006
Yes, why?

604
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,170
The songs were good, right?

605
01:02:49,776 --> 01:02:51,637
They're okay.

606
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,912
Could we listen to it?

607
01:02:57,328 --> 01:02:58,808
Now?

608
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,967
Yes.

609
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:03,633
Can you play it?

610
01:03:04,944 --> 01:03:06,521
I'll play it.

611
01:04:11,823 --> 01:04:13,336
<i>Hello.</i>

612
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,047
<i>Yesterday, Auntie played this tape</i>

613
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:19,186
<i>of the movie Saajan.
A strange coincidence.</i>

614
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:22,478
<i>She has every Hindi
movie audio tape,</i>

615
01:04:22,479 --> 01:04:25,432
<i>she doesn't have a
CD or Mp3 player.</i>

616
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,726
<i>She keeps the cassette
industry alive all by herself.</i>

617
01:04:29,424 --> 01:04:31,416
<i>You must be trying to figure out</i>

618
01:04:31,696 --> 01:04:34,201
<i>what I scratched out.</i>

619
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:38,773
<i>Isn't it odd to keep
writing like this?</i>

620
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:43,192
<i>We can write anything in a
letter, it's very easy.</i>

621
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,392
<i>But this,</i>

622
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,732
<i>I can tell you only in person.</i>

623
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,442
<i>I think it's time for us to meet.</i>

624
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,407
<i>Do you know the Kooler Café</i>

625
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:56,920
<i>in Matunga?</i>

626
01:04:57,488 --> 01:05:00,244
<i>I've heard they have
very good kheema pao.</i>

627
01:05:00,752 --> 01:05:02,127
<i>My favorite.</i>

628
01:05:02,128 --> 01:05:03,858
<i>Shall we meet tomorrow?</i>

629
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:05,394
<i>At 1:00?</i>

630
01:05:06,128 --> 01:05:07,673
<i>Ila.</i>

631
01:06:02,704 --> 01:06:03,855
What?

632
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:05,815
The boss wants to see you.

633
01:06:06,288 --> 01:06:07,886
Yes, I'll come after lunch.

634
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:09,465
It's urgent.

635
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:13,170
Okay, I'll come.

636
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:29,327
May I come in, sir?

637
01:06:29,328 --> 01:06:31,090
Come in.

638
01:06:46,895 --> 01:06:49,815
I just had a meeting with
the Accounts Department.

639
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:53,338
And it was the most embarrassing
meeting of my life.

640
01:06:54,575 --> 01:06:56,633
You know what they said?

641
01:06:57,455 --> 01:07:02,393
They said, "it's as if our Claims
Department does not exist."

642
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:06,958
All the pay orders are wrong.

643
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:10,065
Shaikh's initials are
all over the place.

644
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,195
And to think that I was going
to have this man replace you.

645
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:19,794
I need you to review this.

646
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:23,441
Stay up all night if
necessary, but fix it.

647
01:07:24,143 --> 01:07:27,150
And as for you, Shaikh, just
get out of my sight. Please.

648
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:29,045
It's my mistake, sir.

649
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,897
I made the pay orders.

650
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:36,085
I asked his initials
because we work together.

651
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,999
It's my mistake.

652
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,375
Fernandes,

653
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:42,841
- you don't have to defend him.
- I'm not defending anyone, sir.

654
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,538
Thirty-five years of service.

655
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,323
And you have not made
one single mistake.

656
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:53,497
You know I would not
defend anyone, sir.

657
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,719
Anyway,

658
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,326
I'll handle the
Accounts Department.

659
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,378
- Okay?
- It's okay, sir, no problem.

660
01:08:07,856 --> 01:08:13,209
One more thing. Why do these
files all smell of vegetables?

661
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:18,606
- Onions, potatoes, even garlic.
- Really?

662
01:08:18,607 --> 01:08:21,178
Smell it. Smell it.

663
01:08:23,024 --> 01:08:24,754
I don't...

664
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,591
Sorry, sir, you saved me today.

665
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:53,774
Thank you, sir, you saved me.

666
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:57,240
Don't you ever cut your bloody
vegetables on the office files.

667
01:08:58,575 --> 01:09:00,088
Sorry, sir.

668
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:02,128
Next time,

669
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,515
I'll put a plastic bag over the files.
And then cut the vegetables.

670
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:09,742
I'm sorry, sir.

671
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:12,527
I'm sorry, sir, no
vegetables. Nothing.

672
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:14,040
I'm sorry, sir.

673
01:09:16,463 --> 01:09:18,703
This isn't some cheap
restaurant in Saudi!

674
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:20,238
These are government files!

675
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,620
Do you understand?

676
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,138
If you cannot do this, get lost!

677
01:09:30,031 --> 01:09:32,755
Why should I get lost?

678
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,731
You will teach me.

679
01:09:36,688 --> 01:09:38,963
I am sorry, sir, but
you will teach me!

680
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:48,079
Did your mother also tell you
to forge a degree to get a job?

681
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:54,585
She must have gotten confused.

682
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:58,677
What kind of a person
you are, Mr. Shaikh?

683
01:09:58,703 --> 01:10:00,117
Huh?

684
01:10:05,136 --> 01:10:07,407
Why don't you come
over for dinner, sir?

685
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:09,135
Sir, please.

686
01:10:09,136 --> 01:10:11,160
I've made pasandas.

687
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:13,711
Sir, please.

688
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:22,325
Unbelievable, Mr. Shaikh.

689
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:25,301
Unbelievable.

690
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:31,252
Pasanda, he says.

691
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:37,045
You'll come, right?

692
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,164
- Sir, have more pasandas.
- No, no, no. Uh...

693
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:44,239
It's very good.

694
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,126
It's my recipe, sir.

695
01:10:47,599 --> 01:10:50,478
"Don't marry him, he'll
chain you to the stove."

696
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,822
Her father is a very dangerous man.

697
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,862
Last time he smiled

698
01:10:54,863 --> 01:10:57,774
was during the 1984 World Cup.

699
01:10:57,775 --> 01:11:00,466
Just a little bit.

700
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:04,594
He's a sour face.

701
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,310
Sir, what does your wife do?

702
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:12,692
Be quiet.

703
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:15,278
I'm sorry, sir, she doesn't know.

704
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:16,725
It's okay.

705
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,872
My wife has passed away.

706
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,690
But I have a girlfriend.

707
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:36,244
You?

708
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:39,472
Yes.

709
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:48,278
What is her name?

710
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:01,460
Ila.

711
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,222
I knew it, sir!

712
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:09,135
The lunchbox, the notes...

713
01:12:09,136 --> 01:12:11,438
When did you get married?

714
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:16,214
Marriage, sir... Sometimes
it feels like 35 years.

715
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,462
Sometimes 25, or 10, and sometimes
it feels like it was yesterday.

716
01:12:23,727 --> 01:12:27,957
Sir, you're not eating,
have some more.

717
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,422
It's my recipe, sir.

718
01:12:29,423 --> 01:12:31,278
I really don't want it.

719
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,042
You're not eating at all.

720
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,959
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

721
01:12:40,143 --> 01:12:41,873
Go ahead.

722
01:12:44,015 --> 01:12:47,317
You asked just now
when we got married.

723
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:51,758
Actually,

724
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:53,751
her father said no.

725
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:58,543
He said: "The boy is an orphan,
short and dark-skinned."

726
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:06,834
So Meherunissa ran away from home.

727
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,967
But she doesn't want to get married
without her father's blessing.

728
01:13:16,879 --> 01:13:18,542
I won't tell anyone.

729
01:13:18,543 --> 01:13:20,273
No. It's not that.

730
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:22,801
Her father has agreed now.

731
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,910
We are getting married soon.

732
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:34,350
There'll be an army from
her side at the wedding.

733
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:37,554
Brothers and sisters,
their husbands, children,

734
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:41,880
uncles, aunts, everyone
will be there.

735
01:13:42,383 --> 01:13:45,401
And there is no one from my side.

736
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:49,071
I'm alone.

737
01:13:50,063 --> 01:13:52,306
I wanted to ask, if
you wouldn't mind,

738
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:57,298
being the witness from my side.

739
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:58,832
My "guardian."

740
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,424
Me?

741
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:04,409
Yes, and if Madam
Ila can come too...

742
01:14:08,815 --> 01:14:10,448
Of course.

743
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:14,798
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

744
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:16,823
Thank you so much, sir.

745
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,857
Her father insists on
giving me a scooter.

746
01:14:20,975 --> 01:14:22,902
As a gift for my promotion.

747
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,621
But I'm not retiring.

748
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:28,592
I was thinking

749
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,409
of not taking early retirement.

750
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:33,102
Uh...

751
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:36,819
I'll ask the boss to
make you my assistant.

752
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:38,900
So your promotion...

753
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,695
That's good news, sir!

754
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,833
I mean, great news!

755
01:14:49,711 --> 01:14:53,198
Don't mention it to my father-in-law,
he'll take the scooter back.

756
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,377
- Ha, ha.
- Sir, please.

757
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:58,254
I'll tell Meherunissa
the good news.

758
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:02,168
Thank you very much, sir.

759
01:16:28,879 --> 01:16:30,838
Uncle, would you like to sit?

760
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,339
Who, me?

761
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:34,446
Yes, Uncle, would you like to sit?

762
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:35,698
No.

763
01:16:36,303 --> 01:16:38,994
Please, I'm getting off
at the next station.

764
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,054
Fernandes.

765
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,592
- Yes, sir.
- You wanted to talk to me?

766
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:11,315
No, sir.

767
01:17:11,663 --> 01:17:14,201
My secretary said you
wanted to talk to me.

768
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,597
It was about pay orders.

769
01:17:17,647 --> 01:17:19,574
What about the pay orders?

770
01:17:19,759 --> 01:17:21,489
I solved it.

771
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:23,761
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

772
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:26,606
Okay.

773
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:28,436
- I'll see you soon.
- Yes, sir.

774
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:56,628
Would you like to order?

775
01:18:32,686 --> 01:18:34,574
<i>Let's move to architecture now.</i>

776
01:18:34,575 --> 01:18:37,614
<i>New services keep on coming out
and keep on getting close.</i>

777
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:41,680
<i>Let's see if any one of them can
perhaps be a little easier to use.</i>

778
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:47,565
<i>Dear Ila, I got the lunchbox
today. There was nothing in it.</i>

779
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:50,672
<i>And I deserve that.</i>

780
01:19:51,502 --> 01:19:55,470
<i>Yesterday you waited in the
restaurant for me for a long time.</i>

781
01:19:55,471 --> 01:20:02,384
<i>But before that, that same morning
I forgot something in the bathroom.</i>

782
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:05,490
<i>I went back in to get it.</i>

783
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:08,077
<i>And the bathroom smelled the same.</i>

784
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:12,951
<i>Exactly the same as it used to be after
my grandfather had been in the shower.</i>

785
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:17,368
<i>It was like my grandfather
had been there.</i>

786
01:20:17,903 --> 01:20:19,694
<i>But he had not.</i>

787
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:21,622
<i>It was just me.</i>

788
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:25,425
<i>Just me and the smell
of an old man.</i>

789
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:29,045
<i>I don't know when I became old.</i>

790
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:34,292
<i>Maybe it was that morning. Maybe
it was many, many mornings ago.</i>

791
01:20:35,055 --> 01:20:38,318
<i>And maybe if I'd forgotten
something in the bathroom before,</i>

792
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:40,529
<i>I would have found out sooner.</i>

793
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,805
Uncle, would you like a seat?

794
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:44,850
No, no.

795
01:20:47,598 --> 01:20:51,096
<i>Life kept on going and
lulled me with its motions.</i>

796
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:55,694
<i>I kept rocking back and forth as it
threw me left and threw me right.</i>

797
01:20:55,695 --> 01:20:57,774
<i>And then before I knew it...</i>

798
01:20:59,023 --> 01:21:02,390
<i>No one buys yesterday's
lottery ticket, Ila.</i>

799
01:21:03,214 --> 01:21:06,418
<i>I came to the restaurant
while you were waiting.</i>

800
01:21:07,823 --> 01:21:09,614
<i>There you were.</i>

801
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,854
<i>Fidgeting with your purse.</i>

802
01:21:11,854 --> 01:21:13,945
<i>Drinking all that water.</i>

803
01:21:21,742 --> 01:21:24,974
<i>I wanted to come up to you and
tell you all this in person,</i>

804
01:21:24,975 --> 01:21:27,350
<i>but I just watched you wait.</i>

805
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:33,236
<i>You looked beautiful.</i>

806
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:39,155
<i>You're young.</i>

807
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:41,399
<i>You can dream.</i>

808
01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:46,104
<i>And for some time, you
let me into your dreams.</i>

809
01:21:48,622 --> 01:21:51,346
<i>And I want to thank you for that.</i>

810
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,718
The two ladies at the back,

811
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,962
please come in front.
I can't see you.

812
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,096
Smile, please.

813
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:41,846
One, two, three.

814
01:22:42,094 --> 01:22:43,886
Now a photo with everyone!

815
01:22:43,887 --> 01:22:47,319
The girl's side to the right.
The boy's side to the left please.

816
01:22:54,574 --> 01:22:57,592
The boy's side to the left please.

817
01:23:02,798 --> 01:23:04,430
Smile, please.

818
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:17,168
You're leaving, sir?

819
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:19,950
This is the new scooter?

820
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:21,583
Want a lift?

821
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:25,037
If you stay and don't retire,

822
01:23:25,038 --> 01:23:27,762
- I'll return it to Meherunissa's father.
- Ha, ha.

823
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:30,834
Taxi!

824
01:23:32,718 --> 01:23:34,766
The weather is strange.

825
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:37,075
It's like there's a drought.

826
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:45,650
Okay.

827
01:23:48,526 --> 01:23:50,039
Goodbye, Shaikh.

828
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:57,041
Do you know, sir,

829
01:23:57,262 --> 01:24:00,814
the first time I took the train
with you, in first class,

830
01:24:01,518 --> 01:24:03,445
I hadn't bought a ticket.

831
01:24:04,846 --> 01:24:07,700
I spent the whole journey
till Bombay Central

832
01:24:07,982 --> 01:24:10,126
praying I wouldn't be caught.

833
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:12,402
What would you have
thought of me? Ha, ha.

834
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:19,767
But the very next day, I got
a first class pass made.

835
01:24:34,062 --> 01:24:36,753
You'll be a good husband, Shaikh.

836
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,732
Thank you very much, sir.

837
01:24:47,598 --> 01:24:48,947
Wait.

838
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:58,196
Come to Nasik sometime.

839
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:43,670
Hello.

840
01:25:46,606 --> 01:25:47,987
Ma...

841
01:25:48,878 --> 01:25:50,456
I'm coming.

842
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,371
Eighty rupees.

843
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:37,619
Rajeev is on his way.

844
01:26:38,798 --> 01:26:40,430
He's in a meeting.

845
01:26:40,782 --> 01:26:43,189
He'll go straight
to the crematorium.

846
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:52,527
I'm very hungry.

847
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,015
I'm craving parathas.

848
01:27:01,038 --> 01:27:03,630
I didn't eat breakfast
this morning.

849
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,834
I was making breakfast for him.

850
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:08,631
Okay, Ma.

851
01:27:13,262 --> 01:27:15,953
I was always worried...

852
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:20,561
about what would happen to
me when he passed away.

853
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,560
- Never mind.
- But now...

854
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,267
I just feel hungry.

855
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:33,879
Ma.

856
01:27:36,302 --> 01:27:37,934
In the beginning,

857
01:27:38,702 --> 01:27:41,077
there was a lot of
love between us...

858
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:43,796
when you were born.

859
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,022
But for several years,

860
01:27:47,438 --> 01:27:52,431
I've been disgusted by him.

861
01:27:53,678 --> 01:27:55,373
Ma.

862
01:27:55,374 --> 01:27:58,957
- Every morning, his breakfast,
- Ma.

863
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:01,551
His medicine, his bath...

864
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:05,393
Breakfast, medicine, bath...

865
01:28:15,022 --> 01:28:16,982
When your brother died...

866
01:28:20,143 --> 01:28:23,309
that old ambulance
with a red light came.

867
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:26,132
Remember? Huh?

868
01:28:27,918 --> 01:28:30,326
Those old Matador models.

869
01:28:31,502 --> 01:28:33,527
Which one has come now?

870
01:28:34,062 --> 01:28:35,565
Huh?

871
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:37,678
What color?

872
01:28:38,702 --> 01:28:40,182
White.

873
01:28:40,878 --> 01:28:42,707
With the blue light.

874
01:28:42,926 --> 01:28:44,918
Okay.

875
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:04,973
Mister.

876
01:29:04,974 --> 01:29:06,290
Yes.

877
01:29:06,638 --> 01:29:09,614
This lunchbox is going
to the wrong address.

878
01:29:09,615 --> 01:29:11,923
How can it go to the wrong address?

879
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,741
We don't deliver it wrong.

880
01:29:13,742 --> 01:29:16,686
Yes, I understand.

881
01:29:16,687 --> 01:29:21,997
But my lunchbox has not been
going to the right address.

882
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:24,333
- It goes to the right address.
- It doesn't.

883
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:26,061
People from Harvard came...

884
01:29:26,062 --> 01:29:28,173
Forget about them.

885
01:29:28,174 --> 01:29:31,117
Listen to me. Try to
understand what I'm saying.

886
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:34,765
This lunchbox that I give to
you does not go to my husband.

887
01:29:34,766 --> 01:29:38,829
Instead it goes to someone
else, who has been eating it.

888
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:42,381
The Harvard people came here
and studied our system.

889
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:46,542
- They said we don't deliver wrong...
- It's been going to the wrong address.

890
01:29:46,542 --> 01:29:48,397
Do you think I am a liar?

891
01:29:48,398 --> 01:29:52,206
The King of England came in
person to see our system.

892
01:29:52,207 --> 01:29:54,989
But this lunchbox
is going somewhere.

893
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:56,685
It goes to the right building.

894
01:29:56,686 --> 01:29:59,639
I want the address
of that building!

895
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,773
Saajan Fernandes' desk?

896
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:28,431
He sits two desks down.

897
01:30:39,918 --> 01:30:42,358
Is this Saajan Fernandes' desk?

898
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:45,037
Let me call you back.

899
01:30:45,038 --> 01:30:47,021
Saajan Fernandes?

900
01:30:47,022 --> 01:30:48,753
He left.

901
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:52,118
I mean he left the job.

902
01:30:52,654 --> 01:30:54,125
Where can I find him?

903
01:30:54,126 --> 01:30:55,409
Nasik.

904
01:30:56,686 --> 01:30:58,351
He left for Nasik.

905
01:31:07,022 --> 01:31:09,389
So you are going to Nasik?

906
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,575
Yes.

907
01:31:12,302 --> 01:31:14,392
Are you moving there?

908
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,295
Yes.

909
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,892
Permanently?

910
01:31:21,262 --> 01:31:22,545
Yes.

911
01:31:27,022 --> 01:31:29,325
I retired three years ago.

912
01:31:29,326 --> 01:31:31,885
I come back to see my
son every now and then.

913
01:32:11,374 --> 01:32:13,235
Sorry, Ila, ma'am.

914
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:37,363
Throw.

915
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,438
Come on, Calvin.

916
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,605
Good evening, Mr. Fernandes.

917
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,397
We thought that you're gone.

918
01:33:00,398 --> 01:33:01,837
I was gone.

919
01:33:01,838 --> 01:33:04,212
- But I came back.
- Why?

920
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:17,581
Okay, you play here, but
don't break anybody's glass.

921
01:33:17,582 --> 01:33:19,181
Okay?

922
01:33:19,182 --> 01:33:20,727
Take it.

923
01:33:22,254 --> 01:33:24,529
Thank you, Mr. Fernandes.

924
01:33:28,109 --> 01:33:30,702
- Come on, Calvin.
- Come on, Calvin.

925
01:33:42,606 --> 01:33:44,435
Ila?

926
01:33:45,006 --> 01:33:46,190
Ila?

927
01:33:46,926 --> 01:33:48,877
Auntie.

928
01:33:48,877 --> 01:33:51,601
I've been calling out
since this afternoon.

929
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:53,870
Where were you?

930
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:56,404
I had something to take care of.

931
01:33:56,654 --> 01:33:58,352
I got worried.

932
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:03,954
I ran out of diapers
for your uncle.

933
01:34:04,206 --> 01:34:06,831
But I asked the super to get them.

934
01:34:07,469 --> 01:34:08,621
Do you know, Ila?

935
01:34:08,622 --> 01:34:11,053
I cleaned your uncle's fan today.

936
01:34:12,206 --> 01:34:14,449
Without turning it off!

937
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:04,400
<i>You must have reached Nasik.</i>

938
01:36:04,845 --> 01:36:07,863
<i>This morning you probably
woke up and made some tea.</i>

939
01:36:08,974 --> 01:36:12,658
<i>And after that maybe you
went for a morning walk.</i>

940
01:36:14,222 --> 01:36:16,141
<i>I woke up this morning</i>

941
01:36:16,142 --> 01:36:18,233
<i>and sold all my jewelry.</i>

942
01:36:18,989 --> 01:36:22,357
<i>My bracelets, earrings
and my wedding necklace.</i>

943
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,470
<i>It's not much.</i>

944
01:36:24,782 --> 01:36:27,149
<i>But I've heard that one rupee here</i>

945
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:29,262
<i>is worth five in Bhutan.</i>

946
01:36:29,357 --> 01:36:31,820
<i>So maybe we'll be
okay for some time.</i>

947
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:33,399
<i>And after that...</i>

948
01:36:34,734 --> 01:36:37,425
<i>After that, we'll see.</i>

949
01:36:38,478 --> 01:36:42,157
<i>By the time Yashvi comes home
from school, I'll have packed.</i>

950
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:44,401
<i>And we'll take the afternoon train.</i>

951
01:36:45,038 --> 01:36:47,597
<i>Maybe I'll send you this letter</i>

952
01:36:47,597 --> 01:36:50,190
<i>and your new postman
will deliver it.</i>

953
01:36:50,702 --> 01:36:53,775
<i>Or maybe I should
keep it for myself.</i>

954
01:36:54,286 --> 01:36:56,693
<i>And read it again years from now.</i>

955
01:36:58,094 --> 01:36:59,988
<i>I read somewhere</i>

956
01:37:01,037 --> 01:37:04,885
<i>that sometimes the wrong train
will get you to the right station.</i>

957
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:07,254
<i>Let's see.</i>
