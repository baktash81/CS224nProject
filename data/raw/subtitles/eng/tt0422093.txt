00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,851
March 11.

2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,651
Dear diary,
my husband of 18 years...

3
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,920
this week is being honored
by the city of Atlanta...

4
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,587
as the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year.

5
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,494
I am so proud of him.

6
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,090
He has worked so hard.

7
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,141
I wanna swing

8
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,580
Swing till daylight
with you

9
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,641
I wanna dance

10
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,517
Dance the whole night through

11
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,752
Where the beat-beat-beat
is jumping

12
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,055
And the crowd is feeling fine

13
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,529
Where the dance-dance-dances
are popping

14
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,692
Theirs are flowing like wine

15
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,066
I wanna swing

16
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,868
Swing till daylight with you

17
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,535
I wanna dance...

18
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,306
To look at us...

19
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,212
you would think
that we've got it all together.

20
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,716
But looks can be deceiving.

21
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,720
Some days are good
and I think he loves me.

22
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,722
Then other days...

23
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,156
I think he doesn't care.

24
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,887
Dancing till daylight

25
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,896
Just us two

26
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,556
Kicking up my heels...

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,897
I never thought
I'd see this day.

28
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,402
I was just saying
to my wife this morning...

29
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,905
that if I died and came back...

30
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,237
that I would want
to come back as me.

31
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,245
No, truly it is an honor...

32
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,511
to receive the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year Award.

33
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,677
Its especially
an honor because...

34
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,347
He is so into appearances.

35
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,515
What looks one way
on the outside...

36
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,719
can be a totally different
matter on the inside.

37
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:19,197
There is no way...
no way...

38
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,530
that I could have done
any of this...

39
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,969
without my wonderful wife
of 18 years.

40
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,379
I don't know this stranger
I sit next to.

41
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,220
All I know is that with
every dime and every case...

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,759
he has changed.

43
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,138
How about I...
run us a hot bath?

44
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,679
I left something at the office.

45
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,078
I have to go.

46
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,347
Who is she?

47
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,549
When you get a job
and pay one of these bills...

48
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,184
then you can ask me questions.

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,023
I am still your wife.

50
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,988
Thats cute.

51
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:30,365
Charles...
I don't want to fight.

52
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,031
This is your night.
Lets just enjoy it.

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,373
Tell me what I need to do,
and I will do it.

54
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,140
You really want to know
what you ought to do?

55
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,987
Get the hell out of my car.

56
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,109
What a way
to start our anniversary.

57
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,205
Tell me... why do I love
that man so much?

58
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,216
Maybe if I could stop
thinking about...

59
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,218
how good things used to be...

60
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,255
I might be able to find
the strength to leave.

61
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,165
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

62
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,505
Hi, Mrs. McCarter.

63
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,840
Hey, Mrs. McCarter.

64
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,777
Kalvin, how are you?
How is Joanne?

65
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,816
- She's doing great.
- Thats great.

66
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,181
- You doing all right?
- I'm wonderful. Thank you.

67
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,119
Listen, is he in?
Because I brought him, uh...

68
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,177
lunch.

69
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,121
Actually, I'm headed that way...

70
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,854
No, no. Please.
Thank you, though. Thank you.

71
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,452
Helen.

72
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,667
What, um...

73
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,934
Um... hi.
I'm Brenda Marcos.

74
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,736
How do you do?

75
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,377
Um... we got to go.

76
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,038
You ready, little fella?

77
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,412
It was nice to meet you.

78
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,015
Is that her?

79
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,752
Don't play games with me.
Tell me, Charles.

80
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,350
Is that her?

81
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,866
Thank you.

82
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,197
I'll see you at home.

83
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,184
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

84
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,353
What?

85
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,193
- What are you doing?
- Working.

86
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,529
Where are you going
with my things?

87
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,731
Lady, look... l'm just filling in
for my cousin because he's sick.

88
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,205
Somebody named Charles McCarter
or something like that...

89
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,367
rented this truck,
told me to load it up and wait.

90
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,705
So thats what I'm doing.

91
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,643
No. Wait. Wait.

92
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,183
Christina?

93
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,814
Christina.
Christina, there...

94
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,327
there is a man out there
putting my things in a truck.

95
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,827
What is going on?

96
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,831
Mr. McCarter asked me to pack
all your things this morning.

97
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,232
And all these clothes
are from the boutique.

98
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:27,534
I wish I had a man to do
something like this for me.

99
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,775
Happy anniversary.

100
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,972
- I have something to tell you.
- Your gift first.

101
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,315
Aren't you going to open it?
Charles, I have to admit...

102
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,378
I thought you forgot,
but I saw all the clothes...

103
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,982
in the closet
and... ta-da! Ha ha!

104
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,960
Its not exactly my taste,
but I love it.

105
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,257
Helen...

106
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,161
This one, it doesn't really
fit quite right, though.

107
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,961
I think I'm going to have
to get some alterations...

108
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,126
Helen.

109
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,964
You see how I keep
interrupting you?

110
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,164
Charles, I only want
to hear the good tonight.

111
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,901
OK?

112
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,448
I need to tell you something.

113
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,248
What is she doing here?

114
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,152
I asked her to come.

115
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,115
Charles, what is going on?

116
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,626
Is she wearing the dress
that I just picked out?

117
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,424
What?!

118
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,361
There's no easy way
to say this...

119
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,525
but our marriage
has run its course.

120
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,296
Its over.

121
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,360
What? What are you
trying to say?

122
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,372
I'm saying...
its over.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Charles!

124
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,869
Helen,
don't act so surprised.

125
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,207
I mean, I haven't
touched you in a year.

126
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,712
I haven't... well...

127
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,771
I haven't been happy for years.

128
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,874
18 years, and you think
you can just come in here...

129
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,179
and end it like this?

130
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,484
Charles, what am I supposed
to do without you?

131
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,354
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,659
Charles... please.

133
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,667
- Oh, my God.
- Don't do this.

134
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,135
Please tell me you're not one of
those weak begging sisters.

135
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,435
Brenda, let me handle this.

136
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,508
You are not leaving.

137
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,914
No... l'm not leaving.

138
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,418
But you are.

139
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,352
There's a truck outside.

140
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,049
Its full of gas,
and I hired some guy...

141
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,887
to take you
anywhere you want to go.

142
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,018
I can't keep treating her
like this. And my children...

143
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,721
not seeing their daddy
every night.

144
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,026
I'm staying here and there...

145
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,429
Children?

146
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,904
Two boys. They need me.

147
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,407
Charles.

148
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,545
Its me.
How can you say this to me?

149
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,480
How can you do this to me?

150
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,714
Good-bye, Helen. Now,
be a lady and leave quietly.

151
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,551
- No.
- No?

152
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,716
You woulÃ¯ve never had
any of this without me.

153
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,350
Now, you better
get up out of here...

154
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,863
- before I lose my temper.
- No!

155
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,329
No, I am not leaving!

156
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,890
- You what?
- No!

157
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,902
You're leaving, all right.

158
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,733
You're leaving. Go on.

159
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,569
Any way you want to do it.

160
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,744
Get up! Get up!

161
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,078
Aah! No! Charles! No!

162
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,387
Come on.

163
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,526
Huh? Come on.

164
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,697
What you doin'?

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,264
Get out of here! Get out!

166
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,032
Charles! Charles!

167
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,132
Charles!

168
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,763
Oh, what the hell
have they got me into?

169
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,519
Hey, look...

170
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,782
we've been driving
around for hours now.

171
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,825
I do have another job that
I have to be at in a few hours.

172
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,693
So there's got to be
someplace I can take you.

173
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,458
Take me where?

174
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:24,401
He has alienated me
from my entire family.

175
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,201
He made me put my mother
in a home bec...

176
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,744
Because she didn't fit
into his "American dream."

177
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,410
I don't have anyplace to go.

178
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,214
Lady, I'm really sorry
to hear about that...

179
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,549
but its the middle
of the night...

180
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,647
- Just stop the truck!
- I'm trying to help you out.

181
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,954
- Just stop the truck!
- I'm not stopping the truck.

182
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,393
All you men are just alike!
You just think about yourselves!

183
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,225
You don't think about
anybody else but yourself!

184
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,061
Just stop the truck,
and I will drive myself...

185
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,725
where I have to!
Pull the truck over!

186
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,827
Hey! Don't grab the wheel!
Hey. Don't touch the wheel.

187
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,235
I'm stopping. I'm stopping.

188
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,706
- Then get out!
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,333
I don't care!
Get out of the car!

190
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,741
I'll drive myself!

191
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,506
You know what? Now I see
why you're going through...

192
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,172
what you're going through.

193
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,681
Oh, you go to hell!

194
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,444
Have a nice life.

195
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,185
Yeah, you're welcome!

196
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,981
Don't shoot! Its Helen...

197
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,348
your granddaughter!
Don't shoot!

198
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,716
What the hell? Girl!

199
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,119
I always open the door
this time of night shooting...

200
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,679
'cause there ain't nothing
but a crackhead...

201
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,589
or the police knocking
on your door this time of night.

202
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,922
What you doing here this late?

203
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,755
I was in the neighborhood and...

204
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,664
You were in the neighborhood?

205
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,032
I thought I'd come by
and say hi.

206
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,867
You live in a mansion
on the other side of town.

207
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,874
What the hell you doing
in the ghetto?

208
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,705
You ain't on that stuff, is you?

209
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,369
Is you over here trying
to buy some stuff?

210
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,640
I missed you.

211
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,841
Come by in the daylight here.
Don't come by...

212
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,283
Madea, please.

213
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,083
Come on in here.

214
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,382
Who that is at the door?

215
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,654
Shut up, Joe. I got this.

216
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,663
...l'm gonna have
to put my foot down.

217
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,495
Kunta Kinte put his foot down,
and it got chopped off.

218
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,035
Now shut the hell up
and go back to sleep.

219
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,023
I know I had some
cigarettes in this...

220
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,218
Harpo.

221
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,491
Harpo, who this woman?

222
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,361
Joe, go in that room
and take your medicine.

223
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,263
You know you crazy as hell
when you don't take it.

224
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,031
I say hell... no.

225
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,275
What the hell?

226
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,368
Look what you
done made me do!

227
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,742
Oh, hell!

228
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,713
Get the hell up.

229
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,876
You didn't come by yesterday.

230
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,886
You got to eat something
out there on them streets.

231
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,354
You got to be careful,
you hear?

232
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,086
Look at you. Lord help me.

233
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,754
You ain't got
no regular clothes, do you?

234
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,761
What?

235
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,923
Helen... hey.

236
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,029
Debrah?

237
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,163
Yeah, girl.

238
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,169
You gonna hug me?

239
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,711
Yeah.

240
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,519
So, how are you doing?

241
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,054
You look good. You look good.

242
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,556
Marrying that rich lawyer.

243
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,856
When we were kids, we both said
we'd get a rich man, right?

244
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,259
We both got lawyers.

245
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,820
Deb, what...
whats going on?

246
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,926
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't judge me.

247
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,566
Thank you. I got to go.

248
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,906
You take care of yourself
out there.

249
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,807
Lord.

250
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,439
You hungry?

251
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,313
I can't eat anything.

252
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,649
You need to eat something.

253
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,847
What happened to her?

254
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,018
Life.

255
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,252
Brian and the kids must
really be going through it.

256
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,763
They're doing all right.

257
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,629
But I want to talk about you.

258
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,327
I called Charles this morning...

259
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,870
and he told me,
before he hung up...

260
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,429
that you and him
is getting a divorce.

261
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,998
But what I can't seem
to figure out is why you here.

262
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,840
He put me out of the house.

263
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,937
- Who house?
- Our house.

264
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,380
Exactly. How the hell
a man gonna put a woman...

265
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,281
out of her own house?
He mightve put me out...

266
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,717
but he was gonna
put me out of half.

267
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,220
I'm gonna go in
the other half of the house.

268
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,653
He wasn't puttin' me
out of all of it.

269
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,350
The house is in his name, Madea.

270
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,985
Lord have mercy.
Thats how women get messed up.

271
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:53,225
Too busy out shopping when you
need to be checking the deed.

272
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,732
Whoo! That makes me mad, girl.

273
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,132
I don't have any rights
to the money.

274
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,499
No right?

275
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,295
I signed a prenup.

276
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,171
What the hell
you sign a prenup...

277
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,234
I ought to punch you
in the face.

278
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,972
Who the hell told you
to sign a renup?

279
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,344
He didn't have nothin'
when you married him!

280
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,144
Charles always knew
he'd be successful.

281
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,445
And he said to me...

282
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,646
"I want to know that
you're here for love."

283
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,746
And I didn't have a job.

284
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,313
So its his money.

285
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,554
Is it? What was you doing
while he was working, honey?

286
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,654
Taking care of the house,
cooking and cleaning.

287
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,167
Exactly.
That sounds like a job to me.

288
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,929
Cooking and cleaning...
how long you do that?

289
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,597
18 years.

290
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,663
All right. OK.

291
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,175
18 years...

292
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,212
lets see how much he owes you.

293
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,514
18 years...

294
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,847
you've been cooking...

295
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,716
cleaning...

296
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,857
having sex with him
when he wanted.

297
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,723
- Was it good?
- No.

298
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,456
Major deduction.

299
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,963
And I didn't tell you
that he hit me.

300
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,547
Girl, that man
owes you 64 billion...

301
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,883
283 million, 974 trillion...

302
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,616
5 thousand...

303
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,989
and 20 dollars and 82 cents.

304
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,652
Now, you need to get your money.

305
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,788
- Thatll never happen.
- You want to bet?

306
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,559
I can happen
one of two ways, honey.

307
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,727
You can get it from his
checking account voluntarily...

308
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,236
or his insurance policy.

309
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,966
Involuntary manslaughter.
Which one its gonna be?

310
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,234
- Madea.
- Mm-mm.

311
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,243
I ain't gonna have this.
Come on.

312
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,246
- What? Where are we going?
- To your house.

313
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,248
Oh, no. The guard
will never let us in.

314
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,147
I said come on!

315
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,981
Mayday! Mayday!

316
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,065
Lord have mercy.

317
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,136
Get your stuff.

318
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,867
What the hell
is wrong with you?

319
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,374
These your clothes?

320
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,670
They're hers.

321
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,541
Oh, they're hers?

322
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,480
Who is, uh...
"Dol... say & Gab-anna?"

323
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,607
Who that is?

324
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,211
Dolce and Gabbana.
They're designers.

325
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,085
Oh. She a label ho.

326
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,227
$700 for a damn rag?

327
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,229
Just a rag.

328
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,731
Madea, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

329
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,060
This man left you...

330
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,766
for some old floozy.

331
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Madea, whats wrong?

332
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:03,311
A wire hanger!

333
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,394
Rip it.

334
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,690
Rip it?

335
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,991
- Rip it.
- No, no.

336
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,657
Rip it!

337
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,564
- Rip it? Rip it!
- Rip it!

338
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,693
Rip it!

339
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,031
Rip it!

340
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,097
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,776
Rip it like this!
Get mad at it!

342
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,111
Ltll make you feel better!
Rip it!

343
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,777
Rip it! Rip it!

344
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,876
Rip something!

345
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,944
- Rip it!
- Rip it!

346
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,580
Rip it real good. Rip it.

347
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,182
Wait a minute.
Whats this gonna solve?

348
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,820
Nothing. Its just gonna
make you feel better.

349
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,059
- Rip it! Ha ha ha!
- Rip it!

350
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,901
This is for every black woman...

351
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,106
who ever had a problem
with a black man!

352
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,250
Goodness.

353
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,288
Calm down, girl.

354
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,523
I'm tired as hell.

355
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,997
OK.

356
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,127
I'm gonna go down
to the office.

357
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,072
I forgot some things.

358
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,407
OK... you go down
in the office...

359
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,469
because you forgot something.

360
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,710
Find me some oxygen.

361
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,617
And bring me some oxygen!

362
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,159
What are you doing in here?

363
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,786
Charles.

364
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,660
Are you stealing from me?

365
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,722
No. No, I just...

366
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,201
How did you get in here?
I changed the locks.

367
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,042
What the... who are you?

368
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,635
Who are you?

369
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,408
I'm the owner of this house.

370
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,109
Wrong answer.
My granddaughter Helen...

371
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,048
is the owner of this house.

372
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,678
You're the ho. You ain't
got no power or no deed.

373
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,018
Did you do this?
This is Vera Wang!

374
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,218
Who that is? She do nails?
I need to get my nails did.

375
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,352
Thats it!
I'm calling the police!

376
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,227
I'm not scared of no popo.
Call the popo, ho.

377
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,493
Call the popo, ho!

378
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,127
Charles, please...

379
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,831
I don't have any money, and...

380
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,840
I tried to be nice to you,
didn't I?

381
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,041
Didn't I?

382
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,774
I'll just go.

383
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,408
You'll just go?

384
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,520
I'll just take it,
and I'll just go.

385
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,522
Oh, you'll just
take it and go, huh?

386
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,218
You're gonna take
my money and go?!

387
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,454
If I call the police, they're
gonna be here in ten minutes.

388
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,226
OK. Then that leaves me nine
to beat the hell out of you.

389
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,699
You think?
I know tae kwon do.

390
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,703
And I know whoop your ass.
Come on. Bring it on.

391
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,762
You don't know me.
I'm from the projects.

392
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,775
Come on.
What the hell is your problem?

393
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,367
Come on. Shut up. Shut up!

394
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,711
Oh, hell no. Watch out.

395
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,112
Yeah, you keep running!

396
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,774
What?
Now you asking me questions?!

397
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,216
You begging now?

398
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,220
Oh, please do it.
Please hit her.

399
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,381
Please!
I want to see you do it.

400
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,753
What the hell's wrong with you?

401
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,553
Here, now, you bastard.
Put your hands on her.

402
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,389
Oh, my God! Don't hurt him!

403
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,985
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna kill him.

404
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,360
Putting his hand
on my granddaughter.

405
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,058
I'm calling the police.

406
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,067
You call the police, so they can
see how you done hit her.

407
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,227
No, just get out.

408
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,670
Charles, I have been nothing but
a good woman and wife to you.

409
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,673
I don't deserve this.

410
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,438
You will reap what you sow.

411
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,503
Keep your money.

412
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,310
You crazy as hell.

413
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,350
Just leave it.

414
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,182
I might leave some of it.

415
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,815
It was this that made you
the evil bastard that you are.

416
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,983
Get out.

417
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,424
Here, now, the way I see it...

418
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,960
half of everything in this house
belongs to her...

419
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,461
and I ain't leaving here
till she get it.

420
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,862
- She'll never see it.
- What did he say?

421
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,490
Come on, Madea. Lets go.

422
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,795
Thats right. Go.

423
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,699
Give me 5 minutes with her
in the bathroom, please.

424
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,362
Madea, lets go.

425
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,805
OK. Oh, yeah. I'm leaving.

426
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,874
Its just a matter of time...

427
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,542
before he does
the same thing to you.

428
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,281
Never. I could never be you.

429
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,324
I'm a woman who knows
how to get and keep her man!

430
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,023
Whats that?

431
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,323
Madea...

432
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,023
Half of everything
in here belongs to her.

433
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,929
Which half do you want?
Do you want this half...

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,729
or do you want this half?

435
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,732
Madea.

436
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,307
Your Honor,
case number 456790...

437
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:09,046
the People versus Mabel Simmons
and Helen McCarter.

438
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
Criminal trespassing,
reckless endangerment...

439
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,988
criminal possession
of a handgun...

440
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,423
assault with a deadly weapon...

441
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,359
What are you
walking so fast for?

442
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,397
Suspended license,
expired registration...

443
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,423
reckless driving,
and a broken taillight.

444
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,196
Girl, I know that ain't
who I think it is.

445
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,730
I know you didn't say
Mabel Simmons. Madea?

446
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,742
How are you doing,
Judge Mablean?

447
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,836
Its good to see you.
Your hair is pretty, girl.

448
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,608
Look at you.
You're looking good.

449
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,239
How you been?

450
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,613
You're still at it?

451
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,117
This ain't even my fault.
What had happened was...

452
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,882
Save it.
Who's here for the defense?

453
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,547
Brian Simmons here on behalf...

454
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,488
of Mrs. McCarter and
Mrs. Simmons, your Honor.

455
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,754
- Brian?
- How you doing, Judge Ephriam?

456
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,388
I'm getting tired
of seeing your aunt.

457
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,694
I'm tired of seeing you.

458
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,991
It won't happen again.

459
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,468
Yeah, I bet.

460
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,062
Bail is set at $5,000
for Miss McCarter...

461
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,303
property or cash.
But as for you, Madea...

462
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,844
I'm placing you
under house arrest.

463
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,641
You ain't putting me
on no house arrest, honey.

464
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,011
I ain't fi'n
to to deal with that.

465
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,573
Its either that or prison.
Whats your choice?

466
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,312
I'll take the house arrest.

467
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,752
Bailiff, call the next case.

468
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,656
The city of Atlanta
versus Bobby Brown.

469
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,284
What is this,
repeat-offender day?

470
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,024
Bobby! Bobby, I love you!
Sit down, Miss Houston.

471
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,705
- OK, you like hot sauce?
- Put that lid down!

472
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,909
What the hell?
How the hell you do that?

473
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,683
You don't know
what we're playing?

474
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,389
Hey, Daddy.

475
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,123
I see you got Thelma and Louise
out of jail.

476
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,824
Yeah, I did. Hey, stop running.

477
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,197
Stop running.
Say hi to your aunt Helen.

478
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,701
- Hi.
- Hi.

479
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,863
Thats your son. Tiffany.

480
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,238
- My God. How old is she now?
- She'll be twelve tomorrow.

481
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,799
Hey, baby. How you doing?

482
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,539
- Can I?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,205
So...

484
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,750
I saw Debrah.

485
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,450
I didn't know she was so bad.

486
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:31,052
Yeah. She took it pretty hard
when you left.

487
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,962
Charles wanted us
to move away from anything...

488
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:38,230
that reminded him of the past,
and why I let him do that...

489
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,828
Debrah and I were thick
as thieves growing up, huh?

490
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,567
Yeah, you were.

491
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,905
I'll tell you what.
Y'all about to be set.

492
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,569
What you got? Oh, hell.

493
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,579
Y'all don't know nothing
about playing no cards.

494
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm gonna take mine and git.

495
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,741
I could have spent my money
in a better place.

496
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,045
Did you hear me, John?

497
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,451
We gonna play, or we gonna talk?

498
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,921
Joe, let me get some.

499
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,024
Thats some good stuff.

500
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,431
You want some, John?

501
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,863
I guess not.

502
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,700
Joe, let me get some.

503
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,865
Last time we gave you
some of this stuff, Mildred...

504
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,533
we had to call the popo on you.

505
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,770
We had to call the ambulance
and everything.

506
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,209
You went crazy as hell.

507
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,247
You ain't supposed to smoke this
when you're on lithium.

508
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,906
I'm all right.

509
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,316
All right. Don't wet up my butt,
get the lipstick all over it.

510
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,718
You act crazy if you want to.
Whose play is it?

511
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,914
Play something.
Play something.

512
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,551
Brian, can you handle
my divorce?

513
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,322
You don't even have to ask.

514
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,729
I always thought that
if I did all I could...

515
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,791
God would bless my marriage.

516
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,599
It takes a lot more
than you doing all you can.

517
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,072
And who's to say that
this is not your blessing?

518
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,733
You know, sometimes
we hold onto the things...

519
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,504
that God himself
is trying to tear away.

520
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,772
Its not that easy.

521
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,575
You know women. We love hard.

522
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,048
- And men don't?
- Not like a woman.

523
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,744
I don't know
if I agree with that.

524
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,183
We don't love as easy...

525
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,845
but when we love,
we love just as hard.

526
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,583
You don't see men
getting themselves...

527
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,023
in situations like mine.

528
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,856
The mother of my kids
is a junkie...

529
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,497
and I love her.

530
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,658
Thats a tough situation.

531
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,032
Yeah. I look at Tiff...

532
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,470
she is so much like her.
She wants to sing.

533
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,042
I can't let her do that.

534
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,668
She's not Debrah.

535
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,213
Tell that to my heart.

536
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,314
Orlando. O-dawg,
whats going on, man?

537
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,979
Big Brian, whats up, man?

538
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,716
Y'all got it smelling
real right around here.

539
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,189
Thats my deal, man.
Thats my deal.

540
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,987
Hey, I want to introduce
you to somebody.

541
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,223
This is my cousin Helen.
Helen, this is Orlando.

542
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,327
Did I miss something?
You two know each other?

543
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,129
This is the sweet young lady...

544
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,329
that threw me out
of a moving truck.

545
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,838
This is the crazy woman...

546
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,238
Thats her.

547
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,900
This town is too small.

548
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,308
I think you owe me an apology.

549
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,039
I don't owe you anything.

550
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,240
I was just trying
to help you out the other night.

551
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,249
Oh, yeah, right.
You're no good samaritan.

552
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,013
He paid it. Its not like
you're some savior or something.

553
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,682
I'm gonna go...
check... do something.

554
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,186
Just another bitter
black woman, huh?

555
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,195
Excuse me?

556
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,699
I called you bitter, because
now every man you meet...

557
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,701
is gonna have to pay
for what he did.

558
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,327
You don't know
anything about me.

559
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,372
I know I watched a man
drag you out of a house...

560
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,906
and treat you like dirt.

561
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,671
Now there's another story
you can tell my cousin.

562
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,339
And I'm not bitter.
I'm mad as hell!

563
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,912
Turn that off up there.
Turn it off.

564
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,557
Shut up up there, all that
music.

565
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,058
How you doing, Henry Lee?

566
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,560
Its good to see y'all.

567
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,220
See, I'm on house arrest.

568
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,558
What is that?

569
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,064
You don't even
want to know, baby.

570
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,566
You don't even want to know.

571
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,465
Get somewhere and sit down
over there, little boy...

572
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,902
before I knock the hell
out of you. Where's your mama?

573
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,872
There you go.

574
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,544
- Mildred, you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

575
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,945
Mildred, don't you start
acting crazy.

576
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,313
Give me, give me. Here.
I'm gonna put this out.

577
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,012
You acting like you crazy.
I'll save that for later.

578
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,714
Your play, Mildred.

579
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,982
Play something.

580
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,062
Help! Somebody help me!

581
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,934
I'm out.

582
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,371
What happened to my eyes?

583
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,772
Everything is dark!

584
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,333
Open your eyes, and you might
be able to see something, fool.

585
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,140
Crawling all over me!
The rabbits!

586
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,114
The rabbits
are crawling all over me!

587
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,674
You ain't supposed to be
smoking that stuff, Mildred.

588
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,844
Rabbits!

589
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,688
Brian, please take her home
to her house.

590
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,087
I don't know why the hell
you come over here...

591
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,181
to my yard with that.

592
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,725
Get on, rabbit. Go, rabbit.

593
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,627
Go. Go, rabbit. Go.
OK, the rabbits gone. OK?

594
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,163
All right. No more rabbits.

595
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,827
Hey, Mildred,
you forgot your rabbit.

596
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,670
Don't come back over here
no more, Mildred!

597
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,208
Don't come back over here!

598
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,368
I don't see no rabbit.

599
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,036
That was good stuff we had.

600
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,081
Is that a rab...
thats a rabbit!

601
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,283
Here. Use this.

602
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,381
Whats this,
your way of apologizing?

603
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,518
Because if it is,
I'm not accepting it.

604
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,722
I'm sorry, mister.

605
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,734
Hey, hey.

606
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,397
My name's Orlando.

607
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,636
Orlando.

608
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,873
Willie, put some music on.
Something we can dance to.

609
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,709
You got it.

610
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,715
Lets turn this party up.
Y'all, come on. Dance.

611
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,307
Come on. Everybody come on.
Come on, Helen.

612
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,818
You and that young man.

613
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,548
Come on, young man. Come on.

614
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,505
March 19.

615
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,174
Dear diary...

616
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,707
I look out at my family
having fun and laughing...

617
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:32,017
and everything in me
is screaming for help.

618
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,422
How do I get to that place?

619
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,519
How?

620
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,434
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

621
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,599
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

622
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,576
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

623
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,918
Hello?

624
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,047
Chuck, this is Jamison.
Man, I need to talk to you.

625
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,454
You know what time it is?

626
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,958
I don't really care
what time it is.

627
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,257
I got a situation.
We need to talk now.

628
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,501
It went bad.

629
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,002
What are you talking about?

630
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,504
- I shot him.
- Who?

631
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,870
Some cop undercover
who was trying to sting me.

632
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,636
What does that
got to do with me?

633
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,507
Charles,
I need a lawyer and a judge.

634
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,944
Now, there is $300,000
in that bag.

635
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,777
That ought to
buy me both, right?

636
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,340
Look, I'm a legitimate
defense attorney...

637
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,581
and I would advise you
not to try and bribe a judge.

638
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,179
Look, man, I'm hot!

639
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,316
I don't have time for
all this legal stuff, man.

640
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,486
OK, look, you know I don't deal
with your kind anymore.

641
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,894
My kind? Brother,
before you started...

642
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,625
defending all
these rich white boys...

643
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,530
it was my kind
that got you down.

644
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,193
- I'm going home.
- Home?

645
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,500
Oh, how quickly we forget.

646
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,972
I ran so much coke
for you back in the day...

647
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,599
I paid for that house.

648
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,941
Now look here. I need you,
like you needed me...

649
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,540
back in the day
to get all you got.

650
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,313
No. What you need
is a lawyer...

651
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,685
and not to ever
call my house again.

652
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,838
You are my lawyer.

653
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,138
You know where to find me.

654
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,150
Lord Jesus. All of this
calamity in the world.

655
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,021
But I tell...

656
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,186
The paper's sad.
Its really sad.

657
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,253
You nasty as hell.

658
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,198
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

659
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,700
Here.

660
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,701
What?

661
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,169
You need a job.

662
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,502
Oh, Madea, I don't...

663
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,303
I don't know
how to do anything.

664
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,003
I got a job for you...

665
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,342
as soon as I get
some more Vaseline.

666
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,213
Joe, that is your...
thats your family.

667
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,979
Thats your dead husbanÃ¯s
side of the family.

668
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,986
She ain't no kin to me.

669
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,217
I could introduce you to Harvey.
Maybe he'll help you out.

670
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,589
She ain't selling no dope, Joe.

671
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,651
If I had a bottle
of battery acid...

672
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,924
I would give you
a chemical peel...

673
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,625
just scrub all of that ugly
off of your face.

674
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,191
I know you're my brother...

675
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,703
and the only reason I'm
letting you stay in my house...

676
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,433
is to get your check.

677
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,270
But I can still
get your check...

678
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,741
if you come up missing.
Keep trying me.

679
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,402
But you're gonna end up
in the Chattahoochee river.

680
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,676
What you looking at?!

681
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,376
You ain't moving in here.

682
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,213
Next thing you know,
she'll be getting mail here.

683
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,219
Joe, leave that baby alone.

684
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,777
If their name
comes on the envelope...

685
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,380
that means they move
right the hell in.

686
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,890
Get out.

687
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,291
Get... get out.

688
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,921
Baby, take that newspaper...

689
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,295
and go on in the kitchen
and look for you a job.

690
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,697
And an apartment.

691
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,032
Look for an apartment
while you're in there.

692
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,730
You always messing
with somebody.

693
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,363
What the hell's wrong with you?

694
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,964
You're just grouchy as hell.
You been grouchy.

695
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,202
Thats why Mommy and Daddy
didn't like you.

696
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,370
She ain't moving in here.

697
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,710
Ain't enough room in this house
for all of us here.

698
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,717
This ain't "Roots." These rooms
are barely big enough...

699
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,218
for you to turn around in.

700
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,049
Man, but you know,
you're just huge.

701
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,147
You big as a Buick.
You just fat as hell.

702
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,953
I watched you walk
down the hall the other day.

703
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,153
I thought somebody had put
a refrigerator on your butt.

704
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,718
You're huge. You're big.

705
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,856
And thats something
you'll never...

706
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,594
in your life hear a woman say.

707
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,371
Yes!

708
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,848
Thank you, Mrs. McCarter.

709
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,551
She's in her room.

710
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,988
Hi, Mama.

711
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,732
Hi.

712
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,865
I brought you some things.

713
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,403
Hey, baby. How you doing?

714
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,039
Oh. I'm doing OK.

715
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,983
Yeah.

716
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,650
They talked to me
about the bill here yesterday.

717
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,089
They call you?

718
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,354
Yes.

719
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm gonna get that paid.

720
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,025
You know Charles
don't care nothing about me.

721
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,260
What makes you think
he's gonna pay it?

722
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,769
I talked to Madea.

723
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,203
I know whats going on.

724
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,144
I think I'm...

725
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,009
Iosing my mind, Mama.

726
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,082
He hurt me so bad.

727
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,052
He was my everything.

728
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,218
God is your everything.

729
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,558
Don't you know
he's a jealous god?

730
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,428
He don't want no man before him.

731
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,728
I don't even know
where to begin...

732
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,896
to pick up the pieces
of my life.

733
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,496
Lord have mercy.

734
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:09,178
I was 39 years old
when you were born.

735
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:13,012
I never ever dreamed
I'd have children.

736
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,677
And then here you come...

737
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,812
sweet bundle of joy.

738
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,057
But what did I do?

739
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,719
I think I shielded you
way too much.

740
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,492
Now you got to get out there...

741
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,594
try to stand
on your own two feet.

742
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,503
Oh, no, Mama.

743
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,201
I can't do that.
I'm not strong like you.

744
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,210
Sure you are.

745
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:47,148
You got the strength
God gave us women to survive.

746
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,015
You just ain't
tapped into it yet.

747
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,854
Come here.

748
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,191
Come on.

749
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,690
Come on now.

750
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,362
Oh...

751
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,674
just let it go.

752
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,679
Nothing wrong with
shedding a few tears.

753
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,874
It cleanses the soul.

754
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:24,854
You know, you need
to stop thinking...

755
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,686
about what you think
you lost...

756
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,693
and look forward
to what there is to gain.

757
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,729
Its a new life, baby.

758
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,629
Its right in front of you.

759
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,725
All you got to do
is reach out and grab it.

760
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,832
How do I do that, Mama? How?

761
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,137
By waking up every morning...

762
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,206
and thanking God that you did.

763
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:57,219
And then ask him to help you.

764
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,450
Just ask the savior to help you.

765
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,430
April 18.

766
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,272
Dear diary,
every day I wake up...

767
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,836
I take my mother's advice.

768
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,849
Most days, I don't want
to get out of bed...

769
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,181
but I do.

770
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,381
Some people say,
"One day at a time."

771
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,186
Seems too long for me.

772
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:39,025
Most days, all I can do
is moment to moment.

773
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,189
The good thing
about being this low...

774
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:46,396
is that there's
nowhere to go but up.

775
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,864
Hi. Can I get your order?

776
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,998
Hi.

777
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,707
OK, I'm gonna kill Brian.
Did he tell you I work here?

778
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,212
Hey, easy. Easy.

779
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,715
A man's got to eat, right?

780
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,842
What can I get for you?

781
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,979
How about a coffee
and a number four?

782
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,218
We don't have number fours
in this restaurant.

783
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,556
OK. How about just a coffee?

784
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,959
Coffee.

785
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,930
OK.

786
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,191
I like the new haircut...

787
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,566
a lot.

788
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,696
Thank you.

789
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,349
Oh, no matter what

790
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,012
You may be going through

791
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,021
Take it to the master

792
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,353
He'll see you right on through

793
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,689
I know Jesus, whoo!

794
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,387
Take it to him

795
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:48,522
You can leave it there

796
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,033
He will work it out

797
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,365
No matter what

798
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,702
You may be going through...

799
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,365
April 25.

800
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:02,879
Dear diary,
today was a bad day.

801
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,814
I got up and came to church
because I was so angry.

802
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,818
When I think
about all the blood...

803
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,820
and sweat and tears
I put into my marriage...

804
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,822
it makes me want to hate him.

805
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,585
Let me tell you something, boss.

806
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,492
I paid you a lot of money,
and that judge, he ain't down.

807
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,995
The judge had no choice...

808
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,826
but to allow the videotape
into evidence.

809
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,992
I told you
to make this go away.

810
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,331
Say it wasn't me,
I wasn't there.

811
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,997
How the hell do you
use self-defense?

812
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,505
You're on videotape.

813
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,007
And it will be
very hard to explain...

814
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,838
you not being there
at the time of the murder.

815
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,503
Self-defense is our only option.

816
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,706
Then put me on the stand.
I'll say it wasn't me.

817
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,339
Then all your priors
come into play.

818
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,544
Look, Mr. Jackson,
you have to let me work here.

819
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,985
Look, man, you can get me off,
make this go away.

820
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,579
Look, I said
I would do all I can.

821
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,682
Well, that better be
a hell of a lot, brother.

822
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,192
Or I will do all I can.

823
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,693
Wait a minute.
Are you threatening...

824
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,696
Ain't nobody talking to you.

825
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,699
I done paid you a lot of money.

826
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,361
You know how it is
on the streets, Chuck.

827
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,700
Brother don't do what he say.

828
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,640
However you and your homeys
settle your disputes...

829
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,143
this has to play out in court.

830
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,146
- Lf I go down, man...
- lf you go down?

831
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,148
Kalvin, walk away.

832
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,683
Walk away.

833
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,159
Don't let this suit fool you.

834
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:28,163
I don't take too kindly
to threats, Mr. Jackson.

835
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:32,668
And I don't make
idle threats, Mr. McCarter.

836
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,364
I better get off.

837
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,176
May 12.

838
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,012
Dear diary...

839
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,184
I'm beginning to find my way.

840
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,689
Its been close to
three months...

841
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:58,421
and every day
gets a little easier.

842
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,690
Even though we're still
battling Charles in court...

843
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,700
I don't even give it
that much energy anymore.

844
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,202
I don't understand this,
but its strange...

845
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,103
how little can be so much
when you're happy.

846
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,870
I find myself
smiling and laughing...

847
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,174
more than I ever have.

848
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,714
I find myself...

849
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:23,219
Wait a minute. Thats it.

850
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,413
I'm finding myself.

851
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,231
Its nights like this
I wish I had a car...

852
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,096
or kept that U-Haul truck
a few more days.

853
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,589
Hey. Brian asked me
to pick you up tonight.

854
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,090
He did?

855
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,218
No, thanks.

856
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,591
All right, but you know...

857
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,789
the next bus doesn't come
for at least an hour.

858
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,264
I'll be fine.

859
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,996
Why are you being
so mean, woman?

860
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,268
Why are you being
so nice, man?

861
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,776
You know, there are still
a few of us nice guys around.

862
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,108
All right. Suit yourself.

863
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,508
Come on, now.
This makes no sense.

864
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,347
You'll take me straight home?

865
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,148
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

866
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,189
Just get in the truck.

867
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,314
Come on.

868
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,559
You all right?

869
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,757
Yeah.

870
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,613
This is some weather, huh?

871
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,184
Hey, you know what?
I'm kind of hungry.

872
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,850
You want to stop
and have some dinner?

873
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,517
I have food at home.

874
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,460
I was thinking you might like...

875
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,657
a nice little salmon dinner
at one of my favorite spots.

876
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,723
Where is that? McDonalÃ¯s?

877
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,396
Actually, its a little
jazz bar called Chandra's.

878
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,208
I love that place.

879
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,211
There you go. All right. So?

880
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,610
Are we going?

881
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,776
- I can't afford Chandra's.
- No, no, no, no. I got it.

882
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,148
You got it?

883
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,880
Yeah, I got it.

884
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,047
And what do you do?

885
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,216
Because I don't hang
with drug dealers.

886
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,422
I work twelve hours a day
at McWorth steel, all right?

887
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,196
I got the bill.

888
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:52,565
Yeah. Well, this is not a date.

889
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,604
Yes, ma'am.

890
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,794
What are you looking at?

891
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,401
A beautiful black woman.

892
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,704
Is that all you see
when you look at me?

893
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,409
No. No, not at all.

894
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,218
I also see a woman
who's been hurt...

895
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,812
a lot...

896
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,326
and she's taught herself
how to be tough...

897
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,384
real tough.

898
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:56,398
But, you know, the key
is to be tough, not hard.

899
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:00,266
And how would you know
what the key is?

900
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:04,672
Lets just say
I had to learn it, too.

901
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,544
Is that what you tell
all your women?

902
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,879
I don't have women.

903
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,215
I had a bad breakup last year.

904
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,693
And I guess
you could say I've...

905
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,730
I've been happily single
ever since.

906
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,493
Well, I guess...

907
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,198
we've both had
bad breakups, then.

908
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,037
Hello. Welcome to Chandra's.

909
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,940
I'm Chandra Currelley.

910
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,438
This one is
for the new couples...

911
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,814
here for the very first time
tonight.

912
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,157
How do I start?

913
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:03,831
Where do I begin?

914
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,496
I've been hurt so much

915
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:12,507
I just need a friend

916
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,306
Could it be you?

917
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:22,249
Will you break
through these walls?

918
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,480
Are you willing

919
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:28,183
To help them fall?

920
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:31,790
I want to love again...
