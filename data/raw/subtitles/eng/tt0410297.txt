1
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,650
You coming or not?

2
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,957
-All right, I'll get her to you right away.
-Appreciate it.

3
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,184
-Hi.
-Hi.

4
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:47,660
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.

5
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:51,198
-Hi, excuse me.
-Yeah, just a minute, okay?

6
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,928
-Fill this out for me and wait over there.
-No, I'm... I'm Dr. Forster.

7
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,471
I was told to report here.

8
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:01,100
You'll be covering 22 patients
on rounds today, this floor and the next.

9
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,939
-Twenty-two?
-Quiet morning.

10
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:06,015
If you get into trouble, beep me,
but don't make it a habit.

11
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,709
The med students
will help you out with scutwork.

12
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,651
What's he doing here?
I ordered an MRI, stat.

13
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:15,418
-Transport said about four hours.
-He could be dead in four hours.

14
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,823
Never mind. Dr. Forster, MRI.

15
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:20,056
-A right, two lefts, elevator to two.
-Okay.

16
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,699
Follow the signs.
Hustle back here for rounds.

17
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,364
Dr. Kly...

18
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:30,465
-Are you taking me somewhere?
-I certainly hope so, sir.

19
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,441
-How are you feeling today?
-Am...? Am I gonna make it?

20
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,340
Yes. Absolutely.

21
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:42,453
Alex!

22
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:46,990
I made my famous spinach pie.
The trailer's nice and toasty.

23
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:49,058
I can't.

24
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:55,524
Look, it's really cold out here.
Don't get sick on me or anything.

25
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,227
I never get sick.

26
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:03,171
So I heard you bought a house,
and apparently I'm the last one to know.

27
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,776
I thought I mentioned that.

28
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,707
Wait.

29
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,678
Where?

30
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,181
Outside of town.
Up the shore a little bit.

31
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,080
Up the shore? There's no houses...

32
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:17,224
Oh, God. You don't mean that thing
with the stilts and the...?

33
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,194
-You all right?
-Yeah. Are you crazy?

34
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,229
Why would you take that house, Alex?

35
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:30,098
It's made of glass. There's no privacy.

36
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:31,966
Mona?

37
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,705
Get yourself some boots.

38
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,708
Hey, Gonzalez!

39
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,454
-Four-thirty.
-You lost?

40
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,716
-Yeah.
-Takes a while to get your bearings.

41
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:53,054
-I'm Madhvi.
-Kate Forster. Hi.

42
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:56,663
Oh, wrong floor.
Where'd you do your residency?

43
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,663
Just a little community hospital
up on the North Shore.

44
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,860
Dear new tenant,
welcome to your new home.

45
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,824
As the previous tenant, let me say...

46
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:28,999
...I hope you'll like living here
as much as I did.

47
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,294
I filed the change of address
with the post office...

48
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:34,836
...but you know
what a crapshoot that can be.

49
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:38,702
So if anything slips through, would you
do me a favor and forward my mail?

50
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:42,606
I'd appreciate it.
My new address is below.

51
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:46,648
Thanks in advance. P. S:

52
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:51,346
"Sorry about the paw prints by the front
door. They were there when I moved in.

53
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:54,850
Same with the box in the attic."

54
00:06:56,695 --> 00:07:00,961
Paw prints?
What the hell is she talking about?

55
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:18,484
Hey, baby girl. Hi. Hi. Hey.

56
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,722
Fix the light.

57
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,860
Get dog food, huh?

58
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,837
Get human food.

59
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,398
Hey. Hey.

60
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,437
Hey, come here.

61
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:29,582
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.
Can't be Chicago.

62
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,158
The TV says it's global warming.

63
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,128
The icebergs start melting,
water covers the Earth.

64
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,994
Thank God we won't live to see it.

65
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,836
What's this?

66
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,608
That's nothing.
It's one of your father's.

67
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:48,244
-Dostoyevsky?
-Oh, yeah.

68
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:54,916
It's about a guy who breaks the neck
of a poor woman with an axe...

69
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,919
...and, so far, keeps wandering
around regretting it.

70
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,726
This is good.

71
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:07,330
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. It's really good.

72
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,522
I'll meet you there.

73
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,133
What are you thinking?

74
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,035
My folks are coming into town.

75
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:14,932
Nothing.

76
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,372
When your father passed away,
it was hard. It still is hard.

77
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:24,481
Holding his books,
I feel like he's with me somehow.

78
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:27,447
Knowing that he was once
on the same pages...

79
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,814
...reading the same words.

80
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:38,656
Oh, my God!
Somebody call an ambulance!

81
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:41,026
We need an ambulance at Daley Plaza.

82
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,202
A man has been struck by a bus.
Get an EMT crew here. Sir...

83
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,268
Get out the street.
Get on the sidewalk.

84
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,269
-On the sidewalk. Off the street.
-Sir?

85
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:50,999
Get on the sidewalk!
Get on the sidewalk!

86
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:54,477
I'd like to get the foundation
on number 17 dug today.

87
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,846
Look, I know you're
kind of new around here, kid.

88
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,678
What?

89
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:03,014
I can't get to 17 until
at least next week.

90
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:06,215
Come on, Mulhern.
That's bullshit and you know it.

91
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,724
Take Clemens and Rodriguez
off of roofing.

92
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,591
Jorge can run the backhoe
they're not using on 14...

93
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:13,993
...and grab four or five
of those other guys...

94
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,500
...who are doing nothing
on seven and 10.

95
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:20,299
Paulie, Carlos, Frank, Danny,
and what's-his-name, the tall guy?

96
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,999
-Rafael.
-Rafael.

97
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:26,009
-Let's go.
-Okay.

98
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,738
-Ready?
-Yeah.

99
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,281
-Well, I need it to 10 and 11.
-Hey!

100
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:36,755
Housekeeping ER
to the Suture Room, please.

101
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,451
Housekeeping ER to the Suture Room.

102
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,061
-Hey.
-Hi.

103
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:49,101
I heard about Daley Plaza.

104
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,634
EMT said you fought hard for the guy.

105
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,043
Yeah. Really knocked myself out.

106
00:10:56,712 --> 00:11:00,773
Kate, I'm going to tell you
what I tell every young doctor.

107
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,976
Hopefully, you'll be the first to listen.

108
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:09,886
On your day off, get as far away
from this place as you can.

109
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:15,395
Go someplace where you feel
most like yourself.

110
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:12,416
Dear Ms. Forster:

111
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,956
I got your note...

112
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,425
...and I'm afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

113
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,566
As far as I know, the lake house
has been empty for several years.

114
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:25,328
Maybe your note was intended for
the Sandburg house down the shore...

115
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:29,030
"...since no one has lived
in this house for years.

116
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:33,170
But I'm curious about the paw prints."

117
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,147
Dear Mr. Wyler, I'm very familiar
with the Sandburg cottage...

118
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,881
...and I can guarantee
I never lived there.

119
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:48,858
I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet.

120
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,030
So let me try again.

121
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:54,394
I used to live at the lake house,
then I moved.

122
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:58,231
Now I live at 1620 North Racine
in Chicago.

123
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:01,499
I'd appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any.

124
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,475
Oh, by the way, it's 2006.

125
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,274
Has been all year, ask anyone.

126
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,984
2006?

127
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,885
What does she mean, 2006?

128
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:16,524
God.

129
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,780
Oh, God.

130
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,091
-Good morning, Mr. Wyler.
-Morning, Mr. Wyler.

131
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,789
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, morning.

132
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,797
Hello, Mr. Wyler.

133
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:29,271
Mr. Wyler.

134
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,937
Sir.

135
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,373
Well, obviously,
I derived my inspiration...

136
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,811
...for the metaphor
of the fugue, the loop...

137
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,313
Yeah.

138
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,440
-Two hours of that shit. You kidding me?
-What are you talking about?

139
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:12,173
-He didn't say a word.
-Sadistic, bitter, bitter old man.

140
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,351
I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

141
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,987
Where are you going?

142
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,133
Man, I love that place.

143
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,326
I can't believe that thing's
still running.

144
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,959
Yep.

145
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,701
You look like shit.

146
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,334
I missed you too.

147
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,389
Hey, forget about him.

148
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,890
-Condos.
-Riviera Estates.

149
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,897
-You're joking.
-I don't believe this.

150
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,933
I come back after four years...

151
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,038
...and I get this in front of me.
-What?

152
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,368
My brother thinking
he's Frank Lloyd Whatever.

153
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,545
-Oh, come on.
-Dad keeps you hostage...

154
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:47,442
...in that little
mythmaking factory of his...

155
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:51,015
...while you haven't built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage.

156
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,881
That's funny you say that, actually.

157
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:56,148
I have a hamster cage in mind.
A development of them, actually.

158
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:59,521
Prefab, no foundations.
What do you think about that?

159
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:02,926
See, that's what I'm talking about.
You have vision.

160
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,796
Speaking of which...

161
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:09,300
...l'd like you to know
I bought a house.

162
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:11,531
-Where?
-On the lake.

163
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:13,909
A lake house.
So you are making some money.

164
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,567
Well, it's a dump.
Been abandoned for years, but...

165
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,043
So you got an abandoned,
haunted lake hou...

166
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,806
That's as good a reason as any...

167
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,814
...for selling out and joining
the flabby-developers' guild.

168
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:27,421
-How about this? I even got a dog.
-You got a dog?

169
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:33,392
He just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere.

170
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:48,138
-What are we doing here?
-I have to deliver a letter.

171
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:52,783
It should be here.
1620 North Racine.

172
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,781
But...

173
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:00,351
...there's nothing here.

174
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,758
Are we meeting someone?
Does somebody live here? What?

175
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:07,859
Yeah.

176
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,294
I thought so.

177
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,929
Should we ring the bell?

178
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,550
Dear Ms. Forster:

179
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,489
I went to 1620 North Racine,
and it's not there.

180
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,887
It's just a construction site.

181
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:43,193
From the pictures it looks nice,
but not for another 18 months.

182
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,371
What am I missing here?

183
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:49,064
Maybe you got the address wrong,
because you got the date wrong too.

184
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,142
You really wanna play this game.

185
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:58,281
If you are truly in the year 2004...

186
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,284
...then...

187
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,650
...be forewarned.

188
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:11,922
Remember that day?
You were not happy. Remember that?

189
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,328
I know.

190
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,870
Okay, my mystery correspondent,
I get it.

191
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:21,439
Just in case you really are
where and when you think you are...

192
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,234
...you'll need this.

193
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,744
There was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick.

194
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:31,578
So plenty of rest, lots of fluids.
Doctor's orders.

195
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,687
Snow. Right.

196
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:42,330
Yeah, come to papa.

197
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:20,361
Jackie.

198
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:23,297
Jack.

199
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:26,831
Jack, come on. Come on, girl.
Come on, come on. Jack.

200
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,249
"Lmpossible, I know. Not possible...

201
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,683
...but it's happening."

202
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:30,869
Okay.

203
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,806
Where am I?

204
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:43,744
Very clever.

205
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:47,780
"The lake house."

206
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,217
The lake house. As you can see,
I, too, am at the lake house...

207
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,558
...but I'm getting tired of these games
so I'm leaving, okay? Bye.

208
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:55,960
Thank you. Bye.

209
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,732
Maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly.

210
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,278
I'm a doctor,
dedicated to curing the sick.

211
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,342
At least, trying to.

212
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,817
I'm an architect. I like to build.

213
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:18,852
And while I wouldn't say
my current project is ideal...

214
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,153
...it allows me to be here, in this place,
and that's enough for now.

215
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:28,455
But tell me something. If you're working
in a hospital in Chicago now...

216
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,601
...where were you before, in my time?

217
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,997
Two years ago, in your time...

218
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:38,302
...I was working
in internal medicine in Madison.

219
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:42,644
Tell me about the future.

220
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,379
What's it like in the year 2006?

221
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,450
I'm afraid the world's
pretty much the same.

222
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:55,650
Of course, we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars...

223
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:59,592
...and no one talks anymore
because we can read each other's minds.

224
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,894
But the truth is, man from the past...

225
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:06,663
...not much has really changed
in 2006.

226
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:12,172
Speaking of the past, though,
I've been thinking about the paw prints.

227
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:16,577
-How is that possible?
-Well, I think we have the same dog.

228
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,875
Oh, yeah? What's yours like?

229
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,887
According to the vet,
mine is eight years old in my time...

230
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,116
...six in yours.

231
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:32,122
She's skinny, has sad eyes, snores,
and sleeps like a person.

232
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,631
I don't know why, but I call her Jack.

233
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:36,827
Hello, Jack.

234
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:42,567
It's nice out here.

235
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:46,076
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

236
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,215
-Hey.
-We have to eat.

237
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:51,011
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be asleep.

238
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,580
I'll cook.

239
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:55,649
I thought you didn't like to cook.

240
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,553
No, I don't like to cook.

241
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,785
Is she gonna marry him?

242
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:04,592
-What do you think?
-I don't know. He's kind of old.

243
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:07,963
-Where are you going?
-Okay, he's not that old.

244
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,369
My mom's last boyfriend was bald.

245
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,473
He was nice...

246
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,440
...but my mom didn't marry him.
-No?

247
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:18,545
"There's always something better
coming around the corner."

248
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,114
That's what she says.

249
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:25,112
Maybe that's what that lady should do.
Wait for something better...

250
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:28,290
...to come around the corner.
-Maybe.

251
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:34,060
But if she's not careful,
she could spend her whole life waiting.

252
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,331
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?

253
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:40,129
Yes. What about
a nice bottle of wine...

254
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,463
...to celebrate?

255
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,732
-What time shall I come back?
-Seven o'clock.

256
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,707
Sorry I haven't made it
to the mailbox lately.

257
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:52,849
It's been a long week. All night shifts.

258
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,212
Good to hear from you.
I thought you left me.

259
00:24:56,421 --> 00:25:00,152
You should know that you're
my only connection to the future.

260
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,023
How come we never talk
about the things we like?

261
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:07,854
Well, let's see.
Reading the classics to Jack.

262
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:11,227
-Who's his favorite?
-Dostoyevsky.

263
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:15,099
For me, this city,
on a day when the light is so clear...

264
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,934
...that I can touch every detail...

265
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,805
...every brick and window
in the buildings I love.

266
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:24,608
Come on, take a walk with me
this Saturday. Let me show you.

267
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:28,253
You're crazy. Why are you going
through all this trouble for me?

268
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:31,480
No trouble. Summer's here.

269
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:47,800
Okay, your turn. Favorite things.

270
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:50,841
Where to start? Okay.

271
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:54,138
When I smell the flowers
before I see them.

272
00:25:54,348 --> 00:25:58,648
When it starts to rain
just as the picnic is ending.

273
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:02,720
And I love the smell of Jack's paws.

274
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:05,552
You didn't forget
to mention your husband, did you?

275
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:10,021
Well, of course I love my husband,
who is also a doctor.

276
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:12,665
Plastic surgeon
for small farm animals.

277
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,165
Good. I'm married too.

278
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,828
I've got eight children,
and none of them look like me.

279
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,203
-I'm worried, Kate.
-I would be too.

280
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,009
I'm single.

281
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,609
Me too.

282
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:31,516
Number 27.

283
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,881
She's a beauty.
My father used to tell me...

284
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,956
...she was the grandma
for all the houses in the city.

285
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:40,628
He used to take me on walks
like I'm taking you now.

286
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:44,328
-Alex?
-Kate?

287
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:47,366
I wish we could have
done this walk together.

288
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,249
So, what do you think?

289
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:06,988
He sounds like a nice boy.

290
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,853
Sounds like a nice boy.
Anything else?

291
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,393
-He has wonderful penmanship.
-Mother...

292
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:15,964
...look at the date on the letter.
The date.

293
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,657
-You mean the time thing?
-Yes.

294
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,496
-That's just a detail.
-Just a detail?

295
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,674
About the...
The other day...

296
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,787
...it was not a good moment.
I was in a hell of a hurry.

297
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,750
Of course.

298
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,320
You've got some nice pieces here.

299
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,328
Oh, yeah. Music's fine, music helps.

300
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,694
It's like Nietzsche says:

301
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:53,200
-"Life would be senseless..."
-"Without music."

302
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,006
I guess I told you that, huh?

303
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,641
Pour yourself a drink.

304
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:01,109
Can you appreciate
a good wine by now?

305
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,214
You bet.

306
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,144
You know, you'll have to forgive
your father for being curious...

307
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,516
...but where have you been
all these years?

308
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:14,122
I thought your Kerouac days
were behind you.

309
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:17,926
-I'm sorry, what?
-What?

310
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,656
Oh, you can come up, if you like.

311
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,004
What are you working on?

312
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,239
Oh, I'm just...
I'm just remembering things.

313
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:38,144
It's not such an easy job,
let me tell you.

314
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:41,321
Nor is it particularly innocent,
in my case.

315
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:44,889
Your father is writing his memoirs.

316
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:48,255
-Are we in it?
-What do you think?

317
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,192
Do you wanna be?

318
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:52,731
Do you?

319
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:56,562
Of course.
You were all a part of your father's life.

320
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,932
Why are you talking to me
in the third person?

321
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:01,769
Well, l... I don't...

322
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,343
Because I'm writing about myself,
I suppose. Why, doesn't it suit you?

323
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:11,709
I thought you might like these.

324
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,920
What are these?
Something you've been working on?

325
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,992
No, they're... They're yours.

326
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:23,256
From a house I just bought
on the lake.

327
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,031
Oh, yes, I heard. They said
some sleazy little condo developer...

328
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:30,228
...had snapped it up.

329
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:33,872
Oh, come on. Indulge your father.

330
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,069
Can't you take a little joke,
for God's sake?

331
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,211
Come on.

332
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,111
Tell me.

333
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,780
Where have you been?
I really want to know.

334
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,511
I was trying to forget you.

335
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:50,590
Or forgive you.

336
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:54,089
Did you succeed?

337
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,095
No.

338
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,466
Let me know
if you need any help remembering.

339
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:10,538
Oh, yeah, I will.

340
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:14,944
Charging 360. Get 1 milligram of epi.
Have 300 amio ready in case we need it.

341
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:17,780
-All clear?
-Clear.

342
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:22,051
Hold compression, start bagging.

343
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:23,558
He's got a rhythm. Slow.

344
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:26,356
-Do we have a pulse with that?
-We got a pulse, thready.

345
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,498
-It's getting stronger.
-Long days, these days.

346
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,430
I just worked 30 hours straight.

347
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:34,128
Every time I stop to take a breath...

348
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:37,604
...I realize how isolated
I've let myself become.

349
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:42,714
Believe me,
you can get a bit desperate.

350
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,818
That one? Okay. There you go.

351
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,218
Nice move. Very nice. Nice.

352
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,886
It's not that I'm complaining,
I love my work.

353
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,464
And our tour through Chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty.

354
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:04,603
But my heart still misses
the lake house...

355
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:07,000
...and its trees.

356
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,536
I miss those trees so much.

357
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,318
Don't worry, Kate.
We'll be together in time.

358
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:34,894
Even if we're far apart,
I'll find a way to be close to you...

359
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:37,123
...and take care of you.

360
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:44,304
Katerina.

361
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:47,506
Take this.

362
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:50,846
-You should eat more. You too skinny.
-I'm not too skinny.

363
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:54,280
Remember how you used to eat
when you were little?

364
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,214
-With your hands.
-Yes, I remember.

365
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,254
Now, did you or did you not
write to each other?

366
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,524
-To your father?
-No, to Clark Gable.

367
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,354
Yes, to Dad.

368
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,528
I...

369
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,493
What, Mom?

370
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:14,729
Before your father...

371
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,669
Yeah?

372
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:21,741
-There was this boy.

373
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,150
Did you love him?

374
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:27,714
Yeah.

375
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,653
Well, why didn't you marry him?

376
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,864
So that you could ask me
this question someday.

377
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:53,070
Looks smaller.

378
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,279
When did he complete it?

379
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,879
You weren't born yet,
and I was 8.

380
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,653
Corbusier meets Frank Lloyd Wright.

381
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:12,356
You know, Dad played cards
with both of them.

382
00:34:13,435 --> 00:34:16,893
-Sharing a joint.
-Yeah, well...

383
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:19,440
Can't swim.

384
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,505
There should be a stairway
down to the water, a porch, a deck.

385
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,547
Here, you're in a...
In a box.

386
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:30,013
A glass box with a view
to everything that's around you...

387
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,685
...but you can't touch it.

388
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:36,222
No interconnection
between you and what you're looking at.

389
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:39,258
I don't know, you know.
He's got this big maple growing...

390
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:42,454
...right in the middle of the house.
-Containment.

391
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:49,531
Containment and control.

392
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,367
This house is about ownership,
not connection.

393
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:59,779
I mean, it's beautiful. Seductive, even.

394
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:02,952
But it's incomplete.

395
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:07,086
It was all about him.

396
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:11,159
Dad knew how to build a house,
not a home.

397
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:13,493
But you know...

398
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:16,665
...I think he wants us to do
what he couldn't.

399
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,460
But admitting that...

400
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,232
...would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way...

401
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:26,307
...that he could do more.

402
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:28,570
And that tortures him.

403
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:32,405
Do you remember
being here with Mom?

404
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,316
I remember she tried
to make it work here...

405
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,460
...with us...

406
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:46,689
...with him.

407
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,495
Hey, what about Visionary Vanguard?

408
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:53,297
-What about it?
-Come on.

409
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,340
You can't convince me you're gonna
be happy building saltboxes for tourists.

410
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:00,107
Nobody's gonna admire you for that.

411
00:36:00,312 --> 00:36:03,372
-Admire me for that?
-Yeah, Visionary Vanguard.

412
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,140
That's your idea.

413
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,184
I can't. But you can keep the name.

414
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,516
No, come on.
It's gotta be you and me.

415
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:13,488
Henry, I'm sorry, I can't.

416
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,183
I just...

417
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:18,625
-What?
-I've got other plans.

418
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:20,823
You have a girlfriend?

419
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:23,727
No...

420
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,666
No.

421
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,167
-What is that? You hesitated.
-No, I didn't hesitate.

422
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:33,378
Come on, man.
I don't have any time for that.

423
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,941
What does time have to do with it?

424
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:40,084
Oh, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

425
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:47,460
My dearest Mr. Wyler:

426
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:50,392
Are you willing to play a game
with me?

427
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:54,264
Two years ago today,
I was taking the 145 train to Madison...

428
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,870
...from the Riverside station
and I forgot something there.

429
00:36:58,073 --> 00:37:00,598
It was a gift from my father.

430
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:05,069
If you find it,
can you please put it in the mailbox?

431
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,208
It would mean a lot.

432
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,748
Yours, Kate.

433
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:32,497
-Final call for the 5:46 to Madison.
-Do you really wanna know? Come on.

434
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,904
-All aboard.
-Okay.

435
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:46,614
I'll call you.

436
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:31,300
Kate, I found it. I have it with me.

437
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:34,200
One day I'll get it to you. Trust me.

438
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,432
I know how important it is to you.

439
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:42,147
You might not remember,
but we saw each other.

440
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:44,441
At least, I saw you.

441
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:49,849
You never told me
how beautiful you are.

442
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,581
Well, maybe you saw somebody else.

443
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:55,284
That was a bad hair year for me.

444
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:58,828
Long brown hair.
Gentle, unguarded eyes.

445
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,897
Okay, okay, okay.

446
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,965
You saw me.

447
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:05,798
But I still don't know
what you look like.

448
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:10,832
Well, why don't we just get together
in the future...

449
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,707
...and you can let me know
what you think.

450
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:16,479
It's a date.

451
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:21,177
Okay.

452
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:25,723
Why don't you call me
July 10th, 2006...

453
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:31,160
...at 9:05 p.m.

454
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,214
-Hello.
-Kate?

455
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:51,250
-Yes.
-It's Morgan.

456
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:55,748
Morgan.

457
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,860
I'm in Chicago. I came for a meeting,
but it was canceled...

458
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:00,791
...so I thought I'd give you a call.

459
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,725
Hey, have you eaten?

460
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:07,425
-No, but I'm not...
-Neither have I. I realized I'm starving.

461
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,230
-We could grab a quick bite.
-Okay.

462
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,305
-Yeah?
-All right.

463
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:16,171
-Hey, wait up.
-Watch out, man.

464
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,243
-All right.
-Looks pretty good.

465
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,916
-Perfect.
-No, Morgan, it's...

466
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,449
-It's not.
-No, no, trust me.

467
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,154
It's... Okay.

468
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,886
Hi there.

469
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,253
One sec.
Could you hold on for a moment?

470
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,827
-We'd love a table for two.
-The name?

471
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,563
We don't...
We don't have a reservation.

472
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,669
I'm sorry, sir,
we're booked until October.

473
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:41,896
October?

474
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,005
Well...

475
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,806
...l'll get back to you.

476
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,114
That went well.

477
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,582
It's no big deal.

478
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:00,990
Oh, come on, stop it.

479
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,094
It's the best restaurant in town.
Nobody gets a table here.

480
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,823
-No, it's not that.
-Well, what is it?

481
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:13,430
I didn't do this right.

482
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,465
-There wasn't a meeting.
-You'd see me if there was no big deal.

483
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:18,769
-Lf it was just...
-Ambush.

484
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,811
-You know, coffee,
and coffee can turn into dinner...

485
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,472
...dinner can turn into...
-Turn into what?

486
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,880
I do sometimes
get a few steps ahead of myself.

487
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,183
Morgan, a few steps?
You're always leaping 10 steps ahead.

488
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,484
We were dating, what, a week?

489
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:38,631
And you had our entire future
mapped out for us?

490
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:42,891
In my residency, you were picking out
real estate. I'd go to your house...

491
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:46,401
...you'd have the entire town
in your house to meet me.

492
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,474
I do seem to remember that you made
pretty fast friends with one of them.

493
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:51,905
What are you talking about?

494
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,578
You know what
I'm talking about.

495
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:54,804
-That guy.
-What guy?

496
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:58,383
-The guy I caught you making out with.
-I wasn't making out with him.

497
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,679
What, are we in junior high school
right now?

498
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:02,879
What do you call it, then?

499
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:05,685
A kiss.

500
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:09,920
It was just one kiss
with some random guy that just...

501
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,495
Years... You know what?

502
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,224
Gentlemen...

503
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:18,031
...unit 381 on Riviera Estates
is complete.

504
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,742
Congratulations.
You did a good job.

505
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,849
-One down...
-Forty-four to go.

506
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,384
We're not terrifyingly behind schedule,
just alarmingly.

507
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:35,318
It'll be okay.
The guys are getting to know their job...

508
00:42:35,524 --> 00:42:37,754
...but we could use
another backhoe.

509
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,860
And the water on 14
needs to be resealed.

510
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,553
Shut up.

511
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:44,928
-What?
-I'm kind of disappointed in you.

512
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:48,434
-Why?
-You're supposed to be on top of things.

513
00:42:48,638 --> 00:42:52,369
-I thought I was.
-Well, you never noticed these.

514
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:55,203
Remember?
You told me to get them.

515
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:56,910
Right, right.

516
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,445
Not exactly what I had in mind, but...

517
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:02,113
-You like them?
-I like them.

518
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:07,290
I think we should go out. Tonight.
If you're not doing any...

519
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,653
Jack? Jack.

520
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:11,259
Hey, Jack.

521
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:16,630
Jack!

522
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:19,092
Come on, Jack!

523
00:43:19,503 --> 00:43:22,233
Alex, wait for me!

524
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:24,738
Jack!

525
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,748
Jack!

526
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,145
Jack!

527
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:46,397
Jack!

528
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:57,975
-Yours, I take it?
-Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

529
00:43:58,211 --> 00:43:59,542
Come here, Jack.

530
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:02,773
What were you thinking, huh, girl?
What were you thinking?

531
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:05,941
-She's never run off like that.
-You gotta keep an eye on them.

532
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,245
-What's his name?
-Her. Jack.

533
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,548
Jack. It's a good name for a girl.

534
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:13,751
I should get one like you
for my girlfriend. She loves dogs.

535
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:16,623
-Hey, have we met before?
-No, don't think so.

536
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:19,959
-Morgan Price.
-Alex Wyler.

537
00:44:20,268 --> 00:44:22,293
-Hey, man, you need a hand with this?
-Yeah.

538
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:23,902
-Okay.
-Lived here long?

539
00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:26,335
Just a few months.
I've got a place on the lake.

540
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:29,908
-The lake, really? I've been thinking...
-Alex. Oh, good.

541
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:33,302
-Thank God you found him.
-Yeah.

542
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:35,482
Mona, Morgan. Morgan, Mona.

543
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,708
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

544
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,013
-It's good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

545
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:41,654
Nice boots there.

546
00:44:41,857 --> 00:44:44,758
Just so you don't think
I'm gonna drink all this by myself...

547
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,657
...l'm having friends over tonight for
a party. You two are welcome to come.

548
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:51,622
Oh, hey, Alex.

549
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,599
Take my card. I might be looking...

550
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:57,101
...to rent a place on the lake myself.
-Okay.

551
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:00,538
It's Kate, my girlfriend,
she's never really liked this place...

552
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:05,111
...and I promised we'd look for something
new once she finishes her residency.

553
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,181
So if you hear of anything...

554
00:45:08,151 --> 00:45:11,120
-Sure. She's a doctor?
-Yeah.

555
00:45:12,455 --> 00:45:13,820
Alex.

556
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,765
-Great to meet you, Morgan.
-Great to meet you.

557
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:28,533
Hey, Morgan,
what time's that party at?

558
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:31,903
Eight o'clock. It's Kate's birthday.

559
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:39,209
It's Kate birthday.

560
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,384
Come on, Jack.

561
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,370
-Hi.
-Hi.

562
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:12,574
-What can I get you?
-Glass of white wine, please.

563
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,059
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

564
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:46,946
According to most accepted
social norms...

565
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:51,284
...a person should not drink alone
after 10 p. M...

566
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:53,891
...unless they have a good excuse.

567
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,063
What's yours?

568
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,627
Gosh, don't have one.

569
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:00,595
I do.

570
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:03,995
My youngest left for college
this morning.

571
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,001
Marie.

572
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:09,835
One day she's splashing
around a wading pool in diapers...

573
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:14,311
...then she's packing up a Volvo
and driving to California.

574
00:47:15,283 --> 00:47:18,583
I just hope she knows
what she's getting into.

575
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:20,445
Don't tell me.

576
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:22,624
-Premed?
-Bingo.

577
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:28,761
-Hey, how are you? Good to see you.
-I'm well, thanks.

578
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:30,955
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

579
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:33,964
Alex, Mona, the Wootch.

580
00:47:34,136 --> 00:47:35,865
-Susan, Johnny.
-Hi.

581
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:38,836
Let's get you something to drink.
Come on. Bar's back here.

582
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,202
Come on.
Hey, this is Marjorie.

583
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:43,506
Why didn't you mention it was today?

584
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:45,840
We would have had a cake for you
or something.

585
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:47,949
Oh, it's just time passing.

586
00:47:48,151 --> 00:47:50,176
I hate making a big deal out of it.

587
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,718
You keep a lot to yourself.

588
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:55,151
Nothing wrong with it.

589
00:47:55,458 --> 00:48:00,054
But I've sometimes wondered what else
you have in your life besides work.

590
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,196
Family? Boyfriend?

591
00:48:02,432 --> 00:48:05,027
Well, I did. Once.

592
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,961
His name was Morgan.

593
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:10,470
Morgan? Morgan.

594
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:12,972
That's a sexy name.

595
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:17,673
Surprise!

596
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:24,017
Happy birthday, Kate.

597
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:28,489
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

598
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:32,394
We got you.

599
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:35,226
-This is Kate, obviously.
-Hi, Kate.

600
00:48:40,105 --> 00:48:41,504
This is Alex and Mona.

601
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:43,263
-Hi.
-Hi.

602
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,601
This guy's gonna help us
find our lake house.

603
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:47,205
Right?

604
00:48:50,182 --> 00:48:51,707
You haven't had cake.

605
00:48:51,884 --> 00:48:54,284
Anyway, well, I ended it.

606
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:58,617
And I'm happy now,
and it was the right thing to do.

607
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:02,793
So who is it you write to?

608
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:06,192
I couldn't help... Every time you get
a break at the hospital...

609
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:09,232
...you're writing something.
-There is someone.

610
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:12,803
It's kind of
a long-distance relationship.

611
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:15,074
-How did you meet?
-We haven't.

612
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:16,936
-What?
-No.

613
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,305
-The story of my life.
-You're kidding.

614
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,947
Keep everything at a distance.

615
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:24,276
Everyone.

616
00:49:24,518 --> 00:49:26,383
The man who was standing
in front of me...

617
00:49:26,553 --> 00:49:28,316
...the one that wanted to marry me...

618
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:30,955
...him, I push away. I run from him.

619
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:34,059
In the meantime, the...

620
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:37,390
The one man I can never meet...

621
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:42,560
...him, I would like to give
my whole heart to.

622
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,400
He must write one hell of a letter.

623
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:49,910
It's nice.

624
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,944
It's safe.

625
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,479
-Christ, he's in prison, isn't he?
-No.

626
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:57,810
-You're one of those women, aren't you?
-No.

627
00:49:58,052 --> 00:50:02,319
No, he's just a guy who lives on a lake.
He's an architect.

628
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,282
Oh, my God.

629
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,215
Happy birthday.

630
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:38,824
Thank you.

631
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:43,124
-I hope it's a great year for you.
-Thank you.

632
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:46,966
I'm Alex.

633
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:49,336
The lake-house guy.

634
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,134
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

635
00:51:04,755 --> 00:51:06,347
May I?

636
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:16,724
So you're gonna... You're gonna
find us a place on the lake, huh?

637
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:18,232
-I hope so.
-Yeah.

638
00:51:18,437 --> 00:51:19,768
If I can.

639
00:51:20,005 --> 00:51:21,870
You're a real-estate agent?

640
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:26,067
No, l...
I just have a lake house.

641
00:51:27,145 --> 00:51:28,271
Is it nice?

642
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:31,949
Yeah, you'll love it.
You're gonna rent it after I move out.

643
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:33,447
Oh, really?

644
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:41,556
Kate, have you...

645
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:44,456
...read Persuasion?

646
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:49,598
What?

647
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,566
-By Jane Austen.
-I know who it's by.

648
00:51:53,373 --> 00:51:56,707
Yeah, it's...
It's my favorite book.

649
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,243
Why did you bring something like that up?
What made you bring that up?

650
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:05,214
I just... A friend of mine gave it
to me recently, and I was wondering...

651
00:52:05,786 --> 00:52:07,720
...what it was about.

652
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:11,482
It's... It's wonderful.

653
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,249
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

654
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,553
It's about...

655
00:52:16,697 --> 00:52:18,562
About waiting.

656
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:23,927
These two people, they...
They... They meet.

657
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:28,337
They almost fall in love,
but the timing isn't right.

658
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,806
They... They have to part.

659
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:32,943
And then...

660
00:52:33,348 --> 00:52:35,282
...years later, they...
They meet again.

661
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:37,781
They get another chance.

662
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:43,219
You know, but they don't know
if too much time has passed.

663
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,156
If they waited too long, if it's...

664
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:50,662
...you know,
too late to make it work.

665
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,838
Why do you like that?

666
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,939
I don't know.

667
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:01,507
Don't get me wrong.
It's beautiful in a kind of...

668
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:04,804
-No, it's terrible.
-It's terrible.

669
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:08,280
-That's terrible.
-It's terrible.

670
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,110
That's...

671
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,016
Yeah, it's... That's terrible.

672
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,288
It's a personal question...

673
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:20,827
...but have you ever been
through anything like that?

674
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,898
-Me? No. No, no.
-No.

675
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:31,672
When I was...

676
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,540
When I was 16...

677
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,846
...I was completely in love
with this guy.

678
00:53:40,852 --> 00:53:42,843
He played guitar...

679
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,719
...and I ran away from home...

680
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:49,484
...and went to San Francisco
so I could go live with him.

681
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:53,927
Yeah, he convinced me
I had a beautiful voice...

682
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,198
...and I dreamed of becoming a singer.

683
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,532
I love San Francisco.

684
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,675
Yeah, he was...
He was my first love.

685
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:08,343
Probably the only one.

686
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:14,012
-He must have been a great guy.
-I don't... I don't know, l...

687
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,551
He may have been. It didn't last
long enough for me to find out.

688
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:20,555
Yeah. Truth is, l...

689
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:23,694
I can't even remember
what he looked like.

690
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,925
-Really?
-Yeah.

691
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:27,827
Then that's too bad.

692
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:31,367
My dad... My dad showed up, actually.

693
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:33,095
-You were in trouble.
-He came in.

694
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:36,866
Yeah, I was in trouble.
He yanked me back to Chicago.

695
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,041
Yeah.

696
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,571
And he was sick, and he...

697
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:47,846
He had these... These dreams
of me becoming a doctor, you know?

698
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:54,450
You know, and eventually,
they became my dreams too.

699
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:59,498
He was right.

700
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:03,763
You know, l...
I feel good helping people.

701
00:55:11,146 --> 00:55:13,239
Then he died.

702
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:20,117
Kate.

703
00:55:22,457 --> 00:55:24,254
What?

704
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:34,628
I...

705
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:39,130
You...?

706
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:47,172
I just...

707
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,044
What?

708
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:55,416
Do you know this song?

709
00:55:57,661 --> 00:55:59,322
Yeah.

710
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:06,959
-Do you sing?
-No.

711
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,367
Nobody wants to hear me sing.
You don't wanna hear me sing.

712
00:56:10,707 --> 00:56:14,371
L... I didn't mean, you know...

713
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:18,805
But, yeah.

714
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:25,081
But I can dance.

715
00:58:45,803 --> 00:58:47,293
Kate.

716
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:50,496
Hey.

717
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:55,207
Alex was... Alex was just telling me
about the... The lake house.

718
00:58:56,848 --> 00:59:00,682
-Yeah, it sounds... Sounds really great.
-Great.

719
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,687
Alex, it's late.

720
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,153
Yeah.

721
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:09,019
Yeah.

722
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:12,219
-Good night.
-Good night.

723
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,155
It was you.

724
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:29,734
-You working tomorrow night?
-Yeah.

725
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:31,871
Why didn't you say anything?

726
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:35,974
You would've thought
I was crazy or drunk. Or both.

727
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,939
Yeah, but...

728
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:41,113
...I liked you.
You should have said something.

729
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:44,183
How? You were with your boyfriend.

730
00:59:44,386 --> 00:59:47,287
You know what? Excuses, excuses.
You are a coward.

731
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,389
I'm not a coward.

732
00:59:49,591 --> 00:59:53,493
Oh, really?
Well, what about your girlfriend?

733
00:59:53,995 --> 00:59:55,826
What? I told you already...

734
00:59:56,064 --> 00:59:59,192
...she's not my girlfriend.
-He's not my boyfriend either.

735
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:03,098
Oh, really? Well, what is he, then?
Your brother?

736
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:08,910
We have a comedian. What'd you have,
a clown for breakfast this morning?

737
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,638
Wonderful. Our first fight.

738
01:00:12,848 --> 01:00:16,807
You could write a song about it
and go sing it in San Francisco.

739
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,853
What?

740
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:24,726
Hello.

741
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,862
Hey, Henry.

742
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:29,629
What?

743
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,665
You'll let me know if you need anything?

744
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:33,665
Yes, I will.

745
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:35,994
-Hi.
-Good afternoon.

746
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,970
I'm looking for my father. I don't know
which room he's in. Simon Wyler?

747
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:42,975
-Mr. Wyler, the architect?
-Yes.

748
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,308
I'm Anna Klyczynski.
I'm the Attending for your father.

749
01:00:46,516 --> 01:00:48,677
Hey. What happened? How is he?

750
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:53,380
He's okay. He's had a heart attack.
Fortunately, relatively minor.

751
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:56,787
His vitals are fine and he's stable...

752
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:59,054
...but it will require an intervention.

753
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:02,323
He's agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow.

754
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:20,045
Good to see you're taking it easy.

755
01:01:20,853 --> 01:01:24,914
Well, you... You didn't need to come.
I'm perfectly well.

756
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,349
Perfectly all right.

757
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,993
Well, you had a heart attack, Dad.

758
01:01:30,195 --> 01:01:33,528
I had an episode, for chrissake.

759
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,667
Nothing more.

760
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:39,702
Appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective.

761
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:45,309
Well then, I just wanna let you know
I'm here if you need anything.

762
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:49,244
Coffee.

763
01:01:49,682 --> 01:01:51,377
What?

764
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:53,615
You heard me.

765
01:01:56,022 --> 01:01:57,853
Coffee.

766
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:01,923
There's something
I never told you, Kate.

767
01:02:02,129 --> 01:02:04,597
You see, it was my father
who built the lake house.

768
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:07,858
I mean, with his own hands.

769
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:10,902
And it was a long time ago,
before he was famous...

770
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:14,336
...when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother.

771
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:18,342
Her name was Mary,
and the house was a gift for her.

772
01:02:18,546 --> 01:02:21,380
She was smart and funny.

773
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:25,246
She could have done anything, but chose
to take care of my brother and I...

774
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,251
...and help him build his career.

775
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:31,483
You see, the more successful he became,
the more impossible he was to live with.

776
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:35,287
Finally, she just couldn't take
living with him anymore.

777
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:38,432
She left him.

778
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:40,760
Within a year, she got sick.

779
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:44,633
Unfortunately, she never learned
how to stop loving him.

780
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:48,275
He wasn't at the funeral.

781
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,876
When I asked him why...

782
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,418
Go on, Alex. What did he say?

783
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:08,125
He said, "She was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house."

784
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:15,435
And then he gave me
one of his architect-of-the-year grins.

785
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:31,717
I hope you appreciate this.

786
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:34,686
I had to sneak past
three nurses and your Attending.

787
01:03:34,926 --> 01:03:37,224
Oh, jeez, it's hot.

788
01:03:37,562 --> 01:03:38,961
It's not decaf, is it?

789
01:03:39,164 --> 01:03:41,029
It should be, but it isn't.

790
01:03:44,736 --> 01:03:47,364
That's not bad. Thank you...

791
01:03:47,572 --> 01:03:49,199
...son.

792
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,534
-You're welcome.
-Where's your brother?

793
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,838
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

794
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:57,948
-You know how he is, he worries.
-Yeah, I know.

795
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,243
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

796
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,487
She always worried too much.

797
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:04,383
What are you looking at?

798
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:06,988
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

799
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:10,560
It's a proposal for a museum.

800
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,960
-Who is it?
-Someone new.

801
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:18,167
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

802
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:19,998
What are the materials?

803
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:22,398
Granite. Aluminum.

804
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,077
White panels
are straight out of Meier...

805
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:29,612
...but the interior color coming through
the front windows, that's different.

806
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,783
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

807
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,715
I like it.

808
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,349
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

809
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:43,596
Years ago, with you, Mom and Henry.

810
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:46,426
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

811
01:04:47,602 --> 01:04:49,229
The almshouse.

812
01:04:49,437 --> 01:04:51,905
That's right. You mentioned Meier.

813
01:04:52,106 --> 01:04:57,009
His Barcelona museum stands
in the same area as Casa de la Caritat.

814
01:04:57,211 --> 01:04:59,202
It drinks the same light.

815
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:04,317
Meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light...

816
01:05:04,553 --> 01:05:09,320
...and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within, but indirectly.

817
01:05:09,558 --> 01:05:14,552
And that was important,
because although light enhances art...

818
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:19,564
...it can also degrade it. But you know
all that already, you son of a gun.

819
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:21,635
Now, this...

820
01:05:23,572 --> 01:05:25,597
...where do you suppose
this is to be built?

821
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:26,833
I have no idea.

822
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,444
-Oh, but you said you liked it.
-Conceptually.

823
01:05:29,612 --> 01:05:31,842
Now, come on.

824
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,743
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona...

825
01:05:34,951 --> 01:05:37,317
...is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

826
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:40,581
And the light in Tokyo
is different from that in Prague.

827
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:46,786
A truly great structure, one that
is meant to stand the tests of time...

828
01:05:46,996 --> 01:05:49,487
...never disregards its environment.

829
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:51,497
An architect takes that into account.

830
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:56,435
He knows that if he wants presence,
he must consult with nature.

831
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,043
He must be captivated by the light.

832
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:04,942
Always the light. Always.

833
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,838
Hey. I have an emergency.
Take my shift. Please.

834
01:07:07,848 --> 01:07:09,372
Hello.

835
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,211
-Mr. Wyler?
-Yes.

836
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:15,616
This is Dr. Klyczynski
at Chicago City Hospital.

837
01:07:16,356 --> 01:07:19,848
I'm afraid I have some
difficult news for you.

838
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,223
I'm so sorry, Alex.

839
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:29,561
I wish somehow
I could be there with you...

840
01:07:30,104 --> 01:07:33,801
...that we could sit together and look
out over the water and the light...

841
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,942
...in this house your father built.

842
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:42,814
I could be a shoulder for you
like you've been for me.

843
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:46,179
And tell you that
everything is gonna be okay.

844
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,923
If I could do one thing for you today...

845
01:07:51,126 --> 01:07:53,185
...from here...

846
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:56,990
...one small, simple thing
from the future...

847
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,590
...I hope this is it.

848
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:03,733
It won't be published
for a couple of years...

849
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:06,601
...but I don't think
you should have to wait that long.

850
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:11,280
I hope it helps you know
how much you were loved.

851
01:09:55,722 --> 01:09:58,122
Pick a place. I'll be there, I promise.

852
01:09:58,358 --> 01:09:59,689
Tomorrow, what do you say?

853
01:09:59,893 --> 01:10:01,724
But, Alex,
it won't be tomorrow for you.

854
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:05,331
-You're gonna have to wait two years.
-I know, I don't care. I'll wait.

855
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:06,864
Are you sure? I don't know.

856
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:09,536
I do. I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

857
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:12,865
Okay. I'll see you in two years, then.

858
01:10:13,074 --> 01:10:15,338
See you tomorrow, then.

859
01:10:15,743 --> 01:10:17,438
Kate...

860
01:10:17,645 --> 01:10:19,636
...where would you like to go?

861
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,111
II Mare.

862
01:10:24,285 --> 01:10:26,276
When were you hoping
to dine with us?

863
01:10:26,487 --> 01:10:28,080
Two years from tomorrow.

864
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,451
-Two years from tomorrow?
-Yeah.

865
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,627
-Two years?
-From tomorrow.

866
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,588
-Hi.
-Hello. Name?

867
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:37,891
Forster.

868
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,432
-Can I have your name?
-Wyler.

869
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:42,162
Or Wyler, I'm...
I'm really not sure.

870
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,568
I think we should be able
to accommodate you.

871
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:45,831
-Great.
-Wyler?

872
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,500
Wyler.

873
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:53,615
Your waiter will be right with you.

874
01:11:17,775 --> 01:11:19,936
Good evening, miss.

875
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:24,046
Complimentary.

876
01:11:34,325 --> 01:11:37,159
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

877
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:02,185
Another glass for the lady?

878
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:31,938
You weren't there.

879
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:34,477
You didn't come.

880
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,654
I don't understand.

881
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:45,987
Something must have happened.
I'm sorry.

882
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:49,063
I've got two years, Kate.
We can try again.

883
01:13:49,266 --> 01:13:53,498
No, Alex, it's too late.

884
01:13:53,703 --> 01:13:57,299
It already happened. It didn't work.

885
01:13:57,508 --> 01:13:59,442
Don't give up on me, Kate.

886
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:03,341
What about Persuasion?
You told me. They wait.

887
01:14:03,581 --> 01:14:05,606
They meet again,
they have another chance.

888
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,944
Life is not a book, Alex.

889
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,643
And it can be over in a second.

890
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:14,222
I was having lunch with my mother
at Daley Plaza...

891
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:17,188
...and a man was killed
right in front of me.

892
01:14:17,395 --> 01:14:19,626
He died in my arms.

893
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:21,356
And I thought:

894
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,866
"It can't end just like that
on Valentine's Day."

895
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:29,797
I thought about all the people
who love him, waiting at home...

896
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,499
...who will never see him again.

897
01:14:33,412 --> 01:14:35,346
And then I thought:

898
01:14:35,547 --> 01:14:37,879
"What if there is no one?"

899
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:44,180
What if you live your whole life
and no one is waiting?

900
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:48,627
So I drove to the lake house
looking for any kind of answer.

901
01:14:48,828 --> 01:14:51,228
And I found you.

902
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:53,865
And I let myself get lost.

903
01:14:54,067 --> 01:14:59,437
Lost in this beautiful fantasy
where time stood still.

904
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:02,272
But it's not real, Alex.

905
01:15:02,508 --> 01:15:07,446
I have to learn to live
the life that I have got.

906
01:15:09,049 --> 01:15:11,244
Please don't write anymore.

907
01:15:11,452 --> 01:15:13,750
Don't try to find me.

908
01:15:14,688 --> 01:15:17,350
Let me let you go.

909
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,571
Hello.

910
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:10,278
What? Sorry, hold on.
I can't hear you. I'll be back, sorry.

911
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,141
Hello. Hold on. Hold on.

912
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:15,278
Hello.

913
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,584
Hi.

914
01:16:25,128 --> 01:16:27,323
How long are you here?

915
01:16:30,534 --> 01:16:33,867
-I'm at a bar with some friends.
-Come.

916
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:36,664
Well, don't get too excited.

917
01:16:38,109 --> 01:16:40,669
I find that hard to believe.

918
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:44,114
It is good.

919
01:16:44,315 --> 01:16:47,307
And it was really good
to hear your voice.

920
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:50,851
I was surprised how good
it was to hear your voice.

921
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:55,482
So how was your meeting?

922
01:16:55,693 --> 01:16:57,820
-It was good.
-Yeah?

923
01:16:58,029 --> 01:17:00,862
Yeah, l... I got the job.

924
01:17:01,065 --> 01:17:03,398
-Really?
-Yeah.

925
01:17:03,836 --> 01:17:05,997
-Well, congratulations.
-Imagine that.

926
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:11,837
Yeah. A telecom company.
I'll be in-house counsel. Pays well.

927
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,137
And it's here...

928
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:15,813
...in Chicago.

929
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:18,377
Well...

930
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:20,677
...it's great news.

931
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,853
Hey.

932
01:17:28,828 --> 01:17:30,523
What?

933
01:17:50,718 --> 01:17:52,208
Jack.

934
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,354
Hey, Jack.

935
01:17:54,688 --> 01:17:56,451
Jack.

936
01:19:16,907 --> 01:19:19,171
Are you gonna
come down this weekend?

937
01:19:21,346 --> 01:19:23,541
Don't you miss me a little bit?

938
01:19:24,215 --> 01:19:26,683
Oh, just a little bit. Not a lot, huh?

939
01:19:27,152 --> 01:19:30,815
Okay. No, I heard you. Yeah.

940
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,955
Kate, I'm gonna
have to call you back, okay?

941
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:53,243
Still wanna rent a lake house?

942
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:56,512
It's what Kate wants.

943
01:19:56,715 --> 01:19:59,309
How the hell do you know
what Kate wants?

944
01:20:00,686 --> 01:20:02,347
Trust me.

945
01:20:14,234 --> 01:20:17,362
Hey, you. I know you.

946
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:26,406
Whatever you want out back.

947
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:58,142
What do you think?

948
01:20:58,747 --> 01:21:00,874
You're fixating. You know?

949
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:03,748
Why do you keep
tweaking the lake house?

950
01:21:03,952 --> 01:21:06,045
Why don't you do your own work?

951
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:08,451
Because it's hers.

952
01:21:08,824 --> 01:21:14,091
You're talking about the girl
from the future.

953
01:21:14,296 --> 01:21:15,958
Kate.

954
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:19,563
And you're still writing with Kate?

955
01:21:19,936 --> 01:21:23,303
-No.
-Why not?

956
01:21:24,774 --> 01:21:26,332
She asked me not to.

957
01:21:27,043 --> 01:21:28,738
Why?

958
01:21:31,047 --> 01:21:32,742
Time.

959
01:21:36,653 --> 01:21:38,177
Hey, come on.

960
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:42,153
This is a good thing.
You know, you need a real woman.

961
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:45,453
-A woman...
-Henry, listen.

962
01:21:46,664 --> 01:21:48,461
Listen to me.

963
01:21:48,932 --> 01:21:53,926
While it lasted, she was
more real to me than any of that stuff.

964
01:21:54,138 --> 01:21:58,268
She was more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

965
01:22:00,477 --> 01:22:02,309
I saw her.

966
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:05,012
I kissed her.

967
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:09,012
I love her.

968
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:14,283
And now she's gone.

969
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:24,964
She's gone.

970
01:22:32,378 --> 01:22:34,005
And Duckett squirts through.

971
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:36,208
First thing...

972
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:40,116
How could the Ab Scissor
four-minute ab machine...?

973
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:42,981
-And your potatoes
cooking on the top.

974
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:46,750
It's nice out here. Let's stay here.

975
01:22:46,992 --> 01:22:48,858
But we have to eat.

976
01:22:49,863 --> 01:22:53,060
We can eat here. I'll cook.

977
01:22:53,433 --> 01:22:55,697
I thought you didn't like to cook.

978
01:22:56,336 --> 01:22:58,634
No, I don't like to cook.

979
01:23:00,273 --> 01:23:03,572
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

980
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:05,904
What about all
the washing-up afterward?

981
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:08,706
-We'll eat with our fingers.
-Could you turn that down?

982
01:23:08,915 --> 01:23:10,348
Don't we need any plates?

983
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:14,248
Yes. One for you,
and one for...

984
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:29,299
"There could have been
no two hearts so open...

985
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:32,765
...no tastes so similar...

986
01:24:33,971 --> 01:24:36,872
...no feelings so in unison."

987
01:24:51,456 --> 01:24:56,291
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

988
01:24:56,495 --> 01:25:00,989
...five, four, three, two, one.

989
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,066
Happy New Year!

990
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,412
Come in.

991
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,927
Hi.

992
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:36,925
Hi.

993
01:25:38,438 --> 01:25:39,871
What do you think?

994
01:25:40,073 --> 01:25:41,938
This is what I gave up lunch for?

995
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:46,908
-I know it needs work.
-Work? How about a wrecking ball?

996
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:50,240
I found an architect
who specializes in renovations.

997
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:52,884
I made an appointment for tomorrow.

998
01:25:57,392 --> 01:25:58,950
Ambush.

999
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:00,455
Come on.

1000
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:04,187
We can't stay in my apartment.
We've been there over a year.

1001
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,062
I wanna keep moving forward.

1002
01:26:17,646 --> 01:26:20,945
-It's a new firm.
-"New" as in inexperienced?

1003
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,914
No. "New" as in cheap.

1004
01:26:34,129 --> 01:26:36,495
Hi, Dr. Forster.
We'll be with you in a moment.

1005
01:26:36,732 --> 01:26:38,427
Great, thank you.

1006
01:26:52,182 --> 01:26:55,276
Oh, by the way...

1007
01:26:56,686 --> 01:26:58,813
...happy Valentine's Day.

1008
01:26:59,022 --> 01:27:02,150
Oh, God, Katie,
I didn't get you anything.

1009
01:27:02,392 --> 01:27:05,521
I'm sorry. I've just been
so swamped and...

1010
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:07,663
Doesn't matter.

1011
01:27:24,181 --> 01:27:27,948
-What is this?
-It's global warming.

1012
01:27:30,188 --> 01:27:34,181
Dr. Forster?
Hi, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1013
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:55,413
-Hi. Good to see you again.
-Dr. Forster. You too.

1014
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,549
-Hi, I'm Morgan.
-Hey, Morgan. Vanessa Vanderbeck.

1015
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:03,051
So obviously, the first thing you see
is what we had talked about. The atrium.

1016
01:28:03,756 --> 01:28:05,155
That's stunning.

1017
01:28:05,324 --> 01:28:08,851
So we were able to do it with all
the glass panels in the metal structure?

1018
01:28:09,062 --> 01:28:10,654
-Yeah.
-Can l...?

1019
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,227
Wanna get a beer after work?

1020
01:28:12,465 --> 01:28:16,527
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm taking
Vanessa out for Valentine's Day.

1021
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,730
Wait.

1022
01:28:22,276 --> 01:28:23,709
Say that again.

1023
01:28:23,911 --> 01:28:27,039
It's Valentine's Day today.
I'm taking out Vanessa, my girlfriend.

1024
01:28:27,247 --> 01:28:30,614
Cold champagne, some oysters,
maybe a little chocolate.

1025
01:28:30,851 --> 01:28:34,343
-What's the date?
-It's February 14th.

1026
01:28:35,255 --> 01:28:39,522
-February 14th, 2006.
-Yeah.

1027
01:28:40,128 --> 01:28:42,995
-Stunning. Thank you so much.
-Our pleasure.

1028
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,632
Thank you. Henry will
make sure you have everything.

1029
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:47,767
Great. They were absolutely beautiful.

1030
01:28:48,002 --> 01:28:49,492
Thank you.

1031
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:52,262
What?

1032
01:28:53,742 --> 01:28:57,041
Katie, I gotta get back to work.

1033
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:01,880
Who did this drawing?

1034
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:04,211
My brother did, actually.

1035
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:05,751
Who's your brother?

1036
01:29:05,955 --> 01:29:07,946
Alex Wyler.

1037
01:29:08,257 --> 01:29:10,020
Did you know him?

1038
01:29:12,161 --> 01:29:13,719
Yeah.

1039
01:29:14,663 --> 01:29:16,426
Yeah, I know him.

1040
01:29:18,934 --> 01:29:21,129
Do you know how
I can get in touch with him?

1041
01:29:21,337 --> 01:29:24,239
Is he...?
Is he anywhere that I can...?

1042
01:29:26,943 --> 01:29:28,808
I'm sorry.

1043
01:29:29,446 --> 01:29:33,473
He died...

1044
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:36,646
...two years ago today, actually.

1045
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:42,049
There was an accident.

1046
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:01,302
Where?

1047
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:06,472
Kate.

1048
01:30:08,854 --> 01:30:11,288
Wait, just stop. Just stop.

1049
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:13,883
Goddamn it, answer me.

1050
01:30:14,193 --> 01:30:18,220
What is the matter? Kate.

1051
01:30:20,899 --> 01:30:22,457
Kate!

1052
01:31:26,902 --> 01:31:29,928
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.

1053
01:31:30,171 --> 01:31:32,469
This cannot be Chicago.

1054
01:31:32,874 --> 01:31:35,900
The TV says it's global warming.

1055
01:31:36,278 --> 01:31:38,041
Nothing wrong with that.

1056
01:31:38,246 --> 01:31:39,975
It's a dangerous thing.

1057
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:42,111
Alex...

1058
01:31:43,552 --> 01:31:46,453
...I know why you
didn't show up that night.

1059
01:31:46,689 --> 01:31:49,954
It was you at Daley Plaza that day.

1060
01:31:51,127 --> 01:31:52,924
It was you.

1061
01:31:53,829 --> 01:31:55,888
Please, don't go.

1062
01:31:56,966 --> 01:32:00,424
Just wait. Please.

1063
01:32:01,404 --> 01:32:02,769
Don't look for me.

1064
01:32:02,972 --> 01:32:05,305
Don't try to find me.

1065
01:32:07,477 --> 01:32:09,342
I love you.

1066
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:15,811
And it's taken me all this time
to say it, but I love you.

1067
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:24,954
And if you still care for me...

1068
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:28,765
...wait for me.

1069
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,291
Wait with me.

1070
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:34,994
Just wait. Wait.

1071
01:32:43,748 --> 01:32:46,148
Wait two years, Alex.

1072
01:32:46,617 --> 01:32:48,949
Come to the lake house.

1073
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,152
I'm here.

1074
01:33:48,349 --> 01:33:50,180
You waited.
