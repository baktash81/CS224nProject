00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,274
Hmm?

1225

Quick! Everybody

Oh, no!

1243

Long story. You guys?

Were you a good boy?
(HUMMING HAPPILY)

1257

You didn't cause any trouble
for Frankie, did you?

Thanks, Frankie! I would've
torn my fur out... (GIGGLING)

1261
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,833
from being away from
my design book for so long.

<i>The book gave her the confidence
to take on Madame Ghostier!</i>

1264
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:35,708
<i>It proved that imagination and
creativity can take you anywhere.</i>

you so long to get home'?

1269
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,522
I hope my book
wasn't any trouble.
