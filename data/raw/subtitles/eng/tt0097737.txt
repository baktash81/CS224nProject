1
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>Four to shack.
Container 14 ready to winch.</i>

2
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,296
<i>Six to shack.
Silver extraction completed.</i>

3
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,097
<i>That's good eating.
Burritos, enchiladas...</i>

4
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>Black beans and rice, man.
That's puerto rican. Hey, I gotta take you...</i>

5
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,396
Well, I hate to break up
the great latino gourmet debate...

6
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,399
But we ain't off
the clock yet, so uh...

7
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,820
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

8
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,823
Please tell me who the hook is?

9
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,409
Fifteen, is that you?

10
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,537
You got a hook on box 22?

11
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,498
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit.

12
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,917
Watch your mouth, sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

13
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,128
This is Jones.
I ain't the hook.

14
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,130
Seven to shack.
I'm the hook.

15
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,008
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

16
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,136
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something?
We're all waitin' on ya honey.

17
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,846
Go suck on a shrimp, sixpack.

18
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,024
Seven to shack.
Ready to winch.

19
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,526
There we go.
Winch on.

20
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,158
Okay, miners, let's come on home.

21
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,035
You heard the man.
Let's get movin' folks.

22
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,329
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

23
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,372
I hear that.

24
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,842
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

25
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,157
Well, doc,
not so as you'd notice

26
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,701
but the sun has set
on yet another day

27
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,080
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

28
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,000
Sixteen tons
and what do you get

29
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,753
another day older
and deeper in debt

30
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,382
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

31
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,802
I owe my soul to the company store.

32
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,022
Jonesy! Help!

33
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,440
Cobb!

34
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,068
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

35
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,987
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

36
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,781
Yeah, I got you, dejesus.
You look fine from in here.

37
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,158
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

38
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,953
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

39
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,538
Mr. dejesus, I can't...

40
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,874
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

41
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,252
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

42
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,254
Doc! Doc!

43
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,924
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose and uh...

44
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,176
And out through your mouth.

45
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,262
I think you're hyperventilating.

46
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,557
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

47
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,601
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

48
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,103
Doc! Beck!

49
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,230
- Help!
- Doc, come on!

50
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,777
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

51
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,739
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

52
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,329
Help!

53
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,248
Damn!

54
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,919
Hook him to my rv-four transpac.

55
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,129
Right. Hook him to the rv...

56
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,090
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

57
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,885
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

58
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,804
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

59
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,891
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

60
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,517
I'm gonna die!

61
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,937
You ain't gonna die.

62
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,654
Just keep him moving.

63
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,952
Take it easy. We'll make it.
We'll make it.

64
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,582
Open the damn door.

65
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,672
Come on! Get him inside!

66
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,891
Keep him moving.

67
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,444
Come on, lift lock. Go.

68
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,571
Come on, lift lock. Up.

69
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,304
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

70
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,182
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
It's Beck.

71
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,851
It's not his fault.
Doc should've been there.

72
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,062
If he was a real shack boss,
doc would have been there.

73
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,772
He got real lucky this time.

74
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,317
Hey, wall street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

75
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,321
Shit. There goes my bonus.

76
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,366
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

77
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,787
He was in the Indian ocean.
Boy, I'm telling you that is not a pretty sight.

78
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,121
Hey, leave hazy alone, man.

79
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,875
One tiny little hole in the
fucking toe of his suit man.

80
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,252
No bigger than your dick.

81
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,630
Yeah, boy, that ocean came in.

82
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,801
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

83
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
We just buried his helmet.

84
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,017
- That would've been you, dejesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

85
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,604
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

86
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,816
- Knock it off, sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

87
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
We've been stuck down in this
hole for a hell of a long time

88
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,864
and we had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

89
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,867
The doc is my responsibility.

90
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,664
The doc is my responsibility.

91
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,166
Bullshit.

92
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:44,435
God, it would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under

93
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,313
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

94
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,023
- Anyone check weather up top?
- Yeah.

95
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,734
It's raining, but it's
supposed to be clear for pickup.

96
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,778
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

97
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,032
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

98
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,118
- Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.
- Oh, sixpack!

99
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,913
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Hey, wherever I can find it.

100
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,915
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

101
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,751
Be watching news on TV that's so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

102
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,046
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air

103
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,299
and after five minutes,
you realize

104
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,510
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

105
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,264
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

106
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,975
That looks the same
as everybody else's...

107
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,187
You find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,480
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs

109
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,567
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs

110
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,945
which screw 'em up even more,
and that's just the good part.

111
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,281
You people just don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

112
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,953
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- That's all right, sir. I was just finished.

113
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,415
- How are you feeling there, dejesus?
- I'm okay.

114
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,918
- See the doc yet?
- No.

115
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,420
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

116
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,964
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

117
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,467
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

118
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,011
Makes me feel better already.

119
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,933
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

120
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,352
I see where this is going.

121
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,438
Well, um, see, all of us owe
some shack maintenance time.

122
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,065
I thought tonight would
be a good time to get it done.

123
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,984
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

124
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,194
We just pulled a full shift.

125
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,279
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

126
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,281
That's a union violation.
It's in the contract.

127
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,992
Right on, Cobb.
Let's hear it for the shop steward.

128
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:23,868
Woo!

129
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,871
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

130
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,124
I know about the contract, Mr. Cobb,
and the deal is you can follow the letter

131
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,669
of the contract to the law and you can
spend an extra workday gettin' it done

132
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,255
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

133
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,466
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

134
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,593
What about our quota?

135
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,513
You're only 25 tons off quota.

136
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,057
You're bound to go way
over that by the last day.

137
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,769
Look, folks, it's just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

138
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,355
It's just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

139
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,649
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

140
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,195
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop steward's three.

141
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,157
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

142
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,493
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

143
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,664
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct somewhere.

144
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,666
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

145
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,711
Williams, run a diagnostic
on dejesus' suit.

146
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,880
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

147
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,092
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

148
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,098
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

149
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,560
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the orchestra, please.

150
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,603
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, doc?

151
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,605
Well, I'll be on the golf
course in the morning.

152
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,733
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver

153
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,193
I could stop by after lunch.

154
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,739
We almost had an accident today.
Dejesus's suit.

155
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,700
You have something
to say to me?

156
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,077
Yeah. Section 1412

157
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,663
of the tri-oceanic manual requires

158
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,542
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room

159
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,878
during all exterior operations.

160
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,630
L just wanna make real
damn sure that's clear.

161
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,764
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

162
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,729
Thank you, sir, for taking
care of that situation.

163
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,277
- Listen to it, for Christ's sake.
- It's just gettin' old, that's all.

164
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:07,865
You don't see doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

165
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,119
As long as it's recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

166
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,163
Ten to one it's a short.

167
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,292
Okay.

168
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,592
Piece of cake.

169
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,391
Great.

170
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,674
Oh, mama! What a pair.

171
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,552
What'd you say?

172
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,805
I said, "what a pair."

173
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:17,685
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

174
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,646
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

175
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,571
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

176
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,283
Compliments of bowman.

177
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,629
Yeah.

178
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
How in the hell did you do that?

179
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,598
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

180
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,309
All right? Let's go.

181
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,729
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

182
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,194
That's clean.

183
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,114
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my god!

184
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,747
Come here, kuki.

185
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,123
Here, kuki.

186
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,167
Sixpack, you shit!

187
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,090
Surprise!

188
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,134
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

189
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,512
Well, it's like I tell you, Martin,
i think you've got an honest-to-god

190
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,972
bonanza on your hands.

191
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,808
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

192
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,394
When I told the director
of Atlantic operations

193
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,856
that we had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

194
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,735
I had no idea that you were
going to prove me a genius.

195
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,780
- Well, I'm glad you're happy, Martin.
- I'm ecstatic.

196
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,949
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

197
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,450
What?

198
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,288
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

199
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,290
I miss the research, and...

200
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,876
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

201
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,796
He has a few incidences
of insubordination

202
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,675
but his credentials
are very impressive.

203
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,012
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

204
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,181
Well, this ain't the Mayo clinic.
How'd he get down here, Martin?

205
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,517
A serum he developed
killed several people.

206
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,812
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

207
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,272
Now, look, Beck.

208
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,774
Things are beginning
to move very fast now.

209
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,819
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

210
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,155
Just say the word.

211
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,406
No.

212
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,868
No, I don't think
it's anything I can't handle.

213
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,286
Good.

214
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,833
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

215
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,002
Not yet.

216
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,798
- How's tri-oceanic doing, bow?
- Got money in this tub?

217
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,344
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

218
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,220
You know, last year
when they lost a tanker,

219
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,015
the bottom fell out of their stock
and I lost a bloody fortune.

220
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,059
You take your money too seriously.

221
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:22,870
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

222
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,332
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

223
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,960
Whew, look at those white legs!

224
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,381
Hey, Willie, honey, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

225
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,343
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

226
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,304
Hey, watch it, sixpack!

227
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,432
No hard feelings?

228
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,935
Nope. Sweet dreams.

229
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,484
I got a date with an angel.

230
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,830
Come on, baby.

231
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,873
Sit on my face.

232
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,762
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

233
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,433
You bitch, look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

234
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,977
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think it's funny?

235
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,479
You're gonna think it's funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

236
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,399
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

237
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,193
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

238
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,654
- How do you know it was her?
- It was her, goddammit!

239
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,699
- Are you calling me a liar, Beck?
- That may be the size of it, bubba.

240
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,453
- You and Williams just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Oh, bullshit!

241
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,913
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

242
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,667
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, it's a full one.

243
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,882
Ready to drill.

244
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,138
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

245
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,182
- Let's blow it.
- Blow this.

246
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,312
Charge activated.

247
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,939
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

248
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,941
Ha, ha, ha.

249
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,071
Oh, yeah!

250
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,247
It looks like the mother load, guys.

251
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,379
I need more light on that, seven.

252
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,092
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

253
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,638
Sixpack? Sixpack?

254
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,057
All right, look.

255
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,558
The cable's stuck.

256
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,904
Sixpack.
Sixpack, what's happened?

257
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,740
We've lost him.

258
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,701
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there, sixpack?

259
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,787
Beck, I'm looking for him.

260
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,380
Shack to seven.
What's going on out there, Williams?

261
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,176
He's gone.

262
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,221
Williams, speak to me.
What's happening out there?

263
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,560
Sixpack. Sixpack, answer.

264
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,395
Oh, my god!

265
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,313
Williams!

266
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:40,359
Come on, Williams.
What's the alternate?

267
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,361
Try 35.

268
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,405
Williams? There she is.

269
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,578
Williams, you hear me?
What's going on out there?

270
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,621
God, he's gone over the south Ridge.

271
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm going down after him.

272
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,631
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is off that Ridge.

273
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,217
Come on, jonesy, work it out.

274
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,389
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

275
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,391
- I don't know, he's lost!
- They're supposed to be tied.

276
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,935
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move it!

277
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,979
Oh, god!

278
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,738
What've we got?

279
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,827
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out of there?

280
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,962
Bowman, what's the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

281
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,048
Thirty minutes.

282
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,473
This is six to shack.

283
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,475
Six to shack.

284
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,393
Sixpack.

285
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,647
For god's sakes, why doesn't
sixpack have his blinkers on?

286
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,566
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

287
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,325
What?

288
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,369
What is this?

289
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,082
A ship?

290
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,739
That's Russian.

291
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,369
Are you picking this up?

292
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,789
Yeah, we got it, seven. Can you
open up that picture a little for us?

293
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,043
Leviathan.

294
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:06,338
- What?
- Leviathan.

295
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,382
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

296
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,762
- Williams, what's your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

297
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,515
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

298
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,559
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

299
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,112
I'm going inside.

300
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,327
Sixpack.

301
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,500
Sixpack, answer me!

302
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,428
Baltic sea?

303
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,149
What have you got there, bowman?

304
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,903
The leviathan. Currently with
the Russian fleet in the baltic sea.

305
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,156
Currently horseshit. Currently it's
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

306
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,201
Well, it's gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

307
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,454
It's right here.
The baltic sea.

308
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,749
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice it's missing.

309
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,504
Williams, you got one minute to find
sixpack and get your butt out of there.

310
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:38,430
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does sixpack have?

311
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,091
The infirmary.

312
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,409
Whoooo!

313
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,452
I'm rich, honey!

314
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,454
I'm rich!

315
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,542
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

316
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,085
How can I be on report if i
never even heard a word?

317
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,253
Ain't that right, cobby?

318
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,047
Don't cobby me.
You're on your own this time, sixpack.

319
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,133
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

320
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,845
A Timex. And it's still ticking.

321
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,223
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

322
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,185
Here's something for you, bow.

323
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,106
Hey, sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

324
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,108
Whew!

325
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,453
- What's that?
- "Kitty does Kiev."

326
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,246
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

327
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,123
It's in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

328
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,460
- May I see it, please?
- Doc, it's not really "kitty does Kiev."

329
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,925
- It's the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

330
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,136
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish,

331
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,764
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of hindi.

332
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,642
- It's part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

333
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,894
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

334
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,647
That I believe.

335
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,567
- What's this?
- Personal effects, doc. Can you read that?

336
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,070
Deceased.

337
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,574
What's all this?

338
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,662
Deceased.

339
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,042
Deceased.

340
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,214
Deceased. All of them.

341
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,635
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

342
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,679
Dejesus, dump this last box.

343
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,645
That's nice.
What is this? Vodka.

344
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,648
Stresnavga.
Hey, that's good stuff.

345
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,858
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

346
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,403
Hey, Becky, if I'm on report,
i guess this bottle's mine, huh?

347
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,655
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

348
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,826
But it's pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence

349
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,662
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing

350
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,414
restricted material.

351
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,708
- Mr. Cobb, all this gets impounded.
- It's done.

352
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,006
And one more thing.

353
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,926
I think if I hear you call me
"Becky" one more time, sixpack,

354
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,471
I'm gonna pop your tops...
All six of 'em.

355
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,406
My infirmary's filled.

356
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,076
The doctors on board tell me
it's like a tropical infection.

357
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,623
But it's not like anything
I've ever seen before.

358
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,462
And there's something else
i don't understand.

359
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,839
And then it goes off.

360
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:44,801
Ok. So what do you want me to say, doc?
It all sounds mysterious?

361
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,636
Yea.

362
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,681
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

363
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,267
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

364
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,604
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

365
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,274
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship that's

366
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,152
sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

367
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,789
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

368
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:20,837
That's the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

369
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,965
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

370
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,803
Hey doc, now how the hell
do you know that's a torpedo hit?

371
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,180
I mean, a collision with another boat
could produce that hole.

372
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,973
I don't agree with you.

373
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,017
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

374
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,520
I mean, so what if they
scuttle their own boat?

375
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,272
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people

376
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,110
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

377
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:47,656
I know about rocks. I know about stones, doc.
I don't know about Russian boats.

378
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,660
Plus which, I bet you five dollars
it's a clerical error.

379
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,455
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

380
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,333
I gotta fix the lift lock.

381
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,336
Okay, two more days.

382
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,588
Let's have no waves.

383
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:07,426
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

384
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,887
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

385
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,764
Waves .

386
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,058
Hey, Cobb.

387
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,395
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

388
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,440
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

389
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,109
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

390
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,778
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

391
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,533
Warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

392
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,997
Hey, Cobb, if you're
gonna be doing that, man,

393
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,999
you should be wearing
what you wear to the beach.

394
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,500
I hate the beach.

395
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,503
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

396
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,839
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

397
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,926
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

398
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,511
Watch. You'll see.

399
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,557
Four, zero, five, four

400
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,142
eight, six.

401
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,520
You guys are so full of shit.
I mean, how stupid do you think he is?

402
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,689
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

403
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,361
Bingo!

404
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,821
That bottle's mine.

405
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,366
- Cute, dejesus. Specimen cups?
- Hey, loosen up, bow.

406
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,703
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

407
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,955
All you do is exercise.
Come on, you gotta live a little.

408
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,916
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

409
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,210
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

410
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,713
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

411
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,549
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

412
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,843
Smart lad.

413
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,470
Cheers.

414
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,850
- It's water.
- Beck switched it.

415
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,852
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

416
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,480
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

417
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,857
- There goes our party.
- It's not bad.

418
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,443
- It's not bad at all.
- It's water.

419
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,338
Hi!

420
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,508
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

421
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,839
Whoa.

422
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,342
That was a pretty big one, huh?

423
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,720
- You'd think we'd get used to it by now.
- Yeah.

424
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,390
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

425
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,689
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

426
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,569
It's going well.

427
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,113
I think I've got a good shot.

428
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,866
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

429
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,619
Yeah, I know what you mean.

430
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,622
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

431
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,294
- Push d.L.
- What?

432
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,338
D.L.

433
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,970
Oh, man.

434
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,226
What are you doing down here?

435
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,104
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

436
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,398
What are you doing down here, Williams?

437
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,734
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

438
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,861
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

439
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,114
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea

440
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,909
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

441
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,203
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell

442
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,205
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

443
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,623
Well, do you?

444
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,377
You tell me.

445
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,588
I think you handled
dejesus pretty well.

446
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,257
Yeah?

447
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,886
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

448
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,305
What about sixpack?

449
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,600
What about him?

450
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,187
Did you bust him because of me?

451
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,399
Maybe.

452
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:38,446
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

453
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,784
Yeah, I know.

454
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,163
Good.

455
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,464
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

456
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,386
Hell, that's what I would've done.

457
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,974
Maybe you're more one
of us than you think.

458
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,534
Good morning.

459
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,455
<i>50f!-</i>

460
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,459
okay. That's good.

461
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,296
Just look at my forehead.

462
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,339
That's it.

463
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,430
Let me see your tongue.

464
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,603
Good morning, gentlemen.
What's wrong, doc?

465
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,483
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

466
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,777
- Take off your shirt.
- It ain't no hangover.

467
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,362
Feels about 1000 times worse.

468
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,661
How long did you have these spots?

469
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,747
- What?
- Don't touch it.

470
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,801
Well, as first officer of the shack,
it's your call.

471
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,179
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

472
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,722
I don't get it.

473
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:32,685
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup

474
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,272
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

475
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,359
But like I said, it's your call.

476
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,910
Well, as bad as he is,
there's no way

477
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,996
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

478
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,208
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

479
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,294
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

480
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,548
The company will take that under
consideration when they look at our numbers.

481
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,385
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

482
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,428
The contract says,
if we miss our quota

483
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,056
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

484
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,058
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

485
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,769
The bastard's
definitely tanking on us.

486
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,480
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

487
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,482
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

488
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,526
- Williams, take her down.
- That's terrific.

489
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,196
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

490
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,575
So, what, are you taking inventory?

491
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,536
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play ping-pong.

492
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,125
I'm goin' to work, Mr. Jones.
You got a problem with that?

493
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,460
- Work?
- Work.

494
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,893
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it, doc?

495
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,478
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

496
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,564
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

497
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,067
Try to do it as quick as I can.
That's it. I got it.

498
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:07,447
Steady, steady, steady.
Easy, easy.

499
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,285
It's all right.
Keep your hands off it.

500
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,370
Here. Hold that.

501
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,208
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

502
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,496
Container 22 is full, sir.

503
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,123
Okay, this one's full up, so let's run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

504
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,042
You got it.

505
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,394
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

506
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,105
Tell me something I don't know.

507
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,114
Goddamn it, take a guess.

508
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,474
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

509
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,517
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

510
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,438
No harm done.

511
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,482
Just don't call me cracker.

512
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,526
Perk up, sport.

513
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,906
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

514
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,827
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

515
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,997
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

516
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,820
Oh, lord.

517
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,323
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

518
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,325
I don't know if it is,
i don't know if it isn't.

519
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,161
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

520
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,081
I've been going back and forth
with narragansett naval all day.

521
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,041
Consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

522
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,043
The best people in virology.

523
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,504
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

524
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,173
Their best guess, and that's
all it is is just a guess...

525
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,634
Is that before sixpack died,
he was undergoing

526
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,636
some form of genetic alteration.

527
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,888
Genetic alteration from what?

528
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,890
It could be a million things.

529
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,852
Something in the food, the air.

530
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,689
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

531
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,067
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

532
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,070
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers

533
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,114
I don't think we should tell them
that sixpack is dead.

534
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,038
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

535
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,166
It's a little difficult
to describe.

536
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,334
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing

537
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,712
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

538
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,798
My wife would never
understand that at all.

539
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,010
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

540
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,012
She wouldn't understand that at all.

541
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,431
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

542
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,141
Put on your shirt.

543
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,978
- It's all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

544
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,525
This whole thing is unnecessary, doc.

545
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,653
The only skin problem
i can see is white people.

546
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,909
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

547
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,286
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

548
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,748
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

549
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,042
That's all.

550
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,962
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

551
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,131
Well, it's a possibility.
But if that was the case

552
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,425
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

553
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,637
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

554
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,639
No, really, you're fine.

555
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,600
Great. Thanks, doc.

556
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,353
What do you mean, a skin problem?

557
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,521
Your skin changes?

558
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,692
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

559
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,158
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was just joking, doc.

560
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,332
You can finish getting dressed now.

561
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,505
Oh, bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

562
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,182
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

563
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:11,686
Whatever. But you think it's
restricted to this one crew member?

564
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,688
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

565
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,690
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

566
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,900
What are you talking about?
It's already killed one man!

567
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,655
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

568
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,283
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

569
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,663
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

570
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,165
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

571
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,167
And it's no day at the beach.

572
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,962
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual

573
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,007
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation

574
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,050
of all the personnel
on the shack.

575
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,177
It's your call,
but unfortunately

576
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,888
we can't pick you up so soon.

577
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:51,267
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba

578
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,269
possibly coming your way.

579
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,731
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

580
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,732
What are you saying?

581
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,817
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

582
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,861
It shouldn't be a long delay.

583
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,363
Well, what's a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

584
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,908
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

585
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,286
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

586
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,414
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

587
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,458
I promise.

588
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,391
Bow. Bow, are you okay?

589
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,560
Oh, my god. Come on.

590
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,564
Can you help us here?

591
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,696
- Let's put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

592
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,868
It's all right.

593
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,041
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find doc, all right?

594
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,460
Hey, doc?
Maybe he's with sixpack.

595
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,800
Doc? Hey, you in here?

596
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,511
Sixpack?

597
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,806
Hey, man, how you doin'?

598
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:16,685
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

599
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,605
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

600
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,650
Yeah, we just brought bowman in, man.

601
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,652
She don't look too good.

602
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,696
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

603
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,409
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

604
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,453
You go on back to sleep, okay?

605
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,456
I'll talk to you later, all right?

606
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,300
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

607
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,429
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Willie, please don't go!

608
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,974
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

609
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,686
Shh. You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

610
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,484
Sixpack...

611
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,112
Sixpack?

612
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,867
My hair's coming out.

613
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,472
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

614
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,474
Yeah.

615
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,476
Bowman?

616
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,856
I don't understand.
We just left her here.

617
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,329
Bowman? Bowman, it's doc!

618
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,427
Oh, man.

619
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,843
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

620
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,598
Except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

621
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,976
And this disease, it killed bow?

622
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,978
No.

623
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,606
No, she killed herself.

624
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,485
Hey, we're getting outta
here just in time.

625
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,779
Yeah, well, that's a
whole 'nother problem.

626
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,617
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

627
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,911
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

628
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,999
Twelve hours? What're we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

629
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,546
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

630
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:16,091
Okay? Doc.

631
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,236
Oh, my god.

632
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,238
What is this?

633
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,240
What's goin' on, doc?

634
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,438
- Okay, Willie, get the door.
- Got it.

635
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,360
Beck.

636
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,780
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

637
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,616
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

638
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,285
Section c of the health and safety code.
Watch it.

639
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,748
Willie, program that lift lock.

640
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,086
Hey, I feel something.

641
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,088
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

642
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,882
Wait a minute.
I feel something too.

643
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,009
- Let's go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

644
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,177
Come on. Come on. Come on.

645
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,387
Alright, come on,
let's flush it, doc.

646
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,556
What do you mean "flush it?"
They're human beings we're talking about

647
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,057
- for god's sake!
- What if one's alive?

648
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,851
- How about a moment of silence?
- Let's do it, doc.

649
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,644
My god, they're alive!

650
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,105
- Get it up here.
- Let's have a look.

651
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,276
Bow.

652
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,194
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

653
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,946
Hit the button!

654
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,491
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

655
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,785
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

656
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,246
Beck!

657
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,249
Come on!

658
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,344
Oh, god!

659
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:56,854
It's coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. That's it.

660
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,941
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

661
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,404
That's it. Stop. Now move in.

662
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,367
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

663
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,703
- There's something about it. It's...
- Bigger.

664
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:26,592
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

665
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,845
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

666
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,308
Why stop with the base model?

667
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,603
Why not try to alter the human form?

668
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,149
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

669
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,151
Regeneration.

670
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,738
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure.

671
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,824
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

672
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:53,827
So what's next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

673
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,623
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

674
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,626
<i>Natura no confundendo est.</i>

675
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,131
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with mother nature."

676
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,527
I better let the company know.

677
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,156
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

678
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,493
Yeah. I thought about that, doc.

679
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,537
But I also like to think they got some
kind of commitment to their people.

680
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,957
You can save that speech
for your ad campaign.

681
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,126
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

682
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,922
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that tri-oceanic

683
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,676
is gonna risk exposing themself to
potential market loss just to save us

684
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,178
you're in for an
eye-opening experience.

685
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,721
Maybe.

686
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,893
Maybe so. And I know your life's
gone a couple of bad rounds, doc.

687
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:04,231
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

688
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,131
I think we got something here.

689
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,802
Son of a bitch.

690
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,809
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

691
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,310
It was an experiment, man.

692
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,355
I mean, they put the drug or
whatever it was in the vodka!

693
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,357
They meant to trick
them into takin' it.

694
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,235
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

695
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,780
I mean, with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

696
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,199
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on, man.

697
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:00,203
You know how mothers put the
castor oil in with orange juice?

698
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:03,248
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

699
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,710
That's the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

700
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,754
Fool. He could've got us all killed.

701
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,673
You guys weren't so holy when
you were shooting that vodka.

702
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:12,841
It could've been anyone.

703
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,053
Well, miss high and mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

704
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,138
Yeah, it bothers me.

705
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,807
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

706
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,312
You know that in gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

707
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,106
Sixty-four square miles.

708
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,987
How can you sit there goin', "shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

709
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,365
And another thing, man. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin' ok?

710
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,578
You don't know shit about skiin', man.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

711
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,580
What about what we just saw?

712
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:47,793
Like Willie said, you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

713
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,214
- Doesn't anybody care what just happened?
- What're you gonna do about it? Huh?

714
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,259
Sixpack and bow are dead.

715
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,100
I can't help what happened. Can you?

716
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,647
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

717
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,943
Eat? After what we just went through?

718
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,381
The storm's still holding its course.

719
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,093
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

720
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,720
No change. Still just the one.

721
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,669
Hey, man, everybody's jumpy.
What are you doin'?

722
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,671
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

723
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,384
Look, hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

724
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,596
I should.
You know how long that took me?

725
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,973
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

726
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,396
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

727
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,734
Holy shit!

728
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:23,156
Please, god, help me!
Help me, jonesy! Help me.

729
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,619
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

730
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,121
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

731
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,834
- Please.
- I'll be back.

732
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,511
Look! It's got hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

733
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,597
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

734
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,902
I didn't want to tell her about bowman.

735
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,446
I listened to Martin, and all my mind says
"she's full of shit."

736
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,532
It's got dejesus! Come on!

737
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,897
Beck, don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

738
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,774
Dejesus!
Cobb!

739
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,402
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

740
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,529
I'm not gonna watch that
thing without some protection.

741
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,865
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

742
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,451
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Let's go find him.

743
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,954
Okay? Come on. Let's go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

744
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,957
What's happening?

745
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,711
My god, she's out there.

746
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,713
All right, look. Jones, you come with me.

747
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,300
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Let's go.

748
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,121
Willie?

749
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,963
Hey, Beck.

750
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,634
Oh, no. It's her scarf.

751
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,845
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

752
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:54,391
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

753
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,475
What's going on?

754
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,186
Whatever got sixpack
and bowman is still here.

755
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,022
- What?
- It just got dejesus.

756
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,677
All right. We're talkin' Turkey.

757
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,471
Dejesus! Hey!

758
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:35,765
Doc.

759
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,477
Oh, my god.

760
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,526
The blood supply.

761
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,155
Oh, my god.

762
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,657
It got the blood supply.

763
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,252
It's growing. It's had a meal.

764
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,880
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

765
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,884
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

766
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,970
That's why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

767
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,096
What one on that ship?

768
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,475
Somebody want to let the
rank-and-file in on your little secret?

769
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,102
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

770
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,814
- No shit.
- What're you trying to tell us, doc?

771
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:12,612
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

772
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,784
Regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

773
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,787
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored

774
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,541
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

775
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,669
- What?
- It absorbs the intelligence of its victim.

776
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,088
Intelligence may not be the right word.

777
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,756
The hell with semantics, doc.
What are you saying, now?

778
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,968
This thing is part dejesus,
part sixpack, part bowman, what?

779
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,805
I don't know.
I'd just be guessing.

780
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,015
But I do know this:

781
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,602
The Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

782
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,815
Maybe to protect us all.

783
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,150
Alright. Then I say we protect ourselves.

784
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,695
Let's escape into those air bubbles
and get the hell out of here.

785
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,613
And hit the surface in
the middle of a hurricane?

786
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,115
Man, that storm'd rip
those bubbles to pieces.

787
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,868
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.

788
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,041
- So what are we gonna do?
- Look, I think we got one shot.

789
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,546
Just one shot. We lure it down into the
swamp, flush it out just like the other.

790
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,673
And how're we gonna do that?

791
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,850
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

792
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,061
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

793
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,813
- Mark. Got it?
- Got it.

794
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,316
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

795
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,652
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess,

796
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,655
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

797
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:38,656
<i>'</i> Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

798
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,367
- let's do it.
- Be careful with this.

799
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,078
- Don't worry. I don't want to give up any more.
- Take care.

800
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,331
I'll do my best.

801
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,416
Okay, let's go.

802
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,840
You know, I was quite good once.

803
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,512
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

804
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:50,103
I developed drugs and techniques

805
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,147
that're used every day by
doctors all over the world.

806
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,653
- Made a difference.
- It still does, doc.

807
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,742
This itches like hell.

808
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,416
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

809
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,459
It really itches.

810
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,798
That's because it's healing.

811
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,385
I'm gonna change that dressing,
see if I can't make you more comfortable.

812
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,971
- Where are you going, doc?
- The infirmary.

813
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:26,514
Without protection?

814
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,100
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

815
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,593
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

816
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,637
Here we go.

817
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,584
- Take off your shirt, Cobb.
- Sure.

818
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,128
I'm cold.

819
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,756
Help me, please.

820
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,342
Oh, yeah, sure.

821
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,185
Doc? Doc!

822
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,771
Help me!

823
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,481
What's happening?

824
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,400
Help!

825
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,321
Doc.

826
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,293
- Beck! Jones!
- Willie!

827
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,051
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

828
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,094
Get over here!

829
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,512
Willie!

830
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,117
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's doc and Cobb?

831

- Wait a minute. It was just here.

- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

833

- Slow down. There's two of them?

- All right.

- Okay.

01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,219
Okay, now what?

837

How do you feel about big waves?

838
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,641
I love waves.

We haven't deserted you.

Thompson's message, we were concerned.

- Well, that's the bad news.

When are you coming?

- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

through hell...

after what you've been through.

I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

- Save your breath.

- We don't have much choice, do we?

01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,734
Don't! Save yourself!

1000
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,490
Beck!

1001
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,454
Come back!

1002
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,960
Say "aah," motherfucker!

1003
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,341
Let's get outta here!

1004
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:56,529
Helicopter 405 heading back
to platform p.O.C.

1005
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:05,265
They don't want anything else
to do with it, you know?

1006
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:06,933
Beck!

1007
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,145
You made it!

1008
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:14,190
No one back at tri-oceanic
believed me.

1009
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:18,695
But I never gave up on you once.
How do you feel?

1010
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,240
Better. A lot better.
