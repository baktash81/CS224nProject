"Five hundred dollars for
the death of Chen Kuo-Wei."

2
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,555
Hey, Friend!

3
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:21,265
Your style's not bad.
But take it easy, you look beat.

4
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:29,425
You must be the Four Door Fist Champion,

5
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,602
Chen Kuo-Wei?

6
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,540
Yes I am, and who might you be?

7
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:38,018
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,548
I've heard of your devil's kick,

9
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,676
It's famous in the Kung-Fu world.
It has never been defeated...

10
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,755
And it never will.

11
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:52,979
I suppose I should warn you.

12
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:57,072
I've been given good money to kill you.

13
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,298
What the hell are you talking about?
Someone's paid you to kill me?

14
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,530
I'll give you twice as much to kill him!

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,023
You could, only my honour comes first.

16
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:11,703
You must realize I'm paid to kill.
The contract's sealed.

17
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:14,348
- So you must die.
- Don't be so sure of that...

18
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,829
For I, champion of the four Door Fists,
have never yet been defeated!

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,213
I don't care who you are,
I'll break every bone in your body...

20
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,215
and send you to hell.

21
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,700
"Wong Kei-Ying Martial Art School"

22
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,830
Kai Hsien!

23
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,698
- What's the matter, Master?
- I'm going out, keep an eye on them.

24
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,740
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,149
Stop!

26
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,890
We won't practice this today.

27
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,598
Let's practice the Fist of Five Styles
which I taught you a few days ago.

28
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,823
He's so lame...

29
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,655
- Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

30
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,655
Start now.

31
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,823
Dragon Sees Tiger.

32
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:27,035
Tiger's rear, Snake's Tongue Darts Out.

33
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,296
Panther Sees Fire,

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,505
White Crane Spreads Wings.

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,732
Hold it!

36
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,670
Your wrists are too weak.
You can't learn it well, understand?

37
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:23,729
I suppose you think that was funny,
playing tricks on your teacher!

38
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,731
We'll see. Take that! And that!

39
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,173
- It wasn't me!
- Who was it? Tell me.

40
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,623
Who was it?

41
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,341
Wong Fei-Hung.

42
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,805
Wong Fei-Hung.

43
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,323
Even though Master Wong is your father,

44
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,723
you don't have a right
to cause trouble here.

45
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,635
You think Kung-Fu
is just a performance.

46
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,598
You're telling me my Kung-Fu is bad?

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,079
Not too bad, but bad enough.

48
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,495
Show me exactly what's wrong with it.

49
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,173
Look at your Panther Sees Fire.

50
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,060
Well what's wrong?

51
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,671
You've exposed your body.
It's easy to attack you.

52
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:14,331
And that Horse Stance is
bow-legged. Just a kick...

53
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,410
and you'll fall.

54
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:33,585
Shut up! Shut up you turkeys!

55
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,323
You'd like to test your
teacher's Kung-Fu, would you?

56
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,945
We can all learn from each other.

57
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:50,431
I can stand almost anything, you bum!
But I've taken enough of this bullshit!

58
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,875
You've exposed your body again.
Do you know that, teacher?

59
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,930
Your hat!

60
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,112
Here you go!

61
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,595
Pork belly, shut up!

62
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:41,049
Look! Right foot! Snake stance!

63
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,134
Bastard!

64
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:56,373
Wong Fei-Hung,
you've taught Hsien a lesson.

65
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,373
We all feel very happy about it.

66
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,845
He's too arrogant, I can't stand it.

67
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,710
You really showed him!

68
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,425
That's great...

69
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,498
Eat more then!

70
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,123
No, I'm talking about that girl.

71
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,725
That perfect frame she's got.
Really sexy!

72
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,930
- How much?
- 30 cents.

73
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,198
Not bad!

74
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,348
I'm willing to trade 10 years
just for a kiss by her!

75
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,750
Kissing is for children.
I could get her to hug and kiss me.

76
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,498
I don't believe you!

77
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,173
You want to bet on it?
I’ll bet you a whole dinner.

78
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,998
Deal.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,350
She's hot, she wouldn't
look at you twice!

80
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,490
All right! A whole dinner then.

81
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,620
Just watch.

82
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,990
He's looking for trouble.

83
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,900
This flower is beautiful.
Trust me, try it on.

84
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,498
- Excuse me!
- My eye hurts.

85
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,623
What can I do?

86
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:14,875
Something got into my eye.
Help me get rid of it, miss. Please, hurry

87
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,950
Harder.

88
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,498
- He did it!
- Did you see that?

89
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,252
Thanks. Snake!

90
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,990
Don't be afraid...
I'll kill it. Don't be afraid.

91
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,398
That's a great technique.

92
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,398
That's great. I must try
that on your sister.

93
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,230
What did you say? My sister?

94
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,160
Thought you could take advantage
of my daughter, did you?

95
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,757
Me touch her? She was asking
for it, that dumb bitch.

96
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,998
Mother!

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,048
You wanted to lay your
filthy hands on her.

98
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,510
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly.

99
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,643
Think you’re real smart, huh?
Well, I’ll teach you a lesson, boy.

100
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,370
So you want to play Kung-Fu? Try this!

101
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,049
The old bitch is tough.

102
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,403
Come on, you guys! Hey!

103
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,438
Some friends they make.

104
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,449
You're nothing but a skinny old woman,
so I'll let you win.

105
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,449
Excuse me!

106
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,974
Watch where you’re going!

107
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,975
Stumbling about like a drunken stooge!

108
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,738
Antique jade!

109
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,850
Mister, want to buy?

110
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,951
You sure it's real?

111
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:35,448
Of course.

112
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,208
It’s a family heirloom.
It's worth the money, sir.

113
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,698
- How much?
- 10 dollars.

114
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,810
That's too expensive!

115
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,299
It’s worth it!

116
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,598
Only 10 cents?! Hey mister!

117
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,098
Mister, I can't sell it that cheap.
Please give it back to me. It’s all I have!

118
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,398
I couldn't sell such a
valuable piece for only 10 cents!

119
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,156
Then I’ll keep the jade and the money.

120
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,314
Hey, give me back my jade.

121
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,298
Mister, you broke my jade!
Pay me back!

122
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,898
You expect payment from me? Take this!

123
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,598
Father...

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,460
- Please, at least give me something.
- No!

125
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,598
What happened?

126
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,726
He's broken my jade and
then he refused to pay me!

127
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,553
Shithead. Piss off.

128
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,912
Who're you calling Shithead?

129
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm calling you!

130
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,398
Hand over that man's money!

131
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,373
Pay? Not before I put you in the ground.

132
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,232
It's too bad you feel that way.

133
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,669
There's nothing been going right today,
so you caught me in a bad mood.

134
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,580
Now, I'm gonna have to
teach you how to pay!

135
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,350
Get up!

136
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,280
Wanna kill me?

137
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,035
This is dangerous!

138
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:51,988
You barely missed my knuckles!

139
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,995
- This is for you, now get going!
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm doomed, I'm dead!

141
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,480
Don't be afraid,
it's just the blunt end.

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,848
I have no intention of killing you...

143
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,849
...yet!

144
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,030
Don't...!

145
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
That one really came close.

146
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,670
And watch what you're doing.

147
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,499
Drop dead!

148
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,410
Fists have no eyes, knives have no heart!
Sometimes I can hit by mistake!

149
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,348
I chop, chop, chop... the meat!

150
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,873
I slice, slice, slice... like a cucumber!

151
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,832
I beat, beat, beat... you like garlic!

152
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,180
I’m glad I came across you.
You sure have brightened my day!

153
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,390
It’s been ages, brother.
You still look great.

154
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,799
Your brother is old now.

155
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,686
What a beautiful niece I’ve got.

156
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,305
She's still a kid. Just a bit naive.

157
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,718
Where's Fei-Hung?

158
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,473
He went out.

159
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,952
This naughty boy always goes out to play.
He's a young man now.

160
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,954
I think you may not recognize him.

161
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:50,383
This time, stay longer.

162
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,110
Fei-Hung, don't go away.

163
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Come greet your auntie and cousin.

164
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,548
Come here, now.

165
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,620
Coming...

166
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Shit!

167
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,395
Say hello.

168
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,900
Auntie, cousin.

169
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,878
- Cousin.
- Fei-Hung.

170
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,491
What happened to your neck?

171
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,110
I... I slept without a pillow.

172
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,098
Without a pillow? Let me help you.

173
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,350
- No thanks, auntie.
- Come on, relax.

174
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,599
Auntie.

175
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,049
Mother!

176
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,650
Feel better now?

177
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,900
Yes.

178
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,698
Brother,

179
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,991
Fei-Hung really looks smart.

180
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,740
He's quite tactful and clever.

181
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:56,300
Brother, you're really a good father.

182
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes, I’m very strict to him.

183
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,390
No wonder I heard people praising
him as soon as I came here.

184
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,998
Really? What did they say?

185
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,223
The son of Wong Kei-Ying is very smart.

186
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:12,847
He's also a man of justice.

187
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:17,715
I’m very proud of him.
Come here, my son.

188
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Sit down.

189
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,860
But there are many sex
maniacs in this village.

190
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,348
That's right.

191
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,023
One of them harassed your
niece on the street just now.

192
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:40,048
when I went to rescue her,
he even attacked me.

193
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:45,284
You mean to tell me both of you
were attacked here in my own town?

194
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:46,724
Could you recognize him?

195
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,448
As if I could forget.
Yes, I'd recognize him.

196
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,670
Good, let's find him now.

197
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,060
I’ll teach him a real good lesson.
Fei-Hung, come with me.

198
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,748
Uncle! You don't have to go out.

199
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,548
Why?

200
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,270
That guy is right here.
He's standing in this very room.

201
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,848
Who? Where?

202
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,940
Standing right over there.
He's your son Wong Fei-Hung.

203
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,274
You...

204
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,699
You...

205
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,390
Son-of-bitch!

206
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,730
Kneel down!

207
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,299
Father...

208
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,074
You bastard!

209
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,675
You have dishonoured me.

210
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,799
Wong Kei-Ying!

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,029
I'm doomed.

212
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,800
Wong Kei-Ying.

213
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,880
Master Li, what has happened?

214
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,695
I'll tell you what.
I'm looking for your son.

215
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,725
Why?

216
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,438
Because he's nothing but a wild animal.

217
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,120
He attacked my son for no reason,
breaking his legs, arms, and skull.

218
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,541
He really beat him up.

219
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,944
He looks like a dumpling.

220
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,390
Wong Kei-Ying! I want justice!

221
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,515
- You beast, I must kill you.
- No, Dad... No...

222
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,973
Brother, you mustn't kill your own son.

223
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:28,976
Yes!

224
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,475
I must kill him, he's a disgrace!

225
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:37,735
Sounds bad for a teacher of your
standing to flog his own son to death.

226
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,780
Mr. Li didn't come to witness
how you punish your son.

227
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,400
If he must be punished, I suggest
that Mr. Li here is quite capable.

228
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,170
Stop him!

229
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,665
I’m responsible for what I’ve done.

230
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,413
So let him punish me.

231
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
Take this.

232
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,760
Now, I promise I won't fight back.

233
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,760
You dare make fun at this time?

234
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Wong Kei-Ying, what are you gonna do?

235
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:09,355
As from this moment, I disown him.

236
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,310
This slime is no longer mine.
Do what you like with him.

237
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,554
Mr. Li, I have a proposition.

238
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,660
Let Fei-hung take ten strikes
without any resistance.

239
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:26,690
Ten strikes should be enough.
Now, Mr. Li, do you approve?

240
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,830
I don't need ten strikes
to kill him, three is enough.

241
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,430
Master, listen.
I’m going to fix that squirt.

242
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,850
Master Chao, be sure you leave
him looking just like I look now.

243
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,798
The Divine Eight.

244
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,631
That palm style of yours,
it's really something.

245
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,899
I’m only getting started!

246
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,870
I'm not dead yet!

247
00:21:57,575 --> 00:21:59,025
You want to cut off my posterity?

248
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,875
Enough!

249
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,995
You've made your ten strikes, Mr. Chow.

250
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,200
You said you would kill
me within three strikes.

251
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,910
Snake and Crane together.

252
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,210
Strike the vital points.

253
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,350
Let's try your Divine Eight again.

254
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,400
I told you I’ve got style.

255
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,910
Hey! My jacket's getting dirty, take it!

256
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,340
You regret not paying
for that jade now, huh!

257
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,630
- It's me!
- You hit your master.

258
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,100
- Young Master, are you alright?
- Young master, are you okay?

259
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,170
Master, now I look just like you.

260
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,798
Wong Kei-Ying,

261
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,973
you win with your smart tricks.

262
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:38,974
I'll get you back.

263
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:39,974
Let's go!

264
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,020
You watch out!

265
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,723
Careful with my son, hurry.

266
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:46,815
- I'll get you yet!
- So don't come back!

267
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,890
Careful, careful.

268
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,230
He came in with one cripple
and left with two.

269
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,173
You fight well, I give you that.

270
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,020
- But I'll still kill you!
- Brother.

271
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,023
It’s useless to beat him anymore.

272
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:07,845
Let's punish him by Kung-Fu practice.

273
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,448
I’ve tried with that bastard.

274
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,373
Right!

275
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,608
From now on, you are forbidden
to leave the house.

276
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:16,254
We'll start with five
hours of Horse Stance!

277
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,780
Now don't move.

278
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,970
Have some more boiling water, bastard!

279
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:21,934
Hey, are you comfortable?

280
00:26:25,812 --> 00:26:30,610
Are your legs shaking, are they aching?
You know, I feel sorry for you.

281
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,075
Poor little chicken!

282
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,570
You feel itchy? Want me to help you?

283
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,605
Stop. Don't do that!

284
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,298
I'm just carrying out my orders.
See, it's your father's idea.

285
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,275
He says for every bowl you break,
you stay another hour,

286
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:04,457
you bastard!

287
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,875
Master, you're back!

288
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,360
Yes, his stance appears
to be pretty steady.

289
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,198
- Did he slack off?
- No, I’ve been watching him.

290
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,305
Really?

291
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,223
Finally some progress.

292
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,755
Yes, I'm very tired.

293
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,065
- Are you really that tired?
- I am, sir.

294
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,699
But you've got a chair, right?

295
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:28,171
What? A chair? Let me see!
Damn it, a chair...

296
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,490
You dare cheat me
when I'm punishing you.

297
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,775
I really can't do anything about you.

298
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,000
I’ll ask your uncle to come
tomorrow and fix you.

299
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:42,475
Who's he?

300
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Beggar So.

301
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,044
Help me, To Tao!

302
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,449
Hurry!

303
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,273
Practicing your Kung-Fu upside down, huh!

304
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:26,000
- I'm dying!
- Here, I brought you food.

305
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,780
I’ll go get something to drink.

306
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:34,075
My neck!

307
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,915
Get me down, quickly.

308
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,407
Come on, get up.

309
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,552
You came down so quickly.

310
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:56,775
Untie me!

311
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:06,924
Eat this.

312
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:11,533
Hey, is it true So Hui
is gonna fix you?

313
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,670
- That's right.
- That's bad news for you.

314
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:15,955
Why?

315
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,770
Do you know anything about Beggar So?

316
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,610
I heard he's very cruel.

317
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:24,475
All his students have if not
broken arms then broken legs!

318
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,049
Really?

319
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,630
I'm telling you the truth.

320
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,773
Nui was his student and you
know what happened to him?

321
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:34,835
What?

322
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,924
He lost all his teeth and hair.
His nose got twisted.

323
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,698
Even his own father
couldn't recognize him.

324
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,410
That monster gets pleasure out of
torturing people, he's a real sadist.

325
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:52,065
- What should I do then?
- You think about it yourself.

326
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:56,895
You've got to help me,
I don't know what to do!

327
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,400
- Escape, that's the only way!
- Escape, that's the only way!

328
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,374
You're clumsy!

329
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,898
You should try to pay more attention!

330
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,652
- Just go.
- I’ll leave now.

331
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,398
"Yue He Restaurant"

332
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,800
Sir, here are the dumplings.

333
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,380
Please have a seat.

334
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:45,198
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

335
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,260
No, sit down. Go on.

336
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,000
You're by yourself, good.
I don't like to eat alone.

337
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:55,948
The food here is very good.

338
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,310
Everything looks and tastes great.

339
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,400
Real good smell, really fantastic.

340
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,120
What can I get you, sir?

341
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,948
Why you're alone? Where's Old Shang?

342
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,600
- What's that?
- No, go ahead, eat.

343
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,620
What would you like to eat?

344
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,848
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer.

345
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,773
- Sorry. We got no shark's fin.
- That's too bad.

346
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:24,198
Then I want a roasted goose leg. The left one.
A chicken and a steamed grouper.

347
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,398
- Sorry, we have no grouper.
- Then any fish will do.

348
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,970
Also a stewed abalone and
shrimp noodles. Hurry!

349
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,174
And half a catty of
Shaoxing wine, hurry!

350
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:36,699
One wine!

351
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,390
You have a great appetite.

352
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,090
It is necessary to eat
well to become strong!

353
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:05,585
Here's the left goose leg, chicken...

354
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,910
- Half litter of Shaoxing wine.
- Yes... no thanks

355
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,750
- Have a little wine. Be my guest.
- Really, I...

356
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,535
Here, just taste that.

357
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,748
Eat up!

358
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,848
Go on, don't be shy.
Help yourself to what you want.

359
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,850
Enjoy yourself.
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

360
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,340
Drink...

361
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,098
Go ahead.

362
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,810
I eat...

363
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,795
Drink...

364
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:03,455
You must be starving!

365
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,605
Very nice.

366
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,270
They sure know how to cook here.
That meal was really something.

367
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,198
I’ll pay the bill, don't refuse me.
I’ll go and pay it now.

368
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,323
Buy me lunch tomorrow.
I’m leaving. I’ll pay today.

369
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,173
You must finish your dinner, okay?

370
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:24,122
See you tomorrow. Bye for now.

371
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,380
Take care, see you tomorrow.

372
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:31,410
That will be exactly $1.05.

373
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,923
Someone else will pay the bill.

374
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,703
Really? Who?

375
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,320
The old man over there.

376
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:45,924
You know him?

377
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,120
He's my father.

378
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,649
Your father?

379
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,420
How many fathers do you have?

380
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:57,673
He's the boss of this
inn and I’m his son.

381
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:58,931
That makes you a bastard.

382
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,180
So you just want to eat and run?
Look there.

383
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,100
"PAY OR DIE!"

384
00:36:15,075 --> 00:36:18,674
I ain't poncing meals from you.
Forgot my money, that's all.

385
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,505
I’ll come back tomorrow
and pay you then.

386
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,169
"PAY OR DIE!"

387
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,143
Gorilla, beat him up!

388
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:04,574
Tiger's Claw.

389
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,870
No, hold it, stop. Let's talk.

390
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,324
Stop it.

391
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,746
Go ahead, beat him.

392
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,523
I'll get back what you've eaten.

393
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:52,924
Now!

394
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,230
Roasted goose's leg. The left one.

395
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:09,274
And the fish.

396
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:10,529
That's enough.

397
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,380
Also half a catty of Shaoxing wine.

398
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,717
Now that you emptied my belly,
I feel hungry again.

399
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,650
Hey, that's enough, or do
you want to kill the boy?

400
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:39,514
No, it's not enough. He is to
do the toilet cleaning for us.

401
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,060
You wanted something to clean?

402
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,622
Thanks old man.

403
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,148
Old bum! How you dare
interfere with our business!

404
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,760
Just look how strong I am.
Watch me jump!

405
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,070
Jump then!

406
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,260
Now you're jumping all right!

407
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,335
This is how to wash your face.

408
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,399
Damn you!

409
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,721
Stop eating!

410
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:28,775
- We're friends, remember?
- Okay, let's be friends.

411
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,660
You've got arms of iron,
but you've brains of straw.

412
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,065
Stop that, let's get out of here!

413
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,180
This way...

414
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,623
You know what?

415
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,238
I can't help wondering
how old you are.

416
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,783
For your age, you sure are tough.

417
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:21,510
A necessity.

418
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:25,861
I've had to be tough to be
able to survive to this age.

419
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,667
Just look at you.
You're weak and useless.

420
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,098
Today was just a bad day.

421
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,876
If I hadn't fallen into the trap,

422
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,166
I'd have beaten them.

423
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:47,382
Sounds like an excuse.

424
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:52,653
I forgot to ask why you
couldn't pay for your meal.

425
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:57,952
That's a long story.
Old man, may I know your name?

426
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,050
I'm Mr. So.

427
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:05,914
Hey, there's a fellow with the
same name screwing up my life!

428
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,010
It’s all his fault!

429
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,498
- Who are you talking about?
- He's this creep named Beggar So.

430
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,755
My own father asked
this guy to train me.

431
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:17,250
So you're afraid of him?

432
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,560
Afraid? Of course not!

433
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,947
I have heard rumours.

434
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,548
He's very cunning, violent and mean.

435
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,913
But I’ll show him!

436
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,846
That old fart. Wait until
I see him, I’ll tear him apart.

437
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:33,973
You'll show the fart, huh?

438
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,032
Hey, just where do you come from?

439
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,580
The sky is my roof and
I sleep where ever I may.

440
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,160
- So you're a bum?
- Everyone calls me Beggar So.

441
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,710
Your name is Beggar So as well?

442
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:53,924
Beggar So?

443
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,199
That's the name.

444
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,540
That was close. Good thing I'm fast.

445
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,640
Not fast enough!
You can't escape from me!

446
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:37,595
Your father paid me well to train you
and that's what I’m going to do!

447
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,420
How long will this take?

448
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,698
- One day?
- One year exactly.

449
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,780
I'll never make it!

450
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,132
You already have your cash,
so you can relax.

451
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,998
I wouldn't do that.
I’m going to enjoy this!

452
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,999
I’ll see you in hell!

453
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,055
You're strangling me.

454
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,223
Well, you're just a stupid old fool.

455
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:42,223
You're just an old beggar who likes
to pretend you're a real tiger.

456
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,948
I’ll show you what a tiger's about!

457
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:59,594
I see your tiger's got a bad paw, huh?

458
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:01,531
Tiger-Fist!

459
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,519
It’s still there!

460
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:41,186
All that Kung-Fu looks like dancing.

461
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:42,674
The Crane attacks!

462
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:47,873
Crane's Beak. Angry Crane.

463
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:48,998
Crane eats the Shrimp!

464
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:55,482
- The Crane Flies.
- How's your head?

465
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:11,720
Your fingers are
stronger than my teeth!

466
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,836
I'm coming to get you!

467
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,880
You scared me!

468
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,392
Climbing trees to get away now, are we?

469
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,090
What? I’m just using Monkey Kung-Fu.

470
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:00,473
Ready to learn?

471
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:02,848
Answer! Answer!

472
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,850
Please stop, I want to learn.

473
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:11,200
But I don't like your
style of recruitment.

474
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,890
Let me down!
I don't want to die like this.

475
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:52,974
I thought you were
supposed to be a teacher.

476
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:55,875
But you are trying to kill me.

477
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,098
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

478
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,110
That was only your first lesson.

479
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:59,315
Trying to escape?

480
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:00,914
I just wanna take a piss.

481
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,774
So do it there!

482
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,420
From the right jar to the left jar.

483
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,853
The back jar to the right jar.

484
00:49:33,825 --> 00:49:35,545
The back jar to the front jar.

485
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,688
Left jar to the right jar.

486
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
The right jar to the front jar.

487
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,484
Left jar to right jar,
right jar to left jar.

488
00:49:59,775 --> 00:50:01,838
I can never finish it!

489
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,260
Continue!

490
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:11,408
This is torture. Fine!

491
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,147
Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung!

492
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,995
Have a good wash, you old bastard!

493
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,796
Hey you, get out of here.

494
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,675
Do you hear me? Are you deaf?

495
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,126
Are you blind? Can't you see I’m busy.

496
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,710
No hanging around you bum.
Move your ass.

497
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:50,283
Is this your place?
What if I refuse to move then?

498
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:54,698
A big mouth and a wet ass.

499
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,842
It should be taught some manners.

500
00:52:01,425 --> 00:52:02,424
How does it feel?

501
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,399
Nice and dry?

502
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:12,756
Right you twerp! I’ll give you dry!
I’ll shove you in the head first.

503
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,749
Come on...

504
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:46,948
What's that supposed to be, Kung-Fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

505
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,576
Who's your master?

506
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:50,475
No-one calls my father's Kung-Fu shit!

507
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:10,306
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

508
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:13,340
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

509
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,530
I think you'd better call me father.

510
00:53:21,925 --> 00:53:23,093
Go to hell!

511
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:31,545
Sit down!

512
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,566
Get up! Sit down again!

513
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:40,465
All my dogs must obey.

514
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,658
Quit playing!

515
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,437
Take my shoes.

516
00:54:00,925 --> 00:54:01,945
What...?

517
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,998
I don't even need to use my hands.

518
00:54:10,225 --> 00:54:12,742
You'd better use them, I’m not scared!

519
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,791
Had enough?

520
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:28,855
I won't stop until I send
you straight to hell!

521
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,710
Don't come here!

522
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,074
Ah shit!

523
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,900
You've become a cowardly turtle!

524
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:04,865
Your skull's like butter.

525
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,295
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

526
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,425
Killing a nobody like you...

527
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,405
would only ruin my reputation.

528
00:55:29,775 --> 00:55:31,773
Crawl between my legs...

529
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:33,615
and then go home to your pig-sty!

530
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,099
Crawl!

531
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,049
Wait!

532
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,575
Aren't these your pants?

533
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,975
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

534
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,230
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

535
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:18,845
Your skull's like butter.

536
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,695
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

537
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,370
Killing a nobody like you...

538
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,469
would only ruin my reputation.

539
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,498
Crawl between my legs,
then go home to your pig-sty.

540
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,499
Crawl!

541
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,840
You idiot, this wine is very expensive.

542
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:13,245
It smells good!

543
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:19,205
Master, enjoy your wine,
I'll dry your clothes.

544
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,790
Hey, why are you so sexy?

545
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,574
- The clothes caught fire...
- It’s on fire!

546
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:03,035
Oh god! You've burnt
my best cloak I have!

547
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,035
My back!

548
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:07,370
- My wrists!
- Your wrists are not strong enough.

549
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:21,798
More rabbit food...
and the tea's weak & cold.

550
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,799
Stay quiet and eat.

551
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,773
Master, you're giving me a headache.

552
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:28,055
Eat your meal.

553
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,249
What's wrong?

554
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:40,405
You're so tired you can't
even use your chopsticks?

555
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,300
Master, I’m finished.

556
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:10,905
That was quick.

557
01:03:11,675 --> 01:03:14,325
Now, use these smaller
cups to empty it again.

558
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,705
Go on.

559
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:22,205
I wish I'd known about this part first.

560
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,080
This is killing me.

561
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,740
- Hey, Hung...
- Yes?

562
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:42,205
Crack this walnut for me.

563
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,439
No, you break it like this.

564
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,010
Now you try.

565
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:57,105
Please, Master!
Haven't I cracked enough?

566
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,800
Master, why don't we go for a walk?

567
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,549
All right...

568
01:05:03,925 --> 01:05:04,835
Open now...

569
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:17,125
- Master, you're good!
- Of course.

570
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:25,720
Observe well... place your bets!

571
01:05:26,175 --> 01:05:27,865
Old man, you should leave now.

572
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:29,418
Leave?

573
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:32,579
How can I buy good wine
with so little money?

574
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:37,449
I’ve still got more money to win.

575
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,760
Come on, bet...
Trust me, bet there!

576
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:51,024
Turn it over!

577
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:53,398
Hurry up!

578
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,223
Hurry up!

579
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:56,295
Turn it over!

580
01:05:57,575 --> 01:05:58,615
Quit shouting!

581
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:10,345
You're amazing, Master. You did it again.

582
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,960
That's great.

583
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,799
Put down your bets.
We're getting rich. It's easy!

584
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
You were lucky.

585
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,170
I'll play with you...

586
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,099
in one go!

587
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,560
Right, this is my lucky day.

588
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:29,745
Come on.

589
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:55,725
- Choose.
- No problem.

590
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:03,915
Turn it over.

591
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,100
It's not there.

592
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:22,325
You think you're quick, huh?
Well, my eyes are quicker.

593
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,457
- So, you're trying to cheat, huh?
- So you're a swindler.

594
01:07:32,575 --> 01:07:35,815
Police is here, run!

595
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:49,898
You're a dirty thief.
Give me back my money!

596
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,086
You'll never get your money back!
Do you know who I am?

597
01:07:54,175 --> 01:07:55,625
Who cares!

598
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:00,605
I’ll tell you who I am,
I’m Iron-Head Rat.

599
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:02,855
I’ll show you with this brick.

600
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:07,455
Very hard indeed!

601
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,790
Scared?

602
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,200
Hey, baldy!

603
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,073
Give me back the money!

604
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:17,153
I don't care who you are! I'll beat you.

605
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,090
I warn you, shitface,
I choose who I bury next!

606
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:24,223
You don't mind to get hurt, do you?

607
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,660
I’ll let you try my iron head!

608
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,073
Master, his head is too hard!

609
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:50,848
Don't give up!

610
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,819
Let's see you stop my iron head!

611
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:02,545
This is fun!

612
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,440
Good, very good.

613
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:48,647
Bet you never guessed you'd
end up in someone's pants!

614
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:23,345
An iron hammer for an iron head?

615
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,265
Can you take it?

616
01:10:50,675 --> 01:10:52,745
That's enough, please!

617
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,290
Master, my wrists are breaking!

618
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:30,045
- Lazy!
- No.

619
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,630
My hands are gonna break!

620
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:48,525
No more exercises.
Go fetch me some wine.

621
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:51,923
Yes,

622
01:11:51,925 --> 01:11:53,625
"Ru Yi's Restaurant."

623
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,673
Waiter!

624
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:05,985
Coming. What do you want?

625
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:09,948
- Some wine.
- Shall I fill it up?

626
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,548
No, three cups will be enough.

627
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,575
Three cups?

628
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,795
Hurry up, don't just stand there.

629
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:52,350
Damn it! Where's that
stupid boy with my wine?

630
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,796
Idiot!

631
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,899
That's him!

632
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,310
Old man, who are you?

633
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,760
Who's asking?

634
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:29,315
Old man, have you heard
of the King of Sticks?

635
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:35,785
Yes, I have. Have you ever
heard of Beggar So then?

636
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:37,425
Beggar So?

637
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:39,845
In person!

638
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,010
Let's go!

639
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,248
Don't go. He doesn't
look like Beggar So.

640
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,309
- What?
- Look.

641
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:55,185
He's trembling, he can't
be the real Beggar So.

642
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,426
So you think you're being funny?
I’m not fooled that easily.

643
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,860
But I’m not lying, I am Beggar So!

644
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,798
Master.

645
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,805
Give me the wine!

646
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:16,915
It's water!

647
01:15:24,325 --> 01:15:26,335
Idiot! Now see what you've done!

648
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,300
Master!

649
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:36,773
They're lucky!
If I ever meet them again,

650
01:16:36,775 --> 01:16:38,705
I’ll kill them both. Let's go!

651
01:17:04,175 --> 01:17:06,375
Cheer up, eat something.

652
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,450
Master, it's all my
fault you were beaten.

653
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,110
It seems bad luck follows you around.

654
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:19,523
I’ve been through a lot of things,
but until this day...

655
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:21,588
I've never suffered such
humiliation like that!

656
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:26,210
He wasn't better than you, but you've
no strength without your wine.

657
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:29,185
You sure can talk.

658
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:35,790
True, but if I had been taught better,
I could've beaten that jerk.

659
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,780
You mean to say I’m not
teaching you right?

660
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:46,615
You're just pushing me around.
You're teaching me how to get beaten.

661
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:57,773
Your father is without question
an excellent martial arts Master.

662
01:17:57,775 --> 01:18:01,098
His methods are among the best.

663
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,020
So why would he ask me
to teach you my style?

664
01:18:04,775 --> 01:18:06,545
He wants you to torture me.

665
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:14,390
He asked me because he knows
I’ve got a secret style.

666
01:18:15,175 --> 01:18:16,174
What's that?

667
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,695
The Eight Drunken Gods.

668
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:24,361
It’s nothing special.
That shows your damned ignorance.

669
01:18:24,925 --> 01:18:31,990
Many people have asked me to teach
them but I turned them all down!

670
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:10,798
Don't be fooled by my staggering,
there's power inside to kill.

671
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:15,819
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.
Pretending lets you win.

672
01:19:36,575 --> 01:19:37,935
Clever, isn't it?

673
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,790
Why haven't you shown me it before?

674
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,573
Didn't your father tell you that...

675
01:19:44,575 --> 01:19:47,703
foundation is very important.

676
01:19:48,123 --> 01:19:53,650
I do this because I want you
to have a good foundation.

677
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,823
I think you're ready now.

678
01:19:57,825 --> 01:19:58,773
Really?

679
01:19:58,775 --> 01:20:02,489
To study my style, you'll find it
easier if you have a drink first.

680
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,650
Drink up.

681
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:16,445
Have another cup.

682
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,410
Fei-Hung, have you ever gone to school?

683
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,740
I've spent a few years
in a private school.

684
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,130
"Drink up the wine."

685
01:20:33,573 --> 01:20:36,850
- "May our cups never rest."
- "For I’ll sing you a song."

686
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,820
"I’ll put your ears to the test."

687
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:47,570
"Power and wealth are no avail to us.
When only drinking prevails."

688
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:50,425
Boy, enough, enough.

689
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:58,330
"Sober men and sages are
lost through the ages."

690
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,380
"All our brave drinkers
shall never die."

691
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,506
"All our brave drinkers shall never die."

692
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:08,902
"Shing Fung produces
the finest of wines."

693
01:21:10,725 --> 01:21:13,097
"The best soldiers of Shien
Yang are always young."

694
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,898
"Even the King couldn't
stop my drinking."

695
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,244
"Let's drink a toast to
our ship that's sinking."

696
01:21:24,825 --> 01:21:27,021
"With uplifted cup,
I say to the full moon."

697
01:21:30,225 --> 01:21:32,168
"Why does my shadow appear to swoon?"

698
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:35,855
"Wine in a radiant cup you see."

699
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,348
"Put down that cup the
horses are awaiting thee."

700
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:43,404
"Fallen on the battlefield, the
soldier says, who will remember me?"

701
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,032
"Who will remember me?"

702
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,277
"Who will remember me?"

703
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,025
The God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

704
01:22:41,225 --> 01:22:46,025
The God Li, the drunken cripple
with the powerful right leg.

705
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:17,110
The God Jun, the drunkard
holding a pot in his arms.

706
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:48,189
The God Lan, the drunkard with
the sudden deadly waist attack.

707
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:18,703
The God Chan, the drunkard
with the swift double-kicks.

708
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:50,220
The God Tso, the drunkard
with the powerful throat lock.

709
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,551
The God Han, the drunken flute
player with powerful wrists.

710
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:43,300
The God Miss Ho, the drunken
woman flaunting her body.

711
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,370
Concentrate! This is serious.

712
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,498
Isn't this style for women?

713
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:01,119
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she is strong. Watch me.

714
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:07,479
Do like I do!

715
01:26:21,975 --> 01:26:23,395
Continue practicing!

716
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,329
Okay, I will.

717
01:26:25,825 --> 01:26:26,895
Practice hard!

718
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:34,465
This is for sissies. I won't do it!

719
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,680
Wong Kei-Ying!

720
01:26:41,275 --> 01:26:46,335
Why do you persuade the Bull Head Hill
villagers not to sell me their land?

721
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:48,625
What was your reason for it?

722
01:26:50,575 --> 01:26:52,722
Was it because of that
business over your son?

723
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,551
That's a personal issue.

724
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:56,935
It'll be settled in good time.

725
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,060
I'm not responsible.
What is your game?

726
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:01,898
What is yours?

727
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,092
Mr. Li, why do you want to buy the hill?

728
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,948
As you wish to know, I'll tell you.

729
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:14,430
That old graveyard up there has been haunting
us for centuries, disturbing family spirits!

730
01:27:15,725 --> 01:27:19,515
They'll get more than $20 per lot,
it's good money for that land.

731
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:22,098
Then you butt your nose in
where it isn't wanted!

732
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,270
You mean you want to buy the graveyard?

733
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,048
Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Li!

734
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:33,323
And it must be exorcised.
I've got three mistresses without children!

735
01:27:33,325 --> 01:27:36,416
I'll be content with a chicken egg.
But they can't produce that!

736
01:27:36,925 --> 01:27:39,390
Maybe you've just become impotent.

737
01:27:44,975 --> 01:27:47,932
You can't hide anything
from me, Mr Li.

738
01:27:49,075 --> 01:27:50,505
And what's that supposed to mean?

739
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,807
Li Wan-Hao, I think you just
want what's hidden in the hill.

740
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,140
What would that be?

741
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,405
- The coal.
- The coal?

742
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,534
Bull Head Hill contains a rich coal deposit.

743
01:28:01,535 --> 01:28:06,668
You secretly deal with the Coal Company
to make profit from the selling of the coal.

744
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:10,425
You can fool the villagers,
but you can't fool me!

745
01:28:15,975 --> 01:28:19,545
Since you know it, I won't deny.

746
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:24,250
If you don't interfere,
I'll give you 20% of the profit.

747
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,890
20%? You'd spend so much on me?

748
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,300
Listen, Li Wan-hao,
the hill belongs to the villagers.

749
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,240
No one can take it away,
get out of here!

750
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,070
Wong Kei-Ying,
you're trying to go against me,

751
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:42,408
No matter how good your Kung-Fu is,
you are going to pay for this!

752
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,253
$1000 for the death of
Wong Kei-Ying of Fushan.

753
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,310
Wong Kei-Ying?

754
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,810
"Teacher's Birthday Ceremony"

755
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,748
Master.

756
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,550
- Is everything ready for tonight?
- Yes.

757
01:29:31,725 --> 01:29:33,778
Hurry up, there will be
many guests tonight.

758
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,580
Hey, Master Hsu.

759
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,580
Big Funeral?

760
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,199
Are you a dumb masochist?

761
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,999
Coming here looking for more punishment?

762
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,400
Didn't you suffer enough last time?

763
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:02,248
I just wanna have something
to eat and someone to beat.

764
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,174
Alright. I’ll make you
an extra special dish!

765
01:30:04,175 --> 01:30:05,898
Master, what would it be?

766
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,499
Bamboo shoot and pork.

767
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,497
- Go get my stick.
- Okay.

768
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,799
Pork?

769
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,660
I'll have a piece first.

770
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,840
Right, it tastes good!

771
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,299
Master.

772
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,499
Cheers.

773
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:02,330
Wow, your teeth are sharp!
They bit right through the bowl.

774
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,374
Now what?

775
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,770
Be careful now, toothy.
Take it easy.

776
01:31:50,825 --> 01:31:53,365
I did tell you to take it easy.

777
01:32:08,533 --> 01:32:09,533
Sit still!

778
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,850
A fart for the King of Sticks.

779
01:32:30,075 --> 01:32:31,755
This is 'Hungry Dogs Eats Shit!'

780
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:33,475
Not quite!

781
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,840
You like it?

782
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,260
He's drunk!

783
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,860
The old man will like this.

784
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:55,800
Master, the King of Sticks gave
us wine. It’s free of charge.

785
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:01,075
Master.

786
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:03,374
Master.

787
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:07,680
Master.

788
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:09,499
Master.

789
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:22,123
Fei-Hong, one year has passed...

790
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:27,073
and it’s time for us to
go our separate paths.

791
01:35:27,075 --> 01:35:31,548
I have taught you all the techniques
and the magic of kung fu.

792
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:34,723
Practice diligently,
master each technique...

793
01:35:34,725 --> 01:35:37,725
The Eight Drunken Gods
is the ultimate Kung-Fu.

794
01:35:37,725 --> 01:35:41,098
My home is the world.
Try not to miss me.

795
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,498
Go home and be a good son.

796
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:47,260
Remember this, If you ever need me,
I’ll be there. Beggar So.

797
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,598
Master...

798
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,616
Master!

799
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,099
Higher!

800
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:27,745
- Harder!
- Master Wong!

801
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:31,748
- Master Wong...
- What is it?

802
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:35,458
Master Wong, Li and his men
are digging on Bull Head Hill!

803
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,702
Really?

804
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,455
Tell the men I’m going there. Quick!

805
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:45,745
This way! Quick!

806
01:37:19,825 --> 01:37:20,924
Wong Kei-Ying,

807
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:24,501
Your skill in Kung-Fu is
renowned, I compliment you.

808
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:30,920
Who are you? I don't know you.
Why do you want to kill me?

809
01:37:32,325 --> 01:37:36,305
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.
I kill for money.

810
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:42,040
Today I have a worthy opponent,
I'd like to pay you my respects.

811
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:48,760
I’ve heard of you. The cold-blooded
assassin who'd sell his own brother.

812
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,750
That's me.

813
01:37:51,975 --> 01:37:55,948
But killing me,
you won't find that so easy.

814
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:58,713
Then I suppose you'll
want to wish me luck.

815
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,620
Hands are for door knobs
and legs break down doors.

816
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,211
30% from the hands,
the rest are from the legs.

817
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:20,315
Wong Kei-Ying. Are you
ready to meet your death?

818
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:34,623
Master.

819
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,448
Father, are you alright?

820
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,516
Idiot, you're back?

821
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,430
It’s alright. Don't be afraid. I'm here.

822
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,040
He dares to attack my father?
I’ll give him a good lesson!

823
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,185
You again?

824
01:39:51,475 --> 01:39:55,495
Good. You can help bury
your old man, shitface.

825
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:02,210
Master Wong, it's too bad
you have such a disgraceful son.

826
01:40:04,475 --> 01:40:06,445
You watch out, or you'll
have a body with no ass!

827
01:40:08,225 --> 01:40:13,355
Dumbass, go and clean pig-stys
or I’ll have to kill you too.

828
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:16,392
I won't die, bastard,
but the worms'll grow fat on you!

829
01:40:16,675 --> 01:40:21,835
Okay, I give a discount today,
killing two for the price of one!

830
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:23,625
Up yours!

831
01:40:27,075 --> 01:40:32,548
Wait... wait for me.

832
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,357
Master, what are you doing here?

833
01:40:35,575 --> 01:40:39,321
How can Beggar So
miss a great fight?

834
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,770
Beggar So, it's none of your business.
Go away!

835
01:40:44,575 --> 01:40:49,785
You are mistaken.
This is very much my business.

836
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:54,707
But don't worry, I’m not
going to fight you.

837
01:40:55,125 --> 01:40:57,485
He is good enough to do it.

838
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:01,891
Come. Drink first.

839
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,798
Master, this wine is strong.
What kind is it?

840
01:41:46,575 --> 01:41:47,913
San Pien Wine.

841
01:41:48,575 --> 01:41:49,574
I’m drunk!

842
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:47,890
I’m the God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

843
01:42:59,275 --> 01:43:00,955
The cripple Li!

844
01:43:28,925 --> 01:43:31,856
The drunk with a strong right leg.

845
01:43:33,225 --> 01:43:34,295
The God Lan!

846
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:56,260
A sudden attack to the waist,
the God Jun!

847
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:00,380
Holding a pot in his arms,
Han's gone mad!

848
01:44:16,425 --> 01:44:18,915
Well done, the Eight Drunken Gods...

849
01:44:19,775 --> 01:44:23,365
Patience, you've not seen it all yet.

850
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,500
The God Han.

851
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:32,060
He's the flute player
with the powerful wrists.

852
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:01,450
Impressive!

853
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:04,890
Your flute is bent.

854
01:45:06,025 --> 01:45:07,024
The God Tso,

855
01:45:07,925 --> 01:45:11,280
- drunkard with the powerful...
- Throat Lock.

856
01:45:33,675 --> 01:45:35,075
Now your lock is broken.

857
01:45:49,575 --> 01:45:50,825
The Devil's Shadowless Hands.

858
01:45:52,525 --> 01:45:53,775
Yes, you're very observant.

859
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,850
The God Chan!

860
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,125
The God Chan won't reach old age!

861
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,230
Where's the drunken Miss Ho?

862
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:29,584
Miss Ho... Ho...

863
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,960
Wait!

864
01:46:37,275 --> 01:46:40,298
- Master, there's a problem.
- What?

865
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,550
I didn't bother to learn this!

866
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,870
- Can you teach me now?
- It’s too late!

867
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,760
Fei-Hung!

868
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,460
She'll appear without a shadow,
just perform the actions.

869
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:25,070
Combine the other 7 styles,
and make your own Miss Ho.

870
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:29,400
Ho? You want Ho? Sure.

871
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,920
This is called Widow Seeing Lover off.

872
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:54,980
Woman sitting on a toilet Seat.

873
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:03,445
You don't sit right!

874
01:48:11,825 --> 01:48:12,985
Putting on Make-up.
