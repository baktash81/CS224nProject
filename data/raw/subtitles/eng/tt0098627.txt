2
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,990
Oh, God.

3
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,451
How are you, Richard? Hot enough for you?

4
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,619
Yeah.

5
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,670
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,299
You dummy, why don't you watch
where you are going?

7
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,662
Does this look like 10:00, or like 10:30?

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,956
- Morning, Richard!
- Good morning.

9
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,292
- You are a half hour late.
- Only a half hour?

10
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,420
I am usually 45 minutes late.
I am early today.

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,297
I see.

12
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,890
- Are you going to join me today or what?
- Coming.

13
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,186
Give me your money and your wallets.

14
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,939
Get your ass out of here. It is too hot.

15
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,324
Color me old-fashioned, Rich,
but I just love the park on a Sunday.

16
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,495
I would love it more if we didn't have
to work today. Come on, let's go.

17
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,551
Let me open that for you, all right?

18
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,204
Hot enough for you, Larry?

19
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,166
No, Harris, why don't you turn up the heat?

20
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,626
Okay. I'll tell the engineer.

21
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,426
Cheap bastards. Turn off
the air conditioning on the weekends.

22
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,080
- Let's go to the beach.
- No.

23
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,250
- We are going to be here our whole lives.
- Yeah, I am afraid so.

24
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,424
- I am going to the beach!
- Give me those papers.

25
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,010
- The papers are going to the beach.
- We aren't going.

26
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,221
You want these?
You're coming to the beach.

27
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,099
- I guess we are going to the beach.
- Wilson at the line.

28
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,269
That was beautiful. Replay.

29
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,941
Give me those papers!

30
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,740
- You think it's safe to go in the water?
- No, better not.

31
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,121
- You just ate. You might get cramps.
- I'll risk it.

32
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,174
{y:i}We'll get back to you with more tunes,
{y:i}but first we'll hear...

33
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,427
{y:i}the latest from Weather Central.

34
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,638
{y:i}- What is happening out there, buddy?
{y:i}- Sizzle, sizzle...

35
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,266
{y:i}as the Big Apple becomes the Baked Apple.

36
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
{y:i}You better believe that these are...

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
Oh, Christ. Will you shut that thing off?

38
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,480
{y:i}... continues before Labor Day weekend.

39
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:37,152
{y:i}It is going to be the four "H's":
{y:i}Hot, humid, hazy, and horrible.

40
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,157
This sucks. I am so unhappy.

41
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,995
- We should be at a real beach.
- There are no more real beaches.

42
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,166
I mean we could go to Jones Beach
and float around in the hospital waste.

43
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,335
Then again Coney Island is always real nice.

44
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,963
We could go there and watch the fish
disintegrate in front of our eyes.

45
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,384
Wait a minute. Wait a goddamn...
Hold the phone, buddy! I got it!

46
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,970
I got the $2 million. Where are your pages?

47
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,638
Get your pages.

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,142
Oh, my God!
You are not going to believe what you see!

49
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,895
- Okay.
- Turn to Page 28.

50
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,482
Right after 27.

51
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,902
- Got it.
- All right? You got it?

52
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,196
I want you to turn to Page 41 now.

53
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,699
- I got it.
- Check out line 18.

54
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
- Okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,035
- You see it?
- I see it.

56
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,953
What about it?

57
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,499
You are such a stupid piece of rat shit.

58
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,292
Hot!

59
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,045
- Watch your step!
- I am being barbecued here!

60
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,174
All right. Okay. All right, buddy
I am going to explain it to you real slow.

61
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,342
- Good.
- Okay.

62
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,221
There's more than one check issued
on the same life insurance policy claim.

63
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,225
One in December of '87, another in
April of '88, and two more in June.

64
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,352
- Making any sense?
- Yeah, he died four times.

65
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,230
Yes. According to this, he died four times.

66
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,899
So somebody screwed up.
It wasn't us. Was it?

67
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,026
No. It wasn't us.

68
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,987
Don't you see?
We just uncovered a $2 million error.

69
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,074
We're going to be heroes.
We're going up the corporate ladder.

70
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,660
- This is good for me.
- Yes, this is good for you.

71
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,414
- It's good for me, too.
- I'll tell Lomax first thing in the morning.

72
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,749
- What page is it?
- No, Larry. Let me tell him.

73
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,210
- We'll both tell him.
- Okay. Great!

74
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,845
There is what's-her-name.

75
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
Stop staring at her.

76
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,944
You've not shut up about her
for two months.

77
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,031
- Ask her out already, will you?
- No. I don't know what to say.

78
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,324
She's a summer intern.
She'll be gone in a week.

79
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,617
No, I've no idea what to say.

80
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,996
- Say "Hi, I want to go out with you."
- I can't say that.

81
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,831
Why not?

82
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,791
Because there are too many people around.

83
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,419
It's New York City.
There are always too many people.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,087
Excuse me, miss.

85
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,678
Oh, shit.

86
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,805
Good weekend, Bob?

87
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,022
- You going to say something?
- Shut up.

88
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,442
- You are blowing it.
- Shut...

89
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,362
Please, shut up, all right?

90
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,828
Thank you.

91
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,796
Okay.

92
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,173
Try witty.

93
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,218
Say, "You know what would look
good on you?"

94
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,097
- "Me." Huh?
- Oh, please.

95
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,766
- Richard, that is a very good line.
- Enough, look...

96
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,769
- if I wanted to talk to her, I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her.

97
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,688
- Would you talk to her?
- Would you stop?

98
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,773
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yes.

99
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay. Shut up.

100
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,443
Excuse me.

101
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,330
My aunt is very sick.

102
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,879
What?

103
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,216
Nothing.

104
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,644
I don't believe this, she's...

105
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,522
Now, don't flagellate yourself
over this, Richard.

106
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,191
It was a very good effort.
You'll get her next time.

107
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,153
Why did I just say that?
Larry, I don't even have an aunt.

108
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,487
So what?

109
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,990
Anything going on?

110
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,825
There are these messages.

111
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,953
And you are late for
the creative sales meeting, Mr. Lomax.

112
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,748
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- Let me get that, sir.

113
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,583
Sammy. Hank. How are you?

114
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,084
Richard Parker, sir.

115
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,919
- Larry Wilson.
- Whatever.

116
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,464
There's nothing from a Doreena,
a Martha, Judy?

117
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,008
- No.
- Well, that's their tough luck.

118
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,426
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- What?

119
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,678
There's something
we would like to show you.

120
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,223
Wait. It's Monday morning.
After lunch, right?

121
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,142
Quite a bit after lunch.

122
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,643
Shoo.

123
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,835
Yeah, I got it, François.

124
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,507
That's $2.

125
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,302
Rich.

126
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,929
Look at Lomax.

127
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,263
God.

128
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,767
My God. Look at her.

129
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,893
My God.

130
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,979
Jesus. That guy.

131
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,817
Beautiful apartment. House at the beach.

132
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,028
Babes. A boat. A car.

133
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,907
Do you know how much it costs
to park a car in Manhattan every month?

134
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,953
- More than my rent.
- I mean, it's only fair.

135
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,206
His car is a bit bigger than your apartment.

136
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,084
So my apartment is small. It's dark.

137
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,671
It's hot. It's in a high-crime area.
Beats living with Mom and Dad.

138
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,216
All right. Enough.
It's just until I can afford something decent.

139
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,969
Something without
wall-to-wall cockroaches.

140
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,891
All I have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard...

141
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,393
- I'll be fine.
- You are so naive.

142
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,311
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

143
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,648
Go ahead. Oh, God.

144
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,775
I hope your aunt feels better.

145
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,653
- What?
- I said...

146
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,072
She said, "I hope your aunt feels better."

147
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,367
My aunt? The sick aunt. Yes, she is fine.

148
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,785
They thought it was...

149
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,496
Either get on the elevator or get off.

150
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,874
I'll be back.

151
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,006
And I lose again.

152
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,092
I won. I have a date.

153
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,470
- You are kidding.
- No.

154
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,765
Gwen and I, Thursday night,
8:00 p.m., dinner.

155
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,268
- Fabulous.
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.

156
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,313
You are going to want
to borrow my apartment.

157
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,982
No, but thank you. That's sweet.

158
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,902
But I can't do that to you. Thank you.

159
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,615
If she finds out you live with your folks,
you will embarrass yourself.

160
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,368
Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.

161
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,791
It is the cockroaches, isn't it?

162
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,127
- Well...
- They scatter when the lights go on.

163
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,882
{y:i}Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.

164
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,425
I feel lucky.

165
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,182
No, I only want the Maserati
if it comes in that jet black.

166
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,725
Look, if you can't do it for me...

167
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,895
I'll just have to take my business
to another dealer.

168
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,522
Yeah.

169
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,484
So paint it! I mean how hard
can this whole thing be?

170
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,777
Right.

171
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,905
All right. See, that's better.

172
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,866
See how easy it is to do business with me?

173
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,996
No trade. Strictly cash.

174
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,623
Right.

175
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,917
All right. Good.

176
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,633
Gentlemen, what have you got for me?

177
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,472
As you may or may not know, Mr. Lomax...

178
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,852
Larry and I have been, I mean, working.

179
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,771
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

180
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,941
What are we supposed to do?

181
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,029
Bet that thing moves, huh? Jesus.

182
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,781
- Put that back.
- It's a beautiful boat.

183
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,294
You gentlemen were saying...

184
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,628
Yes, well.

185
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,672
As you might have heard...

186
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,802
Larry and I have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system.

187
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,554
- Right.
- Thanks.

188
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,849
Sir, it's a very big job.

189
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,310
A big job. We have been working hard.

190
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,436
A very big job.

191
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,938
I've been at it for quite some time.
Weekends also.

192
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,191
- Weekends, late, and...
- Why don't you show him?

193
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,317
Thank you.

194
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,319
We've got something
you should know about.

195
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,113
- Got them both there?
- Yes. Page 28 and 41.

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,503
You sure these figures are accurate?

197
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,380
- Yes.
- Positive.

198
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,215
Yes, sir, Mr. Lomax.

199
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,177
Bernie.

200
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,433
Call me Bernie.

201
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,894
I mean my father is Mr. Lomax, right?

202
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,030
Okay, Bernie.

203
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:29,119
- Yes, it's all there in black and white.
- We both worked on this one, Bern.

204
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,037
"E."

205
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,123
Bernie.

206
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,752
- Papers.
- Right here, Bernie.

207
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,381
If anything has to go,
I am glad it's my vision...

208
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,676
and not the old joystick,
you know what I mean?

209
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,638
That's computer ink, sir.

210
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,353
Oh, no, you are wrong. Look.

211
00:14:55,854 --> 00:15:00,233
There are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written.

212
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,944
You didn't take into consideration
that it's normal...

213
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,156
especially when using
a fluctuating COL index to combine...

214
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,285
Iook here, a package containing
short-term and straight life policies...

215
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,287
in an overall insurance portfolio.

216
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,581
Now you are wasting my time.

217
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,255
Richard worked on that part, sir.

218
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,009
That is true, Bernie.

219
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:31,056
But if you were to look at the back page,
where the policy indexes are...

220
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,600
you'll notice that the remaining policies...

221
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,979
are dated after
the policy holder died, Bernie.

222
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,773
You are right.

223
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,026
You are absolutely right.
Gentlemen, this is good work.

224
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,861
Very, very good work.

225
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,613
Thank you, Bernie.

226
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,741
I hate to say this, but it appears
as if somebody is trying...

227
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,744
to defraud the company.
Perhaps we should check back records.

228
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,538
Somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy.

229
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,707
No smoking.

230
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,252
Gentlemen, how long have you two
been working here?

231
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,838
- Nineteen months and a week.
- I am not really sure.

232
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,716
- A little longer, I think.
- Longer? I was here before you.

233
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,134
No, Richard. I trained you.

234
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,179
I came here in January,
you came the end of May.

235
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,889
I trained you.

236
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,307
Whatever!

237
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,311
What I am saying is that
I think there is a big future here...

238
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,231
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves.

239
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,108
Thank you.

240
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,527
But I'd like to go over these numbers
with you...

241
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,029
just to make sure
that you've gotten everything.

242
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,282
The only trouble is if someone is trying to...

243
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,910
like you said
"smoke it past the wrong guy"...

244
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,329
I'd like to just keep it confidential.

245
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,124
I mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags.

246
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,417
No, absolutely not.

247
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,460
If you would like, we'll work late.

248
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,922
- Yes, I mean we'll work weekends.
- Weekends are very good for me.

249
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,508
Weekends. Good idea.

250
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,845
Give us plenty of time together,
no distractions.

251
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,638
It is Labor Day.

252
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,019
I got an idea.

253
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,483
How would you two like to come
to my house at the beach?

254
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,901
- Me?
- Us?

255
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,737
Yeah. Hampton Island.

256
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,614
Ever been there? Well, you will love it.

257
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,034
When we're not working,
there are distractions.

258
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,078
There are women, swimming,
boating, famous people.

259
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,875
Well?

260
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,001
- Love to!
- Okay.

261
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,961
Good! It's settled.

262
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,715
We are going to have a good time,
I guarantee.

263
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,884
My secretary will write down
the directions...

264
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,303
- give you the ferry schedule.
- The ferry schedule?

265
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,806
It's the only way to get there,
unless you have a boat. I don't know.

266
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,725
I have never even been on a boat.

267
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,311
I was once on the Staten Island Ferry
with my folks...

268
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,357
Whatever. You come out Friday night,
you'll have a great time, I guarantee it.

269
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,526
I'll even drive you back to the city myself
on Monday. Okay?

270
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,820
We don't know what to say, Bernie.

271
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,907
You don't have to say anything.

272
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,035
If you two uncovered what I think
you uncovered...

273
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,997
old Bernie here owes you both a great deal.
I mean it sincerely.

274
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,375
Now get out of here. Go on.

275
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,920
He loves us.

276
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,341
The man absolutely loves us.

277
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,095
You have to kill them, Vito.

278
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,484
Let me explain something to you.

279
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,197
We don't do that anymore.
We are a corporation now.

280
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,742
We are in the market. We invest.

281
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,746
Real estate. Car rentals. Parking lots.

282
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,500
Parking lots. That's good.

283
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:49,295
- I understand that, but...
- Didn't I order the walnut dressing?

284
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,798
- Yes, you did.
- Taste that.

285
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,720
Does that taste
anything like walnut dressing? Tell me.

286
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,889
This is the raspberry vinaigrette.

287
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,518
Should I have Paulie go
and talk to the chef?

288
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,899
This goddamn raspberry vinaigrette...

289
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,864
Excuse me, Vito.

290
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,500
I know how important food is to you,
I mean...

291
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,837
But we've got a problem here.

292
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,341
I give problems. I don't get problems.

293
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,390
How do you propose to handle it?

294
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,643
Let's make it a murder-suicide job. All right?

295
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,729
Okay, gentlemen?

296
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,733
I'll plant some money, fake a note,
and they can take the rap and...

297
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,736
I won't even have to change the books.

298
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,821
What do you think?

299
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,495
I like it. It's creative.

300
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,251
I am a little rusty. But it'll come back to me.

301
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,759
Okay.

302
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,306
- Do it.
- This is good.

303
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,101
I mean this is really good. Good.

304
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,898
I think we are going to have some fun.

305
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,156
- I have to get going. I really do.
- What, no dessert?

306
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,868
They do a wonderful crème brûlée here.
It's delicious.

307
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,872
No, gentlemen, I really must be going.
Thanks for dinner, Vito.

308
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,090
I got to go powder my nose.

309
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,901
Forget the accident with the two guys.

310
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,486
Take care of Lomax.

311
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,531
He's getting too careless...

312
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,409
too greedy.

313
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,997
Besides...

314
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,500
he's screwing my girlfriend.

315
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:35,712
But you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach!

316
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,840
You heard the conversation.
What am I supposed to do about it?

317
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,924
- Bernie.
- What?

318
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:43,803
I told Vito I was going to spend
some time with my mother!

319
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,771
I have to see you, Bernie.

320
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,315
Cut it out.

321
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,943
- What's wrong with you? Wait a minute.
- What?

322
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,987
- I have an idea.
- What?

323
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,199
You are on, 9:00 Friday night.
I'll be at the apartment.

324
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,242
Just use your key. All right?

325
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,329
I'll wear something special.

326
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,874
I bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before.

327
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,000
No.

328
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,964
- I am glad you finally asked me out.
- You are?

329
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,551
I wish you had asked me out sooner.

330
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,138
Today was my last day at work.
I am going back to college.

331
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,558
We could still have
this weekend together, right?

332
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,686
I am spending it with my folks.

333
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,313
- Are your folks in town?
- No.

334
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,859
Is this the intimate evening
I promised you, or what?

335
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,613
You think there's anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk...

336
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:47,075
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks?

337
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,119
- Hey, want to throw her in?
- How you doing?

338
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,497
I'd invite you to my apartment,
but I have five roommates.

339
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,041
And they are all at home
doing their hair right now.

340
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:59,295
That's a lot of hair. But it's clean. I like that.

341
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:04,009
It's either that or living with my parents,
and I don't think that's a good idea.

342
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,679
I can't blame you. Who'd want
to live with their folks? That's no good.

343
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,932
- Do you have any roommates?
- No. Roommates? No. None.

344
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,851
Why don't we go to your place?

345
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:16,688
Come on, baby. You're not a woman.
Are you? Tell me the truth.

346
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,987
Okay.

347
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,543
Why are you tiptoeing?

348
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,504
Because...

349
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,762
the people who live downstairs,
they're very light sleepers.

350
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,557
They get angry when I walk.

351
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,810
Why are you whispering?

352
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,064
- Am I?
- Yes.

353
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:04,194
I am. That's because of the walls.
They are too thin.

354
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:09,032
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

355
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,299
Look at this teak.
I mean this whole apartment.

356
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,135
Sort of '60s style.

357
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,347
Yeah. I know.
I've been meaning to redo that for years.

358
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,642
No, I love it. I mean, it's very hip.

359
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,479
I think you have done the place beautifully.

360
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,898
I like it. It's home.

361
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,026
You know, it's a side of you
I never would have expected.

362
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,695
I'm very impressed.

363
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,488
- Are you?
- Yeah.

364
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,074
About what?

365
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,411
This apartment has got to be expensive.

366
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,372
So obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that...

367
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,125
Is "dump" the word you are groping for?

368
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,836
You didn't like Hymie's Hunan?

369
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,715
- It's a four-star dive.
- It was great. I loved it.

370
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,301
It's just that some men
would try to impress women by...

371
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,595
pretending to be something they are not.

372
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,307
I absolutely agree. That's a terrible way
to begin a relationship.

373
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,269
Pretending to be something you are not.

374
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,687
Oh, God.

375
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,024
You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to...

376
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,901
but how do you afford a place like this?

377
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,489
I don't like to brag.

378
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,993
I just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money...

379
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:39,414
but I've made some wise investments.
I dabble in the stock market.

380
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:43,960
And of course my parents
were rather well off.

381
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,421
Do you want to sit?

382
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,343
They passed away?

383
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,553
Yes.

384
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,847
They must have been young.

385
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,016
Oh, yeah.

386
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,019
I feel I can trust you.

387
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,440
They were in a train accident.

388
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,193
Yeah, I mean I don't know
what it was with trains...

389
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:12,030
but they just always liked to travel in trains.

390
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,491
I am sorry.

391
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,869
- How awful for you.
- Yeah.

392
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:24,668
You know, I always thought trains
were so much safer than planes.

393
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,797
Well, actually, a plane...

394
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,800
fell on the train.

395
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,370
- Richard.
- Gwen.

396
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:06,960
There's a man in his underwear
in your kitchen.

397
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,879
He's... He's with me.

398
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,427
He's my butler. But...

399
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,763
- You have a butler?
- Yeah. Don't get him started.

400
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:22,308
He'll just go away if you just be quiet.

401
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,361
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

402
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,196
Good evening, young lady.

403
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,407
That's all right, Monroe.

404
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:44,998
Yes, will you, please, just go lay out
my navy blue suit for the morning?

405
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,207
Please.

406
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,752
- How about if I lay you out?
- Very well.

407
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,469
- You let your butler talk to you like that?
- Well, he is a vet.

408
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,888
He has got a steel plate in his head.

409
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,351
Gwen, it's not what you think.

410
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,644
Goodbye, Richard.

411
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,007
I'll grab the bow line.

412
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:39,302
- Hey, Skeet. How are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Lomax.

413
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,389
Here you go, my friend.
Buy yourself a girlfriend.

414
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,392
Where have you been, Candy?

415
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,521
- Hey, Bernie. How about a drink?
- A little bit later.

416
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,319
- Yo, Bernie. The cocktail flag is up.
- A little bit later.

417
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,280
Booze and women.
That is my lifestyle and I love it!

418
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:00,699
And I!

419
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,781
- George, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Lomax.

420
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,495
What are you doing here?
I fired you last week.

421
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,205
- I just want my $90, okay?
- Bullshit!

422
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,750
You drank my liquor
and the toilets still don't work.

423
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,752
I don't want to see you.

424
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,420
Get out of here!

425
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,590
You come back again,
I am going to call the cops!

426
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,508
You son of a bitch.

427
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:07,599
- I am sorry. I think she needs a little B-12.
- Whatever.

428
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,643
{y:i}This is Bernie. Leave a message,
{y:i}I'll get right back to you.

429
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,771
- Goodbye, Mr. Lomax.
- Bye.

430
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,481
Hello?

431
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,443
Hey, Lomax. It's Paulie.
I just got to the island.

432
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:19,903
You are early.

433
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,447
Those schmucks are not coming
until the 6:00 ferry...

434
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,116
- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.

435
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,576
So where is your house?

436
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,787
It's on the point, top of the dune.

437
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,831
Look, Paulie,
don't kill them while I am around.

438
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,084
Bernie, we are on a phone here.

439
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,002
Right. You are right. Okay, I am sorry.

440
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:39,547
The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi, okay?

441
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,716
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

442
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,813
Oh, God!

443
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,441
Rich. It is leaving. Come on!

444
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,111
I told you we should've taken
a taxi from the station.

445
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:04,239
- There's another boat in a half hour.
- We'll miss the parties.

446
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,366
We got it. Excuse me.

447
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:08,827
- Sorry.
- Coming through.

448
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,497
Don't be ridiculous! What are you doing?
We are not jumping on this boat!

449
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,998
- Do you hear me?
- Here we go!

450
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,252
Listen to me, Larry, we are not
jumping on this boat!

451
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,796
- Jesus Christ! My elbow!
- Piece of cake!

452
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,883
Thanks, pal.

453
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,181
This ferry isn't leaving. It's docking.

454
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:33,727
- Okay. We're early.
- You schmuck.

455
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,786
- What is your name?
- What is your name?

456
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,080
- Larry.
- Hi, Larry. I am Michelle.

457
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,834
Come on! Lighten up there, Rich!
We are on our way!

458
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,755
I am so depressed.
I made a fool out of myself last night.

459
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:02,964
Of course you did.

460
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,633
- I should've stayed home.
- What are you talking about?

461
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:09,429
We've been summoned to the mountain top.
This is good for your career.

462
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,600
You know, by the time this weekend is over,
I promise you won't even remember...

463
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,853
what's-her-name's name.
I'll get you a drink. Come on.

464
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,147
Look, I'll see you later.

465
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,816
Goodbye, young man. Nice talking to you.

466
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,041
That is good. This is very good.

467
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,008
- I did not hear you come in.
- I know.

468
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,302
I am real good at that.

469
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,055
- I told you the guys aren't here yet, didn't I?
- You did.

470
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,973
- Good.
- Quite a shack you have here.

471
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,558
It's home.

472
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,603
Can I have a cigarette?

473
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,648
Cigarette.

474
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,193
Sure.

475
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,741
What was...

476
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,920
Quite a ride, huh, Bern?

477
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,817
Glorious day out, or what?

478
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,402
Where's Bernie?

479
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:51,906
I got it right here. It says it's the last house
on the point, top of the dune.

480
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,786
Pardon me, Monsignor, sir, could you
tell me where the top of the dune is?

481
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,540
- Bless you, my son.
- Thank you, Father.

482
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,126
Look, we'll find it. Okay.

483
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,755
- You know, it's an island, right?
- How hard can it be?

484
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,300
Excuse me. Is this the way to...

485
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:29,527
- Yo, is this Bernie Lomax's house?
- Sure is.

486
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,237
Wow.

487
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:34,199
Holy shit. Look at this.

488
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,410
Come on, Rich.

489
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,831
Oh, beautiful.

490
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,209
Oh, my God. He has got a pool.

491
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:47,587
He has got a goddamn pool at the beach.
It's heated.

492
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,047
I love this man.

493
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,884
This is inspiring. Look at this view.

494
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:56,429
- I am getting laid.
- Sure beats Coney Island.

495
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,021
What? Should we just walk in?

496
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:10,860
No, we'll stand out here all weekend.
Come on, we are houseguests.

497
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,031
Hello! Bernie, we are here.

498
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:16,866
Amazing.

499
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,077
I am home.

500
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,578
Excellent.

501
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:25,709
- Admit it. You are glad you came.
- Okay, I admit it.

502
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:30,171
- We got three days of this ahead of us.
- Oh, yeah. This is something.

503
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:34,759
I mean a place like this must go for what,
a $1.6 million, $1.7 million. Unfurnished.

504
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:38,096
- Good God! That's a Lichtenstein!
- What? Where?

505
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,640
Not the piano. The painting. It's an original.

506
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,392
Of course it is.

507
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,854
All of this could be yours,
if you set your goals and work hard.

508
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:49,357
My old man worked hard.
All they did was give him more work.

509
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,154
Hey, is Bernie around?

510
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:58,658
Hello. No, haven't seen him.
But we just got here.

511
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,327
We're going to be here all weekend.
We are houseguests.

512
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,788
Tell him Tawny borrowed his boat
to go skiing.

513
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,832
Hi, Tawny. I am horny.

514
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:10,253
- Hi. Look, don't forget to tell Bernie, okay?
- Okay.

515
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:14,215
Tawny, you wouldn't happen to know
where Bernie is, would you?

516
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:15,717
He's probably making the rounds.

517
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,888
Everybody parties from house to house,
but they always end up here. Bye!

518
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:24,517
- And you didn't want to come.
- I admit it, I was wrong.

519
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,520
Oh, my God.

520
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:33,193
Nothing but champagne and caviar.
Pierre Jouët.

521
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,111
This guy is my idol.

522
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,072
- Don't open that.
- Why not?

523
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,324
We are houseguests, come on.
You want some?

524
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:42,535
No, thanks. This is strange.
Where's our host?

525
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,872
You heard Tawny. He's out partying.
Come on.

526
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,750
Let's check out the rest of this joint.

527
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,460
This is fabulous.

528
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,344
I found him. Mr. Lomax.

529
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,471
Bernie! How are you doing? Great place.

530
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:05,183
I hope you don't mind, but we just
walked in. We didn't know that you...

531
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,518
Bernie?

532
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,937
He's sleeping.

533
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,066
Yeah.

534
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,654
It's not even dark out
and he's out of his skull.

535
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,323
He's been working awfully hard, you know.

536
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,243
Don't slap him. That's your boss.

537
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,496
I know. He's meditating.

538
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,708
He's not. He's like dead, man.
Come on, let's walk him around.

539
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,668
We'll get the blood circulating.

540
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:33,920
There we go. Okay, this way.

541
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,798
Here we go.

542
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,385
That's it. Move those feet, Bernie.
That's a boy.

543
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,679
- Here you go.
- Get him up.

544
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,848
Carry your weight, here, Richard.

545
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,266
Come on, Bernie.

546
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:48,935
- Move those feet.
- He's giving me a hernia.

547
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,564
I am losing him. Put him on the couch.

548
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,945
- We can't just leave him like this, you know.
- Come on, Bernie.

549
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:06,161
Get your hand off me, Bernie.

550
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,790
I'll make the coffee.

551
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:22,135
Don't you worry, Mr. Lomax, we'll make
you some coffee, fix you right up.

552
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,432
Tell you what, let's just make you
a little more comfy.

553
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,726
That is better. There you go.

554
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,772
You are dropping things
right out of your pocket here.

555
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,114
You want to come in here for a minute?

556
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,909
- Yeah, look, Rich, is instant okay?
- That's fine.

557
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,745
- Good. What?
- Look what I found in his pocket.

558
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,249
Wow.

559
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,418
Jesus.

560
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,963
I never knew he was into the drug scene.

561
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,217
God. Look how much is here.

562
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,387
This is not recreational. This is a career.

563
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,722
This man needs some help. You know that?

564
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,141
If he's not careful,
he's going to wake up dead.

565
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:13,228
I watch {y:i}20/{y:i}20. I know the statistics.

566
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,230
I read.

567
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,776
- What?
- Larry, Lomax is dead.

568
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,616
He can't be.

569
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,757
Why do these things always happen to me?

570
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:50,306
What kind of a host invites you to his house
for the weekend and dies on you?

571
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:55,061
Why would he do this?
I mean, he had everything.

572
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:58,314
A house. Cars. Women.

573
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,026
This is tragic.

574
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:06,364
I don't understand why he couldn't wait
until Monday to kill himself.

575
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,410
Look. We have to call the police.

576
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:14,873
And how am I going to get back to the city?
He promised me a ride.

577
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:19,419
Knock it off, Larry. Who cares about a ride?
We are talking death here.

578
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,173
I mean this is just my luck.

579
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:25,633
I finally catch a break at the office...

580
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:28,970
finally see some light
at the end of the tunnel and wham! Gone!

581
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,182
Wait a minute. What am I going to tell them?

582
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:34,642
They might think
we had something to do with it.

583
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,854
I told everyone we were going
to Bernie's house for the weekend.

584
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:40,440
They were so jealous. I mean, I loved it.

585
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:44,611
- Now what am I going to tell them?
- I don't know.

586
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,697
Bernie, you should have been on the court.

587
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:50,492
- What a great day.
- Do you see him?

588
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:51,868
Where are you?

589
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:03,922
Bernie, baby, get off your ass.
It's party time!

590
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:07,217
You should have been out there
sailing with us today.

591
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,470
The sun was fabulous, the wind was
fabulous, we had a great time.

592
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,305
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

593
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:16,017
Love you, darling, just love you.
You know, you could use a little sun.

594
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,228
We are going again tomorrow
if you want to go.

595
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,190
Lie on the deck, catch those rays.
Don't worry. I'll help myself.

596
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:25,568
He's dead.

597
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,197
That's the idea, isn't it? Cheers.

598
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:31,908
Hi, Bern!

599
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,202
Hey, Bernie.

600
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,289
Hi, Bernie.

601
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,585
Hey, dude. You need to pump some iron.

602
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,048
So, Bernie. What about your Porsche?

603
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:48,842
Had a chance to think about my offer?

604
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:52,804
You know, $30,000 is a more than
decent price for that car.

605
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:58,143
You just think about it, take your time,
don't rush into anything. See you later.

606
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:04,733
Excuse me.

607
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:05,984
You promised me a review...

608
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,403
on the front page
of the {y:i}Sunday Times book section.

609
00:42:08,486 --> 00:42:10,280
I know, Alice, but he won't bend on it.

610
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,782
He says there's no interest
in the subject matter.

611
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,035
Pardon me. What's the book about?

612
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:18,329
Whether Sherlock Holmes
and Dr. Watson were secretly married.

613
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,457
- Eyes, nose, and breasts.
- How much?

614
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:23,376
A little tuck here, little sand there,
a little lift there.

615
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,794
Do I need that much?

616
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,756
These people.
Where did all these people come from?

617
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:30,300
Floating party. Happens every weekend.

618
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,552
- Like a drink?
- No, thanks.

619
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:35,096
Yeah, I'd love some champagne, thanks.

620
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,766
Hey, Bernie. What a radical party.

621
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:41,394
Got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon, B.

622
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:45,774
Liza's maid is over for the weekend,
and I had to give her your regular time.

623
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:48,693
Thanks, Klaus. I got it.

624
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,403
See you, Bern.

625
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:53,948
Feels good, eh, Bern? You are really loose.

626
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:57,327
Never seen you this relaxed before.
Keep it up.

627
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,287
I've got to go. Duty calls.

628
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,248
Hey, babe.

629
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,710
Hi, Bernie. I hear you got something for me.

630
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,712
A little present.

631
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,341
Playing games, are we?

632
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:14,636
It's got to be in here somewhere.

633
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:18,515
I think I found something.

634
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,060
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

635
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,481
Doesn't anyone realize he's dead?

636
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,277
Okay, Bernie, I'm going to shoot the wad.

637
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,823
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I am going to go $40,000.

638
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,701
No? You'll be begging me.

639
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,830
We have to call the police.

640
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,791
Here.

641
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,420
- Some of the biggest producers.
- Yeah?

642
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,266
Hello, is this the police? Yes...

643
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,601
I got an idea.

644
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,646
I know it's going to sound funny,
but just hear me out.

645
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,816
No, why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up?

646
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:12,527
Okay, now, we could call the police,
we could do that...

647
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,946
but you know where we'd be
spending our weekend...

648
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:19,701
in some hot police station answering
questions we don't know the answers to.

649
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:23,204
Now, obviously Bernie felt
he owed us something here...

650
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:26,750
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company.

651
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,253
That's why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place.

652
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,798
It'd be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish.

653
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:38,553
All I am saying is,
why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

654
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,016
Just for a bit?

655
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:48,897
I don't believe I am hearing this.

656
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,359
I loved that man. He loved me.

657
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,444
I know he loved you.

658
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,030
He'd want this.

659
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:02,202
I mean he would really want this.

660
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,457
Yes, Operator, can you get me
the police, please? Thank you.

661
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:10,251
Incidentally,
you're a disgusting human being.

662
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,254
Gwen.

663
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:20,095
- Well, hello, Gwen.
- Wayne. Hi.

664
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,682
{y:i}Hampton Bay Police Department.

665
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:25,934
{y:i}Hello?

666
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:28,728
It's amazing.

667
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:33,817
{y:i}- Hello. Police department.
- I'll call the police.

668
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:37,487
No, you know, you were right.
Bernie would have wanted it this way.

669
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,739
No, I think we should call the police.

670
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:42,701
Larry, just give me 10 minutes, okay?

671
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:45,370
Take 20.

672
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,623
- Hi.
- Hi, Freda.

673
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,291
Darling, you look wonderful.

674
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,502
$45,000.

675
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:56,047
Plus free tennis lessons.
That's it, take it or leave it.

676
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,593
Is this guy a tough negotiator or what?

677
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,972
Keep the piece of shit.

678
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,268
What a bash.

679
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:15,817
You animal. You are insatiable.

680
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,361
You slay me, Bernie.

681
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:22,449
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bernie is a little wasted right now.

682
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:25,076
Hi. Wait. Okay.

683
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,871
I can't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.

684
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:30,582
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to speak to me, either.

685
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:35,128
But I just want to tell you I am sorry
for being such a jerk last night.

686
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,882
I don't know what got into me.
I hope you can forgive me.

687
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:47,766
It was kind of funny, seeing your father
in his underwear and everything.

688
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,396
- So you do forgive me?
- No, but it was kind of funny.

689
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,691
I'll never lie again. Honest.

690
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:01,863
So what are you doing here?

691
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:05,784
Mr. Lomax invited me and my friend Larry
for the weekend.

692
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:09,329
- Moving up in the company?
- Yeah.

693
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:14,084
I saw this great play. Yeah, it' s called...

694
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:16,419
You are on your own for a minute here.

695
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:19,339
Great writer.

696
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,676
Well, hello.

697
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,889
I'm Larry.

698
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,183
Fuck off, Larry.

699
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,103
Okay.

700
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,856
By the way, how's your aunt?

701
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:38,900
- Who?
- Your aunt?

702
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,404
- She passed away.
- I'm sorry.

703
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:43,738
It's all right.

704
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,991
Didn't you say you'd be spending
this weekend with your parents?

705
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:50,245
- Yes, I did. I am. They have a house here.
- Great.

706
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,500
There's Bernie. I wanted to thank him
for my summer job.

707
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,377
I'll be right back.

708
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:58,962
No!

709
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:01,047
What?

710
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,508
Nothing.

711
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,433
Go see Bernie about it. Go see Bernie.

712
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,812
- Gwen, darling, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

713
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:20,150
Have I ever told you
I never liked the name Gwen on you?

714
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:23,069
To me you'll always be Vanessa.

715
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,990
Her father and I,
we went to Harvard together.

716
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,035
You are probably right. Oh, Bernie.

717
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:32,328
Here we go, sugar, move it over!
Okay, baby?

718
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,538
Asshole!

719
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:37,250
- I don't understand why we've to move him.
- Don't ask. Just move him.

720
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,626
Here we go. Ready?

721
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:42,756
- I can't believe I'm touching a dead body.
- He was your boss. Come on, let's go.

722
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:48,636
- What a kidder.
- Bernie, you had a little too much.

723
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,431
Come on, you had too much again,
you big knucklehead.

724
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,266
Come on, let's go.

725
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,934
Come on. He is crazy.

726
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,895
Here we go. Walk it off, big guy.

727
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,396
Nice outfit.

728
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,567
Look even nicer
crumpled up on my floor in the morning.

729
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:07,197
Polyester doesn't crumple.

730
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:13,244
- Here we go. That's it, Bernie.
- Hi, Bernie.

731
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,331
- Just like last week, huh?
- Come on.

732
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,961
All right. Okay.

733
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:26,383
Look me in the eye. $50,000.

734
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:30,303
Yes! I knew it! Thank you, Bernie!

735
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,640
Thank you so much. This guy is like family.

736
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,183
You are beautiful!

737
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,395
Grab him. Larry.

738
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,774
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.

739
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:47,112
- Hi, boys. Great view.
- Hello, there. How are you?

740
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,075
I give it an 8.3.

741
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:56,329
We can't just leave him there, you know.

742
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:11,219
Girl. Beach. Sand. Surf. Moonlight.
Did you ever see {y:i}Here to Eternity?

743
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,308
You are right. We better get him.

744
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:21,396
- Thirty minutes. Then we call the cops.
- Not a second more.

745
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:24,482
Ladies, how are you?

746
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:36,911
Hi.

747
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:36,911
Hi.

748
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:48,882
Are we allowed to talk or anything?

749
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,513
Why did you leave the party?

750
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:59,017
I just don't feel comfortable
with most of those people.

751
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:04,064
I don't really know any of those people.
I just know, knew, know Bernie.

752
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,650
Besides, I figure
I can thank Bernie tomorrow.

753
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,527
When there's more privacy.

754
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,574
- Where are we going?
- There's a beautiful view from up there.

755
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:16,743
Great.

756
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,504
Ever been in a lighthouse before?

757
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:30,548
No, this is my first time. This is great.

758
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:35,345
Does anybody live up there?
A lighthouse keeper or someone?

759
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:38,098
No, It's all automated now. Come on.

760
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:44,187
That takes some of the romance out of it.

761
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:46,981
Does it?

762
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:09,337
- You all right?
- Yeah.

763
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,884
You're right. This is beautiful.

764
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,723
My God.
You can see the whole island from up here.

765
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,354
I've always wondered
how these things work.

766
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,856
Richard, don't.

767
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,109
- I can't see.
- Watch out for the trap...

768
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,070
door.

769
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,119
Oh, my God.

770
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:51,171
- That one works.
- Richard.

771
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,132
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

772
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:56,426
- Are you sure?
- I fell down a couple of stairs.

773
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,428
- Anything broken?
- Nothing's broken.

774
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:01,431
- Are you sure?
- A little pain, but I'm all right.

775
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:03,683
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

776
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,643
Here. Hold on.

777
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:07,937
The good news is, I can see again.

778
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:14,694
- I'm so sorry, Richard.
- No, it's okay, really.

779
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,738
I've always wanted a limp.

780
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:19,532
I must thank you.
This has been a great date.

781
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,826
I hope my major medical covers it.

782
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,411
What?

783
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:28,124
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh...

784
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:32,420
but the look on your face
when you fell through the trapdoor.

785
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,714
I think I've got a cracked rib.

786
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,717
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

787
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:41,805
No, I better not. The way things are going,
I'm gonna break my ass.

788
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,890
You'll be okay.

789
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:16,339
I've had a crush on you
since the first day I saw you at work.

790
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,924
I'm crazy about you.

791
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,013
This is so right.

792
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:28,476
Oh, my God. This can't be happening to me.

793
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,480
It's happening to both of us.
You're right. It's so right.

794
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:35,358
No. This isn't right, it's all wrong.
Not here in the sand.

795
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:36,943
- What?
- You deserve more than this.

796
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,863
You need music, flowers, candles.
You need...

797
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,616
You need to get out of here.

798
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,786
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious. You could catch a cold.

799
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:48,913
- Where do you live?
- Dune Walk.

800
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:09,392
Are you dead, too?

801
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:12,437
Mister? Hello?

802
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,398
Oh, Jesus. What is it with this place?

803
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:20,653
How are you? Party's over.
You have to go home now.

804
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:22,530
- Where's Bernie?
- He's swimming.

805
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:25,450
I had a wonderful time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so early.

806
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:28,161
Have fun. See you at the next one. Larry!

807
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,256
Larry, are you in there?

808
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:43,385
- Come on out, Lar. Right now.
- Go away.

809
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:45,095
I need to talk to you.

810
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:47,681
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

811
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,059
Bernie is waiting for us.

812
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:56,856
- Look, Bernie isn't going anywhere, okay?
- I need you, Lar.

813
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:08,827
Bernie, he needs you, too.

814
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:09,994
Unbelievable.

815
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:25,010
How am I supposed to know
that the tide is gonna come up that high?

816
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,095
I don't want to talk about it.

817
00:56:27,178 --> 00:56:29,806
I don't understand why this is becoming
all my fault.

818
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:33,727
- Did you invite somebody over?
- Of course not.

819
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:34,936
Somebody's here.

820
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,897
Let's just shove him in the bedroom,
we'll say he's sleeping.

821
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:41,109
Bernie, you cheat.

822
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:42,736
Two-timer.

823
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:51,953
Bernie, open up.

824
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:56,791
Darn you, Bernie.

825
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,127
Don't do this to me.

826
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:03,965
Where the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

827
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,885
I got you now, you two-timing bastard.

828
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:12,557
Who the hell are you? Where's Bernie?

829
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,226
We're Bernie's houseguests. Who are you?

830
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,728
I'm his woman.

831
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,399
And I'll kill him if he's cheating on me.
Now, where the hell is he?

832
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,069
And don't try to cover up for him, either.

833
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:27,072
- He's not here.
- Haven't seen him.

834
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:28,782
I don't believe you.

835
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,327
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

836
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,461
- That's his woman?
- I guess so.

837
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:54,849
Where the hell is he?

838
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:57,727
- He's in the bedroom.
- Is that so?

839
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,855
He better be alone.

840
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,609
God damn it.

841
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,277
Fun while it lasted, huh?

842
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,656
What difference does it make,
we might as well get this over with.

843
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:13,034
This is good. She discovers the body,
she calls the police.

844
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:15,161
Fix me a drink, will you?

845
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,789
I hate it when they scream.

846
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:45,233
Oh, no!

847
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:00,540
What gives? She has been up there, what,
10, 15 minutes?

848
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:02,584
I don't get it.

849
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,326
Got a little scotch?

850
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:39,579
Sure.

851
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:56,304
- Did everything go okay up there?
- Never been better.

852
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:02,852
Good.

853
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:17,909
How do you like that?
The guy gets laid more dead than I do alive.

854
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:20,662
No, she couldn't have.

855
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,581
He couldn't have.

856
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,668
I get yelled at when I just lay there.

857
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:56,906
Vito, I'm telling you, Lomax is alive.
She was with him for at least half an hour...

858
01:00:57,323 --> 01:01:00,827
- in the bedroom.
{y:i}- What were they doing in the bedroom?

859
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,954
I'd rather not say.

860
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,206
{y:i}What the hell happened to Paulie?

861
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:08,877
Yeah, maybe Paulie
is rustier than we thought, huh?

862
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:15,383
- What a night.
- Great, isn't it? It isn't over yet.

863
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,845
It is for me. I'm dead. No offense, Bernie.

864
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,598
I just gotta lie down for a minute.

865
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:25,643
Suit yourself. Whatever you like.
I'm going on to find the next party.

866
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:29,522
- Just wake me up when you get back.
- Okay, sure.

867
01:01:29,564 --> 01:01:32,108
- Whatever you like.
- Because I got to call the cops.

868
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,445
- Of course you do. In the morning.
- I need a clear head.

869
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,364
Good night, buddy.

870
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,825
Don't forget. Wake me up.

871
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:50,377
I made these a little sweeter this time.
Okay, Bernie?

872
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:53,171
God, it's glorious out, huh?

873
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,466
Here we go, my friend.

874
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,302
This should do it.

875
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,555
Okay.

876
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,849
How did you deal with?

877
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:09,104
Oriental? I think I own that one.

878
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,356
With hotel.

879
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,526
$550.

880
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,820
Give me $600, we'll call it square.

881
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:18,655
Hey, Bernie, Larry.

882
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,449
Great party last night, Bernie.
Your best ever.

883
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:23,993
Ladies. Hello. How are you today?

884
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:25,161
- Great.
- Fine.

885
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:28,790
- Are we doing it again today?
- Absolutely. You know we are.

886
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,126
- Great. We'll see you later, guys.
- Bye-bye.

887
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:33,586
Bye-bye, ladies. We'll see you later.

888
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,505
Is this great or what?

889
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,925
Okay, coming out. My turn.

890
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:40,510
Shooter now.

891
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,139
Yes! Free parking. $500 for me.

892
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,146
Bastard!

893
01:02:57,068 --> 01:03:00,697
I own it. Okay, that is $24...

894
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,950
I own them all. $46, my friend. Call it $50.

895
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,953
Thank you. My turn. Here we go.

896
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:08,705
Lucky seven coming out.

897
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:09,956
Shit.

898
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:15,211
One more you get out of jail free.
All right. Fine. Your turn. I'll roll.

899
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,005
Here we go. Coming out.

900
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,508
Community Chest.

901
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,387
Second prize in a beauty contest.

902
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,974
- What are you doing?
- Playing Monopoly. You want to play?

903
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,185
- No.
- Here we go.

904
01:03:30,977 --> 01:03:33,063
- How did he get down here?
- He walked.

905
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,564
- He walked?
- Say good morning.

906
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:38,443
Oh, God. You're just a sick man, Larry.

907
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,364
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30.

908
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,240
11:30?

909
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:47,744
You let me sleep till 11:30? I have...

910
01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:51,664
- When did you get a Rolex?
- Oh, this.

911
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:57,504
- Good God!
- He didn't need it anymore.

912
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:01,049
That's it. We're gonna go to jail.
They're gonna arrest us.

913
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:04,928
- I'm calling the cops.
- I wanted to call them yesterday, my friend.

914
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,139
He's very upset. Richard, look.

915
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:12,602
Let me just say one thing here.
There's no reason to get pissy about this.

916
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:16,731
Hello.

917
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:20,819
- Richard?
- It's for you.

918
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,738
- Gwen.
- Hi.

919
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,741
What are you doing here?

920
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:29,953
I just came by to talk to Bernie.
I didn't get a chance to last night, so...

921
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,040
Oh, no. Bernie and I
are in a very big business meeting.

922
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:35,375
- Now?
- Yes.

923
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,545
Bernie has such little time,
so can you come back later?

924
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:41,464
Wait a minute.
What happened to Mr. Romantic?

925
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:45,677
- Candlelight? Flowers?
- I know. But Bernie is tied up right now.

926
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:50,849
- It's a bad time.
- What is going on, Richard?

927
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:53,393
Okay. I'll tell you.

928
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:56,146
I probably shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but...

929
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:59,315
at this point, why not? Mr. Lomax is...

930
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:11,411
my boss. I work for him
at the insurance company.

931
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:16,791
Bernie, you're starting to peel.

932
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,294
Better get you out of the sun, huh?

933
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:22,839
Here we go.

934
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:29,846
We were really looking forward
to coming out here...

935
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,931
when we got here, Mr. Lomax...

936
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,017
Bernie was...

937
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:37,312
dead.

938
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:40,940
Dead.

939
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:44,444
Like your mother and father were dead.
And your aunt is dead, too?

940
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:45,570
Different kind of dead.

941
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,920
You son of a bitch. I got you.

942
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:10,929
Then how come I saw Bernie
with you and your friend at the party?

943
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:14,015
Because...

944
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,103
You don't believe me?

945
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:22,607
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on.

946
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,275
This is not going to be fun.

947
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:37,163
I know you think I'm crazy, but...

948
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:43,169
Well?

949
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:46,214
Where is Bernie?

950
01:06:46,756 --> 01:06:48,049
Oh, hello.

951
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,428
- Where's Bernie?
- He went for more daiquiri mix.

952
01:06:51,511 --> 01:06:52,846
No, he didn't.

953
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:55,849
Richard, I don't know what
this game is you're playing...

954
01:06:55,932 --> 01:06:57,726
but this is ridiculous.

955
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,687
- I'm out of here.
- Gwen, I'm not playing any games with you.

956
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:03,356
I'm telling you the truth! Bernie is here.

957
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,651
Where is Bernie?

958
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,529
What, you bastard, did you do with Bernie?

959
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:16,119
I'm phoning the police.

960
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,628
There's no dial tone. With 97 buttons...

961
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:30,717
{y:i}- Where is your house?
- Where is the off button?

962
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,887
{y:i}Look, Paulie, just don't kill them
{y:i}while I'm around.

963
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:37,223
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on a phone here.
{y:i}- You're right.

964
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:39,893
- Play that back.
- I just got it stopped.

965
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:41,644
Play it back, please.

966
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:46,066
{y:i}Hey, Lomax, it's Paulie.
{y:i}I just got to the island.

967
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:47,650
{y:i}You're early.

968
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:50,236
{y:i}Those two schmucks
{y:i}won't come until the 6:00 ferry...

969
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:53,114
{y:i}- and I still have to plant the note.
{y:i}- Yeah.

970
01:07:53,573 --> 01:07:56,910
{y:i}- Where is your house?
{y:i}- It's on the point, top of the dune.

971
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,120
{y:i}Look, Paulie...

972
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:03,124
{y:i}- don't kill them while I'm around.
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on the phone here.

973
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,210
{y:i}You're right. I'm sorry.

974
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:08,463
{y:i}The point is, I just want to be
{y:i}back in New York with an alibi.

975
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:10,090
{y:i}Don't worry about it.

976
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:16,596
We were on the 6:00 ferry.

977
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:20,225
And we're two schmucks.

978
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:25,563
- Kill us?
- Lomax?

979
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,900
Bernie is gonna have us killed?

980
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:30,652
Kill us?

981
01:08:32,028 --> 01:08:33,571
- Why?
- I don't know.

982
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:40,370
Unless he's the one
whose been stealing from the company.

983
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,998
Son of a bitch. He's gonna kill me!

984
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,418
I liked the guy.

985
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:48,545
Okay.

986
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:51,256
He said something about a note, right?

987
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:53,925
- I know, Richard.
- Let's find it.

988
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,738
Bernie, you lying swine.

989
01:09:21,786 --> 01:09:23,538
Holy crap!

990
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:25,206
What?

991
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,636
- There's a $100,000 here easy.
- This is the note. Listen.

992
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,390
"Richard Parker and I
stole this money from the company...

993
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,435
- "to pay for my sex change operation."
- What?

994
01:09:45,518 --> 01:09:47,270
That's what it says.

995
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:52,484
"Now he tells me he loves someone else.
I can't live with that, and neither will he."

996
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,694
It's got my name on it.

997
01:09:56,237 --> 01:09:57,781
Oh, God.

998
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:02,911
Son of a bitch. It's not bad enough
that he's trying to kill me...

999
01:10:02,994 --> 01:10:05,455
now he's turning me into a drag queen.

1000
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:09,125
Why couldn't he say
you were having the operation?

1001
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:11,711
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Richard.

1002
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:15,256
- I've a reputation to protect here.
- For Christ's sakes, Larry!

1003
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,551
No one is going
to have a sex change operation.

1004
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:22,389
Oh, yeah!

1005
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,140
I got to call the cops.

1006
01:10:26,059 --> 01:10:28,853
{y:i}- Operator.
- Operator, the police, please.

1007
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,565
{y:i}You mean Ed?
{y:i}He's out on the beach somewhere.

1008
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:36,194
When do you expect Ed back?
It's a bit of an emergency.

1009
01:10:36,277 --> 01:10:39,280
{y:i}I don't know. Wanna leave a message?

1010
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:40,865
- Yeah. Help!
{y:i}- Okay.

1011
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:42,867
Let's get out of here.

1012
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,788
We have to get off this island,
and maybe not get killed doing it.

1013
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:50,792
- Wait a minute.
- Tell me you have a brilliant idea.

1014
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:53,294
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1015
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:57,590
Lomax told whoever he was talking to
not to kill us if he's around, right?

1016
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:00,552
But Lomax is dead.
He isn't around anybody anymore.

1017
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:02,887
I know that. You know that.

1018
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,932
Nobody else knows that.

1019
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:07,892
Where's Bernie?

1020
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:11,563
Right there.

1021
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,982
There's no Bernie.

1022
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:17,444
He's gotta to be, Rich.
I dumped him here myself.

1023
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:18,737
Where is he?

1024
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,698
- Larry.
- What?

1025
01:11:23,908 --> 01:11:25,660
- Excuse me.
- Hey, kid.

1026
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:27,620
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

1027
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,414
- You little brat!
- What are you doing?

1028
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:31,207
Get out of there.

1029
01:11:31,249 --> 01:11:33,793
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't do that.

1030
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:35,670
This is private property.

1031
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,465
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

1032
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:40,925
- Shut up.
- Who are you... You lousy...

1033
01:11:42,677 --> 01:11:45,388
You better be gone by the time we get there.

1034
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:48,641
- Scram! Get out of here!
- You little bastard.

1035
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:51,311
How'd you like to kiss this?

1036
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,521
- We have bigger problems.
- Kiss my ass.

1037
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:57,067
- What kind of home training is that?
- He buried all of Bernie.

1038
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,234
Jesus.

1039
01:11:58,651 --> 01:11:59,652
Come on.

1040
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:24,552
- Good thing for you, you're dead, pal.
- I actually felt sorry for you, you rat shit.

1041
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:26,680
He looks good enough. Let's go.

1042
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:28,932
- Larry.
- What?

1043
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:31,643
Jesus.

1044
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,854
I never knew he wore a toupee.
You can hardly tell.

1045
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:38,566
Who cares? What are we gonna do about it?
We can't take him out like this.

1046
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:41,611
The killer might not know it's Bernie
and shoot us.

1047
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:49,494
- So long, Lar, it has been fun but not really.
- Goodbye, Rich.

1048
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,504
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1049
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:01,923
Jesus.

1050
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:04,718
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1051
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:13,309
You little bastard.

1052
01:13:15,228 --> 01:13:17,897
- Get back here, you little monster.
- Never mind him.

1053
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:19,816
I'm gonna rip your gums out!

1054
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:23,737
- I'm gonna get that little kid.
- What are we gonna do with Bernie?

1055
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,488
Oh, boy.

1056
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:29,200
Come on, Bernie. Up.

1057
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,372
Put it on him.

1058
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:37,208
Brilliant.

1059
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:43,631
- Sambuca on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

1060
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:56,061
Here we go. Ready. Up.

1061
01:13:58,396 --> 01:14:00,774
You take him down. I'll get the cart.

1062
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:18,208
Hey, Bernie!

1063
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:22,003
Bernie, wait a minute.

1064
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,714
- That guy talking to us?
- Who cares? Get out of here.

1065
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:26,883
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1066
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,302
Bernie, come on.

1067
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,141
- Hey, Bernie. Looking good.
- Hi.

1068
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,477
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hello.

1069
01:14:38,978 --> 01:14:41,606
- Great party last night, Bern.
- How are you?

1070
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:45,235
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1071
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:46,986
Jesus. He's behind us.

1072
01:14:48,279 --> 01:14:50,323
Shit! Is that the killer?

1073
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,742
How do I know, Richard?
Should I stop and ask him?

1074
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:54,452
No. Just drive. Just go.

1075
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:56,496
Bernie, I gotta talk to you.

1076
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:59,833
- Doesn't this thing go any faster?
- This is it.

1077
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,668
We gotta talk.

1078
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:06,589
What about our arrangement?

1079
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:08,758
Come on, Larry. Move it.

1080
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:21,021
Hey, Bernie. The Maserati.
I painted it black for you.

1081
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,481
The Maserati!

1082
01:15:28,236 --> 01:15:29,654
Ferry's gonna leave.

1083
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:32,741
Hold it. Wait. Stop this for a second.

1084
01:15:34,784 --> 01:15:36,161
Let's go.

1085
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:40,206
Rich, grab him. Grab a leg.

1086
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,250
Wait.

1087
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:45,795
We can't just drag him in.
He's got to look like he's alive.

1088
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:48,381
Idea.

1089
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:01,770
Your right leg on three, ready?
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1090
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:03,063
Hold the boat!

1091
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:04,814
Got it? Hold the boat.

1092
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:07,108
Hold that boat.

1093
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:10,987
Hold it.

1094
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:12,530
- Hi, Bern.
- How are you doing?

1095
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,616
Hold the boat!

1096
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,286
Hold the boat, please.

1097
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:20,372
Hold on. We'll be right there.

1098
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:23,833
We're coming.

1099
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:29,005
Come on, Bern.

1100
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,469
Hold it. Hold the boat.

1101
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,847
Shit! What do we do?

1102
01:16:39,015 --> 01:16:40,308
Stop the boat.

1103
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:44,979
Look at this fool.
He wants to get off, we want to get on.

1104
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:46,981
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What?

1105
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:49,943
You don't have to worry about
anybody else murdering you...

1106
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:52,112
because I'll do it. This was all your fault.

1107
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,823
- We'll die on this crummy island.
- Let me remind you...

1108
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:57,492
you're the one who did the extra work
on the computer.

1109
01:16:57,575 --> 01:16:59,911
If it wasn't for me
you'd be fired six months ago.

1110
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:01,746
You can't even work the coffee machine.

1111
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:05,583
A little brownnosing, ass kissing,
to work our way up that corporate ladder.

1112
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,211
Why can't you be a lazy shit like I am?

1113
01:17:09,337 --> 01:17:12,132
Somebody talk to the captain.

1114
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:14,342
I've got to get off the boat.

1115
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,094
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:17,512
Please.

1117
01:17:20,348 --> 01:17:22,350
Somebody talk to the captain.

1118
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:27,522
- I'm sorry, but we're still gonna die.
- Not if Bernie's with us.

1119
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:29,774
Great, I hope the killer keeps that in mind.

1120
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:33,361
Larry, please tell me
how we're going to get off this island.

1121
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:35,071
- We got a boat.
- What boat?

1122
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:36,573
Lomax's boat.

1123
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:39,409
- Tawny brought the keys back, remember?
- Right. Okay.

1124
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:41,745
You go and get them,
I'll stay here with Bernie.

1125
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,538
I'm not going anywhere without Bernie.

1126
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:46,082
You go back, get the keys.
I'll stay with Bernie.

1127
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:49,419
We'll all go back to the house.
We'll all get the goddamn keys.

1128
01:17:49,502 --> 01:17:51,713
- We'll all stay with Bernie.
- Fine.

1129
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,132
Hurry up.

1130
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,801
Move it.

1131
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:00,472
Hold up.

1132
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:02,515
Okay. The keys.

1133
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:05,352
- Here they are.
- Got it. Let's go.

1134
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,978
Oh, my God, Richard!

1135
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,565
It's the killer.

1136
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:14,069
Get the door.

1137
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:17,072
Quiet.

1138
01:18:18,531 --> 01:18:20,367
- Lock it.
- I can't lock it.

1139
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:22,369
I only have a key to the boat.

1140
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:24,662
Kitchen.

1141
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:28,083
- There's no door. Back door.
- Okay.

1142
01:18:29,876 --> 01:18:31,711
Don't panic.

1143
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:35,465
Do something, Rich.

1144
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:37,759
I got Bernie, you get the guy.

1145
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:41,012
Do something, Rich.

1146
01:18:41,888 --> 01:18:43,181
Get him, Rich.

1147
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:50,814
You in here, Lomax? You little bastard.

1148
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:52,774
You jerk.

1149
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,235
Kick me in the ass.

1150
01:18:56,611 --> 01:18:58,196
It's my turn now.

1151
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:03,410
Got him, Lar.

1152
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,168
There's another one.

1153
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:21,052
He's got a knife.

1154
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:25,015
Mr. Lomax.

1155
01:19:26,099 --> 01:19:27,392
What the hell?

1156
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:36,651
- You can come out now, Rambo.
- You sure, Rich?

1157
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:39,654
Good job.

1158
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:45,076
- Two killers.
- Anybody could be the killer.

1159
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,289
- Jesus, we gotta get rid of them.
- Let's shove them in the kitchen pantry.

1160
01:19:55,837 --> 01:19:58,673
I don't know why
I have to carry the heavy guy.

1161
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:02,886
Get his legs.

1162
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:05,805
Larry, let me out.

1163
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:13,271
Here comes Bernie.

1164
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:16,483
Coming through!

1165
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:19,819
There it is. Stop.

1166
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:23,114
Hi, guys.

1167
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:28,995
Ready? On three, here we go.
One, two, three.

1168
01:20:31,414 --> 01:20:32,707
Let's go.

1169
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:39,547
Okay. Untie us.

1170
01:20:42,425 --> 01:20:43,468
Okay?

1171
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:47,555
- Give me the keys.
- Have you ever driven a boat before?

1172
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,432
I was born on a boat.

1173
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,400
This is a fancy boat.

1174
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:05,031
- Push something.
- I am, Richard.

1175
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:06,491
- Nothing's happening.
- I know.

1176
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:08,785
- Push something else.
- Something's happening.

1177
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:11,454
Something's definitely
happening here, huh?

1178
01:21:12,914 --> 01:21:14,958
Wait a minute, hold on.

1179
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:17,168
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

1180
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:20,046
- I know it's here.
- Just keep pressing those buttons.

1181
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,924
I'm pressing. I pressed that button.

1182
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,260
- Nothing is happening, Larry.
- I know that.

1183
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,846
- Did you try the key?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1184
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,389
- Try the key again.
- Fine.

1185
01:21:29,472 --> 01:21:30,932
See that?

1186
01:21:31,057 --> 01:21:33,560
- Here we go!
- We're going home. Give it some gas now.

1187
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:34,894
Giving it gas.

1188
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:38,732
Gas.

1189
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:41,234
- Nothing's happening.
- More gas.

1190
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:42,736
A little more gas.

1191
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:44,738
We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?

1192
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,156
I don't know.

1193
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:51,077
- Larry, you said you've done this before.
- It's different than my boat, okay?

1194
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:52,746
Don't panic.

1195
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:54,581
Stop the boat, Larry.

1196
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,083
Stop!

1197
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:03,131
Back it up.

1198
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,509
We got it.

1199
01:22:06,593 --> 01:22:08,470
- What's going on?
- That's illegal.

1200
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:11,806
- What you're doing is illegal.
- You have a nice day now.

1201
01:22:12,098 --> 01:22:13,391
Are you nuts?

1202
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:19,564
- Got it now. Moving forward. Hold on.
- Oh, shit!

1203
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:27,822
Sorry, Rich. Coming back.

1204
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:31,076
Coming around.

1205
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:35,538
Why is this happening to me?

1206
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:36,831
Coming back.

1207
01:22:41,836 --> 01:22:44,756
- Here we are.
- Stop the boat. Idiot.

1208
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:46,716
Stop the boat!

1209
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:52,222
- Where are the brakes?
- Boats don't have brakes, Captain.

1210
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:55,058
You're kidding. How do they stop?

1211
01:22:55,141 --> 01:22:56,601
Throw the anchor.

1212
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,811
The anchor, throw it.

1213
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:00,063
- They're headed for us.
- Here we go.

1214
01:23:00,146 --> 01:23:02,107
Whatever you're doing, don't.

1215
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,984
Sorry.

1216
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,199
You broke my watch.

1217
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:12,992
Mine still works.

1218
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:15,370
You better put that thing
back on the dead body.

1219
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:17,205
Drive the boat, Richard.

1220
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:20,417
The cops are gonna take
our fat heads to jail.

1221
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,837
My God. Look at them.

1222
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:25,630
Ladies, how are you?

1223
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:28,591
Hello, Betty.

1224
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:31,803
God! Just once, I'd like a woman like that.

1225
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:33,263
Let's party.

1226
01:23:39,477 --> 01:23:41,312
Turn the boat.

1227
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,818
Watch the fishermen.

1228
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:56,578
- Watch the wake!
- Duck!

1229
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:58,413
Watch the wake, Richard!

1230
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,467
This is tougher than it looks.

1231
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:12,594
You're doing very well, Richard.

1232
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:14,888
- Sorry I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

1233
01:24:14,971 --> 01:24:17,390
I've never been chased by a killer before.

1234
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:19,893
It's all right. You're doing very well.

1235
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,981
- Why is everybody waving at us?
- I'm popular.

1236
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:26,107
I see.

1237
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:28,234
Hey, Bernie, showing off again?

1238
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,115
Oh, God. What the hell are those things?

1239
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:37,869
Those are obviously channel markers.

1240
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,412
Obviously.

1241
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:42,540
Okay, wise ass, do you know
what side I'm supposed to pass on?

1242
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,627
That I don't know. Just stay close.
What else can happen here?

1243
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:47,087
I've got no idea.

1244
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:50,298
- Serpentine.
- Is that close enough?

1245
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,718
Do you hear something?

1246
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,389
- There it's again.
- Yeah.

1247
01:24:57,847 --> 01:25:00,225
- I wonder what that is.
- What is that?

1248
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:08,024
- Man overboard.
- What?

1249
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,442
Stop the boat.

1250
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:14,280
He's got nice form.

1251
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:21,079
- I don't know.
- I'm trying to drive a boat.

1252
01:25:21,162 --> 01:25:24,124
- You're doing well.
- Trying to get us off this island of hell.

1253
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:26,334
You had maybe one job to do.
Watch a dead body.

1254
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:29,004
- Well, let's not argue about it.
- Jesus.

1255
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:33,299
- You were the one who tied him up.
- Don't blame this all on me.

1256
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:35,510
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1257
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:37,762
You've lost my sunglasses.

1258
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:56,114
What are you doing?

1259
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:59,200
I haven't got a clue.

1260
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:02,537
I don't believe this.

1261
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:04,289
What?

1262
01:26:06,374 --> 01:26:07,751
We're out of gas.

1263
01:26:10,837 --> 01:26:13,423
Paddling in the Atlantic Ocean...

1264
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:16,426
- on a dead body.
- I'm getting swimmer's ear.

1265
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:18,720
This is now the perfect weekend.

1266
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:23,391
It started when I almost broke my leg
jumping on a moving ferry.

1267
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:27,771
I get to this beautiful beach and my host...
Sorry, he's dead.

1268
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:31,316
Hampton Island.

1269
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,779
Checkers. Excuse me, sir.
Is this your launch?

1270
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:38,198
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't rush.

1271
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:42,994
Come on.

1272
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:46,331
- Can you put a little snap in it, fellows?
- Okay, Cappy.

1273
01:26:52,128 --> 01:26:53,963
Hold on, you damn fool.

1274
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:58,093
I fell down a lighthouse.
I had a corpse wash up...

1275
01:26:58,176 --> 01:26:59,552
next to me on the shore.

1276
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:04,099
And then I find out that my dead boss
is not only a thief, he wants to kill me.

1277
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:11,731
I almost drown.

1278
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,943
The girl of my dreams
now thinks I'm a raving lunatic.

1279
01:27:15,026 --> 01:27:16,903
You mean what's-her-name?

1280
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:20,490
And, now, we're going back
to the house of death.

1281
01:27:20,573 --> 01:27:22,826
- Great weekend, huh?
- Great weekend!

1282
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:26,538
Just get here as fast as you can.
Thanks, Ed.

1283
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:27,872
Police is on the way.

1284
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:30,625
Can just lock ourselves in
until they get here?

1285
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:33,211
I hate it when he stares at me like that.

1286
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:34,671
Let's go.

1287
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:39,217
Put him in his bathroom.

1288
01:27:42,762 --> 01:27:45,515
- Bernie's picked up a little weight.
- What do you expect?

1289
01:27:45,598 --> 01:27:47,684
He's been soaking in the ocean
for two hours.

1290
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,185
Made a damn good float though.

1291
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:55,734
Are you in here?

1292
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:12,250
It's Gwen.

1293
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:15,128
Hi, Gwen.

1294
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,048
You've got to be the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

1295
01:28:18,673 --> 01:28:20,800
You told me Bernie was dead, right?

1296
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:22,802
I just saw you with him.

1297
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,013
What's your explanation this time?

1298
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:27,223
I don't mean to be rude,
but get the hell out of here.

1299
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:30,185
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what is going on.

1300
01:28:30,268 --> 01:28:31,311
Listen to me!

1301
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:34,814
You're in danger here,
leave unless you want to get shot.

1302
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:38,735
Lomax is dead,
somebody is trying to kill us.

1303
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:41,946
Can we stay at your house
until the cops come or what?

1304
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,034
It's just Bernie.

1305
01:28:49,913 --> 01:28:53,166
Gwen, listen to me.

1306
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:56,461
We didn't do this to him.
Do we look like we could kill someone?

1307
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:58,880
Honey, have a drink, relax. You'll be fine.

1308
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:01,800
Let me rephrase that.
Do I look like I could kill someone?

1309
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,677
What is going on in there?

1310
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,643
- Which one of you bastards hit me?
- Son of a bitch.

1311
01:29:13,353 --> 01:29:15,563
You want to get your butt kicked?

1312
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,195
I can explain.

1313
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:40,714
Company.

1314
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,220
I didn't see anything.
I was looking at my watch.

1315
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:49,097
I'm blind.

1316
01:29:57,605 --> 01:29:58,940
It's empty.

1317
01:30:00,066 --> 01:30:02,402
That's right. But this ain't.

1318
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:07,782
Run!

1319
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:09,200
Move it! This way!

1320
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:13,621
It's locked.

1321
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:16,207
What are you doing?
We're friends of Bernie's.

1322
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,043
I hate Bernie's friends.

1323
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:24,966
This way.

1324
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:27,510
To the bedroom.

1325
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:30,972
Come on, let's go. Up.

1326
01:30:31,222 --> 01:30:33,767
You're dead meat, you little bastards.

1327
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,357
Now I'm really mad!

1328
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:42,317
Wait.

1329
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,029
- What?
- You take Gwen, you go hide...

1330
01:30:46,112 --> 01:30:49,324
I'll let him chase me,
you try and call the cops, okay?

1331
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:51,993
Okay? That's it? No arguments?

1332
01:30:52,952 --> 01:30:55,330
I'll get you all, one by one.

1333
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,665
There's no place to hide.

1334
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:14,724
I'm gonna die.

1335
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:33,702
You kicked me, you bastard.

1336
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,872
Shit! Out of bullets.

1337
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:11,239
Sit the hell down.

1338
01:32:15,785 --> 01:32:17,162
Hang on, Lar.

1339
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:22,334
- Coming.
- I got him.

1340
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:27,922
Get off.

1341
01:32:28,548 --> 01:32:30,342
- Hang on, Lar.
- I got him.

1342
01:32:30,633 --> 01:32:34,471
Stand up. Fight like a man.
Come on. Put them up, you chicken.

1343
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:39,768
Watch this, Richard.

1344
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:49,486
All right, Lar.

1345
01:32:56,868 --> 01:32:58,703
Fists of steel.

1346
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:02,707
Bernie, let go of me.

1347
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:05,418
I always liked you, Bernie.

1348
01:33:10,048 --> 01:33:11,466
I got it, thanks.

1349
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:14,219
Just a little closer. Just get the two of us.

1350
01:33:14,302 --> 01:33:16,179
Get the handshake in, okay?

1351
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:20,433
Wait a minute. I think I blinked. Did I blink?
I think I blinked a second there.

1352
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:22,769
- He blinked.
- He blinked. I saw him.

1353
01:33:22,852 --> 01:33:24,479
Make sure he's wrapped up good.

1354
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:25,855
Wait a minute.

1355
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:30,944
I didn't kill him. He's not dead.

1356
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:33,363
I tried to kill him.

1357
01:33:34,864 --> 01:33:36,616
Look at him. He's alive.

1358
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:39,536
- He's not dead. He's alive.
- Move it.

1359
01:33:39,577 --> 01:33:41,621
That man is alive!

1360
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:43,957
Now what?

1361
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:46,960
Now I'm gonna take a week off.

1362
01:33:47,043 --> 01:33:50,130
You're taking a vacation?
The man who won't take a coffee break?

1363
01:33:50,213 --> 01:33:52,882
Gwen just invited me to stay with her.
What should I say?

1364
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:56,428
You're kidding me. You invited him?
You fool. That's fabulous.

1365
01:33:56,469 --> 01:33:58,722
You deserve it, Richard.
The company owes you.

1366
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:01,224
Just a couple of days
until Gwen leaves for school.

1367
01:34:01,307 --> 01:34:04,144
There's plenty of room
if you want to stay, Lar.

1368
01:34:05,562 --> 01:34:09,149
Me? Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just tough it out here at Bernie's.

1369
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:12,527
I hear the party Saturday night is
better than Friday, actually.

1370
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:19,367
What is going on?

1371
01:34:20,076 --> 01:34:23,371
- What's happened?
- Didn't you hear? Bernie Lomax got killed.

1372
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:24,831
- No.
- Yeah.

1373
01:34:24,914 --> 01:34:27,459
- Did you go to that party last night?
- No.

1374
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:30,211
Lawrence, you done real good.
I'm proud of you.

1375
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:33,631
Yeah, I did okay, huh? Surprised myself.

1376
01:34:34,758 --> 01:34:36,384
You did great, Rich.

1377
01:34:45,018 --> 01:34:48,104
Hi, Bernie. See you at the party tonight.

1378
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:49,939
What?

1379
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:54,152
What did she say?

1380
01:35:01,284 --> 01:35:03,536
Mister, can I bury you?

1381
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:06,706
Great!
