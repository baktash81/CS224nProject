1
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,686
Those cheers
still ring in my ears.

2
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,818
For years,
they remain in my thoughts.

3
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,251
Once, I took off my robe,
and I forgot to wear shorts.

4
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:03,587
I recall every fall,
hook, and jab -

5
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:06,633
bad way to get rid of flab.

6
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:11,269
As you know, my life
wasn't drab, though I'd much...

7
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:15,776
Though I'd rather hear you cheer

8
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,734
when I delve into Shakespeare.

9
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:23,073
My kingdom for a horse.
I haven't won in months.

10
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:30,592
Though I'm no Olivier,
I'd rather...

11
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,429
I'm no Olivier, but it ain't
the ring, it's the play.

12
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,772
Give me a stage where I'll rage.

13
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:45,525
Though I can fight,
I'd rather recite.

14
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,654
That's entertainment.

15
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:57,647
Jake La Motta, Jimmy Reeves.

16
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,942
La Motta's undefeated
but behind on points.

17
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,443
He's taking a lot of punishment.

18
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,091
Tell me why.
Why come here to get beat?

19
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:14,133
Do the right thing.

20
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,133
You're outpointed.
You'll have to knock him out.

21
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:23,690
- Bite him, kick him, anything.
- Listen to Joey.

22
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:28,322
Get all over him.
Just knock him out.

23
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,568
You wanna do it?

24
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,834
Help!

25
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:42,170
- A knockout's where it's at.
- Final round.

26
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,210
Good luck.

27
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:48,099
Reeves is up
against a fighter...

28
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,228
who doesn't back up.

29
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:55,192
La Motta continues to bore in,
and Reeves is down!

30
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,991
The crowd's urging Jake on.

31
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:04,332
Reeves is trying to get up.

32
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:08,418
La Motta comes at him
with a hard left,

33
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,424
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

34
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:17,059
La Motta is making a comeback
in the tenth round.

35
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:22,815
Reeves is up again.
La Motta's coming at him.

36
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:28,779
A left and right to the
midsection, a hook to the jaw.

37
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,119
A right and a left.
Reeves goes down again.

38
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,753
- They're pulling La Motta away.
- Two, three, four, five...

39
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:44,719
The referee is counting. Time is
running out. There's the bell.

40
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,194
Did La Motta do it soon enough?

41
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:57,200
Jack, come here! It's no good!
You waited too long!

42
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,992
Put my robe on right.

43
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,496
Ladies and gentlemen...

44
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:10,466
Under the rules
of the Ohio Boxing Commission,

45
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:16,894
after ten rounds, the winner
by unanimous decision...

46
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,360
Jimmy Reeves.

47
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,196
La Motta has lost
his first fight.

48
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:33,039
That's Jake's fight!
Jake won that fight!

49
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:37,676
Don't leave the ring. You won.
Let him go first.

50
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,472
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times, but still...

51
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,213
He's dead. They say he won.

52
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:40,379
Tommy should have been there.

53
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:45,765
He's got to fight with Tommy
or he'll wind up punch-drunk.

54
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:50,068
- I know.
- It's best for everybody.

55
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:55,398
- I said I know.
- You got to make him know.

56
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,995
When will you stop
with all that stuff?

57
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:03,082
I understand. He wants
to do things for himself.

58
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,625
- Hard to understand?
- He's got a concrete head.

59
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,220
You think it's easy?
You talk to him.

60
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,968
- I can't.
- Why not?

61
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,634
- He don't like me.
- Nobody does.

62
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:20,110
I know... I know who's the boss.

63
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:28,411
The judges didn't know.
The people knew.

64
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:33,787
You don't believe me.
Thought I was foolin' around.

65
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:38,512
Tell me the truth.
I ain't foolin' around.

66
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,517
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

67
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:45,603
With that championship belt
around me, I'll fool around.

68
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:51,607
- Is it done?
- No, it's not done.

69
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,193
Don't overcook it.

70
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,623
It defeats the purpose.

71
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,679
What are you doing? You're
overcooking it. Bring it over.

72
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:11,144
- You want it?
- Bring it over. Bring it over!

73
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,517
It's like a piece of charcoal!

74
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,232
- You want it?
- Yeah, right now!

75
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:21,238
Good. There it is.
Can't wait for it?

76
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:25,374
- No, I can't.
- Good. Happy?

77
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,785
- That's all.
- No, more. There.

78
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:32,542
You botherin' me about a steak?

79
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:37,558
I agree. He should be
with Tommy. I'll tell him.

80
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:42,853
Tommy keeps telling me to work
this out. I'm in the middle.

81
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:48,188
- You are? I'm his brother.
- Who better to talk to him?

82
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:53,458
- I will.
- Do what you can.

83
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,244
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Where will you be?

84
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,747
- The gym.
- Catch you there.

85
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,880
All right.
Sal... go fuck yourself.

86
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,477
- Complain some more.
- Complain?

87
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:11,063
- I want to hear.
- You call those carrots?

88
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,197
- You eat 'em?
- I got no choice!

89
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,495
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

90
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,626
You got no choice?
Stay away! Please!

91
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,042
- Get in there!
- I'm sick of you!

92
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,091
- What's the matter up there?
- What?

93
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:37,688
- What's going on, you animals?
- He's callin' me an animal.

94
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,896
- Hey, you!
- Come on.

95
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:44,031
I'm gonna eat your dog
for lunch!

96
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:48,411
- You hear me, Larry?
- Crazy animals!

97
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:53,374
Your mother's an animal,
you son of a bitch!

98
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:56,998
Your dog will be dead
tomorrow, you bum!

99
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:01,721
The whole block could hear you.
Sit down. Relax.

100
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:06,555
You break anything,
I'll come in there and kill you!

101
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,559
Sure!

102
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,145
Calmed down?

103
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:21,241
What did I do? Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

104
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:24,754
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

105
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:30,717
You can't eat and drink
like an animal...

106
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:35,353
and put up with this all day,
I'm telling you.

107
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,941
Forget about Reeves.
You've got other fights.

108
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,236
You can't keep doing this.

109
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,280
What's wrong?

110
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,456
Something's the matter.
What's wrong?

111
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:58,717
What's botherin' me?

112
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:05,314
- My hands.
- Your hands? What about 'em?

113
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:11,072
I got these small,
little girl's hands.

114
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,117
Me too. Who cares?

115
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,284
Know what that means?

116
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:21,421
No matter how big I get,
who I fight, or what I do,

117
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,296
I'll never fight Joe Louis.

118
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:27,057
He's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

119
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,929
I'll never fight
the best there is.

120
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:35,068
I'm better than them,
and I'll never fight them.

121
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,776
That's what's wrong.

122
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:44,489
Don't think about that.

123
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,205
He's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

124
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:52,042
It'll never happen, so why
go crazy thinking about it?

125
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:59,436
- Do me a favour.
- What?

126
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:02,726
- Hit me in the face.
- What?

127
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:06,983
- Hit me in the face.
- Forget about it.

128
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:12,201
- I want you to. Go ahead.
- I said forget about it.

129
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,743
We have fights
all the time. Go ahead.

130
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,581
- No!
- You afraid?

131
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,343
- Of what?
- Come on, hit me.

132
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:25,216
- I'm no fag.
- Take your best shot.

133
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:30,685
- You're a real jerk.
- Did I not tell you to do it?

134
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,021
Do it.

135
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:37,690
- I ain't hittin' you.
- I'm your older brother.

136
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,529
I ain't doin' it!

137
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:45,540
I ain't doin' it...
you fuckin' nut.

138
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,170
I'm not doin' it.

139
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:55,809
- I don't have any gloves.
- Use that over there.

140
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,434
- What?
- Use that.

141
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:03,610
How many times
I got to tell you?

142
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:06,404
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

143
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,615
Hit me with everything you got.

144
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,451
You sure? All right.

145
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,247
- Harder!
- Yeah?

146
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,634
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass. Harder.

147
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:23,140
- That's hard!
- Take it off.

148
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:27,392
- You wanna stop? That's enough.
- Come on!

149
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:30,105
- Come on!
- Don't fuck around!

150
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,866
- Throw it again.
- That's enough!

151
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,073
- I said that's enough!
- Harder!

152
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:40,240
Your cuts are open.
What are you trying to prove?

153
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,672
Joey, what's what?
Jake, you're looking good.

154
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:13,936
How you doin'?

155
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,058
I'm still here.

156
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:20,648
Joey... come here.

157
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:29,247
- He looks mad.
- Spoke to him yesterday.

158
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,706
You told them to come here?
Answer me!

159
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,426
Yeah, why not?

160
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:39,798
- I'll break his fuckin' head.
- Take it easy.

161
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:43,013
Don't ever bring them
up here again.

162
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,319
- Fuck!
- They look like two fags.

163
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:06,379
Call you tomorrow, Joey.

164
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,806
- Jake, don't hurt yourself.
- Fuck you.

165
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:19,281
How's your wife? Anybody
bothers you, let me know.

166
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,823
Yeah. Wave.
They're your friends.

167
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,821
What's wrong with you?

168
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,700
They came because
Tommy wants to help us.

169
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:30,002
What's the matter with you?

170
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:35,256
Will they help
by taking my money?

171
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:40,724
Is that what this is about?
I'm breakin' my ass, not them.

172
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:44,065
Never bring them
here again, you jerk.

173
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:49,149
I'm a jerk? You're a fuckin'
asshole. Don't hit me!

174
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:53,029
Here, you fucker, take this.
Maybe you can't.

175
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,942
Give me a Coke.

176
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,240
You goin' to the dance?

177
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:37,429
- Who's that girl?
- The blonde? Vickie.

178
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:46,065
- Where's she from?
- She's a neighbourhood girl.

179
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:51,402
- What's her last name?
- Vickie. That's all I know.

180
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:53,456
Call her Vickie.

181
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:58,539
- She knows them?
- They know her.

182
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,680
She comes here every day.
Everybody knows each other.

183
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:06,266
- She go with them?
- She's 15 years old.

184
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,142
Where's she gonna go,
the Copacabana?

185
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:14,646
Heard he went
with a beautiful blonde.

186
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,951
That's not her?

187
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:21,535
I doubt it. Why?

188
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:25,756
She ain't the kind
you fuck and forget about.

189
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,296
Why are you always cursing?
Don't do it around me.

190
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,970
Don't do it.

191
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,190
She's not the kind
you bang and forget about.

192
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:41,728
You got to spend time with her.

193
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:45,446
You bang her?

194
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,030
No.

195
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:52,165
- Tell me the truth.
- I just did.

196
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:55,126
If I did it, you would know.

197
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,424
- I took her out.
- You didn't try to fuck her?

198
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,603
- I tried.
- She didn't go with you?

199
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:08,902
- She didn't go for it.
- Naturally. She knew better.

200
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:13,235
- What does she know better?
- That you're an animal.

201
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,865
Ruin her reputation.

202
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,956
- Wasn't he talking to Vickie?
- That's the same guy?

203
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,754
- Same.
- I'll kill him.

204
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,469
- You missed him yesterday.
- I was at the house yesterday.

205
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,884
We'll find him.

206
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:33,104
Look at 'em.
Big business meeting.

207
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:38,730
They talk, make deals,
make sure she can hear.

208
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:43,409
Like a big man. Get outta here.

209
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,617
Don't get your hair wet.

210
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,169
Bigshot.

211
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:57,679
I'll smack him around -
no more bigshot.

212
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,105
Real tough guys.

213
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:07,941
- Tough guys.
- What are you thinkin'?

214
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:14,119
You're married. It's over.
Leave 'em for me.

215
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:20,126
Bigshot.

216
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,434
Let's get out of here.

217
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:33,472
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out. Business.

218
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:36,986
- You go out, I go out.
- Whatever.

219
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:41,453
I won't be here
when you get back!

220
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,995
- Stop.
- Why don't you?

221
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:49,211
You're not going on business.
You're gonna suck each other.

222
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:55,506
Larry, you got something
to talk about with your dog.

223
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,552
- Hit her with a bat.
- She's still my wife.

224
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:02,935
How much you gonna take?
Kill her.

225
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:08,451
Fags! You leave me here
like a dog!

226
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:12,238
- What's wrong with you?
- You can't leave me!

227
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:17,247
- What's the matter?
- I could give a shit!

228
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,436
Beans!

229
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,139
Jack.

230
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,161
- Let's sit with Beansie.
- Beansie who? Who's Beansie?

231
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,830
- What?
- Beansie who?

232
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:47,872
- Beans. One of the guys.
- Think she'll be there?

233
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:51,505
I don't know.
You can see from there.

234
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:06,318
- How you doin', Joe?
- Thanks for the seats.

235
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,571
Hey, what's up? Thank you.

236
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:12,250
I got trouble with some
greaseballs downstairs.

237
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:15,126
- Hello, Father.
- Hey, Father.

238
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,887
Father, you want to get laid?

239
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:22,885
Bless the table. Give us a shot.

240
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,015
Give any money?

241
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:48,091
- She's over there.
- I saw her.

242
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:56,269
- They're with her.
- No, go ahead.

243
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:47,341
Get the fuck out! Get out!

244
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,437
You, too. Get out, you bum!

245
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:53,975
- Bastards.
- Get out.

246
00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:00,534
Hey, Vickie! Vickie! Vickie!

247
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:09,417
- Hi.
- How you doing?

248
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:12,345
- OK. What you doing?
- Nothing much.

249
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:17,557
- That your car?
- My brother's. Ever meet him?

250
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:21,312
- Is that him?
- Yeah. Want to meet him?

251
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,228
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

252
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,922
This is my brother Jake,
the next champ.

253
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:42,049
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

254
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,387
Nice to meet you.

255
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,897
- Nice car.
- You like it?

256
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,062
It's nice.

257
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,758
- Where you from?
- Around here.

258
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:12,304
Want a ride?

259
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:18,898
All right. I have to change.

260
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:22,521
- All right.
- All right? I'll be back.

261
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:24,359
- I'll be here.
- OK.

262
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:33,834
Move over.

263
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,150
- I never played before.
- Go ahead. I'll show you how.

264
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,366
That's right.

265
00:25:56,456 --> 00:26:00,622
- Like this?
- Right. Hit the little one.

266
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,478
You see it?

267
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,393
No.

268
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,551
- What does that mean?
- Means the game is over.

269
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,472
Come on. Let's go.

270
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,186
Daddy?

271
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,954
Dad? Come on in.

272
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:03,631
Probably went shopping.
Let me see. Daddy?

273
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:11,895
Must be shopping. Sit down.

274
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,784
- Want somethin'?
- No.

275
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,067
Sure?

276
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:32,758
Salut.

277
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:51,785
Sit a little closer.

278
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,828
You're so far away.

279
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:22,084
Come here. Sit over here.
Come on over here.

280
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,581
That's better.

281
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,099
No, thank you anyway.

282
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:36,469
Some water?

283
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:49,869
Want to see
the rest of the place?

284
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,075
All right.

285
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,792
I bought it for my father.

286
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,128
Yeah?

287
00:28:56,636 --> 00:28:58,095
From fightin'?

288
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:01,468
Yeah. What else?

289
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,568
The dining room.

290
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:17,406
That was a bird. It's dead now.

291
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,682
Come in.

292
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,273
Sit down.

293
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:06,728
- That's me and my brother.
- I know.

294
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,658
You look good.

295
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:19,797
- Why are you smiling?
- I don't know.

296
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,018
You're beautiful.

297
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:33,602
Anybody ever tell you that?

298
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:12,121
Robinson and La Motta
in their second fight.

299
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,574
Robinson and La Motta
in their second fight.

300
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:20,131
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake last October.

301
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,009
They have different styles.

302
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:29,183
Robinson, the dancing master,
and La Motta the brawler.

303
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:30,849
He's hurt Robinson.

304
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:38,149
He's coming at Robinson.
A left and right to the jaw.

305
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:43,866
It's anybody's fight
at this point.

306
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:49,834
La Motta hurts Robinson again
with a left to the jaw.

307
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:54,840
Robinson comes back. La Motta
drives him across the ring.

308
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:59,894
Robinson is driven out for the
first knockdown of his career!

309
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:04,487
It's the nearest
Robinson's been to losing.

310
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:17,379
La Motta has taken charge
of the fight.

311
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:20,552
Sugar Ray's winning ways
are in jeopardy.

312
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,258
La Motta feigning a left hand.

313
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:38,366
After ten rounds,
Judge Rossi... 8-2, La Motta.

314
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,667
Judge Murphy... 7-3, La Motta.

315
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:49,586
La Motta has won,
a unanimous decision.

316
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:54,178
He's handing Robinson
his first professional loss.

317
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,180
Robinson doesn't like it.

318
00:32:56,273 --> 00:33:02,148
With this victory, La Motta
has broken Robinson's record.

319
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,492
He shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

320
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:16,192
- You sure we should do this?
- Come here.

321
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:18,156
Before a fight?

322
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:23,033
Come here.

323
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,127
You've been good for two weeks.

324
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,494
Come here.

325
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,280
Touch my boo-boos.

326
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:56,460
Good. That's it.

327
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:57,830
Boo-ba?

328
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:02,009
Give the boo-boo a kiss.
Make it better.

329
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:19,908
Take off my pants.

330
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,371
Take off my pants.

331
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:42,107
Take off the rest.

332
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:48,581
- I promised not to.
- Go ahead. Do it.

333
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,441
Take off your panties.

334
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:56,590
I like the gym smell.

335
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:03,432
The smell of the gym.

336
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,975
No, no, no.

337
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:35,857
That's it.

338
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,700
I got to fight Robinson.

339
00:37:13,336 --> 00:37:16,837
What are you doin' to me?

340
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:56,503
La Motta and Robinson
meet again.

341
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:03,060
They're classic rivals -
fierce, powerful fighters.

342
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,647
Dangerous - no other fighter
will go near them.

343
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:11,114
So they fight each other.
They've each won one.

344
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,952
They'll probably fight again.

345
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,162
They go to close quarters.

346
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:26,595
Round seven. Robinson's ahead.
La Motta may need a knockout.

347
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:32,760
Robinson's down for
the second time in his career.

348
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:38,315
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

349
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:42,405
- Robinson's trying to get up.
- Seven... eight...

350
00:38:42,495 --> 00:38:46,495
He's on his feet now,
and he's stunned.

351
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:53,130
La Motta comes at him. Robinson
is well ahead on points.

352
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,506
He hooks a left to the jaw.

353
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,102
Your attention, fans.

354
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:07,606
Judge Joe Lanahan scores it 8-1,
one even, in favour of Robinson.

355
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:15,995
...with a score of 6-2,
two even,

356
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:23,052
for the winner by unanimous
decision, Sugar Ray Robinson.

357
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:38,159
He only won 'cause
he's going in the army.

358
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:42,195
I knocked him down.
What else can I do?

359
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:47,667
They robbed you. Their mothers
take it up the fuckin' ass.

360
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:52,679
Maybe it's because
I've done bad things.

361
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,395
Maybe I'm a jinx.

362
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,102
Forget that shit.
This was your shot.

363
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,812
- They robbed us!
- Want to talk to Vickie?

364
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:05,650
No, I don't.

365
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,118
- Joey, take her home.
- OK.

366
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,547
- You all right?
- I'm OK.

367
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:21,258
- You sure?
- Make sure she's OK.

368
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:22,593
All right.

369
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,794
Don't ever do that shit again.
No more deals like that.

370
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:58,262
- What are you talkin' about?
- Look at that! 168 pounds.

371
00:43:58,348 --> 00:44:02,763
- Stop eatin'.
- I said I didn't want to do it.

372
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:09,227
You're the one who told me
you could get down to 155.

373
00:44:09,322 --> 00:44:13,274
I'm not even gonna
make it to 160.

374
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,793
You signed me at 155.
I could lose $15,000.

375
00:44:18,878 --> 00:44:22,545
- That's right.
- You're my manager.

376
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:25,552
- I did what I wanted.
- I'm worried.

377
00:44:25,638 --> 00:44:30,931
- You want a title shot?
- Am I in a circus over here?

378
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,649
- He's got more sense than you.
- You've been killing yourself.

379
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:39,818
There's nobody left.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

380
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:45,367
Along comes Janiro. He's young.
He'll fight anybody.

381
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:49,244
Good. You fight him.
Tear him apart.

382
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:52,507
- Why are you worried?
- The weight.

383
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:55,762
- The weight?
- I just said the weight.

384
00:44:55,848 --> 00:44:58,851
If you lose because of that,

385
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:02,271
they'll think you're not tough?

386
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:06,488
Good. You'll fight the guys
who were afraid before.

387
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:09,907
- You'll get a title shot.
- Coffee, please.

388
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:14,076
Why? Nobody's left.
Who can they give it to?

389
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,828
- Coffee.
- In a minute.

390
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:18,043
- You listening?
- Please bring it.

391
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,504
- All right.
- How long?

392
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,465
You listening?
Let's say you win.

393
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:27,341
You beat Janiro,
which you should, right?

394
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:28,896
- Yeah.
- Right?

395
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,185
- Yeah.
- You still got a title shot.

396
00:45:32,277 --> 00:45:36,323
- Why?
- There's nobody left.

397
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:42,116
They'll give you the shot.
If you win or lose, you win.

398
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:47,584
You can't lose,
and you'll do it on your own.

399
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:52,137
You understand? Just get
down to 155. Stop eatin'.

400
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:56,721
You can do it.
Do you understand that?

401
00:45:56,812 --> 00:46:01,441
Joey's right. Janiro's
good-looking and popular.

402
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:06,073
- Excuse me. Good-looking?
- I'm saying popular.

403
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,325
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Joey's right.

404
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:13,086
- Are you an authority?
- Nothing. I...

405
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:17,001
Take the baby and get out.

406
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:23,924
Everybody's an authority. How
does she know he's good-looking?

407
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:27,021
She didn't mean nothin'.

408
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,318
- Who asked you?
- Starting with me now?

409
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:35,535
Don't interrupt.
It's none of your business.

410
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:41,458
They got nothin' to do with you.
Take the baby inside.

411
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:47,467
- Let's leave the grouches here.
- Change her diapers.

412
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:51,849
- You make her cry.
- I'll make you cry.

413
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,062
They're babies.

414
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:03,650
Let's go to the training camp.

415
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:07,743
No wives or phone calls.
Nobody around to bother you.

416
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,998
- I'll fix your schedule.
- Can I ask you something?

417
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,759
When I'm away,
you notice anything?

418
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:16,753
- With Vickie?
- Yeah.

419
00:47:16,846 --> 00:47:19,848
- Like what?
- What do you think?

420
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:25,398
- I don't notice anything.
- Keep an eye on her.

421
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:30,729
- She don't do anything wrong.
- Watch her while I'm away.

422
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:33,281
You'll start trouble
for nothin'.

423
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,079
I got a reason.

424
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:40,505
Any woman, given the right
circumstances, will do anything.

425
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:42,962
Anything's possible, all right?

426
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:46,920
You're right,
but you're pickin' on this girl.

427
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:49,554
You're worried
about your weight.

428
00:47:49,644 --> 00:47:53,477
You're saying,
"Go inside! Who asked you?"

429
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:57,981
- You'll give her an excuse.
- She was talkin' about a guy.

430
00:47:58,073 --> 00:48:01,360
So? She was talkin'
on your behalf.

431
00:48:01,453 --> 00:48:05,702
She was talkin'
about a pretty kid.

432
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,252
Make him ugly.

433
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:09,544
- Just do it.
- All right.

434
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:16,469
You should go inside
and make up with her.

435
00:48:16,558 --> 00:48:19,929
Tell her you'll take her out.

436
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:26,608
Then you can leave
with a clear head, all right?

437
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:29,736
All right. Where you want to go?

438
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:35,500
Out out. If you tell her now,
take her aside,

439
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:39,003
'cause I'm not taking Lenore.

440
00:48:39,091 --> 00:48:41,879
What, you think I'll tell her?

441
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,723
- Do what you want.
- I am.

442
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,596
Come here.

443
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:20,023
Good evening.
It's great to be back.

444
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:24,572
Come on, lady, laugh.
I laughed when you come in.

445
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:29,779
Seriously, we have
a special guest with us.

446
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:33,920
He's the world's leading
middleweight contender.

447
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:39,796
The Bronx Bull. The Raging Bull.
Let's hear it for Jake La Motta!

448
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,020
- What's your name again?
- Janet.

449
00:49:48,108 --> 00:49:52,155
Janet. Sorry. It's post time.

450
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:58,623
Hits me with a left hook.
No hand. A hook.

451
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:02,285
- Where you goin'?
- The bathroom.

452
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:09,004
- Hey, Vickie.
- Hi.

453
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:11,425
You're lookin' great. Joe here?

454
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:14,555
- Yeah. Jake's here, too.
- That's great.

455
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:18,599
I'm here with Tommy.
Come have a drink.

456
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:23,234
How are you?

457
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,568
You aren't drinkin', are you?

458
00:50:27,663 --> 00:50:29,989
- How are you, Joey?
- Hi, Sal.

459
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:35,080
I'm with Tommy Como.
Come have a drink.

460
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:37,500
I didn't see him.

461
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:49,730
- See you later, Joey.
- He looks good, Jack.

462
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,527
That was my best joke.

463
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:02,040
Look who's here.

464
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:09,131
How are you, honey?
Good to see you.

465
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,646
- Sit down.
- I just came to say hello.

466
00:51:14,732 --> 00:51:19,230
Thanks for comin' by.
Not a bad kid.

467
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:22,858
She's caught a hundred beatings
off that gorilla.

468
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,959
- What kept you?
- I talked to Tommy.

469
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:34,176
I saw you.
What took you so long?

470
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,797
Nothing. I said hello.
I came back.

471
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,683
What did he say?

472
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:43,934
He asked me if I wanted a drink.

473
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:48,985
- What did Sal say?
- He asked if Joey was here.

474
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:53,369
He said, "Say hello to Tommy,"
and I did.

475
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:57,205
- Are you interested in him?
- No. Why?

476
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:59,038
You sure you're not?

477
00:51:59,213 --> 00:52:00,412
Yeah.

478
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:05,385
But you could be
interested in somebody?

479
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:12,189
- Don't start, Jake.
- Shut up or I'll smack you.

480
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:15,193
These are from Mr Como.

481
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,859
- Shall I take...
- What?

482
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:25,372
- Shall I take this?
- I'm not through.

483
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,453
These are jokes.

484
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,380
Hi. How are you,
you bald-headed fag?

485
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:39,678
- Thanks for the drinks.
- Any time.

486
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:41,565
- How are you?
- Fine.

487
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,229
- Where's Jake?
- Over there.

488
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,741
- Call him.
- All right.

489
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,327
I'll be back.

490
00:52:54,419 --> 00:52:58,964
You don't call any more.
We don't see you any more.

491
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:03,382
You can't make a call?
What is it?

492
00:53:03,474 --> 00:53:06,927
- I'm busy fighting out of town.
- Busy.

493
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:11,483
He's taking me seriously.
I'm only kidding. What a kid!

494
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:14,690
He's the best fighter around.

495
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,578
They're all afraid to fight you.

496
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,373
- How are you?
- OK.

497
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:24,164
- Strong?
- Yeah, I'm doing OK.

498
00:53:24,254 --> 00:53:28,301
- Janiro's got to watch his ass.
- He should.

499
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:29,584
All right.

500
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,678
- I wanted to put money on him.
- Good fighter.

501
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:37,684
Very attractive guy.
No marks. Clean.

502
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:47,199
- Have you gained a few pounds?
- I'll knock it off right away.

503
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:53,164
Let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin'.

504
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:59,592
I'm betting a lot of money on
you in this fight with Janiro.

505
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:01,259
Yeah?

506
00:54:01,433 --> 00:54:07,557
- What would you tell me?
- I'd say everything you got.

507
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:09,027
- Everything?
- Everything.

508
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:14,658
I'm gonna open his hole
like this. Excuse my French.

509
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:17,996
- I'll make him suffer.
- What's with him?

510
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:23,590
I'll make his mother wish she
never had him. He's dog meat.

511
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:28,137
- Didn't he say something...?
- He's a pretty kid, too.

512
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:31,308
Should I fuck him or fight him?

513
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:39,945
- Fuck him or fight him!
- You're liable to get fucked.

514
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:41,692
- By who?
- Janiro.

515
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:46,412
- You want him to fuck you?
- Me? No.

516
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:48,872
- I could fix that.
- How?

517
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:52,581
I'll give you both
a fuckin' beating.

518
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,882
- I'll bleed.
- You're used to that.

519
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:01,846
Drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

520
00:55:02,022 --> 00:55:03,647
Salut.

521
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,607
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

522
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:50,756
- What?
- You awake?

523
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:53,299
No.

524
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:57,967
- Can you hear me?
- What?

525
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:08,865
You ever think of anybody else
when we're in bed?

526
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:12,655
- What?
- When we make love.

527
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:16,293
Nobody. I love you.

528
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,760
Why'd you say
that thing about Janiro?

529
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,932
- What?
- That he had a pretty face.

530
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:30,858
- I never noticed his face.
- Why'd you say that, then?

531
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:38,538
I don't even know what
he looks like. Go to sleep.

532
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:58,598
- He ain't pretty now.
- Jake messed him up.

533
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:06,911
And the winner by unanimous
decision, in ten rounds...

534
00:58:06,996 --> 00:58:08,491
Jake La Motta.

535
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,661
Give me a piece of ice.
Just a sliver.

536
00:58:36,748 --> 00:58:42,337
- No water.
- I'm dyin'. Fuckin' hard-on.

537
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:48,681
Four pounds. Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

538
00:58:56,806 --> 00:59:01,020
I saw the Janiro fight.
He destroyed this guy.

539
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:06,349
He knocked his nose
from one side to the other.

540
00:59:06,445 --> 00:59:11,406
- Who are you fightin' next?
- I don't know.

541
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:16,289
- He'll get that title shot.
- Jackie Curtie. You know him.

542
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:20,246
- A pleasure.
- We'll get the title shot.

543
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,672
- Made some money off Jake.
- More than he did.

544
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:27,885
Made money on the Jackson fight.

545
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:33,233
- Whatever happened to Oscar?
- He's punchy. Probably died.

546
00:59:33,318 --> 00:59:35,691
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- Beautiful table.

547
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,607
He's complaining?
Beautiful table.

548
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:41,485
He's working
an elevator downtown.

549
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:44,115
I'm not Italian.

550
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:50,047
- Took me right up.
- Oscar did you a lot of good.

551
00:59:50,134 --> 00:59:54,632
- Mickey! Cutty Sarks and water.
- Excuse me one minute.

552
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,477
Come back, Joey. Come on back.

553
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:07,609
Something's happening.

554
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:11,915
- They're having a problem.
- Worried about it? Don't worry.

555
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:15,204
- Just shut up.
- I'm a prisoner.

556
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:17,918
I look at somebody wrong,
I get smacked.

557
01:00:18,008 --> 01:00:21,877
- You think you're right?
- I am.

558
01:00:21,972 --> 01:00:26,102
- You're wrong.
- You guys are always up my ass.

559
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:29,137
- Shut up.
- No.

560
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:33,398
- Don't make me...
- I'm tired of listening to you!

561
01:00:33,656 --> 01:00:38,035
- I'm by myself every night.
- Why'd you marry him?

562
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:40,245
- I love him.
- You do?

563
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:43,500
This guy don't want to fuck me.

564
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:50,092
He'll be all right
as soon as he gets his shot.

565
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,755
You won't have to run around.

566
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,853
He'll never be champ.
People hate him.

567
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:59,558
- You're drinkin' with them.
- I'm gonna have fun.

568
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,895
Get your stuff!

569
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:09,827
You're makin' an asshole
out of my brother!

570
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:13,501
- Joey...
- Mind your fuckin' business!

571
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:16,627
- You're takin' this wrong.
- Shut up!

572
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:20,136
What's wrong with you?
This is innocent.

573
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:24,092
- Relax.
- You know better than that.

574
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:28,437
- It's all calm now.
- We're friends a long time.

575
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:31,399
- It's Jake's wife.
- Nothing's goin' on.

576
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,817
Sorry. We can straighten this...

577
01:01:35,955 --> 01:01:38,791
Nothing goin' on?!
Nothing goin' on?!

578
01:01:43,383 --> 01:01:44,794
Fucking hard-on!

579
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:48,682
I'll bite your fuckin' head off!

580
01:01:54,524 --> 01:01:57,146
- Get your hands off!
- Come on!

581
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:00,736
Fuckin' cunt.

582
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,073
Get out!

583
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:06,457
I'll suck your fuckin' eyes out!

584
01:02:11,757 --> 01:02:16,302
We do what we got to do.
Don't mention names.

585
01:02:16,389 --> 01:02:18,798
- You're wrong.
- He's wrong!

586
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:32,905
Take it easy!

587
01:02:56,026 --> 01:03:00,322
There's a lot of years
between you.

588
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,576
I understand
it was your brother's wife,

589
01:03:03,662 --> 01:03:07,958
but you don't create
a scene like that.

590
01:03:08,044 --> 01:03:13,503
We've heard everybody's point of
view, and we'll forget about it.

591
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:16,465
I shouldn't, but we will.

592
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:24,013
Now, I want you to shake hands
and forget this whole thing.

593
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:28,191
No grudges.
That's the most important thing.

594
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:31,027
Come on, shake hands.

595
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:40,665
It's all right with me
if it's OK with you.

596
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,460
- I wish this never happened.
- We all do.

597
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:47,723
All right? We'll get over it.

598
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,896
Salvy, let me talk to him alone.

599
01:03:51,065 --> 01:03:52,690
All right.

600
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:55,903
See you later.

601
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,536
- Sorry. I forgot all about it.
- You fuckin' nuts?

602
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:10,128
Aside from this, the family OK?

603
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:12,674
They're fine. Everybody's fine.

604
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,937
- You can't talk?
- What do you mean?

605
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,896
You got a funny attitude.

606
01:04:22,986 --> 01:04:27,650
What is it
with all the quick answers?

607
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:29,286
I don't know.

608
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:32,955
- You want to leave?
- It's not like that.

609
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:37,790
It's all the aggravation
and all the fights.

610
01:04:39,385 --> 01:04:45,058
Listen to me.
Jake's become an embarrassment.

611
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:51,390
He's embarrassing me with
certain people. I'm lookin' bad.

612
01:04:52,446 --> 01:04:56,909
I can't deliver a kid
from my own neighbourhood.

613
01:04:56,994 --> 01:05:02,833
Why does he make it so hard
on himself? I'd make it easier.

614
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:07,752
His head is rock.

615
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:17,681
It's hard to explain, Tommy.
Jack respects you.

616
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:22,320
He don't say hello to anybody.
He talks to you.

617
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:30,081
When he gets somethin' on
his mind, he's got a hard head.

618
01:05:30,168 --> 01:05:34,713
Jesus Christ could come
off the cross, he don't care.

619
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,594
- He wants to do it on his own.
- On his own.

620
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:44,262
He thinks he's gonna
become champion on his own?

621
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:48,189
- The guy's nuts.
- He's crazy.

622
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:53,025
He doesn't respect or listen
to nobody. That's not crazy?

623
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:56,654
- He respects you.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

624
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,872
You do this for me.

625
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,920
Tell him I don't care
how colourful or great he is.

626
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:07,711
He could beat
everyone in the world.

627
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:12,055
He ain't gettin' a title shot
without us. You tell him.

628
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:25,574
Son of a bitch.
Twenty-dollar shoes here.

629
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:34,751
Know what happened?

630
01:06:39,264 --> 01:06:40,593
What's the matter?

631
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:45,270
- What's wrong?
- I remember meeting her here.

632
01:06:46,901 --> 01:06:48,693
- Who?
- Vickie.

633
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:54,870
What did she do now?

634
01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:02,245
She's doin' somethin'.
I want to catch her.

635
01:07:05,928 --> 01:07:09,631
Want to do yourself a favour?

636
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:15,102
Bust her hole, throw her out,
or let her ruin your life.

637
01:07:15,192 --> 01:07:16,603
That's what's happenin'.

638
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:22,108
How much could you take?

639
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:37,096
- What'd that guy say?
- Good news and bad news.

640
01:07:38,226 --> 01:07:41,596
You got a shot at the title,

641
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:45,475
but you got
to flip-flop for them.

642
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:50,316
- What else is new?
- You knew that was comin'.

643
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:54,575
- Win some, lose some.
- This one we'll lose.

644
01:07:57,003 --> 01:08:02,426
Billy Fox... 173
and three-quarter pounds.

645
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:08,766
Jake La Motta... 167.

646
01:08:08,854 --> 01:08:13,434
I guess you've heard
a lot of rumours by now.

647
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:17,028
A short time ago,
you were the favourite.

648
01:08:17,116 --> 01:08:21,329
Now you're a 12-5 underdog.
People are talking.

649
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:25,413
- I never heard anything.
- It's not good.

650
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:29,454
The bets are off on this one.
Nothin' goin'.

651
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:33,301
Smart money's saying
you're gonna hit the tank.

652
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:35,347
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit.

653
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:39,724
Want to bet?
I'll take the action.

654
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:44,978
Bet on Fox. I'll win.
I don't go down for nobody.

655
01:08:45,073 --> 01:08:48,526
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- All right.

656
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,121
- That's it.
- You came down here for that?

657
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,538
That was it.

658
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:55,327
Fuck him.

659
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:06,280
Good evening.

660
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:10,585
Welcome to the Madison Square
Garden feature attraction.

661
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,162
In this corner...

662
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:16,877
Commissioner,
how about a picture?

663
01:09:18,473 --> 01:09:21,095
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

664
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:27,853
Your brother got out
of the hospital?

665
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:30,235
Did he get out? Good.

666
01:09:31,951 --> 01:09:34,110
- Let me sit there.
- Sure.

667
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,535
- What's up?
- Everything OK?

668
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:39,707
It's OK.

669
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:43,380
- Come out boxing.
- Seconds out.

670
01:09:56,403 --> 01:10:01,447
Stand up! What you doin'?
Hit me, you fuckin' punk!

671
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:07,332
- Come on!
- What're you doin'? Box him!

672
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:22,514
What's the matter with you?
What are you doin' out there?

673
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:24,768
- Slow, that's all.
- What you doin'?

674
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:28,113
Take it easy. He'll make it up.

675
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:33,077
Goddamn it. Pick it up.
I'm sorry.

676
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,823
I got money on you!

677
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:39,290
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, you bum!

678
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:45,556
Pocket your dirty money!

679
01:10:45,725 --> 01:10:50,805
Stop it, Jack!
You phoney bastard!

680
01:10:53,737 --> 01:10:56,775
Don't stop the fight, you jerk!

681
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,407
And you, standing there!

682
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:02,747
The referee stops this bout.

683
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:04,745
- Phoney!
- Fake!

684
01:11:06,506 --> 01:11:09,959
The winner by technical knockout

685
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:14,598
and still undefeated...
Billy Fox.

686
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,452
It's a free country.
Don't fight any more.

687
01:11:35,715 --> 01:11:38,836
What did I do?

688
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,674
What did I do?

689
01:11:44,144 --> 01:11:45,888
What did I do?

690
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:54,609
Get out of here!

691
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,453
It's all right, Jake.

692
01:12:02,087 --> 01:12:04,793
Why'd I do it? Why? Why?

693
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:12,097
They got some balls.

694
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:18,607
I take the dive.
They want me to go down, too?

695
01:12:18,694 --> 01:12:22,147
- I ain't goin' down.
- Do me a favour.

696
01:12:22,241 --> 01:12:25,446
Put your hands up.
I'll show you.

697
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:32,084
- What's so hard about that?
- You don't understand!

698
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:38,593
I had to fight a bum! I tapped
him, he's all over the place.

699
01:12:38,682 --> 01:12:41,768
You didn't have to help him!

700
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:45,021
I don't, I'm in worse trouble.

701
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:47,652
I don't know.

702
01:12:47,737 --> 01:12:52,282
"Purse was withheld
pending DA's probe."

703
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:57,745
Look how they make me look -
like I'm a bum, a mammalucco.

704
01:12:57,835 --> 01:13:01,786
- A what?
- The mammalucco of the year.

705
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:07,970
Tommy won't forget us. You'll
get a shot if he don't die.

706
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:10,550
- Who don't?
- Tommy.

707
01:13:10,645 --> 01:13:14,182
- What are you saying?
- Tommy won't forget you.

708
01:13:14,275 --> 01:13:17,776
- You'll get your shot.
- Something wrong with him?

709
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:19,442
No, I'm just sayin'...

710
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,491
Want to fight in the rain?
It's a stadium.

711
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:44,212
- You can wait.
- I don't want to wait 24 hours.

712
01:13:44,298 --> 01:13:48,215
I don't either,
but we got to. Hello?

713
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:52,968
- You guys want to stop?
- Get off the phone.

714
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,434
- Get off!
- He won't talk.

715
01:13:55,523 --> 01:14:01,481
There's enough confusion here.
Don't call. No comment.

716
01:14:01,574 --> 01:14:06,238
Right. Thank you. Bye.
I don't believe them.

717
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:11,493
- Just hang up on 'em.
- What do you want to eat?

718
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:16,086
- I don't want nothin'.
- You got to eat somethin'.

719
01:14:18,682 --> 01:14:24,688
Eat a steak. Chew it and spit it
out. You'll make the weight.

720
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:26,566
You worried about that?

721
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:32,992
I'll order a steak.
If you want it, it's here.

722
01:14:33,078 --> 01:14:35,997
- Go ahead.
- What do you want?

723
01:14:36,082 --> 01:14:40,378
- Order me a piece of cake.
- That's all?

724
01:14:40,464 --> 01:14:44,463
Get a cheeseburger.
It's better for you.

725
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:49,182
- Yeah, order me one.
- What do you want?

726
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:53,517
- Since when you order those?
- I want it.

727
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,446
- Order what you want.
- I was just suggesting.

728
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:04,155
- Why are you telling her...
- I don't care what she eats.

729
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:08,248
- Then why'd you tell her?
- Order me a cheeseburger.

730
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:13,587
Order a cheeseburger.

731
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:21,270
- How long does this take to do?
- Forty seconds.

732
01:15:21,357 --> 01:15:24,692
That's no good.
Do it in 30 seconds.

733
01:15:31,872 --> 01:15:35,040
- What?
- Somebody to see you.

734
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:39,252
- How you doin'?
- How are you?

735
01:15:44,057 --> 01:15:48,471
- Say hello to Charlie.
- How are you? Lots of luck.

736
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:50,058
Thank you.

737
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:54,487
- How are you?
- All right.

738
01:15:54,572 --> 01:15:58,073
- Feelin' good?
- As good as I'm goin' to.

739
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,198
- I got to fight.
- All right.

740
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,328
- We come to wish you luck.
- Thanks.

741
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,796
- Need anything?
- No.

742
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,755
- You sure?
- No, thanks.

743
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:11,627
- Take care. God bless you.
- Thank you, Tommy.

744
01:16:11,722 --> 01:16:13,632
- You'll be OK.
- Yeah.

745
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:18,140
- See you later.
- Tommy, wait.

746
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:22,528
We really appreciate
your coming. It was nice.

747
01:16:22,696 --> 01:16:24,405
Any time.

748
01:16:24,574 --> 01:16:26,900
- It's important.
- Any time.

749
01:16:27,078 --> 01:16:30,994
- Goodbye.
- So long. Take care of Jake.

750
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:34,205
- I will.
- Any little thing, call me.

751
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,216
He's very nervous.
Goodbye, honey.

752
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:42,724
Look at that face.
Can you believe that girl?

753
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:47,687
- Just as beautiful as ever.
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

754
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:50,481
- So long, everybody!
- So long, Tommy.

755
01:17:01,545 --> 01:17:03,918
Come here a minute.

756
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:15,181
- What was all that about?
- All what?

757
01:17:15,356 --> 01:17:17,065
You know what.

758
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:22,108
- What happened?
- I just said goodbye.

759
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,701
- Now you're friendly with him?
- I said goodbye.

760
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,459
You say hello, goodbye.
That's all.

761
01:17:28,626 --> 01:17:29,871
Yeah...

762
01:17:30,629 --> 01:17:35,174
You hear what I said?
Don't ever disrespect me.

763
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,550
- You hear me?
- I hear.

764
01:17:37,639 --> 01:17:39,050
Go in there.

765
01:17:40,476 --> 01:17:43,313
- Come here.
- Stop that. Stop it.

766
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:47,444
Shut up!
I'll take care of you later!

767
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:58,332
I'm disgusted with you.

768
01:18:03,093 --> 01:18:04,374
Later.

769
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:16,017
Hit the fuckin'...

770
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,354
I'm the boss! I'm the boss!

771
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:35,006
For the middleweight
championship of the world,

772
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:36,807
fifteen rounds.

773
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:39,764
In this corner, the challenger,

774
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:44,068
weighing in at 158
and a quarter pounds,

775
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:47,654
The Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta.

776
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:57,380
Come out fighting at the bell.

777
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:42,152
Now finish him off.

778
01:20:45,784 --> 01:20:49,535
Blow on him.
He'll fall right over.

779
01:20:49,707 --> 01:20:51,118
Feel all right?

780
01:20:54,505 --> 01:20:59,086
Can he continue? Commissioner,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

781
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:16,035
May I have
your attention, please?

782
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,328
Cerdan is unable to continue.

783
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,038
The referee
has stopped the fight.

784
01:21:21,128 --> 01:21:24,463
The winner
by a technical knockout,

785
01:21:24,549 --> 01:21:27,587
the new middleweight
champion of the world...

786
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,800
The Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta.

787
01:21:55,252 --> 01:21:59,964
Don't shake that. It's
the worst thing you could do.

788
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:07,060
You're home.

789
01:22:13,613 --> 01:22:15,571
- Hello.
- Where were you?

790
01:22:15,657 --> 01:22:19,787
- I went out. What's the matter?
- Television won't work.

791
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:26,250
- Where'd you go?
- Out. Shopping, to my sister's.

792
01:22:38,983 --> 01:22:41,689
What's with this kissin'
on the mouth?

793
01:22:41,779 --> 01:22:45,944
- Can't I kiss her?
- Ain't her cheek good enough?

794
01:22:46,035 --> 01:22:49,287
- Come on...
- I don't kiss Mom like that.

795
01:22:49,373 --> 01:22:53,539
- You're not supposed to.
- That's what I mean.

796
01:22:59,012 --> 01:23:01,302
- How's that?
- Looks like somethin'.

797
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,889
Your stomach's in the way.

798
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,148
Why dirty looks?

799
01:23:14,535 --> 01:23:17,157
You eat like
there's no tomorrow.

800
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:23,751
You're defending the title
next month. Keep eatin'.

801
01:23:25,092 --> 01:23:26,967
Give me dirty looks.

802
01:23:30,934 --> 01:23:33,556
What happened
with you and Salvy?

803
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:36,317
- When?
- When you beat him up.

804
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:41,818
When I caught his head
in the taxicab door?

805
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:45,493
- Yeah.
- I told you, didn't I?

806
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,455
- No.
- I never did?

807
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:50,247
- No.
- It was no big thing.

808
01:23:50,337 --> 01:23:53,090
I smacked him on the mouth.

809
01:23:53,175 --> 01:23:57,174
Had to straighten it out
with Tommy. It's forgotten.

810
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:01,643
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Didn't concern you.

811
01:24:03,732 --> 01:24:05,559
- It didn't?
- No.

812
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:08,856
Then who? Vickie?

813
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:14,697
I just explained it.
It was between me and Salvy.

814
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:17,708
Otherwise,
I would have told you.

815
01:24:21,633 --> 01:24:24,968
- That's not what I heard.
- It's not?

816
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:27,013
- No.
- What'd you hear?

817
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:30,684
- I heard something.
- About me and Salvy.

818
01:24:30,771 --> 01:24:34,391
- I heard things.
- That I cracked Salvy around.

819
01:24:34,485 --> 01:24:36,562
- I heard things.
- What things?

820
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:40,701
- I heard some things.
- Don't start that worryin'.

821
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:44,572
Want to worry?
Worry about this title fight.

822
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:46,998
Do that.

823
01:24:50,926 --> 01:24:52,041
Christ!

824
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:59,224
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

825
01:24:59,313 --> 01:25:01,057
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

826
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:06,853
Don't start your shit.
No, really, don't start.

827
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:10,450
- I asked you to watch her.
- I did.

828
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:14,751
- Then why'd you beat him up?
- I told you.

829
01:25:14,835 --> 01:25:19,167
- It had nothing to do with you.
- Don't lie.

830
01:25:19,259 --> 01:25:21,585
- I'm not.
- Think I'm stupid?

831
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,180
I'm your brother.
Don't you trust me?

832
01:25:25,267 --> 01:25:26,679
- No.
- That's nice.

833
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:29,440
I don't trust nobody about her.

834
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:34,978
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you.

835
01:25:35,073 --> 01:25:40,201
I slapped him around. Tommy
straightened it out. It's over.

836
01:25:46,632 --> 01:25:48,127
There's that look.

837
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:53,887
I'll accept your answer,

838
01:25:53,976 --> 01:25:58,355
but if I hear anything,
I'll kill somebody.

839
01:25:59,943 --> 01:26:03,148
- I'll kill somebody.
- Go ahead. Kill everybody.

840
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:09,245
Kill Vickie and Salvy and Tommy.
Kill me while you're at it.

841
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:13,378
You're killing yourself,
the way you eat.

842
01:26:13,463 --> 01:26:20,596
- What do you mean, kill you?
- Kill me first. Do me a favour.

843
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:26,687
- You're a killer. Just kill.
- What do you mean by "you"?

844
01:26:28,193 --> 01:26:33,616
- So? What's that mean?
- You don't know what you meant.

845
01:26:33,701 --> 01:26:36,027
- Don't mean nothin'.
- That meant somethin'.

846
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:39,741
You included you
with Tommy and Salvy.

847
01:26:40,753 --> 01:26:43,209
You said you and them.

848
01:26:44,508 --> 01:26:48,555
This girl ruined your life.
She did a job on you.

849
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:50,467
You're nuts.

850
01:26:50,559 --> 01:26:53,133
- You fuck her?
- What?

851
01:26:53,229 --> 01:26:54,558
You fuck her?

852
01:26:58,362 --> 01:27:02,492
How could you ask me that?
I'm your brother.

853
01:27:02,576 --> 01:27:07,454
Where do you get balls
big enough to ask me that?

854
01:27:11,756 --> 01:27:13,085
Just tell me.

855
01:27:18,057 --> 01:27:21,143
I'm not answering that.
It's stupid.

856
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,439
You're smart, Joey.

857
01:27:30,283 --> 01:27:32,775
You ain't answering me.

858
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:37,496
I'm asking again.

859
01:27:40,548 --> 01:27:45,011
- Did you or did you not?
- I'm not gonna answer.

860
01:27:45,096 --> 01:27:49,048
It's a sick question
and I won't answer it.

861
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:51,767
I'm not answering anything.
I'm leaving.

862
01:27:51,856 --> 01:27:57,149
I'm not staying in this
nuthouse. I feel sorry for you.

863
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:01,073
Try a little more fuckin'
and less eatin'.

864
01:28:01,162 --> 01:28:04,449
If you don't have
troubles upstairs,

865
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:07,212
you won't pick on me.

866
01:28:07,296 --> 01:28:08,625
You're crackin' up!

867
01:28:10,342 --> 01:28:12,086
Fuckin' screwball.

868
01:28:55,825 --> 01:28:59,242
- Where were you?
- My sister's.

869
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:03,164
- Where'd you go after that?
- The movies.

870
01:29:03,252 --> 01:29:04,581
What'd you see?

871
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,585
Father of the Bride.

872
01:29:14,477 --> 01:29:19,474
Why didn't you tell me
about the Copa?

873
01:29:19,568 --> 01:29:22,689
- Tell you what?
- You know.

874
01:29:22,781 --> 01:29:25,736
How come you didn't tell me?

875
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,696
- Why didn't you?
- What are you talking about?

876
01:29:31,502 --> 01:29:36,332
- Did you fuck my brother?
- Get off me, you fat pig!

877
01:29:36,426 --> 01:29:37,375
Did you?

878
01:29:37,552 --> 01:29:38,632
No!

879
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:47,354
- Open the door.
- Get away!

880
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:50,527
- I want to talk.
- You're sick.

881
01:29:50,613 --> 01:29:52,986
Why'd you fuck Joey?

882
01:29:53,075 --> 01:29:55,115
- Get away!
- Open up.

883
01:29:55,203 --> 01:29:56,484
No.

884
01:29:59,292 --> 01:30:02,497
- Why'd you do it?
- I didn't do...

885
01:30:02,589 --> 01:30:06,505
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you fuck them?

886
01:30:06,595 --> 01:30:10,594
I didn't do anything!
What should I say?

887
01:30:10,684 --> 01:30:14,386
- Who'd you fuck?
- Tommy, Salvy, your brother!

888
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:18,066
I sucked Joey's cock!
What should I say?

889
01:30:18,153 --> 01:30:21,820
- You sucked his cock?
- And everybody else's, too.

890
01:30:21,909 --> 01:30:24,579
You're a fat pig, selfish fool!

891
01:30:26,624 --> 01:30:27,953
- Get...
- Fuck you!

892
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,089
His cock's bigger than yours!

893
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:42,979
Where are you going? Where are
you going, you sick animal?

894
01:30:43,065 --> 01:30:48,406
Where are you going?
Get off me, you piece of shit!

895
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,525
You put your hands
in that plate, I'll stab you.

896
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,448
Keep your hands out!

897
01:30:56,543 --> 01:30:59,165
- All right.
- I'd like some peace.

898
01:30:59,255 --> 01:31:02,756
I have to eat like you? Oh, God!

899
01:31:02,843 --> 01:31:07,389
- What's the matter with you?
- You fucked my wife!

900
01:31:09,854 --> 01:31:12,939
Jake, get off him! Get off him!

901
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,063
I'll kill you!

902
01:31:20,202 --> 01:31:21,531
Call the police!

903
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,244
I'll fuckin' kill you!

904
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,584
Get out!

905
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,837
Vickie, don't leave, honey.
Please.

906
01:32:57,594 --> 01:33:01,261
I'm a bum without you
and the kids.

907
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:21,039
Just...

908
01:33:41,604 --> 01:33:41,688
La Motta is losing the title

909
01:33:41,688 --> 01:33:44,262
La Motta is losing the title

910
01:33:44,358 --> 01:33:46,933
he won from the gallant Cerdan.

911
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:49,236
After Cerdan's
tragic plane crash,

912
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:52,825
Dauthuille vowed
to return the title to France.

913
01:33:52,913 --> 01:33:58,206
He has to last this 15th round
to be crowned champion.

914
01:33:59,088 --> 01:34:01,461
La Motta's taking
terrible punishment.

915
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:06,428
A left and right to the head.
Another right to the jaw.

916
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:10,183
La Motta's been playing possum!
Dauthuille's hurt!

917
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:14,686
A right to the body,
a right to the head!

918
01:34:14,778 --> 01:34:18,777
Dauthuille's reeling around
the ring! The tide has turned!

919
01:34:22,539 --> 01:34:26,455
He wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

920
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:31,174
The referee comes over
and starts the count.

921
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:35,889
He's trying to get up.
Seven... he won't make it.

922
01:34:35,975 --> 01:34:38,812
- Nine... ten!
- You're out!

923
01:34:38,896 --> 01:34:42,599
It's all over! He's knocked out!

924
01:34:42,694 --> 01:34:45,446
La Motta, with 13 seconds left,

925
01:34:45,531 --> 01:34:49,578
made one of the most remarkable
comebacks in history!

926
01:34:56,005 --> 01:34:59,541
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

927
01:35:05,352 --> 01:35:07,476
He's your brother.

928
01:35:15,909 --> 01:35:20,454
I'll dial him.
Just tell him you're sorry.

929
01:35:34,477 --> 01:35:35,557
OK.

930
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:50,159
- Can I ask some questions?
- Not now.

931
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,003
- I've been waiting.
- Excuse me.

932
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,624
- I've got a great angle.
- Don't bother me.

933
01:35:56,718 --> 01:35:59,424
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

934
01:35:59,514 --> 01:36:00,843
I asked nice.

935
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,231
Hello?

936
01:36:15,078 --> 01:36:16,158
Hello?

937
01:36:19,919 --> 01:36:24,547
Salvy, this ain't funny
any more. Is it you?

938
01:36:24,634 --> 01:36:28,847
I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.

939
01:36:28,932 --> 01:36:34,439
Your mother sucks big fuckin'
elephant dicks. You got that?

940
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:25,834
Fight of the year.

941
01:37:25,919 --> 01:37:30,334
When the bartender asks what
you'll have, give this answer:

942
01:37:30,426 --> 01:37:31,506
Blue Ribbon.

943
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,937
La Motta's punches
explain themselves.

944
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:42,565
They've fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

945
01:37:42,652 --> 01:37:47,197
It's been a blazing bout for
the middleweight championship.

946
01:37:47,284 --> 01:37:49,858
Great action by La Motta.

947
01:37:50,872 --> 01:37:52,617
That's the last shot.

948
01:37:54,878 --> 01:37:59,376
Round number 13, the hard-luck
number. There's the buzzer.

949
01:37:59,468 --> 01:38:01,260
You know the boys.

950
01:38:12,028 --> 01:38:14,485
Robinson's hurting La Motta now.

951
01:38:17,661 --> 01:38:20,201
La Motta's holding on.

952
01:38:21,333 --> 01:38:26,923
That's the most damaging
punching you've seen recently.

953
01:38:27,008 --> 01:38:30,130
Come on! Come on!

954
01:38:30,221 --> 01:38:35,349
Come on! Come on!
What are you staring for?

955
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:39,057
Robinson punched
with a fare-thee-well.

956
01:38:39,235 --> 01:38:42,985
- Rocked La Motta to his heels.
- Come on!

957
01:39:49,337 --> 01:39:53,383
These are withering shots.
How can he survive them?

958
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:56,426
No man can endure this.

959
01:39:56,514 --> 01:40:01,309
The fight is stopped
on a signal to Frankie Sikora.

960
01:40:02,565 --> 01:40:06,896
Row after row, the crowd
is standing and cheering.

961
01:40:06,988 --> 01:40:10,073
He cannonaded La Motta
into a death defeat.

962
01:40:12,796 --> 01:40:17,377
When I say that,
I mean Jake wouldn't quit.

963
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:24,472
Hey, Ray. I never went down.
You never got me down, Ray.

964
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:32,028
You hear me? You never
got me down. Yeah. See? Look.

965
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:37,706
In the 13th round,
the championship changed hands.

966
01:40:38,626 --> 01:40:42,411
There you see it,
a champion defeated.

967
01:40:43,716 --> 01:40:49,140
Now we wait for the announcement
from Eddie Flint.

968
01:40:51,019 --> 01:40:54,721
Then we'll join
with the radio audience...

969
01:40:54,816 --> 01:40:57,984
and have an interview
with Ray Robinson.

970
01:40:58,071 --> 01:41:00,479
We're waiting for the time.

971
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:05,997
It's being handed between the
commissioner and Eddie Flint.

972
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:08,836
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

973
01:41:09,003 --> 01:41:14,712
The winner by a technical
knockout in the 13th round,

974
01:41:14,803 --> 01:41:18,885
the new world's middleweight
champion - Sugar Ray Robinson!

975
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:29,720
Why won't you fight Wednesday?

976
01:41:29,804 --> 01:41:33,139
Boxing's over for me.
I'm through.

977
01:41:34,728 --> 01:41:39,309
I'm tired of worrying
about weight all the time.

978
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:43,187
You realise there's more
to life. I'm grateful.

979
01:41:43,282 --> 01:41:47,234
I got a nice house
and three great kids.

980
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,573
I have a wonderful,
beautiful wife.

981
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:52,622
What more could I ask for?

982
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:54,422
- What's your name?
- Bob.

983
01:41:54,507 --> 01:41:58,922
Bob, take a picture. Let him
take a picture, honey. Smile.

984
01:42:03,145 --> 01:42:06,729
Thanks, Bob.
Take one of all of us.

985
01:42:11,282 --> 01:42:13,774
Everybody smile. Smile.

986
01:42:15,037 --> 01:42:19,167
Vickie, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

987
01:42:19,252 --> 01:42:24,628
I think it's great. He's home
with us all the time now.

988
01:42:24,718 --> 01:42:28,552
- It's good.
- You know... You through?

989
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:32,058
- Yeah.
- I just bought a club.

990
01:42:32,145 --> 01:42:35,432
It's a bar.
Guess what it's called.

991
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,270
- I don't know.
- Guess.

992
01:42:50,798 --> 01:42:52,672
Shut up. Enough.

993
01:42:54,678 --> 01:42:55,877
Thank you.

994
01:43:01,647 --> 01:43:06,110
That's what a microphone
on a sexy girl sounds like.

995
01:43:12,955 --> 01:43:14,154
Yeah, it's hot.

996
01:43:16,419 --> 01:43:21,380
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight.

997
01:43:24,306 --> 01:43:25,505
OK, honey.

998
01:43:27,102 --> 01:43:29,012
Thank you.

999
01:43:29,188 --> 01:43:31,063
Isn't that somethin'?

1000
01:43:36,657 --> 01:43:41,785
You'd bring her home to dad...
if he was a degenerate.

1001
01:43:43,542 --> 01:43:45,251
Did I say that?

1002
01:43:46,964 --> 01:43:53,052
It's great to be standing here
before you wonderful people.

1003
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:55,299
It's great to be standing.

1004
01:43:58,272 --> 01:44:02,022
If you believe that,
you're full of shit.

1005
01:44:06,117 --> 01:44:10,496
Me and my wife Vickie's
gettin' married...

1006
01:44:12,543 --> 01:44:17,373
Is she here? Vickie?
She's not here.

1007
01:44:17,467 --> 01:44:23,009
Me and my wife's celebratin' our
eleventh wedding anniversary.

1008
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,352
Thank you. Thank you.

1009
01:44:26,438 --> 01:44:30,604
Reminds me of two friends.
One's married, one's single.

1010
01:44:30,694 --> 01:44:36,617
Married guy says to the single
guy, "Look at me. Look at you.

1011
01:44:36,703 --> 01:44:39,374
"Look at me. Look at you."

1012
01:44:42,754 --> 01:44:44,546
Let me continue.

1013
01:44:44,631 --> 01:44:48,501
"Every night,
my wife brings me a drink.

1014
01:44:48,596 --> 01:44:51,514
"She gives me a bath, a rubdown,

1015
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,852
"and makes
passionate love to me.

1016
01:44:54,938 --> 01:44:59,353
"Then she makes me dinner.
You should try that."

1017
01:44:59,445 --> 01:45:03,065
Other guy says,
"Sounds great! When's she home?"

1018
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:13,497
I'm no Olivier, but if
he fought Sugar Ray, he'd say

1019
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:18,005
The thing ain't the ring,
it's the play

1020
01:45:19,516 --> 01:45:23,931
So give me a stage
where this bull can rage

1021
01:45:24,022 --> 01:45:28,022
Though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite

1022
01:45:30,031 --> 01:45:34,861
That's entertainment!

1023
01:46:04,999 --> 01:46:08,452
You were great!
Glad Sugar Ray wasn't here.

1024
01:46:08,546 --> 01:46:10,788
He told that joke last week.

1025
01:46:10,882 --> 01:46:14,467
He repeats himself.
Gettin' senile.

1026
01:46:14,554 --> 01:46:18,139
Meet state's attorney Bronson.

1027
01:46:18,226 --> 01:46:21,145
- How are you?
- And his wife.

1028
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:25,313
You shouldn't be here. Shakedown
payments are next week.

1029
01:46:27,031 --> 01:46:30,781
- Sense of humour. Good.
- That's a joke, right?

1030
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:35,083
- Only you know if it's a joke.
- Just kidding.

1031
01:46:35,168 --> 01:46:38,087
We'll talk later.
This your wife?

1032
01:46:38,172 --> 01:46:39,287
Mrs Bronson.

1033
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:42,005
- Very pretty lady. Charmed.
- Thank you.

1034
01:46:42,095 --> 01:46:46,177
Nice guy. You can take
a joke, can't you?

1035
01:46:48,354 --> 01:46:51,439
- That's all right.
- Don't worry about it.

1036
01:46:55,364 --> 01:46:57,607
Give them another drink.

1037
01:46:58,869 --> 01:47:01,492
- Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1038
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:06,080
- Why isn't she here?
- What's it to you? You're bums.

1039
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:12,677
Especially the state's attorney.
He comes here a lot. Watch him.

1040
01:47:12,764 --> 01:47:15,886
He knows I'm kidding. Watch him.

1041
01:47:16,937 --> 01:47:19,145
- What's the problem?
- No problem.

1042
01:47:19,232 --> 01:47:22,400
I just asked for some ID.

1043
01:47:22,487 --> 01:47:24,362
- How old?
- Twenty-one.

1044
01:47:24,448 --> 01:47:29,575
Twenty-one? Can you prove it?
Prove it to me.

1045
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,302
She can drink here any time.
How old are you?

1046
01:47:40,388 --> 01:47:43,059
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove it?

1047
01:47:43,225 --> 01:47:44,175
Yeah.

1048
01:47:44,352 --> 01:47:46,096
- Prove it.
- Come here.

1049
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:03,749
- She's twenty-one, too?
- She had to convince me.

1050
01:48:19,153 --> 01:48:21,360
- Jake.
- Watch it.

1051
01:48:21,448 --> 01:48:24,119
- Your wife's outside.
- A little louder.

1052
01:48:45,316 --> 01:48:46,645
Good work, Jake.

1053
01:49:28,225 --> 01:49:33,055
It was a busy night.
Everything all right?

1054
01:49:33,148 --> 01:49:36,353
- I'm leaving you.
- What else is new?

1055
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:40,112
I mean it.
I have everything worked out.

1056
01:49:43,455 --> 01:49:45,532
- Move over.
- Why?

1057
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:47,036
- Open up.
- No.

1058
01:49:47,127 --> 01:49:50,379
- Come on.
- No. We're getting a divorce.

1059
01:49:50,465 --> 01:49:53,171
- I'm getting custody.
- Let me in.

1060
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:57,261
I already made up my mind.
I'm leaving. That's it.

1061
01:49:58,853 --> 01:50:01,974
If you show up,
I'll call the cops.

1062
01:50:02,066 --> 01:50:03,940
Don't act that way.

1063
01:50:30,885 --> 01:50:32,925
Come on, champ. Wake up.

1064
01:50:37,311 --> 01:50:41,097
- What's up?
- We're from the DA.

1065
01:50:41,192 --> 01:50:43,944
- I know.
- They want to talk.

1066
01:50:44,029 --> 01:50:47,696
- All look the same.
- They want to talk.

1067
01:50:47,784 --> 01:50:50,906
- About what?
- I'm supposed to bring you in.

1068
01:50:50,997 --> 01:50:52,825
For what?

1069
01:50:58,425 --> 01:51:01,926
You recognise this girl?
She been in the club?

1070
01:51:05,978 --> 01:51:08,221
- It's the same girl?
- Yeah.

1071
01:51:09,984 --> 01:51:14,114
- I don't know her.
- You introduced her to men.

1072
01:51:14,198 --> 01:51:19,028
I introduce a lot of people.
I introduced her to men?

1073
01:51:19,122 --> 01:51:24,285
I introduced him to men,
but I don't say nothin'.

1074
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:29,293
- She's 14. Put on your shoes.
- She's how old?

1075
01:51:29,387 --> 01:51:31,464
- Fourteen.
- Let me see.

1076
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:41,102
Let me ask you somethin'.

1077
01:51:41,196 --> 01:51:45,112
You're tellin' me
that girl looks 14?

1078
01:51:45,202 --> 01:51:46,946
- Fourteen.
- Man to man.

1079
01:51:47,038 --> 01:51:50,040
Come on. We got to go.

1080
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:52,166
- Downtown?
- That's right.

1081
01:51:53,297 --> 01:51:54,958
Because of her?

1082
01:51:57,887 --> 01:52:00,213
- Drunk?
- I'm out on bail.

1083
01:52:00,307 --> 01:52:03,891
- I gotta pick up somethin'.
- Kids are sleepin'.

1084
01:52:03,979 --> 01:52:09,142
- I won't bother them.
- All right. No noise.

1085
01:52:09,237 --> 01:52:10,648
- What?
- No noise.

1086
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:12,198
Just one thing.

1087
01:52:15,287 --> 01:52:17,530
- What's wrong?
- I need $10,000.

1088
01:52:17,624 --> 01:52:20,330
With $10,000,
they'll drop the case.

1089
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,173
- They don't have one.
- You kiddin'?

1090
01:52:23,257 --> 01:52:25,465
Ever see a girl testify?

1091
01:52:28,014 --> 01:52:31,016
You saw the paper - a vice rap.

1092
01:52:31,102 --> 01:52:34,722
- What you doin' to the belt?
- Who cares?

1093
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:38,483
- Can't your friends help?
- What friends?

1094
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:43,069
You're gonna wake
my kids up! Stop it!

1095
01:52:51,423 --> 01:52:54,509
- Can't you stack dishes right?
- Get out!

1096
01:52:54,803 --> 01:52:59,764
Didn't you want to sell me
the championship belt?

1097
01:52:59,852 --> 01:53:02,855
- These are the jewels.
- Where's the belt?

1098
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:09,112
The belt of a champion is very
rare. You should've come sooner.

1099
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:13,033
- The belt...
- Give me 2,000 for them.

1100
01:53:13,122 --> 01:53:15,614
- Fifteen-hundred.
- Not 2,000?

1101
01:53:15,709 --> 01:53:19,376
Fifteen-hundred, top.
I'm sorry. I'd lose.

1102
01:53:19,464 --> 01:53:22,965
Don't tell me
you won't make a profit.

1103
01:53:23,053 --> 01:53:26,257
You're lying.
I could get twice that.

1104
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:35,812
I can't raise the 10,000.
I tried a lot of places.

1105
01:53:35,905 --> 01:53:40,735
What am I gonna do?
What can I do?

1106
01:53:42,289 --> 01:53:44,199
Let 'em do it.

1107
01:53:47,927 --> 01:53:50,715
You ain't a champ.
You're nothin'.

1108
01:53:50,806 --> 01:53:54,010
Right. This is where it's at.

1109
01:53:57,023 --> 01:54:00,061
You pull your load here, boy!

1110
01:54:02,531 --> 01:54:06,447
- You ain't the champion here.
- Fuck you!

1111
01:54:06,537 --> 01:54:10,703
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch! You hear me?

1112
01:54:10,793 --> 01:54:13,712
- Hold onto him!
- I got him.

1113
01:54:13,798 --> 01:54:18,509
See it? Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1114
01:54:18,596 --> 01:54:22,430
Go on! Live in it! Understand?

1115
01:54:22,519 --> 01:54:27,017
Your mother's cunt,
you cocksucker!

1116
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:33,777
You like that
son of a bitch? Sick fuck!

1117
01:54:33,952 --> 01:54:38,616
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck your mother!

1118
01:55:16,139 --> 01:55:19,556
Dummy. Dummy. Dummy.

1119
01:55:25,945 --> 01:55:28,069
Why? Why? Why?

1120
01:55:47,518 --> 01:55:49,096
You motherfuck!

1121
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:02,736
Why?

1122
01:56:06,629 --> 01:56:12,966
Why'd you do it? You're
so stupid, so fuckin' stupid.

1123
01:56:13,055 --> 01:56:15,013
Stupid!

1124
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:19,598
They call me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1125
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:24,270
Why do they treat me
like this? I'm not bad.

1126
01:56:24,363 --> 01:56:26,107
I'm not that bad.

1127
01:56:31,332 --> 01:56:33,076
I'm not that guy.

1128
01:56:36,548 --> 01:56:37,877
Not that guy.

1129
01:56:47,188 --> 01:56:49,182
Guy catches his wife cheating.

1130
01:56:49,275 --> 01:56:52,443
Wife says, "Now the whole
neighbourhood will know."

1131
01:56:55,797 --> 01:56:58,467
Thanks for laughing.
Spread it around.

1132
01:56:59,969 --> 01:57:05,476
The first night I was here,
I said, "Where's the toilet?"

1133
01:57:05,561 --> 01:57:09,940
- He said, "You're in it."
- Let's go.

1134
01:57:10,026 --> 01:57:13,562
- I'm tryin' to do my routine.
- Up yours.

1135
01:57:13,656 --> 01:57:17,157
You're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1136
01:57:17,245 --> 01:57:19,238
- Funny.
- Fuck you.

1137
01:57:20,583 --> 01:57:22,623
And the horse you rode in on.

1138
01:57:24,255 --> 01:57:26,414
And the cavalry behind you.

1139
01:57:27,343 --> 01:57:30,380
- Funny man.
- That's why I'm here.

1140
01:57:33,477 --> 01:57:36,562
Give him another drink.
Piss in it.

1141
01:57:38,943 --> 01:57:45,613
I'm gonna introduce a woman
who's made a world-wide tour.

1142
01:57:45,703 --> 01:57:51,376
Give her a warm welcome.
You can do it, you junkies.

1143
01:57:52,838 --> 01:57:55,876
Her name is Emma 48's!

1144
01:58:15,997 --> 01:58:18,999
Taxi. Taxi!

1145
01:58:29,183 --> 01:58:30,346
Honey...

1146
01:58:31,812 --> 01:58:35,942
I got to take care
of a couple things.

1147
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,854
- See you later?
- Yeah.

1148
01:58:39,406 --> 01:58:42,824
I'll be home later. Be careful.

1149
01:58:56,706 --> 01:58:59,828
Joe. What are you doin'?

1150
01:59:00,003 --> 01:59:01,747
Joey.

1151
01:59:04,802 --> 01:59:07,009
Why don't you turn around?

1152
01:59:19,657 --> 01:59:22,575
Joey, turn around. Come on.

1153
01:59:34,929 --> 01:59:38,513
Come here. Come on.
What are you doin'?

1154
01:59:38,601 --> 01:59:45,603
Why are you so angry?
Be friends. You're my brother.

1155
01:59:45,695 --> 01:59:48,187
- Your brother?
- Yeah, you bum.

1156
01:59:48,282 --> 01:59:52,067
Give me a break.
Kiss me. Come on.

1157
01:59:52,162 --> 01:59:57,456
- Let me call my wife and kids.
- You gonna forgive and forget?

1158
01:59:57,545 --> 02:00:00,631
It's a long time ago. Forget it.

1159
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,005
Come on.

1160
02:00:08,186 --> 02:00:10,393
You're my brother. Come on.

1161
02:00:12,567 --> 02:00:14,311
Give me a kiss.

1162
02:00:19,995 --> 02:00:22,072
- How's everything?
- Good.

1163
02:00:22,165 --> 02:00:26,496
Everything all right?
Your family? Come here.

1164
02:00:30,969 --> 02:00:33,841
Come on, don't do this here.

1165
02:00:35,476 --> 02:00:37,600
We'll get together soon.

1166
02:00:37,687 --> 02:00:39,431
- Call me?
- I will.

1167
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:44,185
- Don't forget.
- I'll call you.

1168
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,526
All right.

1169
02:00:57,337 --> 02:01:02,760
...legitimately, and nobody can
take that away from me. Nobody.

1170
02:01:03,387 --> 02:01:05,511
Some people aren't that lucky...

1171
02:01:08,228 --> 02:01:11,681
like the one Brando played
in "On the Waterfront,"

1172
02:01:11,774 --> 02:01:14,183
a down-and-outer.

1173
02:01:14,278 --> 02:01:18,859
Remember the scene in the car
with his brother Charlie?

1174
02:01:18,952 --> 02:01:20,696
It went like this.

1175
02:01:24,334 --> 02:01:27,586
It wasn't him, Charlie.
It was you.

1176
02:01:27,673 --> 02:01:32,301
Remember that night you said,
"Kid, this ain't your night.

1177
02:01:32,388 --> 02:01:35,841
"We're going for
the price on Wilson.

1178
02:01:35,935 --> 02:01:39,471
"This ain't your night."
My night.

1179
02:01:39,565 --> 02:01:43,565
I could've taken Wilson apart.
So what happens?

1180
02:01:43,654 --> 02:01:45,778
He gets a title shot.

1181
02:01:45,866 --> 02:01:49,402
I get a one-way ticket
to Palookaville.

1182
02:01:49,496 --> 02:01:52,582
I was no good after that,
Charlie.

1183
02:01:52,667 --> 02:01:56,418
You reach a peak,
then it's downhill.

1184
02:01:58,384 --> 02:02:02,847
It was you, Charlie.
You was my brother.

1185
02:02:02,932 --> 02:02:08,475
You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1186
02:02:08,566 --> 02:02:11,734
You should've
taken care of me...

1187
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:16,235
instead of making me take dives
for short-end money.

1188
02:02:16,327 --> 02:02:20,457
You don't understand.
I could've had class.

1189
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:22,618
I could've been a contender.

1190
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:27,375
I could've been somebody
instead of a bum.

1191
02:02:27,468 --> 02:02:30,589
Let's face it.
It was you, Charlie.

1192
02:02:32,392 --> 02:02:35,430
- It was you.
- How you doin', champ?

1193
02:02:35,522 --> 02:02:36,553
Everything OK?

1194
02:02:36,732 --> 02:02:38,143
Yeah.

1195
02:02:38,317 --> 02:02:39,896
- Ready?
- Five minutes.

1196
02:02:39,987 --> 02:02:41,316
- OK.
- Need anything?

1197
02:02:41,405 --> 02:02:42,781
- No.
- You sure?

1198
02:02:44,451 --> 02:02:45,697
I'm sure.

1199
02:02:50,085 --> 02:02:53,586
- Lot of people out there?
- It's crowded.

1200
02:03:13,786 --> 02:03:15,530
Go get 'em, champ.

1201
02:03:25,303 --> 02:03:27,973
I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

1202
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:37,986
I'm the boss. I'm the boss.
