NARRATOR: Nine-ball is rotation pool.

2
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,347
The balls are pocketed
in numbered order.

3
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,727
The only ball that means anything,
that wins it, is the nine.

4
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,481
Now the player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row,

5
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,817
blow the nine and lose.

6
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,739
On the other hand, the player can
get the nine in on the break,

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,825
if the balls spread right, and win.

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,872
Which is to say that
luck plays a part in nine-ball.

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,584
But for some players,

10
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,630
luck itself is an art.

lt's like, "Which twin has got the Toni?"

177
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,427
Maybe they both got the Toni.

178
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,512
Maybe Toni's a guy.
Maybe Toni's bald, you know.

179
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,097
How you gonna know that?
lt's very complicated.

180
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,849
Plus, it's too much money.

181
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,728
-Jesus, you're crazy!
-No, l'm not. Just common sense.

182
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,109
How about l take you guys out
for dinner tonight?

183
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,449
-You should ask Vincent.
-No, you should ask Vincent.

184
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,913
(WHlSTLlNG)

185
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,836
You know the last time
Julian lost for me?

186
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,130
lt's just a game, man.
Some balls and a stick.

187
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,966
Balls and a stick. This is Vincent.

188
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,969
Nine-ball's not that tough.
Do you wanna know what's tough?

189
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,805
-Stocker.
-Stocker?

190
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,139
lt's his video game.

191
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,558
-Vincent's the best at it.
-l'm the best at it.

192
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,560
l mean, in pool, you just got these balls,

193
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,397
you're just sitting there,
you take your time, you set up the shot.

194
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,731
But Stocker!

195
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,192
Can you make any money
playing Stocker?

196
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,946
l'll tell you what l can do off Stocker.

197
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,572
Ten years from now,
l can get into West Point.

198
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,449
That's what l can do with Stocker.

199
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,993
lt's all coming down
to video game reflexes.

200
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,247
l mean, uh, computerized tanks,
Star Wars, you know, that movie.

201
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,250
l mean, 1 0 years from now,
a guy who scores heavy on Stocker

202
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,168
is a shoo-in at the Point.

203
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,046
You are beautiful.

204
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,633
-You don't believe me?
-What do you mean, money?

205
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,053
-Money, money.
-Really?

206
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,013
Hey, look.

207
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,683
lf you got an area of excellence,

208
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,853
if you're good at something,
you're the best at something, anything,

209
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,189
then rich can be arranged.
l mean, rich can come fairly easy.

210
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,108
-Really?
-Yeah.

211
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,445
You have some other area of excellence
besides this Stocker?

212
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,780
Nine-ball, right?

213
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,200
-You're some piece of work.
-l'm some piece of work.

214
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,618
You're also a natural character.

215
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,496
l've been telling her that.
You know, l got natural character.

216
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,874
No, that's not what l said, kid.

217
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,295
l said you are a natural character.
You're an incredible flake.

218
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,089
But that's a gift.

219
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,343
See, guys spend half their lives
trying to invent something like that.

220
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,263
You walk into a poolroom
with that "go, go, go,"

221
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,141
the guys will be killing each other
trying to get to you.

222
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,186
You got that.

223
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,272
But l'll tell you something, kiddo.

224
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,650
You couldn't find big time
if you had a road map.

225
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,404
Pool excellence is not
about excellent pool.

226
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,531
lt's about becoming something.

227
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,533
Yeah?

228
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,744
Yeah.

229
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,956
-Like what?
-A student.

230
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,751
You got to be a student
of human moves.

231
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,504
See, all the greats that l know of,
to a man,

232
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,214
were students of human moves.

233
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,384
-Students of human moves?
-Yeah.

234
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,095
That's my area of excellence.

235
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,139
Oh, yeah?

236
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,350
Yeah.

237
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,814
What?

238
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,107
Okay.

239
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,777
That guy at the end of the bar
in a black suit.

240
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,114
He's been hustling that broad
for half an hour.

241
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,409
He's going to throw in the towel
in 30 seconds for a buck.

242
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,955
You got it, starting now.

243
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,749
Ten seconds.

244
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,626
What do you mean,
rich could be arranged?

245
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,253
Ssh!

246
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,883
...25, 26, 27, 28. Guess the news.

247
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,718
You lose.

248
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,598
Ah. And l just missed it
by a couple of seconds.

249
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,101
Want to up the bet?

250
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,061
Yeah.

251
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,649
Check for the meal says
l leave with her in two minutes.

252
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,943
(LAUGHlNG)

253
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,031
Okay, ready, go. Now! l'm counting.

254
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,955
l know this is going to sound crazy,
but would you come outside

255
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,082
and take a look at my car?

256
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,960
-Your car?
-Yeah.

257
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,172
Come on.

258
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,928
Hold it here for a second, will you?

259
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,023
Human moves, kid.
You study the watch.

260
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,943
But l study you. You get the check.

261
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,237
Excuse me.

262
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,867
Cab's on me.

263
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,752
-What's with the car, Eddie?
-Nothing. l'll drive you home.

264
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:06,173
l just hated to see you sitting alone
at the bar, Diane. lt's just depressing.

265
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,051
-Did you see Jimmy in there?
-Yeah, l saw him.

266
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,762
Does he still got his nighttime job?

267
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,973
He wanted to talk to you
about something, but you were busy.

268
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,058
Oh, yeah.

269
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,355
Where'd you go?

270
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,774
What?

271
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,276
You certainly weren't here.

272
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,446
Yeah? Where was l?

273
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,451
God, the earth moved.

274
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,037
Didn't it move for you a little bit?

275
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,872
That was a train.

276
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,168
No, it was you.

277
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,716
But it certainly wasn't San Juan.

278
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,388
You want to talk earth moving,
you got to talk San Juan.

279
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,932
Remember that water bed we had?

280
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,643
Gosh!

281
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,188
Sometimes l think about that week,

282
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,899
you know, Eddie,
when l'm behind the bar, l think...

283
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,152
l think,
"l'm gonna go and get me a water bed

284
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,614
"and not tell anybody,
just make it a surprise.

285
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,453
"Get some rum and pineapple juice."

286
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,376
You couldn't tell me one word
l just said, could you?

287
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,712
No, l couldn't.

288
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,923
Water bed, rum, pineapple juice.

289
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,175
lt's not that. lt's...

290
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,138
l don't know. That kid today.

291
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,267
lt was like watching home movies.

292
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,021
lt just made me wonder.

293
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,982
Wonder what?

294
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,903
Made me wonder about San Juan.

295
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,836
What did you mean last night
about money and all that stuff?

296
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,216
Come here,
l want to show you something.

297
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,446
-So this is liquor money, huh?
-Some.

298
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,866
l invest. Do you know what l invest in?

299
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
Excellence.

300
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,332
-You think Vincent's that good?
-Well...

301
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,876
He's got the eye, he's got the stroke.

302
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,212
He's got the flake.
He's got that down cold.

303
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,465
But can he flake on and flake off,
l don't know.

304
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,384
See, l don't know whether that
can be taught. That's not clear.

305
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,180
He's got to learn how to be himself,
but on purpose.

306
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,017
-Yeah.
-You like to travel?

307
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,478
-Yeah.
-You like hotels?

308
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,772
Yeah, sure, they're okay.

309
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,483
Are you gonna help me with him?

310
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,652
(CHUCKLES)

311
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,074
That lady you picked up
last night in the bar.

312
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,952
You knew her from before, right?

313
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,163
Hmm?

314
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,957
And the guy?

315
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,084
You probably had his schedule
down cold, right?

316
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,629
Maybe he works around here
somewhere, he's your brother-in-law?

317
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,464
You're a hard broad.

318
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,092
What does Vincent see in you?

319
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,429
Vincent's the best.
That's what he sees in me.

320
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,766
We've just been together
for about a year.

321
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,018
And Vincent made us
get a place together.

322
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,938
You know how we met?

323
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,236
My old boyfriend last year got busted
breaking into Vincent's parents' house.

324
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,197
We met at the police station,
me and Vincent.

325
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,032
You were bailing him out,
your boyfriend?

326
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,494
No. No, no, no. l got busted, too.
l was driving the car.

327
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,955
See this?

328
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,461
-Vincent's mother's.
-He gave that to you?

329
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,713
No.

330
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,883
From the robbery.

331
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,302
Vince says his mother
has one just like it.

332
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,139
He's sweet.

333
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,851
Vincent's real sweet.

334
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,157
VlNCENT: Do you want something
for your kid to bounce in?

335
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,409
What country comes to mind when
you think of bouncing? What animal?

336
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,493
MAN: A kangaroo.

337
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
VlNCENT: Comes from where?
WOMAN: Australia.

338
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,706
That's right, this is Australian-made.
l'll be perfectly honest with you.

339
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,793
lt's twice as expensive, but it's three
times better than Taiwan over here.

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,004
l'll throw you $1 5 off on this.

341
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,257
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah, we'll do it.

342
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,635
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Randall.
lt's a good buy.

343
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,387
Hey, Lou, could you write them up?
Australia, $1 5 off, all right?

344
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,472
Thank you.

345
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,682
lf you ever need anything,

You're not the only stakehorse around,
you know that?

00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,273
See you in Atlantic City, okay?

517
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,650
Don't look too hard for me, okay?

518
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,157
Hey, we are going to the Bahamas.
l just didn't say when.

519
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,326
l appreciate hearing about it
from that dope fiend.

520

l didn't want to tell anybody.

521
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,621
What if l get on the road
and the kid doesn't work out?

-lt makes me feel great, Eddie, great.

That guy sucks, man, and so do you!

All right, l am wrong! Uh-huh.

But let me do it my way.

Do it any way you want to do it, Eddie.

527
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,425
What l want is, l just want to go
on the road, l don't wanna tell anybody!

528
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,552
Fine! lf you got anything that
you need at my apartment,

everything, entry fees, everything.

For that, l get 60% of everything
you win, all bets.

534
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,158
l lay the bets,
so l also take the losses if you lose.

535
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,285
So for that l get 60% of what you win.

536
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,163
60%? What are you, a slumlord?

537

Honey, you find a newcomer
with a better deal than that,

538

you come to me, we talk.

Don't worry. l'm not going to lose often.

Aw. lt doesn't make any sense.
lt goes in streaks.

straight up on paper, but...

-Grady Seasons?
-But that doesn't mean anything.

in the first day of the tournament,

552
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,953
and hang around in the practice room
for a couple of days,

553
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,872
and make more money than the guy
who won the tournament.

554
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,248
Do you hear that?

555
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,750

When l was younger, it was booze.

Somehow it was more human.

-Booze, huh?
-Booze, yeah.

588
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
Wine goes back to the Bible.

589

about amphetamines.

you know, them old golfers and stuff,

594
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,992

you can still lick the jar, right?

When l saw the lay of the table,
l knew that it was gonna be the five.
