1
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,248
I don't really pray...

2
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,459
...but if you could just
help me out here...

3
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,002
...I promise...

4
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:33,757
105.

5
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:35,759
105?

6
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,177
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,888
Run a bath, call the doctor.

8
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,182
Get her into the bath.

9
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:44,852
Dr. Carter, 655...

10
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:46,228
He won 't be there.

11
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:48,313
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

12
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:52,067
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

13
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,319
Susan. Susie.

14
00:00:55,779 --> 00:00:57,072
Mommy says get up now.

15
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,074
- Cold.
- I know.

16
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:01,243
Hang on.

17
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:04,621
Cold!

18
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,499
It just feels cold because
you're so hot.

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,002
Susan, stay with me. Susan.

20
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,171
Susan!

21
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:17,259
Has she been disoriented?
Confused?

22
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,512
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

23
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:25,559
Are you cold?

24
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:29,813
Okay, swing it.

25
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,774
- Move it, people.
- Is room 2 clear?

26
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,276
Yes, it's clear.

27
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,028
Get her pressure.

28
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,322
Let's give her O2. Ten liters.

29
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,616
Tap her right away.

30
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,042
How's her breathing?

31
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:14,566
No pulse or rhythm.

32
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,569
Are you God?

33
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,364
No.

34
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:22,157
My name is Seth.

35
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:23,951
Where are we going?

36
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,244
Home.

37
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,288
Can Mommy come?

38
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,998
No.

39
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,676
She won't understand.

40
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,344
She will...

41
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,179
...someday.

42
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,189
Can I ask you something?

43
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:55,858
Yes.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,402
What did you like best?

45
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:01,655
Pajamas.

46
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,683
She definitely knew what she liked.

47
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:33,937
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

48
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:35,647
Pajamas.

49
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:38,942
Excellent choice. What else?

50
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,112
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

51
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:45,741
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

52
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,328
...but it made her turn
and look at him in such a way...

53
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,456
And they...?

54
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,166
Yes.

55
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,002
It was a good day.

56
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,796
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

57
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,340
Touch?

58
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,342
No.

59
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,427
Yes, you do.

60
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,765
Occasionally. Yes.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,851
Touch.

62
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,997
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

63
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:36,959
Blue eyes.
He's never going to leave her.

64
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,963
20 minutes. 20 minutes. Everything
in this damn city is 20 minutes.

65
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,798
It's never 20 minutes.

66
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:08,365
My ass on a stool all day.
She always gets the good chair.

67
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,246
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

68
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,261
$ 20,000 at 21 percent.

69
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:32,472
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

70
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:33,891
Ah, shit!

71
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:38,562
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

72
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,772
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

73
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,540
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

74
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,126
They all want wings.

75
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:03,295
I never know what to say.

76
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:05,172
Tell them the truth.

77
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,466
Angels aren't human.

78
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,551
We were never human.

79
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:13,889
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

80
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,807
Tell her the truth.

81
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,809
I told her.

82
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:21,396
How did she take it?

83
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,568
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

84
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,889
On the 101 through
downtown L.A., no delays...

85
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:58,934
Shit! Jesus!

86
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,171
What do we got?

87
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:13,759
50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

88
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:17,137
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

89
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:18,889
He's hypertensive.

90
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,432
This diagonal looks tight.

91
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,726
Who cathed him?

92
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,645
Rosenberg.

93
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:28,273
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

94
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,746
He's pretty out of it.

95
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,750
The doctor's here.

96
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:12,609
We're just going to cool to 32 today.

97
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,445
Sucker.

98
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:19,950
Jimi.

99
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,092
Vein.

100
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,567
Kid started walking.

101
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,528
Three unassisted steps.

102
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,698
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

103
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,368
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

104
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,499
Retrograde on.

105
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,922
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

106
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,882
Down to half flow,
here's your volume.

107
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,550
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

108
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:19,760
Let's come off.

109
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,428
We're coming down.

110
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:24,848
We're clamped and off bypass.

111
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,082
Oh, shit.

112
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,835
What are you missing?

113
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:53,919
Sponge.

114
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,421
Bummer.

115
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,679
Got it!

116
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,186
Thank you, everybody.

117
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,355
Presbyterian's on line 2.

118
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,107
His rhythm will be irritable.

119
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:22,364
- She's getting good, huh?
- Yeah, she's getting that attitude too.

120
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,366
Getting an attitude?

121
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:28,161
Shit! V-tac!

122
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:29,872
Christ! Paddles!

123
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,124
Kill the music. Get her back.

124
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,459
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

125
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:36,920
Dr. Rice.

126
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:44,761
Clear!

127
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,431
- No pressure.
- You give him lidocaine?

128
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:48,432
100's gone in.

129
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,017
Buzz him again at 300.

130
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,021
- Still nothing.
- Start compression.

131
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:55,147
Kill the alarm!

132
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:01,653
Hold up. It's not working.

133
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,323
Got to open him.
How long to go back on?

134
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,033
lt'll take me 10 minutes.

135
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:07,910
Come on! Nothing.

136
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:09,161
Knife.

137
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:19,755
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

138
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,381
Ready.

139
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:22,841
Hit it.

140
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,512
Go to 30.

141
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,263
Hit it.

142
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,848
No response.

143
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,309
Tom, I got to get back on bypass here.

144
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,311
Almost there.
Give me 7 more minutes.

145
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:35,521
Come on.

146
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:39,650
Don't do this.

147
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:42,569
He's going.

148
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:44,321
He's not going anywhere.

149
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,458
Come on, don't do this!

150
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,504
Damn it, come on!

151
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,715
Tom!

152
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,969
Come on!

153
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,285
Mrs. Balford?

154
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,787
Where's the doctor?

155
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:37,499
- I'm the doctor.
- I'm sorry.

156
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,836
I operated on your husband.

157
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,754
How is he?

158
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,341
He didn't survive.

159
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:50,762
What?

160
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:55,851
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

161
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:59,354
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia
and we couldn't resuscitate him.

162
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,358
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

163
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,071
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:16,121
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

165
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,415
What did you say?

166
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:22,628
What?

167
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:25,255
Oh, my God!

168
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,788
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

169
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,581
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,419
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

171
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,797
A graft occlusion? What?

172
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,468
It was textbook. It was textbook.

173
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,643
I'm so sorry.

174
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,189
The room got so big.
I was so small.

175
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,483
How did I get so small?

176
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,610
I should've gone back on.

177
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,321
I should've massaged longer.

178
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:34,700
I should've gone back on.
Massaged longer. I lost it.

179
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,662
I lost it.

180
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:59,516
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

181
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:01,894
You're looking at me.

182
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,732
No, not by me, and not
by the dying or the delirious.

183
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:09,151
Have you ever been seen...

184
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:11,862
...like you were a man?

185
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,367
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

186
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,578
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

187
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:23,874
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

188
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,003
That doctor in the operating room...

189
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,715
...she looked right at me.

190
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,676
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

191
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,387
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

192
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,598
And if I want her to?

193
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,184
Why do you want her to?

194
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:45,437
To help her.

195
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,356
Open it!

196
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,024
Open it now!

197
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,901
Everybody down!

198
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,780
Do it! Do it!

199
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,865
Shit! Just give him the money.

200
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,743
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

201
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,912
I should have gone to Ralphs.

202
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,957
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

203
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,126
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

204
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,962
I'll never see my grandkids again.

205
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,257
What am I doing?

206
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:15,926
Just be cool. Be cool.

207
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,682
Be cool, man.

208
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:23,559
Be cool.

209
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:29,982
Holy shit!

210
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:33,944
They don't need to see us.

211
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:54,798
You're early.

212
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,041
What's going on?

213
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,084
Ferris was looking for you.

214
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,932
Don't I have a mitral valve to do?

215
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,767
They canceled it.

216
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,393
Who canceled it?

217
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,478
Sheffield.

218
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,188
Why are you telling me?

219
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:52,397
He was busy.

220
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:53,941
He was chickenshit.

221
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,109
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

222
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,945
You're sick.
You can't operate.

223
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,864
They've rescheduled for Monday.
An elective valve, no big deal.

224
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:04,451
It is unprofessional, and it
embarrasses me in front of my staff.

225
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:10,791
I saw the chart on Balford.

226
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:14,127
I'm on the committee.
It's on review.

227
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,797
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

228
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,423
Then what's the problem?

229
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:23,971
I don't know.

230
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,182
You put up a terrific fight.

231
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,229
We fight for people's lives, right?

232
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,568
Don't you ever wonder who
it is we're fighting with?

233
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,740
So I'm crazy and chemically imbalanced.

234
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,576
You're tired.

235
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:48,245
You have moments.

236
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,290
Why didn't you call me?

237
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,086
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

238
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,297
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

239
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:01,717
You're good.

240
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,302
You know it.

241
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,888
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

242
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,515
Doctor?

243
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,148
I'll see you.

244
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:44,301
"As I walk along the stony shore
of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."

245
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:47,221
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea..."

246
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,140
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

247
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,267
...probably cannot be said.

248
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:56,647
For all that we say is the far-off
remembering of the intuition..."

249
00:20:57,105 --> 00:21:00,692
"...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once..."

250
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:07,449
"Commencing search."
Searching my soul.

251
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:10,619
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

252
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,121
She's been looking
at me for half an hour.

253
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,790
Maybe if I just hang here...

254
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:19,127
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense..."

255
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:23,048
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

256
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:27,344
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man..."

257
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,974
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

258
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:36,687
...as you knew the river
would flow again after it was frozen.

259
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,691
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

260
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,571
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason."

261
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,443
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

262
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:25,861
What happened yesterday?

263
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:27,821
They had a golf tournament.

264
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,573
Who knows with these people?

265
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,033
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

266
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,911
The "G" is soft, like "messenger."

267
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,623
What's on your lip?

268
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,375
What? Am I slobbering here?

269
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,133
- Where did you get that?
- What am I, a prisoner?

270
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:51,220
You want to get well, or
you want Ben & Jerry's?

271
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:53,013
This operation is a big deal.

272
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,182
Continue to eat like this...

273
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,435
...and you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

274
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:02,773
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

275
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:06,485
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

276
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:09,696
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

277
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:14,284
I ain't "the procedure." My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

278
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,538
Hello, hello, hello...

279
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,044
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

280
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,674
Do you know the Muffin Man,
the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

281
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:39,263
Hi, Anne.

282
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:40,973
What are you doing here?

283
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,267
I was on my way up to x-ray...

284
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,727
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

285
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:47,896
...hide.

286
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:49,940
From what?

287
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,694
I should've gone into pediatrics.

288
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:54,987
Oh, no.

289
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:57,990
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

290
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,160
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

291
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,998
Poor little guy.

292
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,212
He never stops crying.

293
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,673
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

294
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,303
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

295
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,555
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

296
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:24,766
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

297
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,102
May I?

298
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,408
Did you do an ultrasound?

299
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,494
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

300
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,538
Okay, baby.

301
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,503
So what are you hiding from?

302
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,340
My patient's wife.

303
00:26:57,341 --> 00:27:00,344
She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

304
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:03,305
...and that I have every confidence...

305
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,307
...and I don't.

306
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:08,644
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

307
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,313
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

308
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,359
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

309
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:17,986
And if it isn't...

310
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,863
...what do I do with that?

311
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,465
Excuse me.

312
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:29,892
Are you a visitor?

313
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:32,603
Yes.

314
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,440
Visiting hours have been
over since 8:00.

315
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,942
Why do they have that?

316
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,360
What?

317
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:41,737
Hours.

318
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,407
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

319
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,745
Who are you visiting?
Mr. Messinger?

320
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,205
Right now?

321
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:56,418
You.

322
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,049
I don't need a visitor.

323
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,467
You're not ill?

324
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:04,676
No.

325
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,722
I'm one of the doctors here.

326
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,060
Are you in despair?

327
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,525
I lost a patient.

328
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:22,236
You did everything you could?

329
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:26,323
I was holding his heart
in my hand when he died.

330
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,159
Then he wasn't alone.

331
00:29:29,576 --> 00:29:30,786
Yes, he was.

332
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:32,162
People die.

333
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:33,497
Not on my table.

334
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:36,250
People die when their bodies give out.

335
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,045
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

336
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:42,172
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

337
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:43,966
I wanted him to live.

338
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,634
He is living.

339
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,220
Just not the way you think.

340
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,938
I don't believe in that.

341
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:01,316
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

342
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:04,611
How did you know my name?

343
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,200
What's yours?

344
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:13,412
Seth.

345
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,672
You better get out of here, Seth...

346
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,633
...or security's going to think
you're a psych patient.

347
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,208
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

348
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:43,669
Suction.

349
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:49,758
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

350
00:31:55,681 --> 00:32:00,227
No dying now, Mr. Messinger. Not until
you give me Seth 's phone number.

351
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:06,400
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

352
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,804
Those eyes.

353
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,515
The way he looked...

354
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,101
...right down into me.

355
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,479
Seth.

356
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:48,275
What kind of name is Seth?

357
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,481
I thought you'd be here.

358
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,942
Salty.

359
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,904
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

360
00:34:58,447 --> 00:34:59,698
You okay?

361
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:08,540
You might want to return this.

362
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:16,423
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring."

363
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,967
How did you know that...?

364
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:21,386
What? I didn't give you this book.

365
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:26,517
You didn't?

366
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,268
Where'd you get it?

367
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,492
Hi. I'm a physician, and I think
a patient left that in my office.

368
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,745
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

369
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:48,956
I can tell you when.

370
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:52,125
All right, give me 5 minutes.

371
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,492
Hello, Maggie.

372
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:29,705
It's nice to see you again.

373
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,832
It's weird to see you again.

374
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,917
Weird is nice.

375
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:38,922
You like Hemingway?

376
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,259
Yeah, I'm starting to.

377
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,057
May I?

378
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,897
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

379
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,399
...and their faint metallic taste...

380
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:00,277
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

381
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:03,405
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

382
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,574
...I lost the empty feeling...

383
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:07,910
...and began to be happy."

384
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:11,246
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

385
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:14,082
I like that.

386
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:18,712
Do you come here a lot?

387
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:20,672
I live here.

388
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:23,717
What do you do?

389
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:24,968
Read.

390
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:27,513
No, I mean, your work.

391
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,224
I'm a messenger.

392
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,478
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

393
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:37,356
No, I'm a messenger of God.

394
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:40,692
Got a message for me?

395
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:43,278
I already gave it to you.

396
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:47,574
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

397
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,995
You've definitely been beeped.

398
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,375
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

399
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,502
The operation went really well.

400
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,213
- It was a good day.
- It was.

401
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,799
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

402
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:07,135
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

403
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,179
I have a feeling.

404
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,723
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

405
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:13,725
Close your eyes.

406
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,105
It's just for a moment.

407
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,835
What am I doing?

408
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,298
You're touching me.

409
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,717
Touch.

410
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:49,595
How do you know?

411
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:52,806
Because I feel it.

412
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:03,233
You should trust that.

413
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:05,777
You don't trust it enough.

414
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,667
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

415
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,169
I don't care.

416
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:24,671
What do you want to do?

417
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,007
Anything.

418
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,137
What's that like?

419
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,600
What's it taste like?

420
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,727
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

421
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,940
Well, it tastes like...

422
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:27,192
...a pear.

423
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:30,112
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

424
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,448
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

425
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,081
Sweet...

426
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:42,791
...juicy.

427
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,254
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

428
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:50,507
...like sugary sand that
dissolves in your mouth.

429
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:55,596
How's that?

430
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,309
It's perfect.

431
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:22,289
The first time I looked in a microscope,
I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

432
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,586
Okay, let me have your hand.

433
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:29,379
What for?

434
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,423
We'll take a look at your blood.

435
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:34,218
Not a possibility.

436
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,764
Men.

437
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:41,350
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

438
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,519
...is 9 times higher than a man's.

439
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,073
Take a look at that.

440
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:01,870
That's bright.

441
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,377
That's me.

442
00:42:09,378 --> 00:42:10,629
All those cells.

443
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,799
That's all you are.

444
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:18,387
That and all the space in between.

445
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,723
If this is all you are...

446
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:23,725
...these cells...

447
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,895
...then when they die, that's the end.

448
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:29,982
I don't know. I think so.

449
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,735
How do you explain it?

450
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:34,987
What?

451
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:38,866
The enduring myth of Heaven.

452
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:46,331
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

453
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:47,708
But you didn't?

454
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,209
No.

455
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:58,594
Because something happened
in my O.R. and I got...

456
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:02,598
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

457
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:06,602
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...

458
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:09,938
Does that sound crazy?

459
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:11,773
No.

460
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,861
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

461
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:17,863
...and I couldn't fix him.

462
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,824
That's not supposed to happen.

463
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:24,995
And I...

464
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:26,914
You cried.

465
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,251
Yeah.

466
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:36,465
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

467
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:39,676
I mean, what happens physically?

468
00:43:43,472 --> 00:43:47,059
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

469
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:50,604
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

470
00:43:50,854 --> 00:43:52,856
Why? Why do they overact?

471
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:57,027
I don't know.

472
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,782
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

473
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:03,909
...your body just can't contain it.

474
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,830
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

475
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,832
Your body weeps.

476
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:17,130
I have to go.

477
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,424
I got to go. Stay right here.

478
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:21,260
Don't go anywhere.

479
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,262
Stay right there.

480
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:45,784
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

481
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,911
It's because the tube is blocked.

482
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:01,466
How you feeling?

483
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,677
Ready to hit the waves.

484
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:06,555
I'm afraid your bodysurfing
days are over.

485
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:13,187
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

486
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:16,231
That is my wife.

487
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,576
Check his vitals every 15.

488
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,553
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

489
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:56,563
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

490
00:45:58,232 --> 00:45:59,691
Not yet.

491
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,097
Where have you been?

492
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:33,141
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

493
00:46:33,475 --> 00:46:34,768
Dinner?

494
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,395
With who?

495
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:43,193
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

496
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:45,028
Did you pack my backpack?

497
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,239
What else?

498
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:49,783
We talked...

499
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:52,202
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

500
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:53,745
Why did you pack my backpack?

501
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:55,956
Earl, what are you doing?

502
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:58,876
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

503
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,460
...maybe do a little hiking.

504
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:03,088
What?

505
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,885
God. Is it...?

506
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:09,428
Maggie, it's just a tick.

507
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,806
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

508
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:14,975
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

509
00:47:15,225 --> 00:47:18,353
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

510
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:19,479
I don't have any.

511
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,982
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

512
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:23,734
How about some olive oil?

513
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,071
Which kind? Jalapeño or rosemary?

514
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,365
Rosemary.

515
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:35,287
So what did you and your friend...
What did you say his name was?

516
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:38,040
Seth.

517
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,167
What did you two talk about?

518
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:43,086
Dying.

519
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:49,218
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

520
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:52,513
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

521
00:48:01,188 --> 00:48:02,523
Can we talk for a minute?

522
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:04,107
We'll talk while camping.

523
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:06,735
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

524
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,695
We need some time together.

525
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,491
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

526
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:15,953
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

527
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:17,746
Doing what?

528
00:48:18,205 --> 00:48:19,998
Just being here.

529
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:23,126
I'll get the trail map.

530
00:48:23,669 --> 00:48:24,753
No, I mean it.

531
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:26,547
Nothing but us.

532
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:31,301
What do I do?

533
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,137
Just look at me.

534
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:47,359
You can't do it.

535
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:50,988
You can't do it.

536
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:53,866
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

537
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:11,466
That old black magic called...

538
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:13,468
...love.

539
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,679
Thank you very much.

540
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:19,600
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

541
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:23,562
You want to watch anything?

542
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:28,650
Me neither.

543
00:49:37,117 --> 00:49:39,036
How do you know when I'm here?

544
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,043
I know.

545
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:49,838
Jeez, you look good.

546
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:54,384
I forgot how good everybody looked.

547
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:59,097
30 years of silence.

548
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:03,101
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

549
00:50:03,352 --> 00:50:04,686
It'll make it easier.

550
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:08,398
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

551
00:50:08,649 --> 00:50:10,234
You might want to check your orders...

552
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:12,528
...because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

553
00:50:12,778 --> 00:50:13,987
You're not dying.

554
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:17,741
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

555
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:20,285
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

556
00:50:21,787 --> 00:50:23,288
Unless...

557
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,460
Could it be...

558
00:50:29,545 --> 00:50:30,754
...the doctor?

559
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:33,757
Sure.

560
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:35,551
The doctor.

561
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,136
She's pretty.

562
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:39,972
A little flat-chested...

563
00:50:40,222 --> 00:50:41,974
...but all you need's a handful.

564
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:44,351
- Who are you?
- This is good.

565
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,937
This is what they call...

566
00:50:47,187 --> 00:50:49,356
..."serendipitous."

567
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:52,985
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

568
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:54,486
Thank you.

569
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,245
You ready to deal?

570
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:06,540
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

571
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:17,593
How's the French toast?

572
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:19,303
Fabulous.

573
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:20,679
Set me up.

574
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,273
Guess I should introduce myself.

575
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:33,525
Come on, give me your hand.

576
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:37,613
Put it in mine. There you go.

577
00:51:37,905 --> 00:51:39,907
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

578
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:41,575
No, that's too much.

579
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:44,077
There you go. Good grip.

580
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:46,580
Nathaniel Messinger.

581
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,624
Glutton, hedonist...

582
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:53,212
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

583
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,759
I don't believe you.

584
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:00,302
You want proof?

585
00:52:00,802 --> 00:52:02,638
You hang out at a library.

586
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:04,556
You can speak every language.

587
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,850
You travel with the speed of thought...

588
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,019
...and you're reading
my mind right now.

589
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,437
Stop that.

590
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:11,939
You're doing it.

591
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,817
It's impossible.

592
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:18,320
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

593
00:52:20,864 --> 00:52:22,032
How?

594
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:24,034
- You choose.
- Choose?

595
00:52:24,284 --> 00:52:25,911
To fall to Earth.

596
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:29,122
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

597
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:31,416
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

598
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:34,503
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

599
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:40,801
You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

600
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:42,803
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

601
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:46,598
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

602
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:50,853
...so it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

603
00:52:53,564 --> 00:52:54,898
Human.

604
00:52:56,817 --> 00:52:57,985
Listen, kid:

605
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:02,531
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

606
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:04,908
You think He didn't give it to us too?

607
00:53:05,242 --> 00:53:06,118
Which gift?

608
00:53:06,827 --> 00:53:08,453
Free will, brother.

609
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,206
Free will.

610
00:53:38,817 --> 00:53:40,402
Couldn't get a job.

611
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,821
No past, no training.

612
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:44,573
No I.D.

613
00:53:45,115 --> 00:53:48,744
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

614
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:50,412
A skyscraper.

615
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:53,290
And I thought, "I could do that."

616
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,459
You see, these people down here...

617
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:58,754
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

618
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:02,216
That makes me uniquely qualified.

619
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,553
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

620
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,096
And I like what I do.

621
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:09,515
I'm good at it.

622
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:14,353
These things'll kill you.

623
00:54:16,146 --> 00:54:17,439
Are there others?

624
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,775
Others like you?

625
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,652
Yeah, they're out there.

626
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:26,031
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

627
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:30,160
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

628
00:54:30,828 --> 00:54:32,412
Then why'd you do it?

629
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,507
My daughter, Ruth...

630
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:45,592
...her stupid husband, Frank...

631
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:47,678
...and my grandkids.

632
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:50,347
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

633
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:56,353
And this is my wife, Teresa.

634
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,024
Did you...

635
00:55:01,984 --> 00:55:03,610
...tell her who you were?

636
00:55:04,653 --> 00:55:07,239
I started to try once or twice.

637
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:09,575
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

638
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:11,118
Do what?

639
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:13,495
It's too much for them.

640
00:55:14,788 --> 00:55:17,166
People don't believe in us anymore.

641
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:28,969
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

642
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:31,430
And sunset, yes.

643
00:55:32,764 --> 00:55:34,266
Take me there?

644
00:55:45,694 --> 00:55:47,321
Can you hear it?

645
00:55:58,165 --> 00:55:59,208
No.

646
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:19,770
I can't hear that!

647
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,397
But you can't feel this!

648
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:24,233
Nathan!

649
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:32,699
You have to go back.

650
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,077
Not until I catch the big wave.

651
00:56:39,414 --> 00:56:40,582
Wait.

652
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,376
Wait.

653
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,086
Wait for what?

654
00:56:45,254 --> 00:56:46,380
Swim!

655
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:24,168
And then you just...

656
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:25,752
...fall.

657
00:57:26,336 --> 00:57:27,880
- Fall?
- Dive.

658
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:30,966
You make up your mind to do it...

659
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,468
...and you do it.

660
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:36,263
And when you wake up, you're...?

661
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,307
Yes.

662
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:42,478
To smell the air.

663
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,438
Taste water.

664
00:57:44,688 --> 00:57:45,772
Read a newspaper.

665
00:57:46,023 --> 00:57:46,773
To lie.

666
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:48,525
Through your teeth.

667
00:57:49,193 --> 00:57:50,152
To feed the dog.

668
00:57:53,113 --> 00:57:54,448
Touch her hair.

669
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,535
What are you waiting for?

670
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,668
There is so much beauty up here.

671
00:58:08,504 --> 00:58:09,796
Yes.

672
00:58:34,905 --> 00:58:36,114
Here you are again.

673
00:58:37,699 --> 00:58:39,535
We'll release your friend
Messinger tomorrow.

674
00:58:39,827 --> 00:58:40,994
That's good.

675
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:44,623
His family's having a kind
of a welcome-home party.

676
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:49,211
Will you be going?

677
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:51,213
Will you be going?

678
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:55,008
This is Earl.

679
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,593
He told me.

680
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:58,929
What else does he tell you?

681
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:03,141
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

682
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:06,937
Sometimes I think Earl's the
only one who understands me.

683
00:59:07,187 --> 00:59:08,272
What about your boyfriend?

684
00:59:08,856 --> 00:59:10,190
Do you love him?

685
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:14,528
Love? I don't know.

686
00:59:14,778 --> 00:59:16,113
What does that mean?

687
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,116
I was hoping you could tell me.

688
00:59:20,075 --> 00:59:22,202
It's a word...

689
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:25,122
...that describes a chemical react...

690
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:29,376
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

691
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:34,673
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

692
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:36,466
...and I don't even know you.

693
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:38,760
What do you want to know?

694
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:42,514
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time.

695
00:59:42,764 --> 00:59:45,017
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

696
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:47,269
Are you married?

697
00:59:47,978 --> 00:59:49,021
No.

698
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:50,898
Are you homeless?

699
00:59:52,483 --> 00:59:53,567
No.

700
00:59:54,693 --> 00:59:55,861
Are you a drummer?

701
01:00:00,782 --> 01:00:02,784
Why don't you ever touch me?

702
01:00:06,747 --> 01:00:08,457
I don't want to hurt you.

703
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,461
You won't hurt me.

704
01:00:37,486 --> 01:00:38,862
Did you feel that?

705
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,670
If I could make you understand...

706
01:00:57,881 --> 01:00:59,383
I understand.

707
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:05,806
I'll see you around.

708
01:02:10,746 --> 01:02:11,955
Hey, Doc!

709
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,461
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

710
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:19,880
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

711
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,465
You look great.

712
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,218
Is this heaven?

713
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:25,886
Look at this.

714
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:32,267
Come on, let's meet some people.

715
01:02:32,684 --> 01:02:34,144
You got an appetite?

716
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:40,150
Have a beer, Seth.

717
01:02:40,984 --> 01:02:41,985
Where you from?

718
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:44,196
Up.

719
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:46,615
North. Uh, Canada.

720
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:55,332
Listen. Can you hear?

721
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,751
I'm growing.

722
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,378
Smile, Hannah.

723
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:10,514
How long have you known Seth?

724
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:13,809
Not very long.

725
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,604
But I feel like I've known him forever.

726
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:20,691
Honey, that hurts.

727
01:03:22,818 --> 01:03:24,528
You're just like Grandpa.

728
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:27,781
Come on.

729
01:03:28,448 --> 01:03:29,783
Let's see if the cookies are done.

730
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:31,326
Come on, Seth.

731
01:03:31,577 --> 01:03:33,787
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

732
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:40,460
How did you two meet?

733
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,965
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

734
01:03:45,924 --> 01:03:47,176
I thought he was a messenger.

735
01:03:48,343 --> 01:03:50,387
Yeah, he's one of those...

736
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:51,597
..."hyphenates."

737
01:03:52,514 --> 01:03:53,849
I'll be right back.

738
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:35,182
Here, can you cut this up?

739
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:45,567
So in what province in Canada
were you born?

740
01:04:46,568 --> 01:04:48,362
I wasn't born in Canada.

741
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,284
What are your parents' names?

742
01:05:02,835 --> 01:05:04,169
No parents.

743
01:05:11,552 --> 01:05:14,429
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

744
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:16,181
I'm not a construction worker.

745
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:18,684
Very pale hands. Let me see.

746
01:05:22,646 --> 01:05:25,023
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

747
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:26,191
No.

748
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:29,319
What's your last name?

749
01:05:29,611 --> 01:05:30,737
You know my last name.

750
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:32,197
I don't.

751
01:05:34,491 --> 01:05:35,534
Plate.

752
01:05:36,368 --> 01:05:37,411
Seth Plate?

753
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:45,711
I cut you.

754
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:49,047
I cut you.

755
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,262
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

756
01:05:56,263 --> 01:05:57,598
Not the way you do.

757
01:05:59,183 --> 01:06:00,726
The way I do?
What does that mean?

758
01:06:01,018 --> 01:06:04,605
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

759
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:06,231
The way...

760
01:06:07,524 --> 01:06:08,484
...a human does.

761
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:12,446
I have no sense of touch.

762
01:06:13,864 --> 01:06:14,656
You feel that?

763
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:16,658
Don't be frightened.

764
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:18,202
You freak!

765
01:06:18,494 --> 01:06:19,620
You liar!

766
01:06:20,204 --> 01:06:21,955
Who... What are you?

767
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:23,874
I came to take Mr. Balford...

768
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,793
...and I saw you.

769
01:06:28,837 --> 01:06:31,089
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

770
01:06:31,924 --> 01:06:33,759
How you fought for him.

771
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:37,763
And you looked right at me...

772
01:06:38,388 --> 01:06:40,098
...like I was a man.

773
01:06:40,682 --> 01:06:43,560
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

774
01:06:43,852 --> 01:06:47,773
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

775
01:06:48,273 --> 01:06:49,775
I was there in the stairwell...

776
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:52,736
...when you cried for your patient.

777
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:55,447
And I touched you. Remember?

778
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:59,117
Why are you doing this?

779
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:02,246
Because I'm in love with you.

780
01:07:10,295 --> 01:07:11,839
I don't believe you.

781
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:14,216
Do you feel that?

782
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:18,554
You don't want to believe me.

783
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:21,181
I cannot conceive of it!

784
01:07:23,225 --> 01:07:24,643
Just get out!

785
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:27,146
Get out!

786
01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:18,405
Doctor?

787
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:22,534
Doctor?

788
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:10,624
Hello?

789
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:18,715
Seth?

790
01:09:22,427 --> 01:09:23,679
Are you here?

791
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:22,362
I want to see you.

792
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,700
Let me see you.

793
01:10:56,396 --> 01:10:57,856
Just stay.

794
01:11:00,776 --> 01:11:02,986
Just stay until I fall asleep.

795
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,942
Oh, yes!

796
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:46,196
Thank you.

797
01:12:07,759 --> 01:12:09,553
The baby can't sleep.

798
01:12:10,387 --> 01:12:12,014
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

799
01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:14,683
I don't know. Let's check him out.

800
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:25,527
Choanal atresia.

801
01:12:25,777 --> 01:12:28,113
There's hardly any air getting through.

802
01:12:28,864 --> 01:12:29,781
How did you know?

803
01:12:31,867 --> 01:12:33,285
I just...

804
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:36,079
...knew!

805
01:13:02,064 --> 01:13:03,106
Maggie?

806
01:13:03,774 --> 01:13:04,775
Yeah.

807
01:13:05,067 --> 01:13:06,193
Are you alone?

808
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:08,070
Yeah.

809
01:13:12,157 --> 01:13:14,535
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

810
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:16,161
Think so?

811
01:13:17,621 --> 01:13:18,747
I couldn't have done it better.

812
01:13:20,207 --> 01:13:21,708
Well, that's a compliment.

813
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:38,308
What are you doing?

814
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:40,102
I'm spending time with you.

815
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,398
Will you marry me?

816
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,317
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

817
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:49,111
Get married on the Nevada side...

818
01:13:49,444 --> 01:13:51,488
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

819
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:56,243
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

820
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,162
What do you want me to say?

821
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:00,831
We belong together.

822
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:03,083
We're the same species.

823
01:14:09,673 --> 01:14:13,135
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

824
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,512
...the proverbial heart.

825
01:14:18,807 --> 01:14:20,309
Please be my wife.

826
01:14:24,855 --> 01:14:26,023
Just think about it.

827
01:14:41,747 --> 01:14:42,915
Breathe in.

828
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:47,961
Breathe in.

829
01:15:01,517 --> 01:15:02,601
I'm good.

830
01:15:10,526 --> 01:15:15,197
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

831
01:15:18,826 --> 01:15:19,868
He didn't tell you.

832
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:25,082
Tell me what?

833
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:27,042
Maybe you should ask him.

834
01:15:27,793 --> 01:15:29,503
No, I'm asking you.

835
01:15:41,014 --> 01:15:42,766
Seth knows no fear...

836
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,351
...no pain...

837
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,186
...no hunger.

838
01:15:47,354 --> 01:15:49,731
He hears music in the sunrise.

839
01:15:52,067 --> 01:15:53,861
But he'd give it all up.

840
01:15:54,153 --> 01:15:55,654
He loves you that much.

841
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:00,117
I don't understand.

842
01:16:03,203 --> 01:16:04,705
He can fall.

843
01:16:05,372 --> 01:16:08,041
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

844
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:11,378
He can give up eternity and become...

845
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,838
...one of us.

846
01:16:13,672 --> 01:16:15,007
It's up to you.

847
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:18,552
How do you know this?

848
01:16:24,475 --> 01:16:26,059
Because I did it.

849
01:17:03,597 --> 01:17:05,516
Seth, I need to talk to you.

850
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:11,897
Seth, please.

851
01:17:14,983 --> 01:17:16,026
Please be here.

852
01:17:18,403 --> 01:17:20,322
God, help me through this.

853
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:33,335
You are so beautiful.

854
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,840
You'll always be that way.

855
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:43,262
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

856
01:17:43,554 --> 01:17:44,930
...and get married.

857
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:49,226
He knows me.

858
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:52,604
He knows the demands of my work.

859
01:17:53,188 --> 01:17:54,940
You don't love him.

860
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,734
He and I are the same.

861
01:18:00,362 --> 01:18:01,780
And I want that.

862
01:18:05,534 --> 01:18:09,371
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

863
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:12,749
But you can feel me.

864
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,710
You felt me.

865
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:18,172
I want to say goodbye.

866
01:18:20,465 --> 01:18:22,217
I don't want to see you again.

867
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,127
Hey, buddy.

868
01:22:26,128 --> 01:22:27,588
You can't be in here.

869
01:22:28,463 --> 01:22:29,464
Do you see me?

870
01:22:31,383 --> 01:22:32,926
Do you see me?

871
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:34,761
Can you see me?

872
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:36,221
We can see you.

873
01:22:38,182 --> 01:22:39,600
Is this blood?

874
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:40,767
This is blood!

875
01:22:41,185 --> 01:22:42,352
Is it red?

876
01:22:42,895 --> 01:22:43,812
Red?

877
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:45,481
Is it red?

878
01:22:46,899 --> 01:22:48,358
Color.

879
01:22:48,692 --> 01:22:50,736
What color were the drugs you took?

880
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,405
Better get your butt out of here.

881
01:22:54,323 --> 01:22:55,449
You got somewhere to go?

882
01:22:59,411 --> 01:23:00,621
Maggie.

883
01:23:12,841 --> 01:23:15,677
Down and down and down I go

884
01:23:15,969 --> 01:23:18,180
Round and round and round I go

885
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:20,557
Round and spin

886
01:23:20,849 --> 01:23:22,976
Loving the spin I'm in

887
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:25,813
Loving that old black magic...

888
01:23:26,104 --> 01:23:28,065
...called love

889
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:31,443
Love!

890
01:23:32,778 --> 01:23:33,946
Hi!

891
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:47,251
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

892
01:24:31,378 --> 01:24:32,546
Can I help you, sir?

893
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:35,591
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

894
01:24:36,633 --> 01:24:37,468
Breath!

895
01:24:40,971 --> 01:24:42,014
Maggie Rice.

896
01:24:43,765 --> 01:24:44,933
Are you a patient?

897
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,935
No. I just need to find her, please.

898
01:24:47,352 --> 01:24:49,688
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

899
01:24:50,355 --> 01:24:51,565
Do you know where she is?

900
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:54,276
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

901
01:24:57,654 --> 01:24:59,281
You have this computer...

902
01:25:00,657 --> 01:25:02,701
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

903
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,789
Where's Maggie?

904
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,838
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

905
01:25:17,007 --> 01:25:18,258
What happened to you?

906
01:25:18,592 --> 01:25:19,551
Sorry.

907
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,136
It's okay.

908
01:25:24,264 --> 01:25:25,474
I fell.

909
01:25:25,974 --> 01:25:28,644
Evidently. Off a train?

910
01:25:29,603 --> 01:25:31,188
I fell in love.

911
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:40,155
Please help me find her.

912
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:48,705
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

913
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:50,040
Wait!

914
01:26:21,655 --> 01:26:22,865
Cassiel.

915
01:26:23,824 --> 01:26:25,033
Are you there?

916
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:34,960
Hello.

917
01:27:30,182 --> 01:27:31,433
Where you headed?

918
01:27:33,143 --> 01:27:34,019
Tahoe!

919
01:27:35,437 --> 01:27:36,647
Reno!

920
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,065
Tahoe!

921
01:27:38,732 --> 01:27:40,067
I'm going to Reno.

922
01:27:40,442 --> 01:27:41,860
I'm going to Tahoe.

923
01:27:42,402 --> 01:27:44,822
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

924
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:03,627
Am I too late?

925
01:30:05,379 --> 01:30:06,380
Too late?

926
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:08,423
Jordan?

927
01:30:12,845 --> 01:30:14,596
I couldn't marry Jordan.

928
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:19,601
I'm in love with you.

929
01:30:27,776 --> 01:30:29,111
What happened?

930
01:30:32,573 --> 01:30:33,949
Free will.

931
01:30:49,131 --> 01:30:50,632
I feel you.

932
01:32:09,711 --> 01:32:11,171
Do you feel that?

933
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:12,631
Yes.

934
01:32:14,633 --> 01:32:15,926
And that?

935
01:32:20,013 --> 01:32:22,808
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

936
01:32:23,851 --> 01:32:25,185
I can't.

937
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:28,188
Try.

938
01:32:30,065 --> 01:32:31,233
Warm.

939
01:32:36,697 --> 01:32:37,990
Aching.

940
01:32:56,133 --> 01:32:57,384
It's okay.

941
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:01,388
We fit together.

942
01:33:01,763 --> 01:33:02,764
I know.

943
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:05,601
We were made to fit together.

944
01:33:27,164 --> 01:33:30,167
I always asked the dying what
they liked best about living.

945
01:33:32,878 --> 01:33:34,630
Wrote it down in my book.

946
01:33:37,174 --> 01:33:38,342
This is it.

947
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,678
This is what I like best.

948
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:44,807
You haven't even started yet.

949
01:33:45,599 --> 01:33:48,018
We have our whole lives together.

950
01:33:48,352 --> 01:33:49,561
You and me.

951
01:33:49,812 --> 01:33:51,772
Mr. and Mrs. Plate.

952
01:39:28,317 --> 01:39:30,277
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

953
01:39:30,986 --> 01:39:32,488
- Stay.
- I should get help.

954
01:39:32,738 --> 01:39:34,781
Don't go. The driver went.

955
01:39:35,032 --> 01:39:36,325
Please stay.

956
01:39:36,658 --> 01:39:38,535
Please stay with me.

957
01:39:39,328 --> 01:39:40,787
I'm scared.

958
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:47,002
I screwed up.

959
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,297
I wanted to show you everything.

960
01:39:50,756 --> 01:39:51,965
You will.

961
01:39:55,636 --> 01:39:58,347
You came all this way.

962
01:39:59,723 --> 01:40:01,225
I'm sorry.

963
01:40:02,309 --> 01:40:04,269
God, no, Maggie!

964
01:40:05,354 --> 01:40:06,688
To touch you...

965
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:08,148
...and to feel you.

966
01:40:09,066 --> 01:40:12,069
To be able to hold your hand right now.

967
01:40:12,486 --> 01:40:13,654
You know what that means?

968
01:40:13,904 --> 01:40:16,573
Do you know how much I love you?

969
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:23,205
Keep looking at me, okay?

970
01:40:24,832 --> 01:40:26,583
Look right in my eyes.

971
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,254
Someone's out there.

972
01:40:32,256 --> 01:40:35,676
Don't look at them.
Please don't you look at them!

973
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:37,469
Is this what happens?

974
01:40:44,601 --> 01:40:45,602
Yes.

975
01:40:52,109 --> 01:40:53,819
This is what happens.

976
01:40:58,282 --> 01:41:00,075
I'm not afraid.

977
01:41:04,163 --> 01:41:05,831
When they ask me...

978
01:41:07,916 --> 01:41:09,293
...what I liked the best...

979
01:41:11,628 --> 01:41:12,796
...I'll tell them...

980
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:14,590
...it was you.

981
01:41:44,745 --> 01:41:45,829
God!

982
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:51,914
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

983
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:55,626
I'm sorry.

984
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:00,631
Get out.

985
01:44:03,258 --> 01:44:05,844
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

986
01:44:06,428 --> 01:44:07,346
No.

987
01:44:08,597 --> 01:44:09,807
Why did He do this?

988
01:44:10,098 --> 01:44:11,099
I don't know.

989
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:12,518
Because her number was up?

990
01:44:13,727 --> 01:44:15,354
What do you want me to say?

991
01:44:23,111 --> 01:44:26,281
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

992
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:29,576
That's life.

993
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,538
You're living now.

994
01:44:34,456 --> 01:44:35,457
And one day...

995
01:44:36,125 --> 01:44:37,459
...you'll be dying.

996
01:44:44,258 --> 01:44:45,300
What's it like?

997
01:44:46,635 --> 01:44:47,553
What?

998
01:44:48,679 --> 01:44:49,680
Warmth.

999
01:44:51,974 --> 01:44:53,350
It's wonderful.

1000
01:44:55,477 --> 01:44:57,646
If you'd known this
was going to happen...

1001
01:44:59,356 --> 01:45:00,649
...would you have done it?

1002
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,740
I would rather have had...

1003
01:45:10,492 --> 01:45:12,369
...one breath of her hair...

1004
01:45:16,123 --> 01:45:17,916
...one kiss of her mouth...

1005
01:45:21,003 --> 01:45:23,046
...one touch of her hand...

1006
01:45:25,257 --> 01:45:27,426
...than an eternity without it.

1007
01:45:30,512 --> 01:45:31,555
One.
