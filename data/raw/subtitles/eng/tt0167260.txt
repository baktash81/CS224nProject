1
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,943
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,407
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,997
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,285
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,344
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,570
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,358
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,259
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,512
Why?

10
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,844
Because...

11
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,765
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:41,317
My precious.

13
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,746
They cursed us.

14
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,328
Murderer.

15
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,960
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,874
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,713
Gollum.

18
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,628
Gollum.

19
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,717
Gollum.

20
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,307
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,065
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,401
--And cool
So nice for feet

23
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,777
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,243
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,090
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,924
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,973
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:57,267
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:11,820
My precious.

30
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,331
Wake up!

31
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,038
Wake up!

32
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,998
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,039
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,878
We must go at once.

35
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,511
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,307
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,431
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,099
No.

39
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,188
It isn't.

40
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,355
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,149
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,580
Come on!

43
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,285
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,830
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,874
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,884
Here.

47
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,934
What about you?

48
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,522
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,482
Sam.

50
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,565
All right,

51
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,235
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,326
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,417
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,998
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,171
There should be enough.

56
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,541
For what?

57
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,928
The journey home.

58
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,104
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,395
Very close now.

60
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,779
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,610
No safe places here.

62
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,946
Hurry.

63
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,248
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon...

64
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,754
...after a hard day's work.

65
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,758
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

66
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,644
Welcome, my lords...

67
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,059
...to Isengard!

68
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,188
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

69
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:21,361
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

70
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,701
We are sitting
on a field of victory...

71
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,367
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

72
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,296
The salted pork is particularly good.

73
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,209
Salted pork?

74
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,845
- Huh. Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

75
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,848
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

76
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,388
Young Master Gandalf.

77
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,151
I'm glad you've come.

78
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,735
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

79
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,572
But there is a wizard to manage here...

80
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,736
...locked in his tower.

81
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:09,249
And there Saruman must remain
under your guard, Treebeard.

82
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,581
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

83
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,791
No.

84
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,916
He has no power anymore.

85
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,007
The filth of Saruman...

86
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,015
...Is washing away.

87
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,725
Trees will come back to live here.

88
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,721
Young trees.

89
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,774
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

90
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,407
Bless my bark!

91
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,447
Peregrin Took!

92
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,242
I'll take that, my lad.

93
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,285
Quickly, now.

94
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,167
Tonight we remember
those who gave their blood...

95
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,669
...to defend this country.

96
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,331
Hail the victorious dead.

97
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,171
Hail!

98
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,552
I am happy for you.

99
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,305
He is an honorable man.

100
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,188
You are both honorable men.

101
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:43,362
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

102
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,409
Ah, don't listen to me.

103
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,744
You are young.

104
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,750
And tonight is for you.

105
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,956
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

106
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,752
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

107
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,344
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

108
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,431
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

109
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,768
But the only brew for the brave and true

110
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,649
Comes from The Green Dragon

111
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,446
Thank you! I win!

112
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,443
No news of Frodo?

113
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,114
No word. Nothing.

114
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,120
We have time.

115
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,917
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

116
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,756
Do we know that?

117
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,635
What does your heart tell you?

118
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,690
That Frodo is alive.

119
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,985
Yes.

120
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,399
Yes, he's alive.

121
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,495
Too risky. Too risky.

122
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,905
Thieves.

123
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,120
They stole it from us.

124
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,502
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

125
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,670
Shh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

126
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,381
Mustn't ruin it now.

127
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,637
But they knows.

128
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,673
They knows.

129
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,468
They suspects us.

130
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,226
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

131
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,984
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

132
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,021
No. Not.

133
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,442
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

134
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,455
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

135
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,161
And we will.

136
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,374
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

137
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,380
It's ours!

138
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,216
Ours!

139
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,216
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

140
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,807
Patience! Patience, my love.

141
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,350
First we must lead them to her.

142
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:32,231
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

143
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,070
Yes, the stairs. And then?

144
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,236
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

145
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:44,831
...until we come to the tunnel.

146
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,331
And when they go in...

147
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,296
...there's no coming out.

148
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,087
She's always hungry.

149
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:00,058
She always needs to feed.

150
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,639
She must eat.

151
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,928
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

152
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,848
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

153
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,108
No.

154
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,988
Not very nice at all, my love.

155
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,946
She hungers for sweeter meats.

156
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,951
Hobbit meat.

157
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,957
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

158
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,209
.then we will find it.

159
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,419
And take it for me!

160
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,880
For us.

161
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,388
Yes. We meant "for us."

162
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,017
Gollum. Gollum.

163
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,680
The precious will be ours...

164
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:51,351
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

165
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,315
You treacherous little toad!

166
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,320
No! No! Master!

167
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,110
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

168
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,659
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

169
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,997
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

170
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,081
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

171
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,840
...who hates Sméagol...

172
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,843
...and who makes up nasty lies.

173
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,596
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

174
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,302
Sam!

175
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,178
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

176
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,851
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

177
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,188
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

178
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,110
You don't see it, do you?

179
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,691
He's a villain.

180
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,317
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

181
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,029
I need you on my side.

182
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,164
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

183
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,627
I know, Sam. I know.

184
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,164
Trust me.

185
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,709
Come, Sméagol.

186
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,412
The stars are veiled.

187
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,909
Something stirs in the east.

188
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,750
A sleepless malice.

189
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,501
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

190
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,642
What are you doing?

191
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,772
Pippin!

192
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,948
Pippin?

193
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,763
Pippin.

194
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,550
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

195
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,968
Just one more time.

196
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,183
Put it back.

197
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,232
Pippin.

198
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,281
No!

199
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,579
Pippin.

200
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,167
He is here.

201
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,632
I see you.

202
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,224
Pippin!

203
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,655
Help! Gandalf, help!

204
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,237
Someone help him!

205
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,870
Pippin!

206
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,171
Fool of a Took!

207
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,562
Look at me.

208
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,611
Gandalf, forgive me.

209
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,699
Look at me.

210
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,705
What did you see?

211
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,249
A tree.

212
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,089
There was a white tree...

213
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,749
...in a courtyard of stone.

214
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,836
It was dead.

215
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,892
The city was burning.

216
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

217
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,099
I saw...

218
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,899
I saw him.

219
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,116
I could hear his voice in my head.

220
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,745
And what did you tell him?

221
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,372
Speak!

222
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,042
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

223
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,671
He hurt me.

224
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,300
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

225
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,298
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

226
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,350
A fool...

227
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,807
...but an honest fool he remains.

228
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,815
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

229
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,273
We've been strangely fortunate.

230
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:30,315
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

231
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:35,160
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

232
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,498
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

233
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,000
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

234
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,333
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

235
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,295
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

236
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,342
Sauron fears this.

237
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,847
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

238
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,430
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

239
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,097
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

240
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:06,188
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

241
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,361
Tell me...

242
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,067
...why should we ride to the aid...

243
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,323
...of those who did not come to ours?

244
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,038
What do we owe Gondor?

245
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,204
- I will go.
- No!

246
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,541
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

247
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,463
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

248
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,514
Follow the river
and look to the black ships.

249
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,391
Understand this:

250
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,225
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

251
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,849
I ride for Minas Tirith...

252
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,733
...and I won't be going alone.

253
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,201
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

254
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,866
Hurry! Hurry!

255
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,744
Where are we going?

256
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,158
Why did you look?

257
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,078
Why do you always have to look?

258
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,374
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

259
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,257
I'm sorry, all right?

260
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,262
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

261
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,932
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

262
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,891
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

263
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,936
And you--? You're coming with me?

264
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,610
Merry?

265
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,066
Come on.

266
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,944
How far is Minas Tirith?

267
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,739
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

268
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,409
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

269
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,619
Here.

270
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,538
Something for the road.

271
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,424
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

272
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,588
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

273
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,257
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

274
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,096
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

275
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,145
I don't know what's going to happen.

276
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,980
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

277
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,644
Show us the meaning of haste.

278
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,688
Merry!

279
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,332
Merry!

280
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,607
Take her by the safest road.

281
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,273
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

282
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,318
It waits to carry her across the sea.

283
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,114
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

284
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,599
There is nothing for you here...

285
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,272
...only death.

286
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,864
Lady Arwen...

287
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,699
...we cannot delay.

288
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,408
My lady!

289
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,430
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

290
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,565
You have the gift of foresight.

291
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,521
What did you see?

292
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,488
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

293
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,149
But there is also life.

294
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,118
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

295
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,333
That future is almost gone.

296
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,460
But it is not lost.

297
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,256
Nothing is certain.

298
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,673
Some things are certain.

299
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,343
If I leave him now...

300
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,104
...I will regret it forever.

301
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,523
It is time.

302
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,571
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

303
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,157
A light from the shadow shall spring

304
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,619
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

305
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,210
The crownless again shall be king

306
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,056
Re-forge the sword.

307
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,586
Your hands are cold.

308
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,101
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

309
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,434
This was my choice.

310
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,564
Whether by your will or not...

311
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:10,195
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

312
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,249
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

313
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,175
Minas Tirith.

314
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,057
City of kings.

315
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,253
Make way!

316
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,288
It's the tree.

317
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,119
Gandalf. Gandalf.

318
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,580
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

319
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,540
The tree of the king.

320
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,251
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

321
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,258
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

322
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,508
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

323
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,847
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

324
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,771
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

325
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,392
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

326
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:55,106
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

327
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:31,769
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

328
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:41,994
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

329
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,332
Perhaps you come to explain this.

330
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:56,505
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

331
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,022
Boromir died to save us...

332
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,811
...my kinsman and me.

333
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,482
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

334
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,457
I offer you my service, such as it is...

335
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,877
...in payment of this debt.

336
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,122
Get up.

337
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,885
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

338
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,129
...but it is not now.

339
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,056
War is coming.

340
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,808
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

341
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,100
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

342
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:59,192
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

343
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:03,860
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

344
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,951
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

345
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,208
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

346
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,503
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

347
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,760
I have seen more than you know.

348
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,093
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

349
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,179
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

350
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,062
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

351
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:38,148
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

352
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:43,191
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

353
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,862
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

354
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:53,830
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

355
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:58,463
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

356
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,424
Come.

357
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,067
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

358
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,484
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

359
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:31,326
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

360
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,740
You're going to have to do
as you're told.

361
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,707
Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel.

362
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,209
It's so quiet.

363
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,675
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

364
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,683
I don't want to be in a battle...

365
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,515
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

366
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,693
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

367
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,110
There never was much hope.

368
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,697
Just a fool's hope.

369
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,546
Our enemy is ready.

370
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,333
His full strength's gathered.

371
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:28,004
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

372
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,219
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

373
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,100
...mercenaries from the coast.

374
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,853
All will answer Mordor's call.

375
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,559
Come on.

376
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,022
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

377
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,564
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

378
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:51,869
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

379
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,702
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

380
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,914
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

381
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,418
Gandalf?

382
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,763
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

383
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,059
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

384
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:24,443
The one they say no living man can kill.

385
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,608
The Witch-king of Angmar.

386
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,025
You've met him before.

387
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,286
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

388
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,545
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

389
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,465
...the greatest of the Nine.

390
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,124
Minas Morgul...

391
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,045
...is his lair.

392
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,263
The Dead City.

393
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:02,648
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

394
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,028
Quick. Quick.

395
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:16,195
They will see. They will see.

396
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:30,756
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

397
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,797
The way into Mordor.

398
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,309
The secret stair.

399
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,096
Climb.

400
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,119
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

401
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,551
- What's it doing?
- No.

402
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,088
- They're calling me.
- No.

403
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,711
Hide! Hide!

404
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,125
I can feel his blade.

405
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,977
We come to it at last.

406
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,602
The great battle of our time.

407
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,020
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

408
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,911
The board is set.

409
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,622
The pieces are moving.

410
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,380
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

411
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,169
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

412
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,553
You must not fail me.

413
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,260
Quiet.

414
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,934
- To the river. Quick. Quick.
- Go. Go.

415
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,439
Come on.

416
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,111
Faster.

417
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,626
Draw swords.

418
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,767
Hold! Hold!

419
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,932
What?

420
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,403
Amon Dîn.

421
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,785
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

422
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:05,247
Hope is kindled.

423
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,015
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

424
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,847
Gondor calls for aid.

425
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,234
And Rohan will answer.

426
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,446
Muster the Rohirrim.

427
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,508
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

428
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,097
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

429
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:28,515
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

430
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,812
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

431
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,317
- Gamling.
- My lord.

432
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,104
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

433
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,363
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

434
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,650
I will.

435
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:45,411
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

436
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,452
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

437
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,968
The men have found their captain.

438
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,472
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

439
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,225
You have given us hope.

440
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,076
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

441
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,160
...the doom of our time will be decided.

442
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:34,252
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

443
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:38,840
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land! Hyah!

444
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,046
Faramir!

445
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:33,056
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

446
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,692
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

447
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,741
Nazgûl.

448
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,576
Take cover!

449
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,252
Nazgûl!

450
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:59,086
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

451
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,549
Fall back!

452
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:19,193
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Come on!

453
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,805
The age of Men is over.

454
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:53,561
The time of the Orc has come.

455
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,273
- Take cover!
- Faster, faster!

456
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,270
Take cover, my lord!

457
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,904
It's coming!

458
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,830
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

459
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,201
Pull!

460
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,304
Mithrandir.

461
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,219
They broke through our defenses.

462
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,603
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

463
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,644
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

464
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,856
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

465
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:28,569
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

466
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,366
Faramir?

467
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,125
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

468
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,502
No.

469
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,377
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

470
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,673
- Where? When?
- In lthilien.

471
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,929
Not two days ago.

472
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:56,851
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

473
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,187
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

474
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,775
What does that mean?

475
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:09,860
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

476
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,140
Careful, master. Careful.

477
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:43,602
Very far to fall.

478
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:49,775
Very dangerous are the stairs.

479
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,984
Come, master.

480
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,952
Come to Sméagol.

481
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,838
Mr. Frodo.

482
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,340
Get back, you!

483
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,721
Don't touch him!

484
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,687
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

485
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,566
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

486
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,022
Master?

487
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:34,365
Master carries heavy burden.

488
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:39,950
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

489
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,366
Fat one cannot know.

490
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,208
Sméagol look after master.

491
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,590
He wants it.

492
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,300
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

493
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:01,934
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

494
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,972
The fat one will take it from you.

495
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:17,567
Send forth all legions.

496
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:21,738
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

497
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,575
Slay them all.

498
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:33,045
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

499
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,797
What of Théoden's riders?

500
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,591
Will Rohan's army come?

501
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,975
Mithrandir.

502
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,936
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

503
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,443
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

504
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,103
...in peace or war...

505
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,199
...in living or dying...

506
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,776
...from...

507
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,290
From this hour henceforth...

508
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,371
...until my lord release me...

509
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,087
...or death take me.

510
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,124
And I shall not forget it...

511
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,715
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

512
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,600
Fealty with love.

513
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,310
Valor with honor.

514
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,278
Disloyalty with vengeance.

515
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:49,000
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

516
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,911
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

517
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,581
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

518
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,500
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

519
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,338
Osgiliath must be retaken.

520
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,595
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

521
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,007
Much must be risked in war.

522
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:11,646
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

523
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:21,107
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

524
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,868
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

525
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,040
Yes.

526
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,959
I wish that.

527
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,838
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

528
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,551
...I will do what I can
in his stead.

529
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:01,230
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

530
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,910
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

531
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,179
Ugh.

532
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,579
What are you up to?

533
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,989
Sneaking off, are we?

534
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,495
Sneaking?

535
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,707
Sneaking?!

536
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,295
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

537
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:49,555
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

538
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,840
...and they say "sneak."

539
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:55,102
Sneak?

540
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:58,431
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

541
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,191
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

542
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,694
You just startled me is all.

543
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,030
What were you doing?

544
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,776
Sneaking.

545
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,200
Fine. Have it your own way.

546
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,993
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

547
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,336
We have to be moving on.

548
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,047
It's dark still.

549
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,462
It's always dark here.

550
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,639
It's gone!

551
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,723
- The Elven bread.
- What?

552
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,356
That's all we have left.

553
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,898
He took it. He must have!

554
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:52,697
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

555
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,738
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

556
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,124
You're a lying wretch!
What did you do with it?!

557
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,830
He doesn't eat it.

558
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,170
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

559
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,048
What's this?

560
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:13,055
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

561
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,428
He took it.

562
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,727
I seen him.
He's always stuffing his face...

563
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,184
- ...when master's not looking.
- That's a filthy lie!

564
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,816
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

565
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,226
- Sam!
- Call me--

566
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,644
Stop it!

567
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,568
Sam!

568
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,781
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

569
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:41,375
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

570
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,660
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

571
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,920
- I'm all right.
- No.

572
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:49,174
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

573
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,460
It's that Gollum.

574
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,345
It's this place.

575
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:56,098
It's that thing around your neck.

576
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,890
I could help a bit.

577
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,726
I could carry it for a while.

578
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,607
Carry it for a while.

579
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,063
I could carry it.

580
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:13,153
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

581
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,566
Get away!

582
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,280
I don't want to keep it.

583
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,824
I just want to help.

584
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,503
See? See?

585
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:30,132
He wants it for himself.

586
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,008
Shut up, you!

587
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,378
Go away! Get out of here!

588
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,388
No, Sam.

589
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,798
It's you.

590
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,682
I'm sorry, Sam.

591
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,773
But he's a liar.

592
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,605
He's poisoned you against me.

593
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,941
You can't help me anymore.

594
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,775
You don't mean that.

595
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,075
Go home.

596
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,906
Faramir!

597
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,947
Faramir!

598
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,538
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

599
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,749
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

600
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,794
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

601
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,927
Your father loves you, Faramir.

602
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,639
He will remember it
before the end.

603
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,793
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

604
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,168
Well...

605
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,338
...yes.

606
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:08,805
At least, well enough
for my own people.

607
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,850
But we have no songs
for great halls...

608
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,144
...and evil times.

609
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:19,148
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

610
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,360
Come, sing me a song.

611
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,747
Home is behind

612
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,667
The world ahead

613
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:49,892
And there are many paths to tread

614
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:55,267
Through shadow

615
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:59,560
To the edge of night

616
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,366
Until the stars are all alight

617
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,707
Mist and shadow

618
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:18,165
Cloud and shade

619
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,884
All shall fade

620
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:30,258
All shall

621
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:38,390
Fade

622
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,259
March! March!

623
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:11,640
March! March! March!

624
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,436
Make way for the king.

625
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,932
Make way.

626
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,441
The king is here.

627
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,024
My lord.

628
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,243
Hail to you, sire.

629
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,903
Grimbold, how many?

630
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,493
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

631
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,164
We have 300 more
from Fenmarch, Théoden King.

632
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,256
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

633
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,434
Six thousand spears.

634
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,479
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

635
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:11,150
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

636
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,657
More will come.

637
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,998
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

638
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,705
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

639
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,564
The horses are restless...

640
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,224
...and the men are quiet.

641
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,813
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

642
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,150
That road there...

643
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,160
...where does that lead?

644
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,748
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

645
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,452
None who venture there ever return.

646
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,539
That mountain is evil.

647
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,427
Hold!

648
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,321
Aragorn.

649
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,941
Let's find some food.

650
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:52,880
There.

651
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,804
A true esquire of Rohan.

652
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,884
I'm ready.

653
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,305
Sorry.

654
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,770
It isn't all that dangerous.

655
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,609
It's not even sharp.

656
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,648
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

657
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,315
Come on.

658
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,031
To the smithy. Go!

659
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,994
You should not encourage him.

660
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,663
You should not doubt him.

661
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,128
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

662
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,428
Why should Merry be left behind?

663
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,215
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

664
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,554
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

665
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,469
I choose a mortal life.

666
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,259
I wish I could've seen him...

667
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:28,104
...one last time.

668
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,696
Sir?

669
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,121
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

670
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,852
I take my leave.

671
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,735
My lord Elrond.

672
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,823
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

673
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,911
Arwen is dying.

674
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:41,757
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

675
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,883
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

676
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,054
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

677
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,974
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

678
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,318
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

679
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,357
The end has come.

680
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,357
It will not be our end, but his.

681
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,703
You ride to war, but not to victory.

682
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:11,370
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

683
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,959
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

684
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:19,836
A fleet of Corsairs ships sails
from the south.

685
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,551
They'll be in the city in two days.

686
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,888
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

687
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,716
You need more men.

688
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,844
There are none.

689
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,520
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

690
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:47,698
Murderers...

691
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:49,283
...traitors.

692
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,912
You would call upon them to fight?

693
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,668
They believe in nothing.

694
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,954
They answer to no one.

695
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:01,215
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

696
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:13,470
Andúril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

697
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:32,201
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

698
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:51,008
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

699
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,597
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

700
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:57,639
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

701
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,647
Put aside the Ranger.

702
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:05,154
Become who you were born to be.

703
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,315
Take the Dimholt road.

704
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,080
I give hope to Men.

705
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:21,504
I keep none for myself.

706
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,013
Why are you doing this?

707
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,688
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

708
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,192
You cannot abandon the men.

709
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,070
Éowyn...

710
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,447
We need you here.

711
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,442
Why have you come?

712
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,079
Do you not know?

713
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,375
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

714
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,719
I cannot give you what you seek.

715
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,571
Just where do you think
you're off to?

716
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:37,864
Not this time.

717
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:40,249
- This time you must stay, Gimli.
- Mm.

718
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,754
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

719
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:49,588
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

720
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,112
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

721
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,285
Where's he going?

722
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,953
I don't understand.

723
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,125
Lord Aragorn!

724
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,299
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

725
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:36,343
- He leaves because there is no hope.
- He leaves because he must.

726
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,258
Too few have come.

727
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,551
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

728
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,723
No...

729
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,436
...we cannot.

730
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:53,110
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

731
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,247
I have left instruction.

732
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,170
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

733
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,011
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

734
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,107
Long may you defend Edoras...

735
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,609
...if the battle goes ill.

736
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:35,110
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

737
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,280
Duty?

738
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:42,822
No.

739
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,207
I would have you smile again...

740
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:01,641
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

741
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,020
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

742
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:17,072
...and no more despair.

743
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,999
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

744
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:29,001
One that is cursed.

745
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,501
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

746
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,714
...to the last king of Gondor...

747
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,878
...to come to his aid...

748
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,763
...to fight.

749
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,428
But when the time came...

750
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:46,644
...when Gondor's need was dire...

751
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,724
...they fled...

752
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,267
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

753
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,610
And so Isildur cursed them...

754
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:01,025
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

755
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,634
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

756
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,099
The way is shut.

757
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,810
It was made by those
who are dead.

758
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,688
And the Dead keep it.

759
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,770
The way is shut.

760
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,619
Brego!

761
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,835
I do not fear death.

762
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:07,554
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

763
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:12,393
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

764
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:13,897
Oh.

765
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,900
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

766
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,159
We must ride light and swift.

767
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:36,079
It is a long road ahead.

768
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,339
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

769
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:47,886
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

770
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:50,183
All my friends have gone to battle.

771
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:52,220
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

772
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,513
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

773
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,058
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

774
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:02,029
- I want to fight.
- I will say no more.

775
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,465
Ride with me.

776
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,339
My lady.

777
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,880
Form up! Move out!

778
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:30,266
Form up! Move out!

779
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:34,595
Ride!

780
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:37,686
Ride now to Gondor!

781
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:30,694
Who enters my domain?

782
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,665
One who will have your allegiance.

783
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:44,999
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

784
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,960
You will suffer me.

785
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:14,863
The way is shut.

786
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:20,501
It was made by those who are dead.

787
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:25,043
And the Dead keep it.

788
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:37,267
The way is shut.

789
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,647
Now you must die.

790
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,396
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

791
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,655
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

792
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,413
That line was broken.

793
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,251
It has been remade.

794
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,718
Fight for us...

795
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,429
...and regain your honor.

796
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:23,938
What say you?

797
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,448
What say you?

798
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,239
Ah! You waste your time, Aragorn.

799
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,626
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

800
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:46,587
I am Isildur's heir.

801
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,123
Fight for me...

802
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:53,294
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

803
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,140
What say you?

804
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:12,150
Open the gate! Quick!

805
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,182
Quick! Hurry!

806
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,394
Faramir!

807
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,652
Say not that he has fallen.

808
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:58,362
They were outnumbered.

809
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,369
None survived.

810
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,038
Fear.

811
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,834
The city is rank with it.

812
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,630
Let us ease their pain.

813
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,624
Release the prisoners.

814
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,759
Catapults!

815
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:20,715
Shields up!

816
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,568
My sons are spent.

817
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:36,529
My line has ended.

818
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:40,734
He's alive!

819
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:44,075
The House of Stewards has failed.

820
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:45,739
He needs medicine, my lord.

821
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:49,410
My line has ended!

822
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,921
My lord!

823
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,839
Put it in!

824
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:08,311
Rohan...

825
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,432
...has deserted us.

826
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:29,124
Théoden's betrayed me.

827
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,095
Abandon your posts!

828
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:47,055
Flee! Flee for your lives!

829
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,641
Oh!

830
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,737
Prepare for battle!

831
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:02,445
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

832
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,577
Over here!

833
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,698
Return to your posts!

834
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,128
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

835
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:33,771
Stay where you are.

836
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,161
We need more rubble!

837
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,201
Watch out!

838
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,916
Down to the lower level. Quick!

839
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,336
Double up, men!

840
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:17,815
Yah!

841
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:06,106
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

842
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:10,118
Stand to your posts! Fight!

843
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,444
Not to the towers!

844
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,614
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

845
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,166
Bring them down!

846
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,462
Fight them back!

847
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:08,627
Peregrin Took!

848
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,677
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

849
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:28,105
This is no place for a Hobbit.

850
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,306
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

851
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:59,227
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

852
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:10,903
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

853
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:15,031
Grond! Grond! Grond!

854
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:23,453
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

855
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,837
In there.

856
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,382
What is this place?

857
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:45,190
Master must go inside the tunnel.

858
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,563
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

859
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:54,899
It's the only way.

860
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:59,279
Go in...

861
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:02,039
...or go back.

862
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,500
I can't go back.

863
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,681
Ugh.

864
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:22,222
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

865
01:38:22,397 --> 01:38:25,810
Orcses come in here sometimes.

866
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,646
Hurry.

867
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,494
This way.

868
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,123
Sméagol?

869
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:47,251
Over here.

870
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,337
Oh!

871
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,377
Aah! Aah!

872
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:58,718
It's sticky. What is it?

873
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,178
You'll see.

874
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,468
Oh, yes.

875
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:07,014
You will see.

876
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,569
Sméagol?

877
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,156
Sméagol!

878
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,789
Sméagol!

879
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,008
Sam.

880
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,186
And you, Frodo Baggins...

881
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:23,734
...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

882
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,825
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

883
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:31,412
...when all other lights go out.

884
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:58,484
Aah!

885
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:51,121
Naughty little fly

886
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:54,499
Why does he cry?

887
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:58,378
Caught in a web

888
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:01,164
Soon you'll be...

889
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,253
Eaten.

890
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:43,381
Got away, did it, precious?

891
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:45,667
Not this time.

892
01:43:45,845 --> 01:43:48,963
- Not this time!
- No!

893
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:59,105
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

894
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,184
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

895
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:04,272
We promised.

896
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:06,946
You must believe us.

897
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:08,823
It was the precious.

898
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:13,783
The precious made us do it.

899
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:33,803
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

900
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:46,152
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

901
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:57,621
No!

902
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,352
I'm so sorry, Sam.

903
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,486
I'm so sorry.

904
01:45:56,141 --> 01:46:00,977
This task was appointed
to you, Frodo of the Shire.

905
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:04,518
If you do not find a way...

906
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:07,016
...no one will.

907
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:56,778
Back to the gate!

908
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:59,243
Hurry!

909
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,516
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

910
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:32,649
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

911
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:37,987
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

912
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,454
Bring wood and oil.

913
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:47,621
Steady.

914
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,877
Steady.

915
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:51,833
Grond! Grond!

916
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:06,811
You are soldiers of Gondor.

917
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:11,479
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

918
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,568
Volley!

919
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,952
Fire!

920
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,353
Let him go, you filth.

921
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:23,989
Let him go!

922
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:27,364
You will not touch him again.

923
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,373
Come on and finish it.

924
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,199
Aah!

925
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,733
Ha! Back!

926
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:35,825
Mr. Frodo.

927
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:47,375
Oh, no.

928
01:52:47,552 --> 01:52:49,509
Frodo.

929
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:51,678
Mr. Frodo.

930
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,635
Wake up.

931
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,857
Don't leave me here alone.

932
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,774
Don't go where I can't follow.

933
01:53:12,077 --> 01:53:13,533
Wake up.

934
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:22,375
Not asleep.

935
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:26,380
Dead.

936
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:57,577
What's this?

937
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:01,582
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

938
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:06,086
Killed another one, has she?

939
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:08,213
No.

940
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:12,918
This fellow ain't dead.

941
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,504
Not dead?

942
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:21,473
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

943
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:24,601
Then she has her way with them.

944
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,602
That's how she likes to feed.

945
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,272
Fresh blood.

946
01:54:29,446 --> 01:54:31,778
Get him to the tower!

947
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,943
Samwise, you fool.

948
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,953
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

949
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:42,615
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

950
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:10,146
The house of his spirit crumbles.

951
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:12,644
He is burning.

952
01:55:13,782 --> 01:55:15,147
Already burning.

953
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:17,483
He's not dead.

954
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,660
He's not dead!

955
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,573
No! No!

956
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:26,117
No! No!

957
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,285
He's not dead!

958
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:32,131
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

959
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,588
I release you from my service.

960
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:41,265
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

961
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:45,018
Pour oil on the wood!

962
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:49,515
Come on! Move your feet!

963
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:52,939
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

964
01:55:53,363 --> 01:55:54,774
Where is Gandalf?

965
01:55:55,907 --> 01:55:57,318
Gandalf!

966
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:03,741
Retreat!

967
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:07,708
The city is breached!

968
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:10,870
Fall back to the second level!

969
01:56:14,718 --> 01:56:16,208
Get the women and children out!

970
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:18,381
Get them out!

971
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:20,045
Retreat!

972
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:22,009
Come on. Come on.

973
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:26,560
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

974
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:37,029
Take them down!

975
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:00,419
Fight. Fight to the last man!

976
01:57:00,597 --> 01:57:01,883
Fight for your lives!

977
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:52,937
Courage, Merry.

978
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:55,475
Courage for our friends.

979
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:02,107
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

980
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:05,488
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

981
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:16,746
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

982
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,163
Flank ready.

983
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:21,208
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

984
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:25,129
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

985
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:28,010
Forth, and fear no darkness!

986
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:32,018
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

987
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:37,475
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

988
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:41,358
...a sword-day, a red day...

989
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:45,149
...ere the sun rises!

990
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:57,211
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

991
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:05,669
Ride now!

992
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,256
Ride now!

993
01:59:09,893 --> 01:59:12,635
Ride! Ride for ruin...

994
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:15,554
...and the world's ending!

995
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:18,890
Death!

996
01:59:19,402 --> 01:59:22,235
Death!

997
01:59:22,405 --> 01:59:25,648
- Death!
- Death!

998
01:59:26,076 --> 01:59:27,692
- Death!
- Death!

999
01:59:28,411 --> 01:59:31,824
- Death!
- Death!

1000
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:39,412
Forth Eorlingas!

1001
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:24,084
Fire!

1002
02:00:27,846 --> 02:00:29,132
Death!

1003
02:00:33,309 --> 02:00:34,595
Charge!

1004
02:00:35,019 --> 02:00:36,635
Fire at will!

1005
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:04,746
Gandalf!

1006
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:11,011
Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind!

1007
02:01:11,347 --> 02:01:13,588
He's burning Faramir alive!

1008
02:01:13,767 --> 02:01:15,508
Up! Quickly!

1009
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:49,584
Set a fire in our flesh.

1010
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:09,069
Stay this madness!

1011
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,097
No!

1012
02:02:45,275 --> 02:02:47,937
You will not take my son from me!

1013
02:02:50,613 --> 02:02:51,899
Yah!

1014
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:03,035
Faramir.

1015
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,553
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1016
02:03:48,087 --> 02:03:49,828
Drive them to the river!

1017
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:54,666
Make safe the city!

1018
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:35,715
Re-form the line!

1019
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,711
Re-form the line!

1020
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:49,312
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1021
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,061
Charge!

1022
02:05:58,301 --> 02:05:59,632
Cut him down!

1023
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:03,295
Follow me!

1024
02:06:26,329 --> 02:06:28,946
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1025
02:06:31,334 --> 02:06:32,620
Left!

1026
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:51,680
Aim for their heads!

1027
02:06:57,693 --> 02:07:00,981
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1028
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:16,367
Merry!

1029
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:40,058
I didn't think it would end this way.

1030
02:07:41,404 --> 02:07:42,769
End?

1031
02:07:44,031 --> 02:07:46,147
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1032
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:51,779
Death is just another path...

1033
02:07:52,415 --> 02:07:54,076
...one that we all must take.

1034
02:07:55,293 --> 02:07:58,752
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1035
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:02,585
...and all turns to silver glass.

1036
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,671
And then you see it.

1037
02:08:08,598 --> 02:08:10,965
What, Gandalf?

1038
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:13,432
See what?

1039
02:08:14,687 --> 02:08:16,928
White shores...

1040
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:20,975
...and beyond.

1041
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:24,231
A far green country...

1042
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,860
...under a swift sunrise.

1043
02:08:31,954 --> 02:08:33,444
Well...

1044
02:08:33,623 --> 02:08:35,284
...that isn't so bad.

1045
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:36,823
No.

1046
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:40,539
No, it isn't.

1047
02:08:56,979 --> 02:09:00,267
Rally to me! To me!

1048
02:09:21,045 --> 02:09:25,585
Feast on his flesh.

1049
02:09:29,929 --> 02:09:32,296
I will kill you if you touch him.

1050
02:09:32,515 --> 02:09:37,931
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1051
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:49,582
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1052
02:10:49,967 --> 02:10:52,208
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1053
02:10:52,386 --> 02:10:55,595
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1054
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:13,195
There's plenty for the both of us.

1055
02:11:13,366 --> 02:11:15,448
May the best Dwarf win.

1056
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:42,216
You fool.

1057
02:11:42,395 --> 02:11:45,808
No man can kill me.

1058
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:51,313
Die now.

1059
02:12:01,997 --> 02:12:03,988
I am no man.

1060
02:12:20,516 --> 02:12:24,009
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

1061
02:12:40,244 --> 02:12:42,861
- Twenty-nine!
- Legolas!

1062
02:13:05,269 --> 02:13:07,727
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1063
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:57,109
That still only counts as one!

1064
02:13:57,279 --> 02:13:59,441
All right, then. Come on!

1065
02:14:43,158 --> 02:14:45,991
I know your face...

1066
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:49,737
...Éowyn.

1067
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:54,666
My eyes darken.

1068
02:14:55,838 --> 02:14:57,169
No.

1069
02:14:58,007 --> 02:14:59,668
No.

1070
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,218
I am going to save you.

1071
02:15:05,556 --> 02:15:07,923
You already did.

1072
02:15:11,562 --> 02:15:13,178
Éowyn...

1073
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:17,182
...my body is broken.

1074
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,697
You have to let me go.

1075
02:15:30,623 --> 02:15:33,206
I go to my fathers...

1076
02:15:34,668 --> 02:15:37,501
...in whose mighty company...

1077
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:41,255
...I shall not now feel ashamed.

1078
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,516
Éowyn.

1079
02:16:45,989 --> 02:16:48,447
Release us.

1080
02:16:50,452 --> 02:16:52,113
Bad idea.

1081
02:16:52,287 --> 02:16:56,121
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1082
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:58,282
You gave us your word.

1083
02:17:00,045 --> 02:17:02,127
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1084
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:04,796
Go.

1085
02:17:05,676 --> 02:17:07,383
Be at peace.

1086
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:43,494
Merry.

1087
02:17:46,258 --> 02:17:47,498
Merry, it's me.

1088
02:17:50,179 --> 02:17:51,669
It's Pippin.

1089
02:17:54,183 --> 02:17:56,424
I knew you'd find me.

1090
02:17:56,602 --> 02:17:57,842
Yes.

1091
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:02,354
Are you going to leave me?

1092
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,607
No, Merry.

1093
02:18:05,903 --> 02:18:08,144
I'm going to look after you.

1094
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:53,568
Hands off!

1095
02:18:53,742 --> 02:18:56,905
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1096
02:18:57,162 --> 02:19:01,326
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1097
02:19:02,876 --> 02:19:06,710
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul rats!

1098
02:19:07,589 --> 02:19:12,755
You touch it,
and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1099
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:35,189
The scum tried to knife me.

1100
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:37,108
Kill him!

1101
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:56,903
Argh!

1102
02:20:58,367 --> 02:21:00,358
That's for Frodo!

1103
02:21:00,786 --> 02:21:02,868
And for the Shire!

1104
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,616
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1105
02:21:30,565 --> 02:21:33,853
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1106
02:21:34,987 --> 02:21:39,732
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1107
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:49,699
- Not if I stick you first.
- Sam!

1108
02:21:55,465 --> 02:21:57,502
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1109
02:21:57,676 --> 02:21:59,758
Sorry for everything.

1110
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:03,880
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1111
02:22:04,057 --> 02:22:06,924
They've taken it. Sam...

1112
02:22:07,769 --> 02:22:09,259
...they took the Ring.

1113
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:12,688
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1114
02:22:24,661 --> 02:22:26,868
I thought I'd lost you.

1115
02:22:27,289 --> 02:22:28,950
So I took it.

1116
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:32,207
Only for safekeeping.

1117
02:22:33,462 --> 02:22:35,203
Give it to me.

1118
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,962
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1119
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:46,880
Sam.

1120
02:22:48,477 --> 02:22:50,468
Give me the Ring.

1121
02:23:11,166 --> 02:23:12,452
You must understand.

1122
02:23:15,962 --> 02:23:17,828
The Ring is my burden.

1123
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:21,123
It will destroy you, Sam.

1124
02:23:24,346 --> 02:23:26,257
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1125
02:23:27,599 --> 02:23:29,215
We best find you some clothes.

1126
02:23:29,392 --> 02:23:32,430
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1127
02:23:54,167 --> 02:23:56,374
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1128
02:23:56,878 --> 02:23:59,210
We made it to Mordor.

1129
02:24:00,549 --> 02:24:02,210
There are so many of them.

1130
02:24:03,135 --> 02:24:05,718
We'll never get through unseen.

1131
02:24:10,892 --> 02:24:14,226
It's him, the Eye.

1132
02:24:21,903 --> 02:24:24,520
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1133
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:27,072
There's nothing for it.

1134
02:24:30,036 --> 02:24:34,451
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1135
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:47,088
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1136
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:51,218
The darkness is deepening.

1137
02:24:51,433 --> 02:24:53,765
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1138
02:24:53,935 --> 02:24:55,972
It's only a matter of time.

1139
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:59,938
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1140
02:25:00,942 --> 02:25:05,436
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1141
02:25:05,614 --> 02:25:07,446
Let him stay there.

1142
02:25:07,616 --> 02:25:10,278
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1143
02:25:10,452 --> 02:25:15,618
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1144
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:24,872
I've sent him to his death.

1145
02:25:26,468 --> 02:25:27,708
No.

1146
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:30,632
There is still hope for Frodo.

1147
02:25:30,972 --> 02:25:35,136
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1148
02:25:36,186 --> 02:25:38,803
- We can give him that.
- How?

1149
02:25:39,105 --> 02:25:41,813
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1150
02:25:41,983 --> 02:25:43,974
Empty his lands.

1151
02:25:44,152 --> 02:25:46,894
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1152
02:25:48,531 --> 02:25:51,023
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1153
02:25:51,201 --> 02:25:52,783
Not for ourselves.

1154
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:58,580
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1155
02:26:00,377 --> 02:26:04,166
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1156
02:26:04,923 --> 02:26:06,163
A diversion.

1157
02:26:06,925 --> 02:26:09,337
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1158
02:26:10,136 --> 02:26:12,173
He will not take the bait.

1159
02:26:12,347 --> 02:26:13,963
Certainty of death...

1160
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:16,723
...small chance of success...

1161
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:19,351
...what are we waiting for?

1162
02:26:37,956 --> 02:26:41,039
To the Gate, you slugs!

1163
02:26:41,876 --> 02:26:45,414
Move it! To the Gate!

1164
02:26:51,553 --> 02:26:53,169
Look, the Orcs...

1165
02:26:53,638 --> 02:26:55,675
...they're moving off.

1166
02:26:56,850 --> 02:26:58,841
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1167
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:01,222
...some luck at last.

1168
02:27:56,159 --> 02:27:57,775
Take mine.

1169
02:27:58,286 --> 02:28:00,402
There's a few drops left.

1170
02:28:15,637 --> 02:28:18,220
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1171
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:22,303
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1172
02:29:15,196 --> 02:29:17,358
Frodo, get down!

1173
02:29:19,117 --> 02:29:21,028
Hide!

1174
02:29:31,337 --> 02:29:33,203
Frodo!

1175
02:29:39,053 --> 02:29:40,464
Where are they?

1176
02:30:16,549 --> 02:30:19,587
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1177
02:30:20,762 --> 02:30:23,345
Let justice be done upon him!

1178
02:30:55,797 --> 02:30:57,583
Fall back.

1179
02:30:57,882 --> 02:30:59,919
Fall back!

1180
02:31:12,146 --> 02:31:14,137
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1181
02:31:16,109 --> 02:31:19,647
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1182
02:31:19,821 --> 02:31:21,653
Something's drawn its gaze.

1183
02:31:39,173 --> 02:31:41,915
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1184
02:31:44,012 --> 02:31:48,006
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1185
02:31:50,852 --> 02:31:52,763
I see in your eyes...

1186
02:31:53,146 --> 02:31:57,185
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1187
02:31:59,152 --> 02:32:02,520
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1188
02:32:02,697 --> 02:32:06,531
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1189
02:32:06,701 --> 02:32:09,363
But it is not this day.

1190
02:32:09,662 --> 02:32:12,700
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1191
02:32:12,874 --> 02:32:15,707
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1192
02:32:15,877 --> 02:32:18,369
But it is not this day.

1193
02:32:18,546 --> 02:32:20,207
This day we fight!

1194
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:26,339
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1195
02:32:26,512 --> 02:32:30,722
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1196
02:33:59,230 --> 02:34:02,768
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1197
02:34:03,234 --> 02:34:05,566
What about side by side with a friend?

1198
02:34:09,115 --> 02:34:10,856
Aye.

1199
02:34:11,701 --> 02:34:13,487
I could do that.

1200
02:34:43,816 --> 02:34:45,853
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1201
02:34:48,863 --> 02:34:51,104
It'll be spring soon.

1202
02:34:51,908 --> 02:34:54,616
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1203
02:34:54,786 --> 02:34:58,450
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1204
02:34:59,832 --> 02:35:03,826
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1205
02:35:04,879 --> 02:35:09,214
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1206
02:35:11,177 --> 02:35:13,669
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1207
02:35:15,264 --> 02:35:16,971
No, Sam.

1208
02:35:17,141 --> 02:35:20,054
I can't recall the taste of food...

1209
02:35:21,229 --> 02:35:24,517
...nor the sound of water...

1210
02:35:24,690 --> 02:35:28,274
...nor the touch of grass.

1211
02:35:29,237 --> 02:35:30,727
I'm...

1212
02:35:31,656 --> 02:35:33,067
...naked in the dark.

1213
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:36,987
There's-- There's nothing.

1214
02:35:37,161 --> 02:35:41,871
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1215
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:45,283
I can see him...

1216
02:35:45,461 --> 02:35:47,077
...with my waking eyes.

1217
02:35:48,172 --> 02:35:50,630
Then let us be rid of it...

1218
02:35:51,217 --> 02:35:53,458
...once and for all.

1219
02:35:54,178 --> 02:35:56,260
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1220
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:59,092
I can't carry it for you...

1221
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:01,512
...but I can carry you.

1222
02:36:02,103 --> 02:36:03,810
Come on!

1223
02:36:34,218 --> 02:36:37,131
Aragorn.

1224
02:36:48,733 --> 02:36:51,316
Elessar.

1225
02:37:03,331 --> 02:37:05,743
For Frodo.

1226
02:37:40,701 --> 02:37:42,191
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1227
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:45,111
A doorway.

1228
02:37:45,706 --> 02:37:47,367
We're almost there.

1229
02:37:49,710 --> 02:37:53,704
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1230
02:38:53,274 --> 02:38:55,140
Frodo!

1231
02:39:22,303 --> 02:39:24,010
Eagles.

1232
02:39:25,431 --> 02:39:26,921
The eagles are coming!

1233
02:39:49,747 --> 02:39:51,658
Frodo!

1234
02:39:56,879 --> 02:39:58,165
I'm here, Sam.

1235
02:40:05,679 --> 02:40:07,261
Destroy it!

1236
02:40:17,858 --> 02:40:21,101
Go on! Now!

1237
02:40:21,278 --> 02:40:23,189
Throw it in the fire!

1238
02:40:37,211 --> 02:40:39,873
What are you waiting for?

1239
02:40:41,757 --> 02:40:44,124
Just let it go!

1240
02:41:17,334 --> 02:41:19,575
The Ring is mine.

1241
02:41:23,132 --> 02:41:24,918
No.

1242
02:41:25,301 --> 02:41:26,587
No.

1243
02:41:35,019 --> 02:41:37,681
No!

1244
02:43:22,126 --> 02:43:24,037
Yes!

1245
02:43:25,212 --> 02:43:26,873
Yes!

1246
02:43:28,048 --> 02:43:30,881
Precious! Precious!

1247
02:43:31,051 --> 02:43:34,214
Precious! Precious!

1248
02:44:27,149 --> 02:44:28,981
Give me your hand!

1249
02:44:37,326 --> 02:44:39,784
Take my hand!

1250
02:44:42,456 --> 02:44:43,742
No!

1251
02:44:51,006 --> 02:44:52,963
Don't you let go.

1252
02:44:57,554 --> 02:44:59,136
Don't let go.

1253
02:45:00,766 --> 02:45:02,222
Reach!

1254
02:46:31,398 --> 02:46:34,265
Frodo!

1255
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:37,898
Frodo!

1256
02:47:58,986 --> 02:48:01,068
It's gone.

1257
02:48:05,325 --> 02:48:07,316
It's done.

1258
02:48:07,828 --> 02:48:09,819
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1259
02:48:11,164 --> 02:48:13,576
It's over now.

1260
02:48:39,026 --> 02:48:41,609
I can see the Shire.

1261
02:48:43,864 --> 02:48:46,151
The Brandywine River.

1262
02:48:48,285 --> 02:48:50,276
Bag End.

1263
02:48:52,623 --> 02:48:55,365
Gandalf's fireworks.

1264
02:48:55,751 --> 02:48:59,540
The lights in the Party Tree.

1265
02:49:01,006 --> 02:49:04,124
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1266
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:07,968
She had ribbons in her hair.

1267
02:49:10,891 --> 02:49:13,883
If ever I was to marry someone...

1268
02:49:14,895 --> 02:49:16,477
...it would've been her.

1269
02:49:18,482 --> 02:49:20,519
It would've been her.

1270
02:49:32,412 --> 02:49:35,905
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1271
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:43,083
...here at the end of all things.

1272
02:51:32,783 --> 02:51:34,820
Gandalf?

1273
02:51:54,471 --> 02:51:56,462
Frodo!

1274
02:52:16,243 --> 02:52:18,075
Gimli!

1275
02:54:01,056 --> 02:54:04,845
Now come the days of the king.

1276
02:54:09,856 --> 02:54:12,188
May they be blessed.

1277
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:35,082
This day does not belong to one man...

1278
02:54:35,256 --> 02:54:37,122
...but to all.

1279
02:54:38,802 --> 02:54:41,715
Let us together rebuild this world...

1280
02:54:41,888 --> 02:54:46,132
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1281
02:57:20,630 --> 02:57:22,712
My friends...

1282
02:57:28,012 --> 02:57:30,674
...you bow to no one.

1283
02:58:14,851 --> 02:58:16,967
And thus it was.

1284
02:58:17,145 --> 02:58:20,763
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1285
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:23,477
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1286
02:58:23,651 --> 02:58:28,145
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1287
02:58:28,323 --> 02:58:30,781
...was ended.

1288
02:58:35,788 --> 02:58:40,533
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1289
02:58:40,710 --> 02:58:44,954
...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.

1290
02:58:47,467 --> 02:58:50,175
We were home.

1291
02:58:56,726 --> 02:58:58,637
Hi.

1292
02:59:15,828 --> 02:59:17,990
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1293
02:59:25,505 --> 02:59:27,542
Hey...

1294
03:00:06,087 --> 03:00:07,669
Rosie, Rosie.

1295
03:00:07,839 --> 03:00:09,830
Good night, lads.

1296
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:55,796
Hm?

1297
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:11,434
How do you pick up
the threads of an old life?

1298
03:01:12,737 --> 03:01:14,944
How do you go on...

1299
03:01:15,114 --> 03:01:20,325
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1300
03:01:21,621 --> 03:01:24,534
...there is no going back?

1301
03:01:25,249 --> 03:01:28,913
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1302
03:01:29,462 --> 03:01:32,329
...some hurts that go too deep...

1303
03:01:34,133 --> 03:01:36,966
...that have taken hold.

1304
03:02:15,091 --> 03:02:17,799
Mr. Frodo?

1305
03:02:20,346 --> 03:02:21,677
What is it?

1306
03:02:23,516 --> 03:02:27,475
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1307
03:02:28,187 --> 03:02:30,849
It's never really healed.

1308
03:02:34,819 --> 03:02:40,064
"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1309
03:02:40,867 --> 03:02:44,610
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1310
03:02:45,121 --> 03:02:47,704
You finished it.

1311
03:02:50,209 --> 03:02:51,699
Not quite.

1312
03:02:52,503 --> 03:02:55,040
There's room for a little more.

1313
03:02:57,717 --> 03:03:01,881
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1314
03:03:02,054 --> 03:03:05,388
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1315
03:03:06,225 --> 03:03:09,058
Bilbo's story was now over.

1316
03:03:09,562 --> 03:03:12,475
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1317
03:03:12,648 --> 03:03:14,230
...Save one.

1318
03:03:14,942 --> 03:03:18,526
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1319
03:03:18,738 --> 03:03:20,695
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1320
03:03:20,865 --> 03:03:23,573
The Elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1321
03:03:23,743 --> 03:03:26,405
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1322
03:03:27,872 --> 03:03:30,079
Frodo...

1323
03:03:31,167 --> 03:03:35,752
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1324
03:03:36,339 --> 03:03:39,001
The one I gave you.

1325
03:03:42,261 --> 03:03:44,377
Sorry, Uncle.

1326
03:03:46,933 --> 03:03:49,550
I'm afraid I lost it.

1327
03:03:49,769 --> 03:03:51,510
Oh.

1328
03:03:51,938 --> 03:03:54,100
Pity.

1329
03:03:56,359 --> 03:04:00,273
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1330
03:04:25,096 --> 03:04:26,552
Oh!

1331
03:04:29,392 --> 03:04:34,432
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1332
03:04:48,661 --> 03:04:51,949
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1333
03:04:52,748 --> 03:04:55,536
The time has come...

1334
03:04:55,710 --> 03:04:58,998
...for the dominion of Men.

1335
03:05:00,131 --> 03:05:02,998
The sea calls us home.

1336
03:05:11,392 --> 03:05:13,554
I think I'm...

1337
03:05:13,728 --> 03:05:18,097
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1338
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:51,467
Farewell...

1339
03:05:51,641 --> 03:05:54,383
...my brave Hobbits.

1340
03:05:56,395 --> 03:05:59,729
My work is now finished.

1341
03:06:02,026 --> 03:06:07,146
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1342
03:06:07,823 --> 03:06:10,656
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1343
03:06:14,205 --> 03:06:16,742
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1344
03:06:17,416 --> 03:06:21,410
...for not all tears are an evil.

1345
03:06:38,729 --> 03:06:40,845
It is time, Frodo.

1346
03:06:46,153 --> 03:06:48,941
What does he mean?

1347
03:06:50,866 --> 03:06:53,733
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1348
03:06:55,329 --> 03:06:58,071
And it has been saved.

1349
03:07:01,794 --> 03:07:04,456
But not for me.

1350
03:07:05,339 --> 03:07:07,797
You don't mean that.

1351
03:07:09,009 --> 03:07:11,125
You can't leave.

1352
03:07:19,562 --> 03:07:22,304
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1353
03:10:55,361 --> 03:10:58,228
My dear Sam:

1354
03:11:00,199 --> 03:11:03,487
You cannot always be torn in two.

1355
03:11:03,702 --> 03:11:07,787
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1356
03:11:08,540 --> 03:11:14,707
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1357
03:11:15,255 --> 03:11:18,998
Your part in the story will go on.

1358
03:11:19,218 --> 03:11:21,300
Well...

1359
03:11:22,554 --> 03:11:25,091
...I'm back.

1360
03:13:07,117 --> 03:13:12,487
Lay down

1361
03:13:12,664 --> 03:13:18,660
Your sweet and weary head

1362
03:13:18,837 --> 03:13:22,876
Night is falling

1363
03:13:23,050 --> 03:13:28,386
You have come
To journey's end

1364
03:13:28,555 --> 03:13:32,344
Sleep now

1365
03:13:32,518 --> 03:13:39,515
And dream
Of the ones who came before

1366
03:13:39,691 --> 03:13:43,855
They are calling

1367
03:13:44,029 --> 03:13:49,240
From across
The distant shore

1368
03:13:49,409 --> 03:13:54,654
Why do you weep?

1369
03:13:54,873 --> 03:13:59,788
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1370
03:13:59,962 --> 03:14:05,048
Soon you will see

1371
03:14:05,217 --> 03:14:10,178
All of your fears
Will pass away

1372
03:14:10,389 --> 03:14:15,384
Safe in my arms

1373
03:14:15,561 --> 03:14:20,055
You're only sleeping

1374
03:14:20,232 --> 03:14:25,227
What can you see

1375
03:14:25,404 --> 03:14:30,649
On the horizon?

1376
03:14:30,826 --> 03:14:35,366
Why do the white gulls

1377
03:14:35,539 --> 03:14:40,249
Call?

1378
03:14:41,211 --> 03:14:46,126
Across the sea

1379
03:14:46,300 --> 03:14:51,545
A pale moon rises

1380
03:14:51,722 --> 03:14:54,430
The ships have come

1381
03:14:54,600 --> 03:15:02,473
To carry you home

1382
03:15:02,649 --> 03:15:07,234
And all will turn

1383
03:15:07,446 --> 03:15:12,737
To silver glass

1384
03:15:12,951 --> 03:15:17,115
A light on the water

1385
03:15:17,289 --> 03:15:22,784
All souls pass

1386
03:15:22,961 --> 03:15:28,331
Hope fades

1387
03:15:28,508 --> 03:15:34,220
Into the world of night

1388
03:15:34,389 --> 03:15:38,849
Through shadows falling

1389
03:15:39,061 --> 03:15:44,682
Out of memory and time

1390
03:15:44,858 --> 03:15:49,227
Don't say

1391
03:15:49,404 --> 03:15:55,070
We have come now to the end

1392
03:15:55,244 --> 03:15:59,613
White shores are calling

1393
03:15:59,790 --> 03:16:03,158
You and I will meet again

1394
03:16:03,335 --> 03:16:10,833
And you'll be here
In my arms

1395
03:16:11,009 --> 03:16:14,843
Just sleeping

1396
03:16:15,013 --> 03:16:20,304
What can you see

1397
03:16:20,519 --> 03:16:25,434
On the horizon?

1398
03:16:25,607 --> 03:16:30,352
Why do the white gulls

1399
03:16:30,529 --> 03:16:35,990
Call?

1400
03:16:36,159 --> 03:16:41,199
Across the sea

1401
03:16:41,373 --> 03:16:46,368
A pale moon rises

1402
03:16:46,545 --> 03:16:49,333
The ships have come

1403
03:16:49,548 --> 03:16:56,887
To carry you home

1404
03:16:57,055 --> 03:17:01,925
And all will turn

1405
03:17:02,102 --> 03:17:07,597
To silver glass

1406
03:17:07,774 --> 03:17:11,893
A light on the water

1407
03:17:12,070 --> 03:17:15,859
Grey ships pass

1408
03:17:16,074 --> 03:17:21,786
Into the West
