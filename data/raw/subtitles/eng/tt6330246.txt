1
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,773
Sir?

2
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,335
Yes, show her in.

3
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:34,670
Sir.

4
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,194
Take a seat, Mrs...

5
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:37,433
Borel?

6
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,207
That's right, sir.

7
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,040
You live in Loiret county?

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,807
We say it's Sologne.

9
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:56,232
Thank you for making the trip.

10
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:59,779
I didn't come for that.
I'm visiting my brother outside Paris.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,578
I asked to see you because,
as you know,

12
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:06,039
our little orphans
are wards of the state,

13
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,999
especially war orphans.

14
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:09,860
That cannot last.

15
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,556
We have to place them
with foster families, you understand?

16
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,290
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:19,480
Ideally,
the children would have a link

18
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,254
with their new home.

19
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,650
The file of young Caradec, Paul,

20
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,423
offers little, except your name.

21
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,382
You knew the father, I believe.

22
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,421
The father, no.

23
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,743
The mother, yes.

24
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,590
In what respect,
without meaning to pry.

25
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,069
She was from back home.

26
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:44,056
My village.

27
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,667
And the child? You knew him?

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,333
No.

29
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:50,629
I never even saw him.

30
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,148
His poor mother died in childbirth.

31
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:58,034
Well, I won't beat around the bush.

32
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,530
Would you take the boy in?

33
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,126
You mean adopt him?

34
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,415
No, let's not be over-hasty.

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,395
If you get on, we'll consider it.

36
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:10,918
Sir, it's...

37
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,761
It's impossible.

38
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:16,059
You're accustomed to fostering children.

39
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,209
Yes, but...

40
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,513
Not him, it's impossible. I cannot.

41
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,019
Fine.

42
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,467
I won't insist.

43
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:35,072
Since you're here,
would you like to meet him?

44
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,470
Stop!

45
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,525
Quiet down!

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,999
- Bring me Caradec.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,141
Caradec!

48
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,749
Look, there's a mummy
here for you.

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,250
C'mon, Caradec, don't be a chicken.

50
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,468
Knock that off.

51
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,995
Get over here.

52
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:04,142
Well, Caradec?

53
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,897
Want a night in the hole?

54
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,541
The lady wanted to meet you.

55
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,666
What will she think of you now?

56
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,447
I don't care.

57
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,742
Go back to your bed.

58
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,133
It's not those kids' fault.

59
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,090
After so long within these walls,

60
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,293
they have them in their heads, too.

61
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,345
That's why foster families are important.

62
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,109
Anyway...

63
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,045
Some chocolate?

64
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:22,347
No, thank you.

65
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,040
SCHOOL OF LIFE

66
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,406
Won't you talk?

67
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,457
Sorry?

68
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:16,528
No, ma'am, I don't feel like talking.

69
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,976
Please, don't give me any ma'ams.

70
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,878
I'm Célestine.

71
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,024
Mummy Célestine.

72
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:25,501
I don't call anyone mummy.

73
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,833
He's with me for the vacation.

74
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,585
My cousin's nephew's son.

75
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,800
There's work to be done
at the manor, Célestine.

76
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,597
Make it ship-shape, fast.

77
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,285
We broke the lamp in the blue room.
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,783
Don't worry, miss.
I'll take care of it.

79
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:57,085
Hands off!

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,151
I must dash.
We're expected in Paris tonight.

81
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,152
That's not the Count.

82
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:10,668
That's his son.

83
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,301
His selfish son.

84
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:15,703
Why say I'm the son of your nephew's...

85
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,225
My cousin's nephew's son.

86
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,871
I can't let any old visitor stay,
you understand?

87
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:21,550
It was a lie, ma'am.

88
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,513
That you'll have to repeat
if anybody asks.

89
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,816
And no more ma'ams, I said.

90
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:28,410
I'm no countess!

91
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,073
Home sweet home.

92
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,484
I'll get changed.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,726
He won't eat you. Just the opposite.

94
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,700
What's his name?

95
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,681
His name's Jeannot.

96
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:56,999
Come on!

97
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:09,980
The fox that was eating our hens.

98
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:13,064
That's good.
You bagged it in the end.

99
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,598
That's your nipper?

100
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,012
The nipper's name is Paul.

101
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,309
My husband. Borel.

102
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,251
Dang, are we in prison here?

103
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,254
- What is it?
- Rabbit.

104
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,095
Don't you recognize it?

105
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,845
It's Jeannot.

106
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,583
That's yucky.

107
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,078
I'll explain.

108
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:06,358
Paul!

109
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,200
All my children slept in here.

110
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,075
Children, ma'am?

111
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,012
Please, stop the ma'ams.

112
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,085
They weren't really mine.

113
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,575
The Lord wouldn't give me my own,

114
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,723
so I looked after other people's kids.

115
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,762
They came up
with the name Mummy Célestine.

116
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:37,262
- Were they orphans?
- No!

117
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,817
You know, sometimes
families can't keep them.

118
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,333
They can put them into care.

119
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,653
Care is for deserted children,
without a family.

120
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,629
There's no shame, being an orphan.

121
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,493
Your dad was raised in care, too.

122
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,059
You didn't know?

123
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,634
How come you know, ma'am?

124
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,884
Somebody said.

125
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:09,829
Coming!

126
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,937
He goes to bed with the chickens.

127
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,433
With the chickens?

128
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:15,652
Get your head down.

129
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,062
It means he goes to bed early.

130
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,073
When not on his rounds in the forest.

131
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:24,628
At night?

132
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,909
Funny things happen
in the forest around here.

133
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,134
Sleep well.

134
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,476
Oh, my.

135
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,986
Will you shut me in, ma'am?

136
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:42,619
And just "will you shut me in"?

137
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,031
Will you shut it?

138
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,641
Why would I?

139
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,278
I might escape.

140
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,887
To escape you have to be locked up.
You're not.

141
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:56,908
With the moon in the forest,
you'd come running back.

142
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:00,868
Sleep well.

143
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:08,656
Come on...

144
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,879
Run for it, boys!

145
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,750
You wanna stay in jail?

146
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,367
Bunch of idiots!

147
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:21,598
You talk to rabbits now?

148
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,837
Close that up
and help me feed the dogs.

149
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:28,992
I don't like dogs.

150
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,420
Scared they'll bite?
Sologne's not for you.

151
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:35,160
They forced me to come.

152
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:37,517
Did they?
Now you're here, get to work.

153
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,051
You can arrest people?

154
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:51,895
Affirmative. A gamekeeper
is the policeman of the forest.

155
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,657
There are thieves in the forest?

156
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:55,735
For sure. Poachers, they're called.

157
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,095
- Poachers?
- Illegal hunters.

158
00:11:58,442 --> 00:11:59,524
Parasites!

159
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,387
Stealing big game.

160
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:04,348
Fish, mushrooms, firewood, everything!

161
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,634
There's one here, Totoche...

162
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,821
- He's the worst.
- What did he do?

163
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,929
The question is,
what hasn't he done?

164
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,819
He'll get what's coming.
I'll nab him red-handed.

165
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:16,900
Straight back to prison.
Penal colony even.

166
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,532
Hold tight!

167
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,082
That's better.

168
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:29,460
Vol-au-Vent!

169
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:32,083
Come on in.

170
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,879
They won't think you're grub or game.

171
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,141
You clumsy oaf! Out!

172
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:50,364
Hurry up!
I'll be late for work at the manor.

173
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:53,068
Fine.

174
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:55,175
- I'll come with you, ma'am.
- No.

175
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,056
The Count doesn't like children.

176
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,070
If you see him coming, run.
Is that clear?

177
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,441
- What do I do?
- Whatever.

178
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,281
Just don't get up to anything.

179
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,744
- I can go for a walk?
- Of course!

180
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,640
Who's Totoche?

181
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,414
Who told you about him?

182
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,845
Your husband, Borel.

183
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,454
He'll send him to a penal colony.

184
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,601
The two of them
fight like cat and dog.

185
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:44,007
But Totoche isn't a bad fellow.

186
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,594
He's just a bit...

187
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,434
How can I put it?

188
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:48,877
Free.

189
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,137
There you go. Truly free.

190
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,769
Unlike Borel,
who sticks to the straight and narrow.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,015
Apparently, Totoche is a poacher.

192
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:01,171
In Sologne, who isn't?
It's tolerated, here.

193
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,547
Add to what you scrape from the earth.

194
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,259
Just to show how free Totoche is...

195
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,929
That's his house over there.

196
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:11,851
There is no house.

197
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,280
There is!

198
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,593
The boat in the nook
behind the trees.

199
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,125
See it?

200
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,433
- There?
- Yes!

201
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:33,117
THE CALL OF THE FOREST

202
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,393
Boy! Boy!

203
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:10,709
Rescue him!

204
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,742
As if I can swim!

205
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:23,681
The idiot! He'll snag in the branches!

206
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,698
No, Boy!

207
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,303
Goddammit!

208
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,078
I've got you.

209
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:35,973
Catch!

210
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:45,319
Come on now.

211
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,025
Come on.

212
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,585
There we are!

213
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,290
Come on, girl.

214
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,007
My little girl!

215
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,164
Where'd you learn to swim?

216
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,970
At the orphanage,
it was bible study or swimming.

217
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:33,337
Why do you call her Boy?

218
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,569
I'd like to learn to fish.

219
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,036
I have no time.

220
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,861
What if I teach you something?

221
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,017
To swim, for example?

222
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:53,345
Look...

223
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,911
It was kind of you to rescue Boy,

224
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:58,093
but I don't want a kid on my hands.

225
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,504
A Parisian especially.

226
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,434
Run along.

227
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,707
Boy!

228
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,485
Come on.

229
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,383
Where are you going?

230
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:16,887
Over to Great Oaks.

231
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,046
With the northerly wind,

232
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:23,640
the pheasants will perch up there.

233
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,249
I'm not the only one who knows.

234
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,179
It's a full moon.

235
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,288
The rogue won't pass up his chance.

236
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,665
But then...

237
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,254
I'll catch him in the act.

238
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,309
Jail for Totoche.

239
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,900
What's that?

240
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:56,426
It's drying.

241
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:57,629
At night?

242
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,046
Look...

243
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,222
Over here.

244
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,017
I found you some togs.

245
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,290
So now you can dress up.

246
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,458
There!

247
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,676
How'd it go?

248
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,275
Not well, apparently.

249
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,257
He'll get what's coming to him.

250
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:18,114
Why get so worked up
over a few rabbits?

251
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,321
A few rabbits?

252
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,207
A few rabbits!

253
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,914
Eat your toast.

254
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:39,773
You again?

255
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,116
Beat it!

256
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,242
Did Borel send you to spy on me?

257
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,953
No, I swear.

258
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,247
Never swear.
Don't you know that?

259
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:48,962
Scram! Vamoose!

260
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,450
- I want to come.
- I don't want you.

261
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:57,093
Boy!

262
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,875
Come here.

263
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,540
Borel was out all night
to put you away for good.

264
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:06,040
I know where you were.
And with who.

265
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:07,875
If you don't take me...

266
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,803
Look here, you runt.
If I'm caught,

267
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:14,606
I'll slit my throat
rather than go behind bars.

268
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,527
I was in jail, too.

269
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:19,406
Don't make me laugh.

270
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,332
An orphanage, it was called.

271
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:32,293
Not a sound.

272
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,817
Good work, Boy. Let's go!

273
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,047
Stop that!

274
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,864
That's poaching?

275
00:21:57,392 --> 00:22:00,043
Poaching? What are you talking about?

276
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:02,938
Who does the game belong to?

277
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,165
One day, on one property.
Next day, on another.

278
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:12,950
What's that?

279
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,676
Didn't I tell you to stay silent?

280
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,378
Sure, but it's...

281
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,875
See those two fingers
at the back of the feet?

282
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,083
That tells you the animal's weight.

283
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,853
10 kg per centimetre.

284
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,580
What's that? 12 cm.

285
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,134
So it's a male.

286
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,790
3-4 years old, 120 kg.

287
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,337
A male what?

288
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:40,933
A hog.

289
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,499
A wild boar,
as city slickers like you would say.

290
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,111
How do you know it's a male?

291
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,541
Look...

292
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:02,382
Thanks.

293
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:03,735
Hold still.

294
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,095
Don't move half a quarter millimetre.

295
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,040
Don't move.

296
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:22,969
That's worth a 10-spot
at the pharmacist's to oil my tonsils.

297
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:24,952
Give me the bag. Quick!

298
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,478
Yes.

299
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,280
C'mon!

300
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,400
Hurry!

301
00:23:58,453 --> 00:23:59,484
Totoche!

302
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,665
Come out, Totoche!

303
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,249
I know you're there.

304
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:06,384
Borel, what's going on?
Why all the racket?

305
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,337
I hoped to see some stags.

306
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:11,481
It's Totoche, my lord.
Another of his snares.

307
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:13,550
You need to press charges.

308
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:16,364
To press charges requires proof.
You have none.

309
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,084
Who says it was Totoche?

310
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:20,107
We're overrun by rabbits.

311
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:22,006
Somebody needs to take care of them.

312
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:25,726
To restrict rabbits,
the best way is fencing.

313
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,046
No, never.

314
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:30,507
No walls, no fences.
It's a forest, not a prison.

315
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:33,335
Stop screaming like a madman in my woods.

316
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,882
Here, walk on the dry part.

317
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:53,305
Be sure not to leave footprints.

318
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,582
Boy!

319
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,408
My sucker punch!

320
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:29,398
Got it?

321
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,333
Against the dogs, we have no chance.

322
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,082
Hooey. They're laid on the stag.

323
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:42,483
- Laden, sir?
- No, laid on.

324
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,423
With the scent
in their snout, on the brain.

325
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,577
Stag, stag, stag!

326
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:48,806
Come on.

327
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,247
Borel's laid on you.

328
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:52,752
Well spotted.

329
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,999
Another blank for the little warden.

330
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,518
Lucien, it's pheasant, the poultry?

331
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:25,212
For sure, it's pheasant.

332
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:27,562
The hunting season's not started.

333
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:30,390
You know the penalty
for dealing in stolen goods?

334
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:33,509
No worries,
they're from cousin Leonard's farm.

335
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,077
Corn-fed, gentlemen.

336
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,167
Corn like lead pellets?

337
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,592
Hi, Lucien.

338
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:45,485
- We've got him.
- Who?

339
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:46,981
Totoche, of course.

340
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:48,702
These snares are his.

341
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:51,558
Not to mention
the prints leading straight to him.

342
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:53,074
You always say that.

343
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:57,001
With the damp ground,
we can't lose the trail.

344
00:26:57,914 --> 00:26:59,517
We've got him!

345
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,150
It's a mystery.

346
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,332
I don't understand
which way he's going.

347
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:13,789
We can't do anything
unless we catch him in the act.

348
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:18,017
Or even the very act.

349
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:19,252
Very.

350
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,082
Did hunters kill it?

351
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,164
No.

352
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,702
Every winter, they just drop.

353
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:50,367
No...

354
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,624
The stag sheds them.

355
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,421
In spring, they grow back.

356
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:56,808
Heck of a surroyal.

357
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,266
A what?

358
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,160
Surroyal. Bay, royal, surroyal,
fork with two tines.

359
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:03,611
A 10-point.

360
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:29,522
Dédé with his barrow!

361
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:39,565
Do you hear that?

362
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,875
Birds, sir?

363
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,468
Not birds, goodness gracious me!

364
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,757
One bird. A warbler!

365
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
And that?

366
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:01,064
- I can't hear a thing.
- Of course, only natural.

367
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,668
Warblers are nicknamed
the sentries of the forest.

368
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:08,715
They sound the alarm
when there's danger.

369
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,259
Poor thing.

370
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:19,934
Good girl.

371
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:21,501
Leave it now.

372
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:23,691
Good girl.

373
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:27,687
Poor bird.

374
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,374
What do you mean? That's life.

375
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:32,860
Life isn't death.

376
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,417
That's precisely it.

377
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,955
For the fox to live,
the pheasant has to die.

378
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:40,633
And for the pheasant to live, well,

379
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,665
insects have to die.

380
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:45,723
For insects to live, plants have to die.

381
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:47,473
That's nature.

382
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:48,942
Life, death, life.

383
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:56,837
There.

384
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,329
My barrow!

385
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:28,655
Lord above!

386
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:36,744
We'll say an angler
gave you the crawfish.

387
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:38,744
Why?

388
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:41,335
He's no fool, Borel.

389
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:44,406
He knows you can't catch them
on your own.

390
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,992
I let you go in the forest
'cause I know who you're with.

391
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,242
It's our little secret.

392
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:57,156
If Borel finds out,
you'll never be allowed out.

393
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,744
You like Totoche?

394
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:02,783
You like him, too.

395
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:07,383
Besides Borel, everyone here likes Totoche.

396
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,066
You more than anyone else?

397
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,956
Cut out the pesky questions.

398
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,281
Who's that above Borel?

399
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,656
My little brother, Guirec.

400
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,153
The day he went to the front.

401
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:27,837
Did he come back?

402
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:29,750
Yes, thank the Lord.

403
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:33,989
My father never came back.

404
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,415
When we die, where do we go?

405
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,813
To heaven, of course.

406
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,926
So why put the dead underground?

407
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,531
They're like the living...

408
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,984
They need a home.

409
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,800
A tomb is a dead person's home.

410
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:56,075
With their name engraved on it.

411
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:59,272
So we can pray and think of them.

412
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,261
My father's in a military cemetery.

413
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:05,917
I never went.

414
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,781
I don't know
where my mother's tomb is.

415
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:33,129
What are you doing here?

416
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:34,495
Who are you?

417
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,736
Answer me!

418
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,747
Thank your husband for the beautiful hare.

419
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,325
It wasn't Borel.

420
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,278
He was out playing the tomcat?

421
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,016
When the cat's away...

422
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:55,601
Who's the boy I saw loitering?

423
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,316
The little Parisian here on vacation.

424
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,020
He won't bother you again.

425
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,515
Does he have a name?

426
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,833
Paul.

427
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:06,625
Paul Lacassagne,
my cousin's nephew's son.

428
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:10,429
Fine.

429
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:19,244
Where is the boy?

430
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:29,375
Where were you so late?

431
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,062
Your father never taught you manners?

432
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,822
My father died in the war.
Leave me alone.

433
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,415
- Come again?
- Stop, both of you!

434
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,414
Stop! Let go of him!

435
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:48,230
I told you to go anywhere but the manor.

436
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,664
Go to your room
and learn some obedience.

437
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,122
If he's unhappy,
he can go back to Paris.

438
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,416
His father died in the war?

439
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:06,233
Yes, poor kid.

440
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:09,705
You said Lacassagne was unfit.

441
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:12,856
Did I?

442
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,478
No, you're confusing him
with my nephew's cousin.

443
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,791
That one...

444
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,786
He's my cousin's nephew's boy.

445
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,843
He's not...

446
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,767
Well, then...

447
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,374
Who taught you?

448
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:49,941
Taught me what?

449
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,728
All about fishing, plants, animals.

450
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:57,251
I picked it up from watching.

451
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:01,166
At your age or smaller,
I was one of ten kids.

452
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,499
Dad says too many mouths
to feed and packs me off

453
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:05,835
to herd cows.

454
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,417
Cowboy?

455
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,500
In America, they call it a cowboy.

456
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:13,328
I'll call it what I want.

457
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,465
With my bundle on a stick...

458
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,108
I moved to a farm
to look after the herds.

459
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:24,326
So by day, I was in the fields,

460
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:27,141
and by dusk,
was back in the stables.

461
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,695
I slept in the straw. Happy.

462
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,261
I was free,
with nobody pestering me.

463
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:38,187
Your parents must've been sad
never to see you.

464
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,640
Not a bit of it.

465
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:42,063
I only went back home a year later.

466
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,790
My mother and father didn't care,
barely said hello.

467
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:48,142
I thought, OK...

468
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:52,291
So long, folks!
And I went my own way again.

469
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:54,293
And ever since, see...

470
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:56,070
I've gone my way.

471
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:00,843
You never really had parents.

472
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,723
I guess not.

473
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,183
So we're the same.

474
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:14,908
It won't stop you growing, you'll see.

475
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,320
Lord of the Loire!
The magnificent salmon. See it?

476
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,416
Yes.

477
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,022
Are we going to fish it, sir?

478
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:32,418
We're going to try.

479
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:35,378
Right here, to snag the fella...

480
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,983
We'll attack from as far as possible.

481
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,181
You stay here and signal to me.

482
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:48,126
I'm counting on you.

483
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,332
It had better not dredge.

484
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:40,937
Got him!

485
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,114
Come on!

486
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:18,644
Dagnammit!

487
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:21,093
He's barely hooked on the lip.

488
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:24,892
Go low, beneath him!

489
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:28,230
Watch out, only one chance!

490
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,934
He's got fight in him.

491
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,273
Dagnammit!

492
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:09,887
Here...

493
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,430
I hereby declare you Knight

494
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:20,398
of the Fly Fishers.

495
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,985
Here we are, to round it off,

496
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,364
beautiful beurre blanc sauce.

497
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:35,450
Hold on.

498
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:37,381
There you go.

499
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:39,697
Rosemary.

500
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:46,987
Célestine always
recites a prayer before meals.

501
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:50,054
Are you in the god squad?

502
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,442
What's that?

503
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:54,231
A choirboy
who slurps the communion wine.

504
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,219
At the orphanage, I refused church.

505
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:58,606
Good for you.

506
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:03,739
Here, you know...

507
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,852
we prefer our wine to our Maker's...

508
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:10,624
Get it?

509
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,106
Sure.

510
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:17,543
Is Célestine coming here?

511
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:18,977
No, why?

512
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,335
The dishcloth.

513
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,533
- What dishcloth?
- The one she hangs at her window.

514
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,055
Listen, you!

515
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,124
There has to be a signal.

516
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:31,102
Or Borel could collar me.

517
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,749
Careful now...

518
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,633
Not a word.

519
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,759
Yes.

520
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,100
And so?

521
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:42,606
So if Borel's in the forest,
I won't go lay my snares.

522
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:43,897
Don't make me laugh.

523
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:45,681
So you go somewhere else.

524
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,156
So, how's your salmon à la Totoche?

525
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:51,562
Super good, sir.

526
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:00,614
That's all we need

527
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,411
- A circus?
- That's no circus.

528
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:07,575
That's a shambles.

529
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,879
I wonder why the Count
lets those wastrels on his land.

530
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,472
They pilfer and pinch,

531
00:43:16,538 --> 00:43:18,559
they swipe anything they come across.

532
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:21,948
You name it.
Mushrooms, game, fish...

533
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:28,153
Like poachers, then.

534
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:32,980
Grab that bottle.

535
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:35,734
Remember that viper?

536
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:39,720
Have a glug.

537
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:43,467
It's good, not for church mice.

538
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,910
Son, now we've toasted, no more sir!

539
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,546
Five or six young fellows

540
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,312
Coming down from Paris

541
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,757
Where'd you get that?

542
00:44:03,153 --> 00:44:04,694
I found it on the ground.

543
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:11,207
Bless us, Lord,
bless the food You gave us,

544
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:13,120
and those who have none.

545
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,374
Amen.

546
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,207
Have some respect for religion.

547
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,155
I'm not in the god squad, me.

548
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:24,921
- I'll slap him.
- Come on, stop squabbling.

549
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,266
Take a look at what I cooked up.

550
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:29,096
Tripe and trotters.

551
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:31,597
- You forgot the ears?
- No.

552
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:33,570
Your ear, Mr. Borel.

553
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:42,889
Want some?

554
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:46,149
You're wrong. It's the best bit.

555
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,207
What a sissy!

556
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:19,303
Heather brooms,
two for the price of one!

557
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:27,856
Hurry.

558
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,332
I'll pay you later.

559
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:32,969
Thanks.

560
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:37,792
Mrs. Borel! A good broom?

561
00:45:38,796 --> 00:45:40,253
Put it you know where!

562
00:45:40,445 --> 00:45:42,610
- Are you talking to me?
- Who else?

563
00:45:42,762 --> 00:45:44,344
You soak! Wine bibber!

564
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,063
I expect you to teach that kid
about more than booze.

565
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:50,266
- He's my responsibility.
- Who is he even?

566
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:52,047
I told you, my nephew's...

567
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:53,805
No, I'm not buying it.

568
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:55,558
Come here.

569
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,207
If it isn't Totoche, the honest trader!

570
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:00,484
At your service.
A good broom for the wife?

571
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:03,365
No?

572
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,652
What do I tell the boy?

573
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:15,106
- I told you to keep out of it.
- Keep out of it?

574
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:16,652
Easy for you to say.

575
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:31,189
That'll teach you to spy on me.

576
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:33,256
Tito, leave him alone.

577
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,525
What's your name?

578
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,955
Paul. And you?

579
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:41,561
My name's Bella.

580
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:44,262
Great timing.
We're dancing for the Count.

581
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,723
Come on.

582
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,999
- How are you?
- Well.

583
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:53,626
Good to see you.

584
00:47:53,946 --> 00:47:55,376
Same here, Joseph.

585
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,460
Guess what I saw. A stag!

586
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:37,337
A giant!
At least 16 points for sure.

587
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,320
I counted them, like you said.

588
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,879
Have you been back at the bottle?

589
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:44,985
Don't make me laugh.

590
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,033
Grab the fry.

591
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,415
Our lucky day! Just what I needed

592
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,147
for the Grandbois Inn.

593
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:18,061
Nice.

594
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:23,238
Can you do the rest of the lines?

595
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:25,197
- Yes.
- Yes?

596
00:50:25,844 --> 00:50:27,796
Here's two more to set up.

597
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:29,953
Keep an eye on the others.

598
00:50:30,547 --> 00:50:32,085
I'll loan you my knife.

599
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:36,677
Watch out.

600
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:38,326
Make sure no one sees you.

601
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:57,314
Stop there!

602
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,450
In the name of the law,
drop your weapon.

603
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,700
Hands up!

604
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,484
Caught in the act.
Poaching!

605
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:14,374
You're in big trouble, son.

606
00:51:14,517 --> 00:51:15,775
Court and all.

607
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:18,469
You'll send me back to jail?

608
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:20,814
- The orphanage?
- No, real prison.

609
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:23,375
Unless you name names.

610
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,033
- No one.
- Really?

611
00:51:26,204 --> 00:51:27,745
So whose is the knife?

612
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,726
- Mine.
- Don't flimflam me!

613
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,343
You're a poacher
and you tell tales?

614
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:35,515
You expect the judge to believe you?

615
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,976
- The judge?
- Walk in front.

616
00:51:47,523 --> 00:51:49,531
I brought you your sneak thief.

617
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:51,554
- What's he done?
- Good question.

618
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,625
He'll tell you
if he has the dignity.

619
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,020
Don't let me catch him
in the forest again.

620
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:58,114
From now on, the wretch

621
00:51:58,278 --> 00:51:59,512
stays with you.

622
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,624
- What about the Count?
- Don't care!

623
00:52:02,524 --> 00:52:05,575
Watch him
or he's on the first train to Paris.

624
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:08,847
What have you done?

625
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:25,342
This time, your goose is cooked.
The kid talked.

626
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,850
What kid?

627
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,812
Don't play me for a fool.

628
00:52:29,281 --> 00:52:30,589
You're going to jail.

629
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:34,343
He spilled the beans.
Your lines, your snares, your scams.

630
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,554
And this here is evidence.

631
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,735
If you have so much proof,
where are the boys in blue?

632
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:41,727
Isn't that the procedure?

633
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,137
I do it my way.
I don't take orders from you.

634
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,166
What's that?

635
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:53,986
That's...

636
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:56,730
- A lamp by the looks of it.
- A lamp?

637
00:52:56,978 --> 00:53:00,105
- For night-time poaching.
- No, Mr. Borel, not at all.

638
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,933
It's a navy lamp.

639
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:04,699
For sailing on the Loire in the fog.

640
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,992
The kid's mine. He's mine, hear me?

641
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:11,820
Stay away from him.

642
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:13,070
Or else!

643
00:53:24,281 --> 00:53:26,640
The Count's daughter is a super rider.

644
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:31,031
What are you talking about?
The Count's daughter is dead.

645
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:32,350
Are you sure?

646
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,540
Of course!

647
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,915
If you see the Count,
never mention his daughter.

648
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,208
Never!

649
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,450
It'd be too much emotion for him.

650
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:44,953
Fine.

651
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:56,772
Well?

652
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,689
I gave you a fright?

653
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,642
Yes, sir, a bit.

654
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,749
Looking at the trophies?

655
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:09,197
The 12-point with the black surroyal.

656
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,330
12-point? Surroyal?

657
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,469
Who taught you that?

658
00:54:14,494 --> 00:54:15,660
Borel, sir.

659
00:54:16,056 --> 00:54:18,082
At your age, I didn't know that.

660
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:21,548
This one is indeed a 12-point.

661
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,561
That was epic.

662
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,754
We lost him.
He jinked to make the pack throw up.

663
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,688
What do you mean, throw up?

664
00:54:29,973 --> 00:54:31,347
It's a stag's ploy.

665
00:54:31,937 --> 00:54:36,085
It lures the pack to other animals
so the hounds lose its scent.

666
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:39,348
We found a way around it.

667
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,019
Paul, come down here!

668
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,959
Leave him, Célestine. He's no bother.

669
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:51,317
You're really so interested
in hunting and animals?

670
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:53,037
Animals, yes.

671
00:54:53,062 --> 00:54:55,528
Come here, I'll show you something.

672
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:00,317
Why are they all dressed up like that?

673
00:55:01,304 --> 00:55:04,348
On a stag hunt,
we dress up, as you say.

674
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,262
It's an age-old tradition.

675
00:55:07,398 --> 00:55:09,085
Why not use a shotgun?

676
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:13,582
For an animal like that,
it can only be a blade. Nothing else.

677
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:14,805
Look...

678
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,981
The 15-point. The finest stag
ever taken on our land.

679
00:55:20,343 --> 00:55:21,921
Never any bigger?

680
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:25,867
It is said

681
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,624
there's a monarch.

682
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,415
A monarch?

683
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:33,887
With 17, perhaps even 18 points.

684
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:36,759
A great and noble traveller

685
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,040
who ventures occasionally
onto our lands.

686
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,411
It must be a legend.
Nobody ever saw it for real.

687
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:49,822
What did you discuss?

688
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,681
Hunting, stags.

689
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:57,689
- I want to see Totoche.
- Borel's forbidden you to go.

690
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,803
We don't have to tell him.

691
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,983
Soon, with school,
you'll have no time for Totoche.

692
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,499
School?

693
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:11,189
You expected the vacation
to last till Christmas?

694
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:15,509
You mean you're keeping me?

695
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,624
Children!

696
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:36,733
Madeléine, Hermine, turn around!

697
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,080
Now, then...

698
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:40,884
Sit down!

699
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,891
Children...

700
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:44,754
Silence, you two chatterboxes.

701
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,582
Children, this is Paul Lacassagne,

702
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:50,397
your new classmate from Paris.

703
00:56:51,497 --> 00:56:52,929
Silence, please!

704
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:54,917
Paul, Michel's seat.

705
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:57,882
Michel, back a row next to Olivier.

706
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,751
I hope you enjoyed your vacation.

707
00:57:02,543 --> 00:57:04,634
Take out a sheet of paper...

708
00:57:38,356 --> 00:57:40,379
Boy, come on.

709
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:57,266
Happy the man who, like Ulysses,

710
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,187
has made a fine journey

711
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:15,751
Or like he who...

712
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,279
So, friend? Life treating you well?

713
00:59:21,837 --> 00:59:23,860
Can't complain, my lord. Thank you.

714
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:26,267
Rich pickings?

715
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,220
It's not what it was.

716
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:31,558
So I see.

717
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:33,914
I could press charges.

718
00:59:34,406 --> 00:59:36,085
For a few mushrooms?

719
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:40,273
It grieves me to say, we were freer
in the days of kings.

720
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:44,141
Rabbits, why not,
but ceps are rarer.

721
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:45,684
Especially this year.

722
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,335
Who came up with that?

723
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:48,641
My gamekeeper.

724
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:49,722
Borel!

725
00:59:49,871 --> 00:59:54,037
Rather than torment fellows like me,
he should look after your land.

726
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:55,209
Your oak trunks

727
00:59:55,234 --> 00:59:57,399
by Closefontaine
are full of termites.

728
00:59:57,778 --> 00:59:59,117
- Really?
- Yes!

729
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,160
Let's take a look.

730
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,908
Borel doesn't know the mushroom spots.
Ceps are everywhere.

731
01:00:09,254 --> 01:00:10,619
It was obvious.

732
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:13,533
Hail on St. Simeon's day,
mushrooms on St. Giles's.

733
01:00:14,048 --> 01:00:15,131
Want some?

734
01:00:16,235 --> 01:00:18,150
I prefer girolles, to be honest.

735
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,095
A girolle omelette. Pure bliss!

736
01:00:21,536 --> 01:00:23,036
We have similar tastes.

737
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,707
Madeleine, my cook, always ruins them.

738
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:27,234
Too dry, too flat.

739
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:29,926
Perhaps she lets the butter go too dark.

740
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,683
It's ready when it's good and golden.

741
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,489
Next time, ask Célestine to make it.

742
01:00:35,777 --> 01:00:37,333
The omelette queen!

743
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:41,859
The poacher entertained
by the gamekeeper's wife.

744
01:00:42,173 --> 01:00:43,464
How amusing!

745
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,986
By the way,
you know she's taken in...

746
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:48,844
a Parisian boy?

747
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:50,921
A Parisian boy?

748
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:54,400
I feel like I know him. It's odd.

749
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:59,361
The lad even claims
to have seen my famous monarch.

750
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:02,761
The 18-pointer's a legend, you know.

751
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:05,931
I wonder sometimes
if it might be based in fact.

752
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,387
Pitch black tonight.

753
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:27,454
Perfect night for lamp work.

754
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:29,797
I bet he's out there.

755
01:01:31,536 --> 01:01:33,493
Poaching with a lamp
isn't his style.

756
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:36,590
Yeah? I saw the lamp
he was working on.

757
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:40,296
As we speak,
he's tracking rabbits in Poigny.

758
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,105
He's in for a surprise.

759
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,391
I'll catch him in the act.

760
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:46,707
From Grandbois Inn,
I'll call the coppers,

761
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:49,251
they'll bag Totoche and his booty.

762
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,947
Not so loud. You'll wake the boy.

763
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,069
The boy, as you say...

764
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:56,181
He looks like a bad'un.

765
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,434
Naturally, you don't see a thing.

766
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:02,233
No, believe me,

767
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:06,189
it's time to rid the country
of that raggedy old vermin.

768
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:14,188
All right, I see!

769
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:16,958
I'm allowed a drink now and then.

770
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:25,668
Easy. If I'm going to collar the guy,
I need to walk straight.

771
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,406
There.

772
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,629
Last one, why not.

773
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,249
One for the road.

774
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,374
Then I'll be going.

775
01:02:54,903 --> 01:02:56,069
Come on.

776
01:03:17,204 --> 01:03:18,501
Borel's on his way.

777
01:03:19,156 --> 01:03:21,212
You out here at night?

778
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,457
What's in that brain of yours?

779
01:03:23,626 --> 01:03:25,274
You could've caught a bullet!

780
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,597
I was scared.

781
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:32,209
- Scared?
- Borel said he'd put you in prison.

782
01:03:32,234 --> 01:03:34,835
He's not been born,
the man who'll put me in prison.

783
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,695
Not born. You hear me?

784
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:44,523
It was Borel.
I said nothing about poaching.

785
01:03:44,548 --> 01:03:46,835
- Not a word.
- I never doubted you.

786
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:49,298
You're a good little fella.

787
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:52,536
But never do that to me again.
Hear me?

788
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:56,434
What would Célestine say
if you had an accident?

789
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:01,816
Take him home.

790
01:04:02,624 --> 01:04:03,884
It's over now.

791
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:07,795
C'mon, son.

792
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:09,650
I don't have my barrow.

793
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:15,337
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm fine.

794
01:04:23,481 --> 01:04:25,567
- A good drive, Mr. Bertrand?
- Yes!

795
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,034
Thank you.

796
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,421
Afternoon, your lordship.

797
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,915
- Afternoon, father.
- Bertrand.

798
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,040
I invited some friends back.

799
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,707
So I see.

800
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:10,265
Champagne! Pour it out, Armand.

801
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:52,736
Dearest Célestine,

802
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,207
I dreamed of a wedding at Herteignes,

803
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,033
in my village church.

804
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,382
Amid my family and friends.

805
01:05:59,974 --> 01:06:02,171
It was not to be, as you know.

806
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:05,725
The best day of my life
was tinged with sadness

807
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,163
without you.

808
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,457
You'll find enclosed the wedding photo.

809
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,517
With all my love,
hoping to see you in Paris one day...

810
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:13,916
Your Mathilde.

811
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:26,066
Why the long face?
What's wrong?

812
01:06:26,203 --> 01:06:27,736
Who's on this photo?

813
01:06:29,622 --> 01:06:31,540
- Give me that.
- No, explain first.

814
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,457
Give me that photo now!

815
01:06:33,538 --> 01:06:34,662
Give me it!

816
01:06:38,971 --> 01:06:41,220
My mother was Mathilde.
Like the bride.

817
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:43,700
That's why I'm here?

818
01:06:43,814 --> 01:06:45,637
My mother was from the village?

819
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,937
- You knew her?
- That's not it.

820
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:48,831
What is?

821
01:06:48,856 --> 01:06:50,734
First, don't rummage in my drawers.

822
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,110
I don't care!

823
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:55,457
- I have a right to know.
- We'll talk later.

824
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:56,598
I'm too...

825
01:06:56,672 --> 01:07:00,184
I'm too shaken up.
Let me get my thoughts straight.

826
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,703
I'm sick of you!

827
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:03,281
Of all of you!

828
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:10,910
Look who it is!

829
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,489
Have you seen Totoche?

830
01:07:12,622 --> 01:07:13,708
No.

831
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,908
Hop in.
You want a ride in my barrow?

832
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:27,708
Something's bugging your head.

833
01:07:31,062 --> 01:07:32,269
Is it school?

834
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:36,093
Say, Dédé, how long have you lived here?

835
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:38,789
Back a while.

836
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,398
You never met any Mathildes?

837
01:07:45,366 --> 01:07:47,710
This one girl wanted a ride

838
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:49,375
all the way to school.

839
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,207
She called me Brow!

840
01:07:54,906 --> 01:07:56,196
She's gone now.

841
01:07:56,468 --> 01:07:57,796
Gone where?

842
01:07:58,184 --> 01:07:59,484
Gone.

843
01:08:00,054 --> 01:08:01,125
Upstairs.

844
01:08:06,859 --> 01:08:08,015
Come back.

845
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:01,195
What brings you snooping here?

846
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,509
Looking for my mother's grave.

847
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:07,292
Dédé told me...

848
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:08,691
"Dédé told me"!

849
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:11,762
You're listening to his imaginings now.

850
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:14,826
Supposing your mother's here...

851
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,303
Where does that leave you?

852
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,173
After stone, you'll dig in the earth?

853
01:09:22,736 --> 01:09:24,353
Know what you'll find?

854
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:26,983
Rotten bones, stinking carcasses.

855
01:09:28,212 --> 01:09:29,947
- It's what you want?
- No.

856
01:09:32,504 --> 01:09:34,514
Let's run along now.
We'll be back soon enough.

857
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:35,839
Or I will.

858
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:45,234
For pity's sake,
chase the dark ideas from your nut!

859
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:47,953
Life is beautiful when it wants to be.

860
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:50,793
But it flies by.
Make the most of it.

861
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:57,437
Every day of the week

862
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:59,601
Cuckolds walk the streets

863
01:09:59,852 --> 01:10:01,976
Cuckold! Cuckold! Cuck!

864
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:04,459
- Know what a cuckold is?
- No.

865
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:23,696
Paul, do you want to talk?

866
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:31,889
Where would talking get us?

867
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:35,072
I don't know.

868
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:37,394
Nowhere, believe me.

869
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,040
Life's beautiful, not rotten carcasses.

870
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:05,999
Have you seen our great stag again?

871
01:11:06,127 --> 01:11:07,127
The monarch?

872
01:11:07,384 --> 01:11:08,550
No.

873
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:13,148
If he's on our land,
my dogs'll flush him out at some point.

874
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:15,585
Is he sick?

875
01:11:16,122 --> 01:11:18,255
No, like me, he's old and weary.

876
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,898
Like an old mare.

877
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,614
He was my daughter's horse.

878
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:26,957
Nobody's ridden him since...

879
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:30,455
Since she left us.

880
01:11:35,142 --> 01:11:38,283
You'd like to learn to ride,
young Lacassagne?

881
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:42,416
I asked you a question.

882
01:11:42,606 --> 01:11:44,697
- That's not my real name.
- Isn't it?

883
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,925
I thought it was.

884
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,939
My real name's Caradec.

885
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,462
Just think,
what a way to find out!

886
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:04,822
Yes, of course.

887
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,707
That's right. Of course.

888
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:07,789
I'm sorry.

889
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:09,790
Do you even realize?

890
01:12:10,301 --> 01:12:12,572
I didn't mean any harm
by taking him in.

891
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:15,250
You knew who he was, didn't you?

892
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:18,590
Yes. I'm so sorry.

893
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:20,359
Sorry for what, Célestine?

894
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:22,200
For hiding all that from you.

895
01:12:23,562 --> 01:12:25,570
And Paul, what does he know?

896
01:12:25,794 --> 01:12:26,960
Nothing.

897
01:12:28,025 --> 01:12:29,533
I couldn't find the words.

898
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,540
That's good.

899
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,561
We'll let him make his own way.

900
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:41,735
Thank you, Célestine.

901
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:44,181
For bringing him back to me.

902
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:03,071
You disappeared.
Where've you been?

903
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:05,895
At school.

904
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:07,926
Lucky you.

905
01:13:08,595 --> 01:13:10,087
I don't go to school.

906
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:14,790
Come on.

907
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:32,030
It's nothing, just a stag bellowing.

908
01:13:33,587 --> 01:13:34,955
What does it mean?

909
01:13:37,966 --> 01:13:39,153
He's in love.

910
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:48,606
This time I saw it. The great stag.

911
01:14:49,259 --> 01:14:52,133
Is that so?
How come only you ever see it?

912
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,160
It wasn't only me.

913
01:14:55,817 --> 01:14:57,691
A doe sees the great stag!

914
01:14:58,132 --> 01:14:59,598
That doesn't count.

915
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,578
You don't believe me? Come on, then.

916
01:15:02,989 --> 01:15:04,905
Can't you see I'm working?

917
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:08,749
I don't want kids around here
if Borel comes. Go on!

918
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,425
Run along, both of you.

919
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,288
We hardly ever go over there.

920
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:24,541
Minaudière Pond?

921
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:25,664
No.

922
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:39,862
"No less than 18 points,

923
01:15:39,887 --> 01:15:42,218
"like a crown on its head.

924
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:46,275
"The king of the forest
lived hidden in the thick woods."

925
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,649
It's no good?

926
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:52,699
Sure, it is. It's very pretty.

927
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:57,048
Tell me, this stag, the monarch...

928
01:15:57,736 --> 01:16:00,095
You saw it for real or imagined it?

929
01:16:00,277 --> 01:16:01,818
I saw it as I see you now.

930
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:03,624
For the second time.

931
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:07,631
Look, Paul,

932
01:16:07,656 --> 01:16:09,530
don't mention the stag to anyone.

933
01:16:09,853 --> 01:16:11,025
Hear me?

934
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:12,371
Not a soul.

935
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,664
You've seen it too?

936
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:20,230
The first time was five years ago.

937
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:26,054
He comes here every year
to rest up in a secret spot.

938
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:27,720
After the rutting season.

939
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:29,551
He needs protecting.

940
01:16:29,742 --> 01:16:31,343
How can we protect a stag?

941
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:33,570
By telling no one about it.

942
01:16:34,004 --> 01:16:35,545
Definitely not the Count.

943
01:16:49,976 --> 01:16:51,081
Armand.

944
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,355
Pull over.

945
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,009
Yes, sir.

946
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:57,926
Get in.

947
01:16:58,173 --> 01:17:00,131
You'll catch cold.

948
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:04,624
This isn't a 12-pointer,
it's a 15-horsepower.

949
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,950
So, is school going well?

950
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,332
Not bad.

951
01:17:09,523 --> 01:17:11,679
The teacher says I'm a dreamer.

952
01:17:11,704 --> 01:17:14,078
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

953
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:18,094
What do you want to do in life?

954
01:17:18,317 --> 01:17:19,395
I don't know.

955
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:36,189
As a forest warden perhaps?

956
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,735
A gamekeeper?

957
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:40,989
I don't want to chase after poachers.

958
01:17:42,884 --> 01:17:45,425
So perhaps you'd like to be a poacher?

959
01:17:47,155 --> 01:17:48,904
You're right. More fun.

960
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:54,410
Yes, find the scent. Find it.

961
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:57,320
That's good. Find it.

962
01:17:57,454 --> 01:18:00,500
I have a perfect line.
Like in a dream, my lord.

963
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,912
Is it him?
You saw him for yourself?

964
01:18:02,937 --> 01:18:03,891
Affirmative.

965
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:06,446
It's not an 18.
It's a 17-point, no less.

966
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,124
I found it with Vol-au-Vent.

967
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:10,344
You should've seen the dog tugging.

968
01:18:10,606 --> 01:18:12,813
Vol-au-Vent's never wrong. Let's go.

969
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:17,379
Father?

970
01:18:17,523 --> 01:18:19,051
May I join the hunt?

971
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:21,830
Hunting in a dressing gown?

972
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:54,918
Pack up!

973
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:57,651
Good, Vol-au-Vent!

974
01:18:57,676 --> 01:18:59,234
Forward!

975
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:52,366
Away!

976
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:57,930
Yes, Tapageaut! The line!

977
01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:59,334
The line!

978
01:20:59,861 --> 01:21:01,603
Vol-au-Vent, the line!

979
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,207
Find it!

980
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,850
Find it, for goodness' sake!

981
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,165
Come on, dogs!

982
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:33,208
Your lordship, upstream!

983
01:21:33,778 --> 01:21:36,040
Hurry!
Before we lose him.

984
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:40,114
My lord, it's the end.

985
01:22:42,148 --> 01:22:43,313
In the water!

986
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,915
In the water, boys!

987
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,165
Strike without delay, my lord.

988
01:23:03,348 --> 01:23:04,531
It could recover.

989
01:23:04,556 --> 01:23:07,012
Like the 12-pointer we lost in Vaucquois.

990
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:24,891
You were right about the stag.

991
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,460
- You saw him?
- You bet!

992
01:23:26,603 --> 01:23:28,148
One imperial fellow!

993
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,727
The Count and Borel hunted him down,

994
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:32,475
drove in for the kill.

995
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,749
And they did it?

996
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,790
They cornered him in a pond.

997
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,018
And then...

998
01:23:37,098 --> 01:23:40,425
The Count, whose lifelong dream
was that trophy...

999
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:41,627
What then?

1000
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,071
He gave him best.

1001
01:24:55,851 --> 01:24:57,328
At my age,

1002
01:24:58,169 --> 01:25:01,445
this sort of thing
is often the beginning of the end.

1003
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,239
Don't exaggerate.

1004
01:25:05,252 --> 01:25:07,025
I worry about my estate.

1005
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:13,852
There's nobody
capable of running it like you.

1006
01:25:14,504 --> 01:25:15,753
Nobody.

1007
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,406
Nobody worthy of your trust.

1008
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:23,496
What have you done to inspire trust?

1009
01:25:25,283 --> 01:25:27,407
Have you worked once in your life?

1010
01:25:31,687 --> 01:25:33,117
Coming from you...

1011
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:39,310
You refused funding
for my automobile business.

1012
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:40,417
Business?

1013
01:25:43,992 --> 01:25:45,562
You'd have helped my sister.

1014
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,665
One question preys on my mind.

1015
01:25:59,036 --> 01:26:00,497
The great stag...

1016
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,311
Why give it best?

1017
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:05,219
Why?

1018
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:08,275
For what it gave me.

1019
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:12,308
Intruder! Out!

1020
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,064
I asked for him.

1021
01:26:15,059 --> 01:26:16,208
Come in.

1022
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:25,600
Closer.

1023
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,494
Here's what you asked for.

1024
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:36,409
Thank you, Célestine.

1025
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:44,445
Do you like hot chocolate?

1026
01:26:45,961 --> 01:26:46,961
Here.

1027
01:26:47,509 --> 01:26:49,383
Don't spoil him, my lord.

1028
01:26:50,348 --> 01:26:51,520
Why not?

1029
01:26:56,541 --> 01:26:57,832
Who's that?

1030
01:26:59,609 --> 01:27:01,718
- My lady.
- Your lady?

1031
01:27:02,267 --> 01:27:03,492
My wife.

1032
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:06,383
She succumbed to Spanish flu.

1033
01:27:07,981 --> 01:27:10,063
Everybody's dead in your family.

1034
01:27:12,508 --> 01:27:13,757
No!

1035
01:27:24,346 --> 01:27:25,439
Mr. Bertrand?

1036
01:27:26,298 --> 01:27:27,298
Borel.

1037
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,016
Know where we can find it?

1038
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:31,625
No, I've lost track of it.

1039
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,207
So go back out there.

1040
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:36,019
Scour the estate with the dogs.

1041
01:27:36,044 --> 01:27:37,793
The Count gave it best.

1042
01:27:37,968 --> 01:27:39,550
Don't argue with my orders.

1043
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:41,266
Well,

1044
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:45,085
until the stag is flushed out,
let's turn our fire on the ducks.

1045
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,374
Killing a heron!

1046
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,367
A curse on you!

1047
01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:35,687
Clear off, you witch!

1048
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:37,742
And you! Go to hell!

1049
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,445
Here, hold this.

1050
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:45,054
Damn it!

1051
01:28:46,126 --> 01:28:47,423
I'm coming, Bertrand.

1052
01:29:07,695 --> 01:29:09,007
Where is the witch?

1053
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,757
The heron...

1054
01:29:15,278 --> 01:29:16,585
You'll blame us for it?

1055
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:19,068
- The gypsies?
- I want you gone by tomorrow.

1056
01:29:19,283 --> 01:29:21,048
Brats, women and all.

1057
01:29:21,468 --> 01:29:22,967
Your father won't allow it.

1058
01:29:23,135 --> 01:29:24,837
From now on, I decide.

1059
01:29:25,328 --> 01:29:26,952
Things will change around here.

1060
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:40,675
What does that mean?

1061
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:43,754
I'll teach you to read and write.

1062
01:29:44,293 --> 01:29:45,792
B and P.

1063
01:29:46,296 --> 01:29:48,257
As in Bella and Paul.

1064
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:51,021
B.

1065
01:29:51,184 --> 01:29:52,225
And P.

1066
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,624
Have you ever had a love kiss?

1067
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:57,883
A real one?

1068
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:02,208
Neither real, nor fake.
All I ever got were thumps and slaps.

1069
01:30:03,283 --> 01:30:04,574
I'll teach you.

1070
01:30:11,392 --> 01:30:13,658
My little Paul didn't come today.

1071
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,548
He'd tire you out.

1072
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,422
On the contrary.

1073
01:30:18,883 --> 01:30:21,122
I find it restful, talking to him.

1074
01:30:21,898 --> 01:30:22,898
Anyway...

1075
01:30:23,978 --> 01:30:26,068
I don't have long left
to get to know him.

1076
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:27,564
Come now.

1077
01:30:37,001 --> 01:30:39,923
You're wondering
why the Count protects us?

1078
01:30:40,298 --> 01:30:41,587
Tell him, Granny.

1079
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:44,481
When he was a young man,

1080
01:30:44,577 --> 01:30:48,512
the Count fell in love
with a beautiful gypsy, too.

1081
01:30:50,393 --> 01:30:53,226
His parents did all they could
to drive them apart,

1082
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:55,196
and stop them getting married.

1083
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,301
Then it started over.

1084
01:31:01,181 --> 01:31:02,222
What?

1085
01:31:02,952 --> 01:31:04,909
The Count with his daughter.

1086
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:08,429
He wanted to stop her wedding.

1087
01:31:08,658 --> 01:31:09,949
His dead daughter?

1088
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:12,929
Yes, his daughter, Mathilde.

1089
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:39,031
Your mother was the first baby I cared for.

1090
01:31:40,434 --> 01:31:41,739
I can see her now.

1091
01:31:42,109 --> 01:31:43,649
Little Mathilde.

1092
01:31:45,997 --> 01:31:47,895
The Count was besotted with her.

1093
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:49,872
She meant everything to him.

1094
01:31:54,113 --> 01:31:56,028
Mathilde met a young man.

1095
01:31:57,344 --> 01:31:58,344
Jean.

1096
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,206
Your daddy.

1097
01:32:02,218 --> 01:32:03,851
And fell in love with him.

1098
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:06,665
Deeply in love.

1099
01:32:08,059 --> 01:32:09,308
He was a snipe.

1100
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,332
What's a snipe?

1101
01:32:12,555 --> 01:32:16,382
He worked on the railroads,
came to lay track in the forest.

1102
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:20,262
With your mother
riding across the property...

1103
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,254
That's how they met.

1104
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:26,869
They loved each other
in secret in a hut.

1105
01:32:27,653 --> 01:32:29,235
In the middle of the forest.

1106
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:35,270
When he found out,
the Count kept them apart.

1107
01:32:36,252 --> 01:32:37,876
He even called the police.

1108
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:39,817
Your mother was underage.

1109
01:32:40,465 --> 01:32:42,672
They eloped together to Paris.

1110
01:32:45,757 --> 01:32:48,179
Your parents' love was more beautiful

1111
01:32:49,098 --> 01:32:50,889
and stronger than anything else.

1112
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:55,567
War broke out.

1113
01:32:58,052 --> 01:32:59,661
Your daddy went away.

1114
01:33:01,486 --> 01:33:03,283
And he died at the front.

1115
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,036
And you were born.

1116
01:33:10,414 --> 01:33:13,038
- And my mother died because of it.
- No!

1117
01:33:13,591 --> 01:33:16,481
Don't believe such a thing.
You're in no way to blame.

1118
01:33:17,322 --> 01:33:19,176
The doctors couldn't save her.

1119
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:26,528
The Count was grief-stricken,
screaming like a wounded animal.

1120
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:30,903
He'd ignored her letters.

1121
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,457
He'd refused to see her.

1122
01:33:38,757 --> 01:33:41,506
And it was in a coffin
that she came home.

1123
01:33:50,603 --> 01:33:52,751
Why didn't you tell me before?

1124
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:56,791
You know, sometimes...

1125
01:33:58,953 --> 01:34:01,160
We make mountains out of molehills.

1126
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:03,625
I was scared I wouldn't find the words.

1127
01:35:42,094 --> 01:35:43,750
Now you know.

1128
01:35:48,416 --> 01:35:50,048
Your mother is so beautiful.

1129
01:35:50,073 --> 01:35:51,408
Was beautiful.

1130
01:35:56,212 --> 01:35:58,080
- I know how you feel.
- Don't care!

1131
01:35:58,723 --> 01:36:00,423
She needed your love before.

1132
01:36:01,572 --> 01:36:03,220
When she was still alive.

1133
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,392
You drove her away,
refused to see her.

1134
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:13,236
You didn't go to her wedding.

1135
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:15,999
You're right.

1136
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,700
When I realized,

1137
01:36:19,621 --> 01:36:21,028
it was too late.

1138
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:25,668
I couldn't understand my daughter.

1139
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,262
Or accept her happiness.

1140
01:36:29,627 --> 01:36:31,330
I made everybody unhappy.

1141
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:41,494
Now you're here.

1142
01:36:43,805 --> 01:36:45,812
And you need to be loved.

1143
01:36:51,746 --> 01:36:52,934
Come here.

1144
01:36:57,304 --> 01:36:58,632
My little Paul.

1145
01:37:03,992 --> 01:37:05,476
I ask your forgiveness.

1146
01:37:07,252 --> 01:37:08,830
Please forgive me, son.

1147
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,790
Grandfather!

1148
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:35,192
Back!

1149
01:37:35,773 --> 01:37:38,012
Hold tight! Tight!

1150
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:40,989
Back, Lucifer!

1151
01:38:42,027 --> 01:38:43,606
Embrace your grandfather.

1152
01:39:17,657 --> 01:39:19,531
Can you deliver this from me?

1153
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:22,336
He'd prefer that to flowers.

1154
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,531
You won't come?

1155
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:27,775
Me, funerals and churches...

1156
01:39:28,751 --> 01:39:30,167
It's not my department.

1157
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,861
Give the boy a hug.

1158
01:39:32,169 --> 01:39:33,947
He doesn't like hugs, remember?

1159
01:39:35,918 --> 01:39:37,770
Do whatever the heck you want.

1160
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,374
Just tell him.

1161
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:58,288
My condolences, sir.

1162
01:40:00,313 --> 01:40:01,396
Thank you.

1163
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,611
My sincere condolences, Mr. Bertrand.

1164
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:15,758
Sir.

1165
01:40:17,676 --> 01:40:19,754
Your late father's signet ring.

1166
01:40:39,121 --> 01:40:40,121
You see?

1167
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,016
We're here.

1168
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:44,926
Where the river marks
the property's northern boundary.

1169
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:47,937
We'll continue construction
of the wall up ahead.

1170
01:40:48,192 --> 01:40:50,143
Where there's no natural boundary.

1171
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:52,683
No! I refuse
to leave this portion open

1172
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:53,980
to every type

1173
01:40:54,374 --> 01:40:56,272
- of intruder.
- The river, sir.

1174
01:40:56,297 --> 01:40:58,796
The river can be crossed at several points.

1175
01:40:59,765 --> 01:41:02,805
I don't want anyone
waltzing in as they please.

1176
01:41:03,059 --> 01:41:05,164
The perimeter wall must surround

1177
01:41:06,132 --> 01:41:07,589
the grounds in full.

1178
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:11,593
Know what his wall means?
It means death.

1179
01:41:13,244 --> 01:41:14,751
Why's the wall so bad?

1180
01:41:14,906 --> 01:41:16,363
Large animals,

1181
01:41:16,468 --> 01:41:19,425
like boars, deer, stags,
they need space.

1182
01:41:19,595 --> 01:41:22,377
One season, they're in one spot.
Then they move.

1183
01:41:22,403 --> 01:41:24,027
For food, but not only.

1184
01:41:24,054 --> 01:41:27,455
After rutting, stags need vitamins
for their antlers.

1185
01:41:28,294 --> 01:41:31,504
That takes them anywhere,
coming and going.

1186
01:41:33,126 --> 01:41:35,962
Yes. With his damn wall, it's over.

1187
01:41:35,987 --> 01:41:38,322
No more mushrooms or chestnuts!

1188
01:41:39,462 --> 01:41:41,368
No more firewood!
Nothing!

1189
01:41:44,577 --> 01:41:46,335
He can't ban everything.

1190
01:41:46,461 --> 01:41:50,293
Dédé, at least try to understand.
It will be shut in! Over!

1191
01:41:52,017 --> 01:41:53,876
They won't get away with it!

1192
01:41:57,302 --> 01:41:58,434
Come on.

1193
01:42:05,046 --> 01:42:06,170
Silence!

1194
01:42:06,455 --> 01:42:08,515
The son's out to kill the great stag.

1195
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:10,936
He blames it for the Count's death.

1196
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:12,132
A fine excuse.

1197
01:42:12,632 --> 01:42:15,265
The idiot has found where it beds.

1198
01:42:15,752 --> 01:42:16,752
Well...

1199
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,611
The stag was given best.

1200
01:42:18,986 --> 01:42:21,185
Killing a pardoned animal is sacrilege.

1201
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:22,709
We have to prevent it.

1202
01:42:22,734 --> 01:42:24,317
Borel! Come on!

1203
01:42:29,754 --> 01:42:31,420
Raving imbecile!

1204
01:42:55,931 --> 01:42:57,264
C'mon, Borel!

1205
01:42:58,478 --> 01:42:59,894
It's cornered!

1206
01:43:06,618 --> 01:43:07,618
Go!

1207
01:43:16,382 --> 01:43:17,382
No, sir!

1208
01:43:34,071 --> 01:43:35,237
Back!

1209
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:39,599
Tapageaut!

1210
01:43:39,624 --> 01:43:40,873
Vol-Au-Vent!

1211
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,884
Yes, good dogs!

1212
01:44:14,163 --> 01:44:15,287
You're fired.

1213
01:44:19,142 --> 01:44:20,283
Fired!

1214
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,540
Where will you live now?

1215
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:25,539
Romorantin, with my sister.

1216
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:26,874
In town?

1217
01:44:27,704 --> 01:44:29,830
It will hurt to leave all this.

1218
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:32,527
Poor Borel, I'll miss you.

1219
01:44:32,552 --> 01:44:33,856
It's mutual.

1220
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:36,400
We'll miss you, too.

1221
01:44:37,895 --> 01:44:40,106
Old brother, since you're leaving,

1222
01:44:40,416 --> 01:44:41,600
let's swap boots.

1223
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:42,665
Our boots?

1224
01:44:43,926 --> 01:44:45,317
My sucker punch!

1225
01:44:45,375 --> 01:44:49,374
Very useful when boys in blue
or gamekeepers are after you. Look.

1226
01:44:52,388 --> 01:44:53,513
Dirtbucket!

1227
01:44:53,538 --> 01:44:56,745
They're yours. You leaving
will be like coming back.

1228
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:58,352
You dirtbucket!

1229
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:01,624
Mr. Germain Borel?

1230
01:45:18,364 --> 01:45:19,912
What are they doing here?

1231
01:45:19,937 --> 01:45:21,645
I asked them to come.

1232
01:45:22,227 --> 01:45:24,226
We were expecting you, Mr. de la Fresnaye.

1233
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:27,531
Please sit for the reading
of your father's testament.

1234
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,777
"I, the undersigned,

1235
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,287

Very good, counsel.

1255
01:46:56,137 --> 01:46:57,469
And the rest?

1256
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,366
Wait!

1257
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:26,751
Come back to see us, Uncle Bertrand.

1258
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:32,070
The grounds are open to all now.

1259
01:47:39,846 --> 01:47:41,345
Goodbye, Mr. Bertrand.

1260
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,754
Take care.

1261
01:47:51,436 --> 01:47:52,810
My little Paul!

1262
01:48:21,228 --> 01:48:22,394
Hey, guys!

1263
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:25,290
Guess what!

1264
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,499
The kid...

1265
01:48:26,634 --> 01:48:28,048
Paul, I should say...

1266
01:48:28,073 --> 01:48:31,393
He's been named sole legatee.

1267
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:33,207
Something like that.

1268
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:36,457
He's inherited the house
and the grounds.

1269
01:48:36,786 --> 01:48:38,583
The forest, the great stag,

1270
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,124
it's all saved.

1271
01:48:44,728 --> 01:48:46,061
A whole sounder.

1272
01:48:47,017 --> 01:48:50,119
15 pigs, 3 sows and one old boar.

1273
01:48:53,137 --> 01:48:54,137
Yes.

1274
01:48:54,369 --> 01:48:55,493
Big, male,

1275
01:48:55,708 --> 01:48:57,165
at least 130 kilos.

1276
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:01,492
If we let them,
they'll ravage the crops.

1277
01:49:01,711 --> 01:49:03,335
And tomorrow, the vines.

1278
01:49:05,181 --> 01:49:07,097
What I'd recommend, Mr. Paul,

1279
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,874
is to organize a beat.

1280
01:49:09,786 --> 01:49:12,293
All right, we'll have a beat
tomorrow morning.

1281
01:49:12,916 --> 01:49:13,916
Fine.

1282
01:49:15,876 --> 01:49:17,392
What time, Mr. Paul?

1283
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,767
Nine o'clock?

1284
01:49:20,499 --> 01:49:21,581
Nine o'clock.

1285
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:24,444
Drives us hard, the boss.

1286
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,288
Let's go.

1287
01:49:48,626 --> 01:49:50,017
Mummy Célestine.

1288
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,124
The honour's yours.

1289
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:20,499
Animals with fur, feather or scales

1290
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:23,614
Animals that bellow, sing or croak

1291
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,665

1292
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:27,665
