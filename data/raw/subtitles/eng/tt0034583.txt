1
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:13,963
<i>With the coming
of the Second World War...</i>

2
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:18,301
<i>many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...</i>

3
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,220
<i>toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>

4
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:24,057
<i>Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.</i>

5
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:27,644
<i>But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.</i>

6
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:32,357
<i>And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.</i>

7
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:37,358
<i>Paris to Marseilles...</i>

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,990
<i>across the Mediterranean to Oran.</i>

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,671
<i>Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...</i>

10
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,423
<i>to Casablanca in French Morocco.</i>

11
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,261
<i>Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...</i>

12
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:05,973
<i>might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.</i>

13
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:08,434
<i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>

14
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:12,271
<i>But the others wait in Casablanca.</i>

15
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,942
<i>And wait and wait...</i>

16
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:17,944
<i>and wait.</i>

17
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,163
To all Officers:

18
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:34,164
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:37,463
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:41,676
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:46,677
Important.

22
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,502
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,379
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,841
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:26,842
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:30,224
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,602
Halt!

28
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,006
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

29
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,592
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

30
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:07,595
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

31
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:10,181
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

32
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:11,432
The unoccupied desert.

33
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,101
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

34
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:19,102
and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

35
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,570
Along with these unhappy refugees...

36
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:27,156
the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

37
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,367
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

38
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:32,620
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

39
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,789
This place is full of vultures.

40
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,708
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

41
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:40,628
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. <i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

42
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,338
<i>- Au revoir, madame.</i>
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

43
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,423
What an amusing little fellow.

44
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:47,260
Waiter.

45
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:49,262
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

46
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:53,516
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

47
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:12,489
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

48
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,851
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

49
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,103
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

50
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:40,605
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,901
May I present Captain Renault, police
prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

52
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:47,278
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

53
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,322
Thank you, Captain.
It's good to be here.

54
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,116
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

55
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,744
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

56
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,120
That is kind of you.

57
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,421
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

58
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:09,425
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

59
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:11,552
Perhaps you
weren't referring to weather.

60
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:12,803
What else?

61
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,972
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

62
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:18,935
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

63
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,895
But we know already
who the murderer is.

64
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,188
Good. Is he in custody?

65
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:25,274
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

66
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:30,029
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

67
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:39,288
<i>It had to be you
it had to be you.</i>

68
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:44,289
<i>I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who.</i>

69
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:49,419
<i>Could make me be true
Could make me be blue.</i>

70
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:54,675
<i>And even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you.</i>

71
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:59,846
<i>Some others I've seen
Might never be mean.</i>

72
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:05,102
<i>Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do.</i>

73
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:08,025
<i>For nobody else gave me a thrill.</i>

74
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,945
<i>Honey, with all your faults
I love you still.</i>

75
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:15,946
<i>Had to be you, wonderful you
Had to be you</i>

76
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,163
'Cause my hair is curly.

77
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:24,417
<i>'Cause my teeth are pearly.</i>

78
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,752
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

79
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,088
I'll never get out of here.

80
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,173
I'll die in Casablanca.

81
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,551
But can't you make it
just a little more?

82
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,760
Please?

83
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:38,389
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

84
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,808
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

85
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,143
All right.

86
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,062
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

87
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,193
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

88
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:55,781
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here
from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

89
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:59,285
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

90
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:01,704
Remember, in cash.

91
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:10,296
Cheerio.

92
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:15,297
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

93
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,060
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

94
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,063
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

95
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:31,233
He never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

96
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:33,652
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

97
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,071
Perhaps if you told him...

98
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,823
I ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

99
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:40,493
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

100
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,246
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

101
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:48,042
We have something
to look forward to.

102
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:52,588
And his father is the bellboy.

103
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:53,201
Monsieur.

104
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,869
Excuse me.

105
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,372
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

106
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:30,543
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...?
I know there is gambling in there.

107
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:33,379
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,590
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

109
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,760
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this...

110
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,053
you're much mistaken.

111
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:45,432
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

112
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,560
Your cash is good at the bar.

113
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,603
What? Do you know who I am?

114
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,772
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

115
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:56,773
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

116
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:02,241
Watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

117
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:05,286
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

118
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:09,707
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

119
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:14,708
What right do I have to think?

120
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,383
May I?

121
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,094
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

122
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:24,930
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

123
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,808
today they are the honored dead.

124
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,478
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

125
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,771
I forgive you.

126
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,648
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

127
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,569
I forgot, you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

128
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,613
You despise me, don't you?

129
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:42,865
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

130
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,034
But why?

131
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,953
Do you object
to the kind of business I do?

132
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:52,625
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if I didn't help them.

133
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:57,421
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

134
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:01,175
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

135
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:04,428
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

136
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:07,973
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

137
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:12,311
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

138
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:15,314
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

139
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,192
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

140
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:21,612
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

141
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:25,449
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

142
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,326
Look, Rick.

143
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:29,286
Know what this is?

144
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,331
Something that even you
have never seen.

145
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:35,668
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

146
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,088
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

147
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,339
One moment.

148
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,759
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

149
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,012
And then, <i>addio,</i> Casablanca.

150
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:49,682
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow...

151
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:53,018
just because you despise me,
you are the only one I trust.

152
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,020
Will you keep these for me, please?

153
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:57,940
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

154
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,859
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

155
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,695
Please keep them for me.

156
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:05,364
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

157
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:07,533
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

158
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:11,620
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

159
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,871
Rick...

160
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,292
I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

161
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,712
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

162
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,881
Just a moment.

163
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:27,303
I heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

164
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:33,517
Oh. I've heard that
rumor too. Poor devils.

165
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:38,518
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

166
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,951
<i>- Say, who's got trouble?
- We got trouble.</i>

167
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,911
<i>- How much trouble?
- Too much trouble.</i>

168
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:57,912
<i>Well, now, don't you frown
Just knuckle down and knock on wood.</i>

169
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,211
<i>- Who's unhappy?
- We're unhappy.</i>

170
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,505
<i>- How unhappy?
- Too unhappy.</i>

171
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:08,506
<i>Uh-oh, that won't do
when you are blue just knock on wood.</i>

172
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:12,056
<i>- Who's unlucky?
- We're unlucky.</i>

173
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,391
<i>- How unlucky?
- Too unlucky.</i>

174
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:19,392
<i>But your luck will change
If you'll arrange to knock on wood.</i>

175
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,691
<i>- Who's got nothing?
- We got nothing.</i>

176
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,235
<i>- How much nothing?
- Too much nothing.</i>

177
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:30,236
<i>Say, nothing's not an awful lot
But knock on wood.</i>

178
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,702
<i>- Now who's happy?
- We're happy.</i>

179
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:36,163
<i>- Just how happy?
- Very happy.</i>

180
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:41,164
<i>That's the way we're gonna say
So knock on wood.</i>

181
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:44,254
<i>- Now who's lucky?
- We're all lucky.</i>

182
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:46,590
<i>- Just how lucky?
- Very lucky.</i>

183
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:51,591
<i>Well, smile again and once again
Let's knock on wood.</i>

184
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,479
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

185
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,314
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

186
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,025
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

187
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:08,404
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

188
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:12,157
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

189
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:14,493
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

190
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,578
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

191
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,747
if you'd work with me
in the black market.

192
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:21,959
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

193
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,586
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

194
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,838
Suppose we do.

195
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,382
When will you realize
that in this world today...

196
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:31,093
isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

197
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:33,929
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

198
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,222
Oh, I like it fine here.

199
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,765
He'll double what I pay you.

200
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,935
I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

201
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:40,436
Sorry.

202
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,900
The boss's private stock...

203
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,528
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

204
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,699
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

205
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:58,203
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

206
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:03,204
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

207
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,546
Where were you last night?

208
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:10,174
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

209
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:14,803
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

210
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,221
Give me another.

211
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:19,141
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

212
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:21,560
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

213
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:24,229
- Rick, I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

214
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,773
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

215
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:31,774
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

216
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,531
Hey, taxi.

217
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,825
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

218
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,744
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

219
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,954
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

220
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:45,955
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

221
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,262
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

222
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,765
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

223
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,934
Someday they may be scarce.

224
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,102
I think now
I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

225
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,854
Maybe get her on the rebound.

226
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:08,774
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

227
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:21,495
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian Victory.

228
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:30,625
The plane to Lisbon.

229
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:33,966
You would like to be on it?

230
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,968
Why? What's in Lisbon?

231
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,053
The clipper to America.

232
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:40,973
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

233
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:45,310
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

234
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,146
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

235
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,023
It's a combination of all three.

236
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,651
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

237
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,404
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

238
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:59,157
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

239
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:03,579
- I was misinformed.
- Hm.

240
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,080
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

241
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:08,292
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

242
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,837
and the cashier
would like some money.

243
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,255
I'll get it from the safe.

244
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:15,007
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

245
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,843
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

246
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:22,844
I'm awfully sorry.

247
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:29,021
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

248
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:30,939
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

249
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,941
A murderer, no less.

250
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:36,737
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

251
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:40,782
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

252
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,997
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

253
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:49,291
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

254
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,376
It will amuse your customers.

255
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:54,004
Our entertainment's enough.

256
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,298
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

257
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,967
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

258
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:01,303
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

259
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:04,056
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

260
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:06,183
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

261
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:10,270
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

262
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:11,563
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

263
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:13,899
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

264
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,902
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

265
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,737
How observant you are.

266
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:21,573
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

267
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,908
Yeah?

268
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:26,328
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

269
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:28,455
There are many exit visas
sold in this café...

270
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:30,832
but we know
that you've never sold one.

271
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,168
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

272
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:35,629
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

273
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,089
That is another reason.

274
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,050
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

275
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:43,095
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

276
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,972
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

277
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,557
Victor Laszlo?

278
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,310
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

279
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:52,479
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

280
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,108
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

281
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,403
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

282
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,571
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

283
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,907
- Manages what?
- His escape.

284
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,951
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

285
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,953
He escaped from
a concentration camp.

286
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,080
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

287
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:14,126
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

288
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,794
Is that a serious offer?

289
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:18,296
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

290
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,800
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

291
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,176
- Okay.
- Done.

292
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:27,639
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

293
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,891
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

294
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,894
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

295
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:36,064
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

296
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,358
he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

297
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,694
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

298
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:44,573
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

299
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:48,535
Whatever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

300
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:51,872
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

301
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,249
you are at heart a sentimentalist.

302
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,419
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

303
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,838
Let me point out just two items:

304
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,009
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

305
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,138
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

306
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,640
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

307
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:13,310
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

308
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,395
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,814
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

310
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,358
I have my orders.

311
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,402
I see. Gestapo spank.

312
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:25,405
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

313
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:28,950
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

314
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,203
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

315
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,538
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

316
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,539
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

317
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:48,970
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

318
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,972
I have already given him the best...

319
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:55,727
knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

320
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,938
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

321
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:58,551
Yes, sir.

322
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,319
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

323
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,079
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, Captain.

324
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,165
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

325
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,086
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

326
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,922
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

327
00:21:23,923 --> 00:21:26,925
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

328
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:30,345
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

329
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:34,099
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

330
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,892
I expected no less, Captain.

331
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,061
Monsieur Ugarte.

332
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,480
Oh. Yes?

333
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:44,234
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

334
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:46,736
May I first please cash my chips?

335
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:58,202
Very lucky, huh?
Two thousand, please.

336
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:08,087
Thank you.

337
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:19,936
Rick! Rick, help me!

338
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:24,937
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

339
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,158
Excellent, Captain.

340
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:35,994
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

341
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:38,330
I stick my neck out for nobody.

342
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:42,334
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

343
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,462
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

344
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,088
Okay, boss.

345
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,678
Rick.

346
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,307
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

347
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,351
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

348
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,686
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

349
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:06,687
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

350
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,527
We are very honored tonight.

351
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:13,865
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

352
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:17,035
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

353
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:20,747
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

354
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:23,041
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

355
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,752
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

356
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:29,965
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

357
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,300
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

358
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:35,387
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

359
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,723
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

360
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,684
There seems to be no secret
about that.

361
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,268
Are you one of those people...

362
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:45,230
who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

363
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:47,440
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

364
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:50,443
Can you imagine us in London?

365
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:52,404
When you get there, ask me.

366
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:53,738
Diplomatist.

367
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,073
How about New York?

368
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:57,367
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

369
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,494
that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

370
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,540
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

371
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,959
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

372
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,420
And that takes in the field
of women too.

373
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,755
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

374
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:14,426
We have a complete dossier on you.

375
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:19,427
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

376
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,600
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

377
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:24,352
And also we know why you left Paris.

378
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,521
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

379
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:27,939
Are my eyes really brown?

380
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,317
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

381
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,737
an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

382
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,948
and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

383
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:41,786
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

384
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:45,123
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

385
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:48,835
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

386
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,921
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

387
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:53,673
until the day we marched in.

388
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:58,219
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

389
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,306
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

390
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:04,476
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

391
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:08,563
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

392
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:12,233
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

393
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:14,736
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

394
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:17,906
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

395
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:18,451
Perhaps.

396
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:24,204
Yes, monsieur?

397
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:29,205
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

398
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:59,072
Two Cointreaux, please.

399
00:25:59,073 --> 00:26:01,741
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

400
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:04,953
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

401
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:08,039
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

402
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,043
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

403
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,921
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

404
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,172
Well?

405
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:20,677
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

406
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,388
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

407
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:26,975
The ring is quite unique.

408
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:31,187
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

409
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,438
What is your name?

410
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:35,066
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

411
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,317
Victor.

412
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,695
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

413
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:41,406
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

414
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:43,700
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

415
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:47,287
I'm sorry, it is.

416
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:49,622
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

417
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:51,791
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

418
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,168
Yes, what is it you want?

419
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:56,462
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

420
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:59,382
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

421
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:02,010
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, Captain.

422
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,722
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

423
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:09,350
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

424
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:12,437
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

425
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,689
That was a gross understatement.

426
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,940
You're very kind.

427
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:18,735
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

428
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:22,071
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

429
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:25,074
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

430
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:29,037
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

431
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,498
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

432
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,167
Somewhere I've seen him.

433
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:35,877
- Sam?
- Yes.

434
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:37,795
He came from Paris with Rick.

435
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:39,422
Rick? Who is he?

436
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:42,175
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

437
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,885
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

438
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:46,679
he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

439
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,390
and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

440
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:54,354
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

441
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:55,563
Excuse me.

442
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:58,942
Major.

443
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,237
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

444
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:03,446
How do you do?

445
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,657
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

446
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,326
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

447
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:10,745
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

448
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:15,746
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

449
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,629
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

450
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,549
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

451
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,385
This is hardly the time or place.

452
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,720
Then we shall state
another time and place.

453
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:30,014
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

454
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:32,850
With mademoiselle.

455
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:36,104
Captain, I am under your authority.

456
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:38,356
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

457
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:42,443
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

458
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,404
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

459
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:47,907
Mademoiselle.

460
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:51,411
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

461
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:55,665
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

462
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:59,502
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

463
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,745
I must find out what Berger knows.

464
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:38,746
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

465
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:57,143
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

466
00:29:57,144 --> 00:29:58,353
- Yes.
- Monsieur?

467
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:00,480
Champagne cocktail, please.

468
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:03,399
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

469
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,527
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

470
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:09,739
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

471
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,784
As you see,
it was true every single time.

472
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:14,452
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

473
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:18,664
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

474
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:21,125
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

475
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:25,963
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

476
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:27,590
I see.

477
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:31,803
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

478
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,222
Underground, like everywhere else.

479
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:37,392
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne Du Bois.

480
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:38,726
If you will come...

481
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:43,727
Monsieur.

482
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,034
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

483
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:59,330
Very well, mademoiselle.

484
00:30:59,331 --> 00:31:02,834
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

485
00:31:02,835 --> 00:31:04,544
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

486
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:07,255
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

487
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,881
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

488
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:13,882
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

489
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,517
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

490
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:22,520
I never expected to see you again.

491
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:24,522
It's been a long time.

492
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:29,444
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

493
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:34,445
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

494
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,083
Where is Rick?

495
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:47,545
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

496
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:51,090
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

497
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:54,385
He went home.

498
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,388
- Does he always leave so early?
- Oh, he never...

499
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:59,974
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

500
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,644
Goes up there all the time.

501
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:07,231
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

502
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:12,232
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

503
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,574
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

504
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,577
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

505
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:22,079
Play it, Sam.

506
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,499
Play "As Time Goes By."

507
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,544
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

508
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:31,297
I'll hum it for you.

509
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:46,103
Sing it, Sam.

510
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,315
<i>You must remember this.</i>

511
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:52,360
<i>A kiss is just a kiss.</i>

512
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:57,361
<i>A sigh is just a sigh.</i>

513
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,453
<i>The fundamental things apply.</i>

514
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:07,454
<i>As time goes by.</i>

515
00:33:09,753 --> 00:33:12,630
<i>And when two lovers woo.</i>

516
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:15,550
<i>They still say, "I love you".</i>

517
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:20,551
<i>On that you can rely.</i>

518
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:25,935
<i>No matter what the future brings.</i>

519
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:29,647
<i>As time goes by</i>

520
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:34,648
Sam, I thought I told you
never to play...

521
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:46,330
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present...

522
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,833
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

523
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:52,503
Oh, you've already met Rick,
mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

524
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:54,046
This is Mr. Laszlo.

525
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:55,840
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

526
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:58,259
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

527
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,261
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

528
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:02,555
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

529
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,599
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

530
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,352
a precedent is being broken. Emile.

531
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:12,023
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

532
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:13,691
- What for?
- Your work.

533
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:16,319
Thank you. I try.

534
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,446
We all try. You succeed.

535
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,865
She was asking about you
earlier, Rick...

536
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:24,160
in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

537
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:26,412
I wasn't sure you were the same.

538
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:30,875
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

539
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,960
How nice. You remembered.

540
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,963
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

541
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,883
- Not an easy day to forget.
- No.

542
00:34:38,884 --> 00:34:43,884
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

543
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:46,849
Yes. I put that dress away.

544
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,393
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

545
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:53,898
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

546
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,318
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

547
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,154
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

548
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:03,866
It would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

549
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,660
I hope we didn't
overstay our welcome.

550
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,994
Not at all.

551
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,788
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

552
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:12,583
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

553
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:16,671
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

554
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:18,589
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

555
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,634
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

556
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:26,222
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

557
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:30,184
He hasn't played it in a long time.

558
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,311
- Good night.
- Good night.

559
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:32,812
Night.

560
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:44,532
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

561
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,952
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

562
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:50,663
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

563
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:55,664
- Good night.
- Good night.

564
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:31,704
Boss?

565
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,836
- Boss?
- Yeah?

566
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:42,089
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

567
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,049
Ain't you planning to go to bed
in the near future?

568
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,301
No.

569
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:48,179
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

570
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,181
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

571
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,557
Good, then have a drink.

572
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:53,684
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

573
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,436
Boss, let's get out of here.

574
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:58,147
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

575
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,941
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

576
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:03,068
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

577
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,987
We'll take the car and drive all night.

578
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:07,990
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

579
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:12,991
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

580
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,628
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

581
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,215
Well, that's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

582
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:28,052
- Sam.
-Yes, boss?

583
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:32,723
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

584
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:34,183
What?

585
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:36,477
My watch stopped.

586
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:38,896
I bet they're asleep in New York.

587
00:37:38,897 --> 00:37:43,897
I bet they're asleep all over America.

588
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:52,743
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

589
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:57,744
she walks into mine.

590
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:05,130
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

591
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:08,092
- Stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

592
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:10,427
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

593
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:13,806
- I don't think I can remember...
- If she can stand it, I can.

594
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,933
Play it.

595
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,978
Yes, boss.

596
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:50,110
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

597
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,696
What did you do,
and what did you think?

598
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:57,697
We said no questions.

599
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:04,329
Here's looking at you, kid.

600
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:37,241
A franc for your thoughts.

601
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:40,119
In America they'd bring only a penny.

602
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,205
I guess that's about all they're worth.

603
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:47,710
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

604
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,878
Well, I was wondering...

605
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,171
Yes?

606
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:56,172
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

607
00:40:56,636 --> 00:41:01,181
- Why there is no other man in my life?
- Uh-huh.

608
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:05,436
That's easy. There was.

609
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,855
He's dead.

610
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,441
I'm sorry for asking.

611
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:14,862
I forgot we said no questions.

612
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:19,863
Well, only one answer can
take care of all our questions.

613
00:42:05,038 --> 00:42:09,249
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

614
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,336
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

615
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:17,337
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

616
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:22,846
<i>Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date.</i>

617
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:27,847
<i>Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate.</i>

618
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:33,061
<i>Woman needs man
And man must have his mate.</i>

619
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:38,441
<i>That no one can deny.</i>

620
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,949
<i>It's still the same old story.</i>

621
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,576
<i>A fight for love and glory.</i>

622
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:49,577
<i>A case of do or die.</i>

623
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:55,166
<i>The world will always welcome lovers.</i>

624
00:42:55,964 --> 00:43:00,964
<i>As time goes by</i>

625
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:04,138
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

626
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:06,223
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

627
00:43:06,224 --> 00:43:08,142
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

628
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:11,645
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

629
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:13,063
You said it.

630
00:43:13,064 --> 00:43:18,064
Here's looking at you, kid.

631
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,554
My German's a little rusty.

632
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:49,099
It's the Gestapo.

633
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,103
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

634
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:58,104
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

635
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,030
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

636
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,948
It's pretty bad timing.

637
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:09,949
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

638
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:11,914
Let's see.

639
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:16,460
Yes, I was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

640
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:20,005
Looking for a job.

641
00:44:24,636 --> 00:44:27,179
Was that cannon fire?

642
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,805
Or is it my heart pounding?

643
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:33,806
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

644
00:44:35,146 --> 00:44:38,482
And getting closer every minute.

645
00:44:38,483 --> 00:44:40,484
Here, here, drink up.

646
00:44:40,485 --> 00:44:42,402
We'll never finish the other three.

647
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:45,989
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

648
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,325
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

649
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:51,828
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

650
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:53,872
It's strange.

651
00:44:53,873 --> 00:44:57,918
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

652
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:01,588
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

653
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:04,675
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

654
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:06,718
No, we must leave.

655
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:08,387
Yes, of course. We.

656
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:12,140
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

657
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:16,395
No, no. Not at my hotel. I...

658
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:19,690
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

659
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:21,608
I'll meet you at the station.

660
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,986
All right, at a quarter to 5.

661
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:28,987
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

662
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,369
That's too far ahead to plan.

663
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,372
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

664
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:38,417
Let's seem. What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

665
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:39,626
Oh, darling...

666
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:43,880
Why not? The Captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

667
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:50,508
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

668
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:57,561
I love you so much.

669
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:01,982
And I hate this war so much.

670
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,361
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

671
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:08,488
If you shouldn't get away...

672
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,073
I mean if...

673
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:13,327
If something should keep us apart...

674
00:46:13,328 --> 00:46:15,412
wherever they put you...

675
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:20,413
and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

676
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,922
Kiss me.

677
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:30,923
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

678
00:46:53,826 --> 00:46:58,826
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

679
00:47:04,837 --> 00:47:06,463
Where is she? Have you seen her?

680
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:09,216
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

681
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:14,217
But this note came just after you left.

682
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:28,902
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

683
00:47:28,903 --> 00:47:31,113
Do you hear me?

684
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:36,114
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

685
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,879
- Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Uh-huh.

686
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,883
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

687
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:36,970
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

688
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:40,724
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

689
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:43,810
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

690
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:45,937
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

691
00:48:45,938 --> 00:48:49,524
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

692
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:52,068
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

693
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:56,364
- "We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

694
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:59,034
I can understand how you feel.

695
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,912
You understand how I feel.

696
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:04,581
How long was it we had, honey?

697
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:07,083
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

698
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:09,169
Every one of them.

699
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,088
Mostly I remember the last one.

700
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:16,009
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

701
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,928
with a comical look on his face...

702
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:21,932
because his insides
have been kicked out.

703
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:24,267
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

704
00:49:24,268 --> 00:49:26,937
Does it got a wild finish?

705
00:49:26,938 --> 00:49:29,272
I don't know the finish yet.

706
00:49:29,273 --> 00:49:34,273
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

707
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:39,115
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

708
00:49:39,116 --> 00:49:40,992
At the house of some friends...

709
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:44,037
she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

710
00:49:44,038 --> 00:49:47,624
A very great and courageous man.

711
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:50,085
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

712
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:53,088
full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

713
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:57,133
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

714
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:59,135
And she looked up to him...

715
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:00,804
and worshiped him...

716
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:03,807
with a feeling
she supposed was love.

717
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:06,101
Yes, that's very pretty.

718
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:09,980
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

719
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:12,941
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

720
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:15,735
playing in the parlor downstairs.

721
00:50:15,736 --> 00:50:20,736
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

722
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:26,997
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

723
00:50:26,998 --> 00:50:29,040
Tell me...

724
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:31,334
who was it you left me for?

725
00:50:31,335 --> 00:50:34,879
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

726
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,880
or aren't you the kind that tells?

727
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:06,286
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

728
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:08,830
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

729
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:12,125
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

730
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:14,336
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

731
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,088
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

732
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:19,341
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

733
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:23,428
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

734
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:26,514
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

735
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:31,515
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

736
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:39,069
There is nothing we can do.

737
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,863
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

738
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,073
I slept very well.

739
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:46,951
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

740
00:51:46,952 --> 00:51:49,412
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

741
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:53,041
Thank you.

742
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:56,586
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

743
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:59,381
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

744
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,132
You have reached Casablanca.

745
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:04,094
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

746
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:06,346
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

747
00:52:06,347 --> 00:52:09,265
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

748
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:12,143
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

749
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:14,729
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

750
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,357
Well, perhaps I shall like it
in Casablanca.

751
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:19,234
And mademoiselle?

752
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:22,946
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

753
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:26,032
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

754
00:52:26,033 --> 00:52:28,868
You may be
in Casablanca indefinitely.

755
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,954
Or you may leave
for Lisbon tomorrow.

756
00:52:30,955 --> 00:52:33,456
- On one condition.
- And that is?

757
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:36,835
You know the leader of the Underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

758
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:38,378
Brussels, Amsterdam...

759
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:40,839
Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

760
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,591
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

761
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:46,386
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

762
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:48,430
you'll have your visa in the morning.

763
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,808
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

764
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,477
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

765
00:52:54,478 --> 00:52:59,478
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

766
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:02,193
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

767
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:05,321
where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

768
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:08,366
I certainly won't
give them to you now.

769
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,952
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

770
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:12,662
What if you murdered all of us?

771
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:17,167
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

772
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:19,669
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

773
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,381
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

774
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:25,175
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

775
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:27,886
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

776
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,637
But there is one exception.

777
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:32,390
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

778
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:35,685
should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

779
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:38,188
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

780
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,190
This is still unoccupied France.

781
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:43,193
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

782
00:53:43,194 --> 00:53:46,070
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

783
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:50,617
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

784
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:54,871
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

785
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:57,665
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

786
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:00,877
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

787
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:05,878
Signor Ugarte is dead.

788
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,012
I'm making out the report now.

789
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:14,265
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

790
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:17,769
or died trying to escape.

791
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,688
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

792
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:21,301
Good day.

793
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,364
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

794
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:30,615
Excuse me, Captain.

795
00:54:30,616 --> 00:54:34,077
Another visa problem has come up.

796
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:39,078
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

797
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:48,883
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

798
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,803
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

799
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,180
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

800
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,016
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

801
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:59,769
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

802
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:04,770
Thanks.

803
00:55:13,284 --> 00:55:14,868
Don't be too downhearted.

804
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:17,120
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

805
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:18,621
Thank you very much, signor.

806
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:21,207
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

807
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,585
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

808
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,795
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

809
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:27,255
I never drink in the morning.

810
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:30,174
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

811
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:32,302
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

812
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:33,803
Here, sit down.

813
00:55:33,804 --> 00:55:36,639
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

814
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,516
Bourbon.

815
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:40,643
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

816
00:55:40,644 --> 00:55:44,230
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

817
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:47,191
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

818
00:55:47,192 --> 00:55:49,402
and no one knows where
those letters are.

819
00:55:49,403 --> 00:55:50,904
Practically no one.

820
00:55:50,905 --> 00:55:53,448
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

821
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:55,700
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

822
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:58,161
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

823
00:55:58,162 --> 00:55:59,871
I'll handle the entire transaction.

824
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:02,790
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

825
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,459
And the carrying charges?

826
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,921
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

827
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:10,506
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

828
00:56:10,507 --> 00:56:12,216
I'll tell him when he comes in.

829
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:15,136
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

830
00:56:15,137 --> 00:56:20,137
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

831
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:27,231
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

832
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:30,735
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

833
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:35,736
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

834
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:37,450
Morning.

835
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:42,451
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

836
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,543
You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

837
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:49,045
Only 700 francs.

838
00:56:49,046 --> 00:56:52,382
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

839
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:55,718
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

840
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,388
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

841
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:02,183
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

842
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:03,393
Doesn't matter.

843
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:07,522
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

844
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:10,733
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

845
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:12,527
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

846
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:15,405
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

847
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:19,200
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

848
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:20,410
Yes.

849
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:22,996
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

850
00:57:22,997 --> 00:57:24,706
I don't think I will, Rick.

851
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,417
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

852
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:29,168
I think I'm entitled to know.

853
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:32,046
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

854
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:35,425
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

855
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:39,554
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

856
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:43,725
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

857
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:47,937
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

858
00:57:47,938 --> 00:57:49,397
If we leave it that way...

859
00:57:49,398 --> 00:57:53,234
maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

860
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:55,028
Not last night.

861
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:58,448
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

862
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:01,492
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

863
00:58:01,493 --> 00:58:03,411
You can believe that if you want to.

864
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:06,289
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

865
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,291
Above a saloon, it's true...

866
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:09,917
but walk up a flight...

867
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:13,713
I'll be expecting you.

868
00:58:13,714 --> 00:58:16,674
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

869
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:19,927
You'll be there.

870
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:22,388
No, Rick.

871
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,683
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

872
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:30,684
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

873
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:38,571
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
Unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

874
00:58:38,572 --> 00:58:40,656
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

875
00:58:40,657 --> 00:58:43,576
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

876
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:45,411
I am influential and respected.

877
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:48,998
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

878
00:58:48,999 --> 00:58:51,292
You, however, are a different matter.

879
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:56,089
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

880
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:59,425
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

881
00:58:59,426 --> 00:59:02,845
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

882
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:04,847
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

883
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:08,768
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

884
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:11,062
We are only interested in two visas.

885
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:13,689
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

886
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,942
You two will want to discuss this.

887
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:20,943
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

888
00:59:21,782 --> 00:59:23,741
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

889
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:27,370
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

890
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:29,330
But if the situation were different...

891
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,041
if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

892
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:34,544
would you take it?

893
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:36,879
Yes, I would.

894
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,215
Yes, I see.

895
00:59:39,216 --> 00:59:43,302
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

896
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:45,638
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

897
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:50,639
and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

898
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:55,606
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

899
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:58,276
I love you very much, Ilsa.

900
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:01,445
Your secret will be safe with me.

901
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:03,739
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

902
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,740
Not more than 50 francs.

903
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:12,748
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

904
01:00:12,749 --> 01:00:16,294
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

905
01:00:16,295 --> 01:00:18,421
Well, good luck, but be careful.

906
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:21,591
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

907
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:24,844
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

908
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:27,722
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

909
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:29,807
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

910
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:33,102
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

911
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:34,312
Yes, something.

912
01:00:34,313 --> 01:00:37,690
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

913
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:39,901
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

914
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:43,613
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

915
01:00:43,614 --> 01:00:44,822
Rick?

916
01:00:44,823 --> 01:00:48,242
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

917
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:50,453
But it is worth a chance.

918
01:00:50,454 --> 01:00:53,456
Thank you very much. Good day.

919
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:55,833
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

920
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:57,835
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

921
01:00:57,836 --> 01:01:00,463
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

922
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:05,464
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

923
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:14,352
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

924
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:16,395
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

925
01:01:16,396 --> 01:01:20,316
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

926
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:22,777
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

927
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:25,154
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

928
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:30,155
I'm sorry.

929
01:01:42,673 --> 01:01:47,673
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

930
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:50,930
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

931
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:53,015
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

932
01:01:53,016 --> 01:01:55,518
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

933
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:57,687
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

934
01:01:57,688 --> 01:02:00,147
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

935
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,441
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

936
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:05,695
You know how
that impresses Germans.

937
01:02:05,696 --> 01:02:08,364
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

938
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:11,117
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

939
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:15,746
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

940
01:02:15,747 --> 01:02:20,747
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

941
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:27,508
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

942
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:31,679
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

943
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,017
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

944
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,601
Sascha!

945
01:02:37,602 --> 01:02:38,853
French 75s.

946
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:42,690
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

947
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:44,233
We will begin with two.

948
01:02:53,076 --> 01:02:55,494
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

949
01:02:55,495 --> 01:03:00,495
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

950
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:10,047
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

951
01:03:13,096 --> 01:03:14,889
You see, Captain?

952
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,475
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

953
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:19,560
We try to cooperate
with your government.

954
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,979
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

955
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,440
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

956
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,817
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

957
01:03:26,818 --> 01:03:28,277
I blow with the wind...

958
01:03:28,278 --> 01:03:30,905
and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

959
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:32,865
And if it should change?

960
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:35,201
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

961
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,495
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

962
01:03:37,496 --> 01:03:41,415
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

963
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:44,293
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

964
01:03:44,294 --> 01:03:45,669
A leader? Like Laszlo?

965
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,130
Mm-hm. I have been thinking.

966
01:03:48,131 --> 01:03:51,634
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

967
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:53,636
I see what you mean.

968
01:03:58,517 --> 01:04:00,601
Thank you, Carl.

969
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:03,020
Thank you, Carl.

970
01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:05,314
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

971
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,900
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

972
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:09,193
Thank you very much.

973
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:12,154
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

974
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:14,156
and a third glass.

975
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:16,325
At last the day's came!

976
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:19,328
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

977
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:22,331
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

978
01:04:22,332 --> 01:04:24,333
A very nice idea.

979
01:04:24,334 --> 01:04:27,920
- To America.
- To America.

980
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:32,341
To America.

981
01:04:34,928 --> 01:04:37,179
What watch?

982
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,851
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

983
01:04:41,852 --> 01:04:45,187
You will get along beautifully
in America.

984
01:04:45,188 --> 01:04:47,148
How is lady luck treating you?

985
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,316
Oh, too bad.

986
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:54,317
You'll find him over there.

987
01:04:57,409 --> 01:04:59,118
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

988
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,580
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

989
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:05,040
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

990
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,542
My husband is with me too.

991
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:09,420
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

992
01:05:09,421 --> 01:05:10,629
Have a drink?

993
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,924
- No, of course not. You mind if I do?
- Oh, no.

994
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:17,720
Monsieur Rick,
what kind of a man is Captain Renault?

995
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:19,430
Like any other man, only more so.

996
01:05:19,431 --> 01:05:20,806
No, I mean...

997
01:05:20,807 --> 01:05:22,850
is he trustworthy?
Is his word...?

998
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:25,311
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

999
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,937
He did. Captain Renault did.

1000
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:29,273
I thought so. Where's your husband?

1001
01:05:29,274 --> 01:05:33,736
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

1002
01:05:33,737 --> 01:05:35,738
Oh, of course he's losing.

1003
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:39,700
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

1004
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:41,911
We come from Bulgaria.

1005
01:05:41,912 --> 01:05:44,330
Things are very bad there.

1006
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:46,916
The devil has the people
by the throat.

1007
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:49,627
So Jan and I, we...

1008
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:52,546
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

1009
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:55,090
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

1010
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,635
But we haven't much money...

1011
01:05:57,636 --> 01:06:00,513
and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

1012
01:06:00,514 --> 01:06:03,224
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

1013
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,520
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

1014
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:09,021
Yes, I'll bet.

1015
01:06:09,022 --> 01:06:12,024
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

1016
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:13,734
But we have no money.

1017
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,486
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

1018
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,988
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

1019
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:22,076
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

1020
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:24,078
He always has.

1021
01:06:26,623 --> 01:06:28,332
Monsieur...

1022
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,543
you are a man.

1023
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:33,420
If someone loved you very much...

1024
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:38,217
so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

1025
01:06:38,218 --> 01:06:41,595
and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

1026
01:06:41,596 --> 01:06:44,848
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

1027
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:48,852
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

1028
01:06:48,853 --> 01:06:50,813
that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

1029
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:53,482
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

1030
01:06:53,483 --> 01:06:54,817
Go back to Bulgaria.

1031
01:06:54,818 --> 01:06:59,818
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

1032
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:04,535
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

1033
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:08,163
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

1034
01:07:08,164 --> 01:07:10,749
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

1035
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:15,750
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

1036
01:07:22,596 --> 01:07:24,054
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1037
01:07:24,055 --> 01:07:25,514
You see? Here we are again.

1038
01:07:25,515 --> 01:07:27,766
I take that
as a great compliment to Sam.

1039
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:31,562
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

1040
01:07:31,563 --> 01:07:34,940
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

1041
01:07:34,941 --> 01:07:37,610
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

1042
01:07:37,611 --> 01:07:40,279
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

1043
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,197
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:07:42,198 --> 01:07:44,199
Right this way, if you please.

1045
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,203
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

1046
01:07:48,204 --> 01:07:53,204
Thank you.

1047
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:03,882
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

1048
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:27,701
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1049
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:29,578
No. No, I guess not.

1050
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:33,040
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1051
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:36,126
I said 22.

1052
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:55,767
Leave it there.

1053
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:11,745
Cash it in and don't come back.

1054
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:14,289
Are you sure this place is honest?

1055
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:19,290
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1056
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,756
How are we doing tonight?

1057
01:09:22,757 --> 01:09:27,757
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1058
01:09:29,139 --> 01:09:31,598
Monsieur Rick...

1059
01:09:36,146 --> 01:09:40,482
He's just a lucky guy.

1060
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:43,527
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

1061
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:48,528
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

1062
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:50,784
Captain Renault, may I...?

1063
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:53,287
Not here.
Come to my office in the morning.

1064
01:09:53,288 --> 01:09:55,122
We'll do everything businesslike.

1065
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:57,833
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

1066
01:09:57,834 --> 01:09:59,835
I'm very happy for both of you.

1067
01:09:59,836 --> 01:10:02,129
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1068
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,548
Well, maybe not so strange.

1069
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,801
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

1070
01:10:07,802 --> 01:10:11,680
No!

1071
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:18,771
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1072
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:23,772
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1073
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:34,203
As I suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.

1074
01:10:34,204 --> 01:10:35,412
Yeah? Why?

1075
01:10:35,413 --> 01:10:37,498
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

1076
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:39,500
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1077
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,210
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

1078
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:44,213
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

1079
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:47,090
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

1080
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,930
Mr. Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you.

1081
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:55,641
- Go ahead.
- Well, isn't there some other place?

1082
01:10:55,642 --> 01:11:00,103
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1083
01:11:00,104 --> 01:11:03,398
- In my office.
- Right.

1084
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:06,235
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1085
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:09,404
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

1086
01:11:09,405 --> 01:11:11,365
You know what I've been doing.

1087
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:15,452
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1088
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:17,913
that I reach America
and continue my work.

1089
01:11:17,914 --> 01:11:19,498
I'm not interested in politics.

1090
01:11:19,499 --> 01:11:22,251
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

1091
01:11:22,252 --> 01:11:23,710
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1092
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:27,422
My friends in the Underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

1093
01:11:27,423 --> 01:11:29,132
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1094
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:30,968
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

1095
01:11:30,969 --> 01:11:32,177
What of it?

1096
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:35,556
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

1097
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,683
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.

1098
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:40,102
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1099
01:11:40,103 --> 01:11:43,605
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1100
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:46,859
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

1101
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,611
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1102
01:11:49,612 --> 01:11:51,572
My answer would still be the same.

1103
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,949
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1104
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,534
There is.

1105
01:11:55,535 --> 01:11:57,953
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1106
01:11:57,954 --> 01:12:00,956
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1107
01:12:00,957 --> 01:12:03,667
- My wife?
- Yes.

1108
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:48,791
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1109
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:51,020
<i>Vive la France!</i>
<i>Vive la démocratie!</i>

1110
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:05,998
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1111
01:14:05,999 --> 01:14:08,625
what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1112
01:14:08,626 --> 01:14:10,919
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1113
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,047
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1114
01:14:14,048 --> 01:14:15,424
The place is to be closed.

1115
01:14:15,425 --> 01:14:20,425
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1116
01:14:23,683 --> 01:14:25,267
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1117
01:14:25,268 --> 01:14:27,728
This café is closed until further notice.

1118
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:32,729
Clear the room at once.

1119
01:14:32,775 --> 01:14:34,317
How can you close me up?

1120
01:14:34,318 --> 01:14:37,946
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1121
01:14:37,947 --> 01:14:40,032
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1122
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:45,033
Everybody out at once.

1123
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,833
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1124
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:52,794
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1125
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:55,964
That is also true, except for one
destination: Occupied France.

1126
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:59,051
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1127
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:00,260
Of what value is that?

1128
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:03,472
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1129
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:06,892
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1130
01:15:06,893 --> 01:15:09,019
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1131
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,354
to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1132
01:15:11,355 --> 01:15:12,647
The other alternative?

1133
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:15,108
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1134
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:17,569
that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1135
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:22,570
Good night, mademoiselle.

1136
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:34,624
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1137
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:58,568
Our faithful friend is still there.

1138
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:01,363
Please don't go
to the Underground meeting tonight.

1139
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:02,614
I must.

1140
01:16:02,615 --> 01:16:06,243
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1141
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:09,788
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1142
01:16:09,789 --> 01:16:11,790
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1143
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:14,417
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1144
01:16:14,418 --> 01:16:16,461
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1145
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:20,006
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1146
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:23,093
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1147
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,637
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1148
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,389
But no intention of selling them.

1149
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,226
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1150
01:16:31,227 --> 01:16:33,019
Did he give any reason?

1151
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,481
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1152
01:16:36,482 --> 01:16:39,609
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1153
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:44,610
I don't know why he said that.

1154
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:58,044
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1155
01:16:58,045 --> 01:17:01,923
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1156
01:17:01,924 --> 01:17:05,719
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1157
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,555
When I was
in the concentration camp...

1158
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:12,559
were you lonely in Paris?

1159
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,520
Yes, Victor, I was.

1160
01:17:15,521 --> 01:17:19,566
I know how it is to be lonely.

1161
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:23,904
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1162
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:28,905
No, Victor, there isn't.

1163
01:17:30,536 --> 01:17:34,414
I love you very much, my dear.

1164
01:17:34,415 --> 01:17:36,416
Yes.

1165
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:39,252
Yes, I know.

1166
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:41,838
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1167
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:44,716
You don't even have to say it.

1168
01:17:44,717 --> 01:17:48,595
I'll believe.

1169
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:51,932
Good night, dear.

1170
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:56,933
Good night.

1171
01:18:00,316 --> 01:18:05,316
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1172
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:11,243
Be careful.

1173
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:16,244
Of course I'll be careful.

1174
01:18:56,163 --> 01:18:59,541
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1175
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:02,002
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1176
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,503
Two weeks, maybe three.

1177
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:05,922
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1178
01:19:05,923 --> 01:19:08,341
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1179
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:09,884
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1180
01:19:09,885 --> 01:19:13,805
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1181
01:19:13,806 --> 01:19:16,808
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1182
01:19:16,809 --> 01:19:20,103
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1183
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:22,480
I won't.

1184
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:24,691
Good night.

1185
01:19:24,692 --> 01:19:29,692
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1186
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:46,504
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1187
01:19:46,505 --> 01:19:50,008
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1188
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:51,426
Well, won't you sit down?

1189
01:19:51,427 --> 01:19:55,513
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1190
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:59,017
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1191
01:19:59,018 --> 01:20:01,895
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1192
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:04,689
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1193
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:07,817
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1194
01:20:07,818 --> 01:20:09,736
I know how you feel about me...

1195
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:12,655
but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1196
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:15,283
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1197
01:20:15,284 --> 01:20:17,452
what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1198
01:20:17,453 --> 01:20:18,995
It was your cause too.

1199
01:20:18,996 --> 01:20:21,915
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1200
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:24,834
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1201
01:20:24,835 --> 01:20:29,835
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1202
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:33,426
Richard.

1203
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:37,138
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1204
01:20:37,139 --> 01:20:40,225
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1205
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:43,853
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1206
01:20:43,854 --> 01:20:46,106
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1207
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:51,107
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1208
01:20:53,364 --> 01:20:56,282
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1209
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:59,661
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1210
01:20:59,662 --> 01:21:01,037
One woman has hurt you...

1211
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:03,957
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1212
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:08,958
You're a coward and a weakling.

1213
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,842
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1214
01:21:13,843 --> 01:21:16,970
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1215
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:19,848
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1216
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:21,057
What of it?

1217
01:21:21,058 --> 01:21:26,058
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1218
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:32,779
Now, if you'll...

1219
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,239
All right.

1220
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,450
I tried to reason with you.

1221
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:41,077
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1222
01:21:41,078 --> 01:21:45,790
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1223
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:49,502
Put them on the table.

1224
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:51,671
No.

1225
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:55,049
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1226
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:00,050
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1227
01:22:00,473 --> 01:22:04,893
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1228
01:22:04,894 --> 01:22:09,894
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1229
01:22:13,527 --> 01:22:15,570
Richard...

1230
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:18,323
I tried to stay away.

1231
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:22,118
I thought I would never see you again.

1232
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:27,119
That you were out of my life.

1233
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,436
The day you left Paris...

1234
01:22:48,437 --> 01:22:52,106
if you knew what I went through.

1235
01:22:52,107 --> 01:22:55,777
If you knew how much I loved you.

1236
01:22:55,778 --> 01:23:00,778
How much I still love you.

1237
01:23:12,503 --> 01:23:15,588
And then?

1238
01:23:15,589 --> 01:23:20,093
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1239
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:23,805
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1240
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:25,682
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1241
01:23:25,683 --> 01:23:29,477
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1242
01:23:29,478 --> 01:23:32,105
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1243
01:23:32,106 --> 01:23:33,523
Then it came.

1244
01:23:33,524 --> 01:23:36,985
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1245
01:23:36,986 --> 01:23:40,905
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1246
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:42,657
Then I met you.

1247
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:46,202
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1248
01:23:46,203 --> 01:23:49,497
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1249
01:23:49,498 --> 01:23:52,458
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1250
01:23:52,459 --> 01:23:55,628
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1251
01:23:55,629 --> 01:23:59,090
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1252
01:23:59,091 --> 01:24:01,259
and for those working with us.

1253
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,637
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1254
01:24:04,638 --> 01:24:07,348
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1255
01:24:07,349 --> 01:24:09,934
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1256
01:24:09,935 --> 01:24:13,396
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1257
01:24:13,397 --> 01:24:16,983
He was sick. He needed me.

1258
01:24:16,984 --> 01:24:19,777
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1259
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:24,778
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1260
01:24:24,783 --> 01:24:26,868
Well...

1261
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:31,497
well, you know the rest.

1262
01:24:31,498 --> 01:24:34,709
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1263
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,045
What about now?

1264
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:38,880
Now?

1265
01:24:38,881 --> 01:24:41,090
I don't know.

1266
01:24:41,091 --> 01:24:45,345
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1267
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:46,763
And Laszlo?

1268
01:24:46,764 --> 01:24:50,183
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1269
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:53,686
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1270
01:24:53,687 --> 01:24:56,648
All except one.

1271
01:24:56,649 --> 01:25:00,234
He won't have you.

1272
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:03,738
I can't fight it anymore.

1273
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:08,739
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1274
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:12,288
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1275
01:25:12,289 --> 01:25:15,375
You have to think for both of us.

1276
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:20,376
For all of us.

1277
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:25,381
All right. I will.

1278
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:30,682
Here's looking at you, kid.

1279
01:25:30,683 --> 01:25:35,683
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1280
01:25:46,156 --> 01:25:48,408
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1281
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,535
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1282
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:55,536
Come inside.

1283
01:25:55,874 --> 01:26:00,874
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1284
01:26:00,963 --> 01:26:05,963
Thank you.

1285
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,525
Carl, what happened?

1286
01:26:22,526 --> 01:26:24,694
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1287
01:26:24,695 --> 01:26:26,362
We escaped at the last moment.

1288
01:26:26,363 --> 01:26:28,823
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1289
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:32,326
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1290
01:26:32,327 --> 01:26:35,747
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1291
01:26:35,748 --> 01:26:40,748
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1292
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:50,674
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1293
01:27:00,147 --> 01:27:03,441
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1294
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:05,401
This might come in handy.

1295
01:27:05,402 --> 01:27:06,736
Thank you.

1296
01:27:06,737 --> 01:27:11,365
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1297
01:27:11,366 --> 01:27:14,285
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1298
01:27:14,286 --> 01:27:17,205
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1299
01:27:17,206 --> 01:27:19,499
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1300
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,209
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1301
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,836
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1302
01:27:23,837 --> 01:27:26,255
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1303
01:27:26,256 --> 01:27:28,591
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1304
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:30,968
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1305
01:27:30,969 --> 01:27:33,387
of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1306
01:27:33,388 --> 01:27:37,058
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1307
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:39,936
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1308
01:27:39,937 --> 01:27:43,231
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1309
01:27:43,232 --> 01:27:44,982
and that you'll never succeed.

1310
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:49,028
You seem to know
all about my destiny.

1311
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:51,989
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1312
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:54,408
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1313
01:27:54,409 --> 01:27:56,327
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1314
01:27:56,328 --> 01:27:59,413
that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1315
01:27:59,414 --> 01:28:01,749
The first evening
I came into this café...

1316
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,919
I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1317
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,004
Since no one is to blame...

1318
01:28:07,005 --> 01:28:09,173
I demand no explanation.

1319
01:28:09,174 --> 01:28:12,635
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1320
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:14,387
All right.

1321
01:28:14,388 --> 01:28:16,597
But I want my wife to be safe.

1322
01:28:16,598 --> 01:28:18,182
I ask you as a favor...

1323
01:28:18,183 --> 01:28:21,269
to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1324
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,603
You love her that much?

1325
01:28:22,604 --> 01:28:25,982
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1326
01:28:25,983 --> 01:28:29,360
Well, I am also a human being.

1327
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:31,112
Yes, I love her that much.

1328
01:28:38,662 --> 01:28:40,121
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1329
01:28:40,122 --> 01:28:42,790
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1330
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:44,000
On what charge?

1331
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:46,377
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1332
01:28:46,378 --> 01:28:51,378
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1333
01:29:00,893 --> 01:29:05,229
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1334
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:07,690
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1335
01:29:07,691 --> 01:29:09,483
You might as well let him go now.

1336
01:29:09,484 --> 01:29:12,653
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1337
01:29:12,654 --> 01:29:14,322
If you were to help him escape...

1338
01:29:14,323 --> 01:29:16,908
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1339
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:19,535
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1340
01:29:19,536 --> 01:29:22,830
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1341
01:29:22,831 --> 01:29:26,083
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1342
01:29:26,084 --> 01:29:28,127
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1343
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:29,670
They're all excellent reasons.

1344
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:31,797
Don't count too much
on my friendship.

1345
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:35,593
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1346
01:29:35,594 --> 01:29:40,348
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1347
01:29:40,349 --> 01:29:42,016
Yes, I have the letters.

1348
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:44,226
But I intend using them myself.

1349
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:47,939
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1350
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:51,192
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1351
01:29:51,193 --> 01:29:53,319
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1352
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,073
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1353
01:29:57,074 --> 01:29:59,367
The last man I want to see in America.

1354
01:29:59,368 --> 01:30:02,703
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1355
01:30:02,704 --> 01:30:06,040
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1356
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:08,876
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1357
01:30:08,877 --> 01:30:13,339
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1358
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,466
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1359
01:30:15,467 --> 01:30:17,718
but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1360
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:19,512
in spite of their legal rights.

1361
01:30:19,513 --> 01:30:21,514
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1362
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:22,723
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1363
01:30:22,724 --> 01:30:25,559
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1364
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,269
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1365
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:30,982
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1366
01:30:30,983 --> 01:30:34,402
something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1367
01:30:34,403 --> 01:30:37,196
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1368
01:30:37,197 --> 01:30:39,532
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1369
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:40,741
Then release him.

1370
01:30:40,742 --> 01:30:43,577
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1371
01:30:43,578 --> 01:30:46,288
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1372
01:30:46,289 --> 01:30:49,166
and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1373
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:51,627
You get him, and we get away.

1374
01:30:51,628 --> 01:30:54,755
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1375
01:30:54,756 --> 01:30:57,758
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1376
01:30:57,759 --> 01:31:00,594
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1377
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:03,097
but you were never interested
in any woman.

1378
01:31:03,098 --> 01:31:06,350
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1379
01:31:06,351 --> 01:31:08,936
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1380
01:31:08,937 --> 01:31:11,939
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1381
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,315
I'm gonna miss you.

1382
01:31:13,316 --> 01:31:16,694
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1383
01:31:16,695 --> 01:31:18,612
Oh, thanks.

1384
01:31:18,613 --> 01:31:19,905
Go ahead, Ricky.

1385
01:31:19,906 --> 01:31:22,742
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1386
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,785
I don't want them around
this afternoon.

1387
01:31:24,786 --> 01:31:29,786
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1388
01:31:34,296 --> 01:31:37,131
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1389
01:31:37,132 --> 01:31:40,676
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1390
01:31:40,677 --> 01:31:44,221
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1391
01:31:44,222 --> 01:31:49,222
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1392
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:52,772
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1393
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:55,941
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1394
01:31:55,942 --> 01:31:58,527
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1395
01:31:58,528 --> 01:32:00,029
Well, so long.

1396
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:03,240
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1397
01:32:03,241 --> 01:32:08,241
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1398
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:41,737
You're late.

1399
01:32:41,738 --> 01:32:45,074
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

1400
01:32:45,075 --> 01:32:48,285
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1401
01:32:48,286 --> 01:32:50,579
This place will never be
the same without you.

1402
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:54,291
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1403
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:57,211
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1404
01:32:57,212 --> 01:32:59,547
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1405
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:01,465
Sam's piano.

1406
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:03,676
Serves me right for not being musical.

1407
01:33:03,677 --> 01:33:05,219
Here they are.

1408
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:10,220
You better wait in my office.

1409
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:16,647
Here.

1410
01:33:16,648 --> 01:33:19,358
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1411
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:20,568
Not yet.

1412
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:22,319
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1413
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,571
Everything is quite all right.

1414
01:33:23,572 --> 01:33:26,740
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1415
01:33:26,741 --> 01:33:30,619
Please trust me.

1416
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:35,620
Yes, I will.

1417
01:33:37,085 --> 01:33:42,085
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1418
01:33:42,966 --> 01:33:46,468
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1419
01:33:46,469 --> 01:33:48,554
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1420
01:33:48,555 --> 01:33:52,016
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1421
01:33:52,017 --> 01:33:54,518
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1422
01:33:54,519 --> 01:33:57,104
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1423
01:33:57,105 --> 01:33:59,064
Victor Laszlo.

1424
01:33:59,065 --> 01:34:04,065
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1425
01:34:04,404 --> 01:34:06,238
The charge of
accessory to the murder...

1426
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:08,991
of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1427
01:34:08,992 --> 01:34:12,453
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1428
01:34:12,454 --> 01:34:16,207
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1429
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:20,794
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1430
01:34:20,795 --> 01:34:22,963
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1431
01:34:22,964 --> 01:34:25,299
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1432
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,843
but I will if you take one more step.

1433
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:32,844
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1434
01:34:33,308 --> 01:34:36,977
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1435
01:34:36,978 --> 01:34:39,313
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1436
01:34:39,314 --> 01:34:41,065
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1437
01:34:41,066 --> 01:34:43,859
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1438
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:46,445
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1439
01:34:46,446 --> 01:34:51,446
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1440
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:59,458
- Hello? Is that the airport?
- Huh?

1441
01:34:59,459 --> 01:35:01,335
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1442
01:35:01,336 --> 01:35:04,046
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1443
01:35:04,047 --> 01:35:06,257
There's to be no trouble about them.

1444
01:35:06,258 --> 01:35:07,716
Good.

1445
01:35:07,717 --> 01:35:11,470
Hello? Hello?

1446
01:35:14,015 --> 01:35:15,224
My car, quickly!

1447
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:18,352
This is Major Strasser.

1448
01:35:18,353 --> 01:35:20,980
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1449
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:25,981
At once, do you hear?

1450
01:35:29,406 --> 01:35:31,615
Hello, radio tower?

1451
01:35:31,616 --> 01:35:34,994
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1452
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:37,621
Visibility, 1 ½ miles.

1453
01:35:37,622 --> 01:35:41,709
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1454
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:46,710
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1455
01:35:56,975 --> 01:35:59,893
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1456
01:35:59,894 --> 01:36:01,854
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1457
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:04,148
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1458
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:05,357
Yes, sir.

1459
01:36:05,358 --> 01:36:08,277
This way, please.

1460
01:36:08,278 --> 01:36:11,572
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1461
01:36:11,573 --> 01:36:13,782
You think of everything, don't you?

1462
01:36:13,783 --> 01:36:16,410
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1463
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:20,164
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1464
01:36:20,165 --> 01:36:21,915
I don't understand.
What about you?

1465
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:24,209
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1466
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:26,378
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1467
01:36:26,379 --> 01:36:28,339
Last night
we said a great many things.

1468
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:30,424
You said
I was to do the thinking for us.

1469
01:36:30,425 --> 01:36:32,926
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1470
01:36:32,927 --> 01:36:35,387
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1471
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:38,098
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

1472
01:36:38,099 --> 01:36:41,143
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1473
01:36:41,144 --> 01:36:44,605
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1474
01:36:44,606 --> 01:36:47,066
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1475
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:50,694
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1476
01:36:50,695 --> 01:36:53,113
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1477
01:36:53,114 --> 01:36:55,616
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1478
01:36:55,617 --> 01:36:58,702
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1479
01:36:58,703 --> 01:37:03,082
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1480
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,334
But what about us?

1481
01:37:05,335 --> 01:37:06,919
We'll always have Paris.

1482
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,297
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1483
01:37:10,298 --> 01:37:12,883
We got it back last night.

1484
01:37:12,884 --> 01:37:17,137
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1485
01:37:17,138 --> 01:37:18,847
But I've got a job to do too.

1486
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,474
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1487
01:37:20,475 --> 01:37:23,185
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1488
01:37:23,186 --> 01:37:24,895
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1489
01:37:24,896 --> 01:37:28,524
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1490
01:37:28,525 --> 01:37:31,402
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1491
01:37:31,403 --> 01:37:35,114
Someday you'll understand that.

1492
01:37:35,115 --> 01:37:38,492
Now, now.

1493
01:37:38,493 --> 01:37:43,493
Here's looking at you, kid.

1494
01:37:55,969 --> 01:37:58,679
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1495
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,056
There's something you should know.

1496
01:38:01,057 --> 01:38:03,016
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1497
01:38:03,017 --> 01:38:06,311
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1498
01:38:06,312 --> 01:38:08,355
- You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

1499
01:38:08,356 --> 01:38:11,358
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1500
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:15,237
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1501
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:16,655
Yes.

1502
01:38:16,656 --> 01:38:18,866
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1503
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:22,536
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1504
01:38:22,537 --> 01:38:25,247
But that was all over long ago.

1505
01:38:25,248 --> 01:38:29,042
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1506
01:38:29,043 --> 01:38:30,836
I understand.

1507
01:38:30,837 --> 01:38:33,714
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1508
01:38:33,715 --> 01:38:36,383
I appreciate it.

1509
01:38:36,384 --> 01:38:38,385
Welcome back to the fight.

1510
01:38:38,386 --> 01:38:43,386
This time I know our side will win.

1511
01:38:54,611 --> 01:38:58,655
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1512
01:38:58,656 --> 01:39:03,160
Yes, I'm ready.

1513
01:39:03,161 --> 01:39:05,412
Goodbye, Rick.

1514
01:39:05,413 --> 01:39:08,624
God bless you.

1515
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:13,625
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1516
01:39:29,395 --> 01:39:31,480
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1517
01:39:31,481 --> 01:39:34,483
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1518
01:39:34,484 --> 01:39:35,984
What you just did for Laszlo.

1519
01:39:35,985 --> 01:39:38,570
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1520
01:39:38,571 --> 01:39:41,114
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1521
01:39:41,115 --> 01:39:43,283
But she knew you were lying.

1522
01:39:43,284 --> 01:39:45,410
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1523
01:39:45,411 --> 01:39:48,830
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1524
01:39:48,831 --> 01:39:50,165
Especially for you.

1525
01:39:50,166 --> 01:39:55,166
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1526
01:40:00,426 --> 01:40:02,469
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1527
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:07,307
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1528
01:40:07,308 --> 01:40:09,601
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1529
01:40:09,602 --> 01:40:13,939
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1530
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:16,984
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1531
01:40:16,985 --> 01:40:21,985
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1532
01:40:22,198 --> 01:40:23,949
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1533
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:28,950
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1534
01:40:40,842 --> 01:40:45,842
Major Strasser has been shot.

1535
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:52,181
Round up the usual suspects.

1536
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:15,834
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1537
01:41:15,835 --> 01:41:17,628
but you've become a patriot.

1538
01:41:17,629 --> 01:41:19,963
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1539
01:41:19,964 --> 01:41:24,964
I think perhaps you're right.

1540
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:50,619
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1541
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:53,246
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1542
01:41:53,247 --> 01:41:57,250
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1543
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:58,710
I could use a trip.

1544
01:41:58,711 --> 01:42:02,214
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1545
01:42:02,215 --> 01:42:05,258
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1546
01:42:05,259 --> 01:42:07,344
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1547
01:42:07,345 --> 01:42:12,345
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
