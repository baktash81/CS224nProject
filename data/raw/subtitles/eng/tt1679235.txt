00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
MEAN GIRLS -2- (2011)

2
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,880
There are times in your life
when you find yourself...

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,316
in very awkward situations.

4
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,919
I mean, just look
at that face, Jo.

5
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,821
Abby needs you.

6
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,423
We need you.

7
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:43,825
And we're willing to pay.

8
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:46,628
And this would
be one of those moments.

9
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:50,849
But I swear, it's not like I am
selling my kidney or anything.

10
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,836
Although, that would
have been less painful.

11
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,937
But I am getting
ahead of myself.

12
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,107
Let me start at the beginning.

13
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:01,244
And it's the big day, the
qualifying race of the Indy 500.

14
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,279
- She takes her position...
- This is my dad.

15
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,581
...revs the motor
of her stock car, hoping...

16
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,035
To not crash and burn on
the last lap of adolescence.

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,573
- Oh, that's my girl.
- Dad built engines for race cars.

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,825
And so did I.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,412
Ignore the pigtails.
I was more naive back then.

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,315
Because of his work,
I changed schools...

21
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,821
two times a year
for the past eight years.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:32,141
This doesn't make me a loner with a highly
evolved defense mechanism or anything.

23
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,644
OK, fine, it does.

24
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:38,432
Today, everything
was about to change.

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,001
It was my first day
at North Shore High,

26
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,438
the last stop before
Carnegie Mellon University,

27
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,206
my dream school.

28
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,876
My rules of survival
were simple:

29
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:52,680
Don't stand out,
never raise your hand in class...

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,649
and watch your back
at all times.

31
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:00,605
New town, same school,
same parking lot.

32
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:03,874
Everyone obsessed with the
freedom of their first car.

33
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:08,379
It's an identity, like the muscle cars
who think they own the road,

34
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,015
and check out
every passing vehicle.

35
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:15,871
Smart cars who don't fit in.

36
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:19,174
- Whoa.
- The "I am so perky...

37
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,761
I might shake off my tube top"
cutesy cars.

38
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,964
And then there's the most
dangerous vehicle on the road,

39
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:29,635
the high-performance,
high-maintenance sports cars.

40
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:34,140
# Like a girl changes clothes #

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,626
If they liked you,
your life was all green lights.

42
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,294
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:40,763
If they didn't,

44
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,699
you were nothing more than a
wreck on the side of the road.

45
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:49,137
# That you're not
going to change #

46
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,190
# because you're hot
Then you're cold #

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,092
# You're yes
Then you're no #

48
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:55,795
At North Shore,
they were called the Plastics,

49
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:59,699
and Mandi Weatherly
was the number one Plastic.

50
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,437
She dotted her name with a
signature heart above the "i".

51
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:07,407
Probably because she didn't
actually possess that organ.

52
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,810
Her two sidekicks
were Chastity Meyer,

53
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,548
who was stupid enough to hit a home run
with any boy willing to play,

54
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,417
and Hope Plotkin,
uber-hypochondriac,

55
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,621
who believed that germs
led to ugliness,

56
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:21,656
and ugliness led to death.

57
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:25,993
And thus, my number one rule
for survival: no girl drama.

58
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:30,231
Actually, no drama, period.

59
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,817
Please, please, don't be ruined.

60
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:36,154
And in high school, an already
embarrassing moment can go from bad...

61
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:37,404
- Whoa.
- Oh.

62
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:39,457
to worse.

63
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:42,294
- Are you OK?
- How bad do I look?

64
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:43,829
She couldn't
have looked worse.

65
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,248
- You look great.
- Really? Thanks.

66
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,517
I am Abby Hanover.
Yeah, you must be new.

67
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:52,388
I am part of the welcoming committee.
Well, there's only two of us, really, and...

68
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:55,975
and I'd... I'd love
to show you around.

69
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,978
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:05,517
Listen, I think I can find my way
to the front office, thanks.

71
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:09,271
So, Jo, I see your
dad's big in NASCAR.

72
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,139
Well, let me set
your mind at ease.

73
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,244
We know how to deal with
celebrities here at North Shore.

74
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:18,931
One of our lunch ladies was on
the first season of American Idol.

75
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,767
- Good to know.
- Yeah, it was pretty hot.

76
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,905
And, uh... we're also aware
of your many moves.

77
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:25,805
Okay.

78
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,107
because we're aware that students
who move around a lot...

79
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:32,178
often wind up as
serial killers or actors.

80
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:35,265
Hey, did I mention
we have an excellent drama department?

81
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,766
I am not really into drama,

82
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,537
but I do know you have
an advanced shop class.

83
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:43,923
Ah, menial laborer
rather than intellectual.

84
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,825
I can respect that.

85
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,462
Um, the cheerleading squad

86
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:52,349
will be going to the public
library for a field trip.

87
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,385
Now, last year, we had
some problems with that,

88
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,188
where we had 12 girls go,

89
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:00,591
and we had 15 girls come back.

90
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,894
I know
how much you all love vampires,

91
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,497
but remember,
the school nurse will be...

92
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:10,835
heading up the blood drive,
so sign up for that now.

93
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,756
Home Ec's down the hall, miss.

94
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:19,027
Actually, as refreshingly
sexist as that is,

95
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,029
I am here for Advanced Shop.

96
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,299
- Drafting class.
- Right.

97
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,868
Well, we lost Mike to that
circular saw incident,

98
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,571
so you can be
Tyler's partner.

99
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,657
OK, everybody, get started
on your birdhouses.

100
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,294
Trusses or triangles,
I don't care.

101
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:38,880
That's about all
I can deal with right now.

102
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,217
- Hey, Tyler, I am Jo.
- Hey.

103
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,655
- What's his deal?
- Well, uh, Mr. Giamatti...

104
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:48,758
bleeds Texas A&M maroon and
white, and they lost Saturday.

105
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,894
Well, if they want to be taken seriously,
they better beat the Longhorns.

106
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,195
Don't let Giamatti hear
you say that...

107
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:56,949
And just
when a guy seems all dreamy...

108
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,769
and has eyes
you can fall into...

109
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,438
So we have to build
a lame birdhouse. Um...

110
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,274
I guess you could decorate it.

111
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:08,812
He opens his mouth
and sounds like an ass.

112
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:12,014
Wow, thanks.

113
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:14,367
But I was thinking I could...

114
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,403
carve the dovetail joint.

115
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,105
- I am impressed.
- That makes one of us.

116
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:26,346
In every school,
students have their lunch gang.

117
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:31,452
As my dad says, your racer is
only as good as your pit crew.

118
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,454
Cutest dog ever, Mandi.

119
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:37,925
Thanks. Coco Chanel really
sets off my new purse.

120
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:40,028
You had her checked
for rabies, right?

121
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,630
Too bad you couldn't get the new Prada
bag with the fringe.

122
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,232
Would have totally
matched her brown fur.

123
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,183
Hello. Fringe is so out.

124
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:50,054
And I am at the top of the wait list
for the new, patent leather Prada satchel.

125
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,957
But you have already waited, like,
six months for the fringe...

126
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:55,828
Of course, Mandi,
fringe is so past tense.

127
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,312
Vogue says crimson
is the new accessory,

128
00:06:58,312 --> 00:06:59,914
and you're totally
going to rock that look.

129
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:01,899
Oh, I know.

130
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:05,637
Lost much, little freshies?
Scram.

131
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:07,872
Ten dogs in a minute.
Let's do this.

132
00:07:07,872 --> 00:07:09,573
You guys are going down.
We're going to win, come on.

133
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,694
- Yeah. Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

134
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,579
- Nick, focus.
- Come on, man.

135
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,581
Chastity, stop drooling.

136
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,717
You know what Mandi
thinks about you and Tyler.

137
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:22,054
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:24,457
Do not play dumb with me.

139
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,410
I don't have to play dumb.

140
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,496
Besides, the cashier
totally sneezed on your salad.

141
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,246
Ew.

142
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,539
- Ugh.
- Pay up, you two losers.

143
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,011
Ugh, God,
Nick is just so nasty.

144
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:48,165
I am only dating him because he's probably
getting a full ride to UCLA.

145
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:49,699
You know, one week
in LA and I will be...

146
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,003
a bikini model-hyphen-reality
star-hyphen-awesome.

147
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,705
- I heard Amy Hall is totally into him.
- Oh, she wouldn't dare.

148
00:07:55,705 --> 00:08:00,144
Nickie, over here.
I missed you.

149
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:05,948
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, have you been lifting weights?

150
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:08,786
Oh, dude, your rat-dog just tongued me.

151
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:11,855
Shut up, Nick. You will hurt
Coco Chanel's feelings.

152
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:14,942
- Aah.
- No groping south of the equator.

153
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:18,779
Or north, creep.

154
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,766
Wow, the hot chick can
really handle herself.

155
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:25,971
Wonder what else she can handle.

156
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:32,827
- Who the hell is she?
- Her name is Jo, Jo Mitchell.

157
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:34,463
She's in my bio class.

158
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:37,865
Somebody said she came somewhere,
from, like, Florida or Texas.

159
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:41,603
Then I also heard that she's
an exchange student from Russia.

160
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,406
Oh, what did they
exchange her for?

161
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,595
She's kind of pretty,
don't you think?

162
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,330
Well,
if you're into pleather.

163
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,117
Hello, there.
Hi, Coco Chanel.

164
00:08:55,117 --> 00:09:00,572
Go back to Mandi, go on.
Go, go, go.

165
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,208
All right, just a little bit.

166
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:08,014
Where's Coco Chanel?

167
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,168
Bad little girl.

168
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:24,564
Oh, my God. Who did that?

169
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,016
- Who fed Coco Chanel?
- It was Abby.

170
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:30,404
- Abby did it.
- You? Again?

171
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,959
I am sorry, I didn't know.
I am really sorry, Mandi.

172
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,961
I will buy you another purse.

173
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,730
Or you can just have mine.

174
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,498
Is that what I think it is?

175
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,418
- Uh-oh, duck.
- I love ducks.

176
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,354
It's, um,
the Prada fringe purse.

177
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,040
My dad got it for me
last month, but...

178
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,362
Last month? Ugh, just go.

179
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,251
- Aah.
- Oh.

180
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:02,687
Stay down there,
and don't ever look at me again.

181
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,541
Better yet, don't even
breathe the same air.

182
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:28,064
Hey. Well, how was it?

183
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:31,315
I saw a girl become
roadkill in the cafeteria.

184
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,118
got to love high school.

185
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:36,556
Speaking of my escape, has my
Carnegie Mellon application arrived?

186
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:38,240
Hey, you know,
I was looking today,

187
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,077
and I saw that the University of Ohio
has a great architectural program.

188
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,046
You could stay close to home,

189
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:48,685
transform Toledo into an
architectural wonderland.

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,087
Dad, what's going on?

191
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,756
I am applying early decision
to Carnegie Mellon.

192
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,624
Eh, what do you want to
go there for, huh?

193
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:59,128
They don't even have a good mascot.
I mean, a Scottish terrier.

194
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,697
Who's going to be
intimidated by that?

195
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:03,083
Plus, you, uh...

196
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,119
You qualify
for in-state tuition here.

197
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,688
Oh, my God.

198
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:10,841
What happened to my tuition?

199
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:17,648
Aw, Jo...
Look, I am sorry.

200
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:19,983
I kept hoping that
the market would rebound,

201
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:23,471
but my investments are in the tank,
and now NASCAR sponsors have cut spending...

202
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,407
Then make them
un-cut spending.

203
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,043
Mom went to Carnegie Mellon,
I... I have to go there.

204
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:32,480
- She loved it.
- I know, I know.

205
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,565
I am sorry I let you down.

206
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:41,055
I know you're disappointed,
Jo, and that's OK.

207
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,294
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong.

208
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:50,331
Strong?
I was trying not to panic.

209
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,600
But when you have moved
as much as I have,

210
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,673
you kind of get attached to the idea
of settling down in one place for 4 years.

211
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,310
In this case,
my mother's alma mater.

212
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,648
My dad and I have been
on our own for a long time.

213
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,616
My mom died before I was one.

214
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:12,921
So life wasn't exactly your typical warm
and fuzzy greeting card.

215
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:17,360
But I wasn't the only one
in my own personal hell.

216
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,014
Abby was hoping that her
swollen, black ankle...

217
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:25,935
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

218
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:30,540
And it might have been,

219
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,177
if not for the
two's long history.

220
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:37,713
Jealousy is a funny thing.

221
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,516
They had lived across
from each other for years.

222
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:44,521
And while Mandi, seemingly,
had everything,

223
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,605
Abby had more.
She had two parents...

224
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:49,860
who went a little overboard
for their darling Abby.

225
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,265
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

226
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,617
Mandi's was cool,

227
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:59,470
but Abby's
was three stories high.

228
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,470
Yay.

229
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,027
Then, the French Revolution
Halloween meltdown...

230
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:07,479
at age 11.

231
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,847
Mandi flaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

232
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,885
until she spotted Abby's
utterly perfect,

233
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:17,772
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royal gown.

234
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:25,130
And finally, the great bra
incident of junior high.

235
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,032
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

236
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:30,836
Well, that had more
to do with nature.

237
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:34,222
Still, Mandi might have
found someone else to hate,

238
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:38,127
if Abby hadn't
done the unthinkable.

239
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:44,432
Mandi, oh, my God. Someone has
a better parking space than us.

240
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,987
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

241
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:49,889
I guess you're number two now.

242
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:52,625
Two? Two?

243
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,744
Mandi hated
being number two.

244
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:02,402
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

245
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,190
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

246
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,270
Chastity.

247
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:15,115
- Hey.
- Anything.

248
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,282
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

249
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,435
Trained in Java and C++.

250
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,038
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

251
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:27,343
- and I do a little salsa for the ladies.
- Oh.

252
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,912
How can I be of service?

253
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:31,164
Oops.

254
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,972
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross.

255
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:42,510
Abby Scabby's face looks as red
and pussy as it did in seventh grade.

256
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,278
Zit cream much?

257
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,716
Mandi was creative,
ruthless, unrelenting.

258
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:53,137
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

259
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,981
And this was
just the beginning.

260
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,519
Brutal.

261
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:16,328
You know, most girls would have laughed,
texted back or posted a status update.

262
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,530
Do I look like most girls?

263
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:30,960
Oh, God.

264
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,229
What a paint job.

265
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:42,071
Need another one?

266
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,447
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

267
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,717
I don't bite.

268
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:09,249
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

269
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:20,694
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

270
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,113
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

271
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:42,884
I gave Abby a ride home from
school, and she dropped this.

272
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,287
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

273
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,355
She had an accident,
didn't she? Was she hurt?

274
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:51,360
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

275
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,862
Again? I knew we should have
sent her to St. Mary's.

276
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:59,402
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

277
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,406
She's a wreck.

278
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:08,443
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

279
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:11,214
I will buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

280
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,800
Money's not going to
fix this, Sidney.

281
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,737
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

282
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,640
If only she had some friends.

283
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:34,872
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

284
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:38,641
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

285
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,911
I mean,
just look at that face.

286
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,046
She needs you. We need you.

287
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,714
And we're willing to pay.

288
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:48,736
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

289
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:52,006
Two, three, 4,000
to get you started.

290
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,291
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

291
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,827
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

292
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,597
And if I can't buy my daughter's happiness,
then what is it worth?

293
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:03,818
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

294
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:09,057
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

295
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,977
There must be
something you want.

296
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:14,312
Some dream I can
help come true.

297
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:18,583
A new car?
A trip to Europe? College?

298
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,772
College.

299
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:25,756
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

300
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:30,546
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

301
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,298
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

302
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,933
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

303
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,202
I guarantee you will
be happy you did.

304
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:40,639
And just for trying, I will buy your
college books for freshman year,

305
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:45,361
which are yours to keep, no questions
asked, as my little gift to you.

306
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,497
Sidney
was pretty convincing,

307
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:51,667
and I should have
realized why.

308
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,470
He was the king
of infomercials.

309
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,006
He could sell anything from
meat juicers to cat toilets...

310
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,009
to my college tuition.

311
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,611
I knew it was crazy.

312
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,880
But Abby'd have
a good senior year,

313
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,252
and I'd get my dream of
Carnegie Mellon University.

314
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:12,756
I figured, who would it hurt?

315
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,676
Four hundred people
already viewed it.

316
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,061
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

317
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:21,514
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone ever comes through.

318
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,449
Especially fathers and doctors.

319
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,853
Not my legs,
Chastity, my face.

320
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:30,090
I am getting all
red and splotchy. Ugh.

321
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,592
- Uh-oh.
- What?

322
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,244
You're never
going to believe this.

323
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:35,546
What do you mean?

324
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:38,582
Someone posted a link on
your page to another video.

325
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:42,787
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

326
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:47,057
Ugh, who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

327
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:50,412
- There's tons of comments.
- Ugh.

328
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:55,149
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

329
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:58,119
So she's hot.

330
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,088
She's well-connected.

331
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:02,658
I mean, she's
pretty much one of us.

332
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,927
So we will just need
to make it very clear that,

333
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:08,463
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people we like.

334
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,303
Agreed?

335
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,193
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

336
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,395
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

337
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:25,898
God, I am not up for the
paparazzi this morning.

338
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,721
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

339
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:35,124
I am Mandi, with an "i".
And you're Jo, right?

340
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,694
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

341
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,947
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

342
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,468
- Us.
- The real welcoming committee...

343
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:44,369
had arrived.

344
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:47,805
- And who not to.
- Did I say "welcoming?"

345
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,245
Uh, oh, wow.

346
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,510
Thanks.

347
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,313
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

348
00:20:56,313 --> 00:21:00,685
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

349
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,520
- Excuse me?
- But I am a benevolent dictator,

350
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,310
so why don't we discuss over a non-fat,
no-sugar raspberry Frappuccino...

351
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,945
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

352
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,313
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

353
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,082
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

354
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:17,502
I will have to pass.

355
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:21,055
Oh, it wasn't a question.

356
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:24,559
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

357
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:28,079
Oh, my God. Hi.

358
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,815
I am Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

359
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:34,853
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

360
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:38,323
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

361
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:42,428
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

362
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,763
I wrote one article
on school uniforms,

363
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,531
and she put strawberries
in my yogurt.

364
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,468
How horrible for you?

365
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:52,204
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

366
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:56,508
swelled up like a big Arothron
hispidus. That's a blowfish.

367
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:59,011
Be careful, Jo.

368
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:02,514
Thanks, but I am
not that worried.

369
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,990
Hey, what's up?

370
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,094
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

371
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:17,898
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

372
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:22,035
Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

373
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:25,289
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

374
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:28,708
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

375
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,129
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

376
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,529
so you're off the hook.

377
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:36,549
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

378
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:44,591
Registration
for AP test has closed.

379
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:45,311
Now...

380
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:49,630
Uh, now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore...

381
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,169
is to, uh, use
the Homecoming Dance...

382
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,639
to fund-raise
for charity, okay?

383
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:03,112
because otherwise you all
would just think...

384
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,813
the world revolves around
you and football.

385
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:09,368
And it doesn't, OK?

386
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:10,985
I told you not to walk
in front of...

387
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:13,488
Babe, I already chose your
tuxedo, rented the limo and...

388
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:16,525
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

389
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:18,995
Mandi, you are so winning
Homecoming Queen.

390
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:19,996
Totally winning.

391
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,698
The school nurse
will be heading up the blood drive,

392
00:23:23,698 --> 00:23:25,901
- so sign up for that now.
- Please.

393
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:30,338
Like I am letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

394
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:33,174
I know.
And no matter what I said...

395
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:36,113
Hey, uh... do you know
where I could catch the bus?

396
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,814
I think it just left.

397
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:41,417
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

398
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,688
Do you know any good auto parts shops?
I have got to get a new spark plug.

399
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:50,093
Well, I... I think there's Pete's Auto
right next to the coffee joint.

400
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:52,128
I could give you
a ride if you want.

401
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,731
I mean, I really
owe you one anyway.

402
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,966
Sweet, thanks.

403
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,343
Oh, look, it's Jo.
Hey, Jo.

404
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:11,615
- Hey.
- She's with Abby Hanover.

405
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,365
Hi.

406
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,787
Thanks for the lift.

407
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,256
Do you want to come inside?

408
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:40,462
I will probably break something,
but... but sure.

409
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,956
- Who's that?
- Um, my mom.

410
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,694
She's really pretty.

411
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,599
Yeah. She was.

412
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:08,640
- What are these?
- Um...

413
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,728
That's the Sydney Harbor Bridge
and a skyscraper I have been designing.

414
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:15,781
Kind of hard to tell,
I am a crappy artist.

415
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,502
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

416
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:22,471
Uh, you're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

417
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,690
You should see
my paintings sometime.

418
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,561
Uh, actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

419
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:30,947
No, that'd be really cool.

420
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:34,584
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

421
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:45,745
My gosh,
is that a friend?

422
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,447
Maybe you were right.

423
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:50,184
Girls aren't
so bad after all.

424
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:54,422
Hello, Mr. Winkle.

425
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:58,843
Are those illegal parts? I will bet
you're running a chop shop over there.

426
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:02,813
Well, I have installed security cameras,
and I will be watching you.

427
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:07,201
- You hear?
- Goodbye, Mr. Winkle.

428
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:25,270
Jo Mitchell, you have
no idea how scary I can be.

429
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,635
Hey, Abby. How are you?

430
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:40,385
Ah.

431
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:45,457
- I can't get up.
- Are you all right?

432
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:48,228
I don't know.
Pull me as hard as you can.

433
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:49,429
OK.

434
00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:57,820
- Now what?
- Uh, help me up.

435
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,570
OK.

436
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:04,827
Seriously? Who would ever
think of something so childish,

437
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:08,832
yet brilliant,
except a bunch of mean girls?

438
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,419
- Hey, Mandi.
- Hi.

439
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:16,793
Now, what do we do?

440
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:19,594
I would have strangled her
right there...

441
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:20,978
Meet me in the bathroom.

442
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:23,280
Bring any spare clothes
that you have.

443
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,049
if I could get off the Vespa.

444
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:31,188
Wow. Bad-ass.

445
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:32,148
So cool.

446
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,894
Coming through.

447
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,130
Sorry.

448
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:42,666
Are you okay?

449
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:45,353
This is all my fault.

450
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,955
You should have never
hung out with me.

451
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,723
Mandi's going to make
your life a living hell.

452
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:50,457
Abby, you can't live in fear.

453
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:54,129
- Did you find me something to wear?
- Just my art smock.

454
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,732
That will have to do.
Thanks.

455
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:02,437
- Do you need my help?
- I think I got it.

456
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:06,141
- How do I look?
- Great.

457
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,863
- Hey, nice look.
- It's not funny.

458
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:16,001
- I am not joking, it's hot.
- Thanks.

459
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:24,210
No unauthorized videos
of my students on the monitor.

460
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:25,814
By the next day,

461
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:29,014
I hoped everyone would have forgotten
about my wardrobe malfunction,

462
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:31,101
but it wasn't
what I was expecting.

463
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:36,255
Apparently, holding your head high
after a Mandi vendetta earned you points.

464
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:49,836
- Oh, my gosh, this is so cool.
- You started it.

465
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:51,955
It was your smock.

466
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:58,545
- It's cute.
- It's pathetic.

467
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:03,350
I could smear paint all over my Versace,
but I have taste, style.

468
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,236
They're just sheep.

469
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:09,356
Chastity, make out with the student intern
in the front office, get Jo's file.

470
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,359
Hope, stalk her.

471
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,628
I want to know everything.

472
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,742
Wow, this is amazing.

473
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:30,711
You shouldn't waste your
talent on sketches for me.

474
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:33,314
Oh, I don't mind.

475
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,566
All right, what
should we work on first?

476
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,319
Um, well, I love
building cars with my dad,

477
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,756
but I want to... I want to design
something more lasting and permanent.

478
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:45,694
I.M. Pei, for instance,
designs the most amazing buildings,

479
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:48,531
- and Joseph Strauss...
- Built the Golden Gate Bridge.

480
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:52,234
Yeah, my family went there last summer.
It's pretty awesome.

481
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:55,422
Well, then, why don't we start
with San Francisco?

482
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:56,723
All right, cool.

483
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:01,477
Oh, um... yeah, and if my dad
asks, this is a school project.

484
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:04,263
He thinks artists are,
like, homeless hippies, so...

485
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,066
- I don't want to get you in trouble.
- Oh, no, no, no.

486
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,752
I need some more samples
for my portfolio anyway.

487
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:11,854
I am applying
to NYU Design School.

488
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:16,526
Or, as I tell my dad, Columbia Pre-Med.

489
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,750
These are...
They're incredible.

490
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,590
Thanks.

491
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:33,427
Tyler, late. Sit.

492
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:35,479
While I was breaking
all my rules with Abby,

493
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,165
I figured I could enjoy
a few other things

494
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,934
North Shore had to offer.

495
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:44,155
He could walk in late
any day he wanted.

496
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:47,992
# You're taking over my heart #

497
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:51,295
# Taking over my head
Making me rewind #

498
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:54,465
# Everything that you said
I can't concentrate #

499
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:59,837
# My mind hesitates
Everything that you do #

500
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:03,074
# I stop on a dime
When you come around #

501
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:08,347
# It's always the same Don't you know
you're my favorite distraction? #

502
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,299
Hey.

503
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,401
Oh. Hi.

504
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:15,987
OK, everybody, big day today.

505
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:20,843
A&M beat Arkansas
in overtime on Saturday. Yes.

506
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:25,447
Oh, and today, we commence
the great egg-drop project.

507
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:27,117
Young lady, that is where we drop...

508
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,018
a boiled egg in a parachute
without it breaking.

509
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:32,155
You will be judged
on style and structure.

510
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:35,190
And if you'd just like to opt out
and bring in deviled eggs for the class...

511
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,610
Tempting, but doesn't the
top student have the option

512
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,813
to submit for the Thompson-Bird
Architecture scholarship?

513
00:31:40,813 --> 00:31:45,134
Yes, not that any
of you slackers care.

514
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:49,806
Eligibility for the scholarship
requires a 4.5 GPA,

515
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:53,644
at least a 2300 on your SATs,
math and verbal,

516
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,712
top scores
on all class projects

517
00:31:55,712 --> 00:32:00,801
and a glowing letter of
recommendation from me.

518
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:04,788
And as you know, I don't glow often.

519
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,461
Let me guess,
we're going to have to win.

520
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,162
Pretty much.

521
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:15,966
Well, then maybe we should
get in some extra study time.

522
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:18,168
Go to a movie or something?

523
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:21,338
- Tomorrow night?
- Sounds good.

524
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,498
- Hey.
- Guess what?

525
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:33,501
Tyler just asked me out.

526
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:36,237
It was amazing,
having a friend to confide in.

527
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,440
Jo, you can't.
It'd be a big mistake.

528
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,508
- Or not.
- You don't know who he...

529
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,878
He's my shop partner,
and I have seen him without a shirt.

530
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,047
Good enough for me.

531
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,218
# Can't stay this way forever #

532
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,124
# Let's stay this way forever #

533
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,127
Oh, my God.
Tyler is a total traitor.

534
00:32:58,361 --> 00:33:01,097
- She's so crossed the line.
- Who has?

535
00:33:01,097 --> 00:33:04,984
That bitch, Jo.
God, Nick, keep up.

536
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,119
And give me your car keys.

537
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,757
Don't.

538
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,311
- Where you going?
- Nowhere. Out with a friend.

539
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:19,948
Your friend's got a nice car.
And your friend is also a guy.

540
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,717
Goodbye, Dad.
I will be home by ten.

541
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:25,088
Nice wheels.

542
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,588
Nick insisted
I borrow his car.

543
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,958
I figured you take cars pretty seriously,
so I took him up on it.

544
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,661
Does that mean
I get to drive?

545
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:33,263
Yes.

546
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,799
- Oh, thank you.
- After you.

547
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,202
Thank you very much.

548
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,478
# Doctor, won't you
help me please? #

549
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,031
# Don't know where to go
I am down on my knees #

550
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:53,551
# I need you #

551
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:57,472
# I need you #
# My mother said pick the very best one #

552
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:01,491
# The very best one is Y-O-U #

553
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:04,394
I got to admit, Jo,
you did pretty good.

554
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,563
No screaming
on the roller coaster,

555
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:08,532
a solid stomach
on the Gravitron.

556
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:10,935
And kicking your ass
at bumper cars.

557
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:13,470
I like a guy who
can take the heat.

558
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,305
Oh, really?

559
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,093
How many guys
are you looking at?

560
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:21,129
Come on, Jo.

561
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,130
Four schools in three years?

562
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,835
How many? Six boyfriends?
A dozen?

563
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,904
None.

564
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:32,173
But I am sort of breaking
all my rules this year.

565
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,476
You have never
had a boyfriend?

566
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:37,695
Shut up. So I never
played Spin the Bottle,

567
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:40,933
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

568
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:43,569
Never...

569
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:45,270
...kissed anyone?

570
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,955
# So I fell into your hands #

571
00:34:46,955 --> 00:34:48,640
# I don't know
where we will land #

572
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,477
# I am just going
with the flow #

573
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:54,363
# Giving me love, love, love #

574
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:57,065
# Ah, ah #

575
00:34:57,065 --> 00:35:00,136
# Giving me love, love, love #

576
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:03,606
# Ah, ah
More than I ever need #

577
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,711
# Your love #

578
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:09,295
Beginning of the
blood drive this month, so sign up now.

579
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:12,231
That's it from me,
I am your principal.

580
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:14,167
You know me.
I will see you in the hallways.

581
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:16,954
Remember, stay left,
or right...

582
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:19,572
- How'd it go?
- Perfect, you had nothing to worry about.

583
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:21,440
Hello, North Shore,

584
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,961
last night,
our new girl Jo Mitchell...

585
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,380
had a first date, and more.

586
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,201
Come on, Jo. How many?
Six boyfriends? A dozen?

587
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:34,071
None. But I am sort of breaking
all my rules this year.

588
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,390
Oh, God. This isn't happening.

589
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,711
- You have never had a boyfriend?
- Shut up.

590
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:42,213
So I never played
Spin the Bottle,

591
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:46,618
I never suffered through
Seven Minutes in Heaven, I...

592
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:48,636
Never... kissed anyone?

593
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:51,956
That's right,
Jo Mitchell is a virgin.

594
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:55,093
She's a virgin?

595
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,966
Ah, young love.
Isn't it pathetic?

596
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,703
Jo, I am so sorry.
It's going to be OK, I promise.

597
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,947
Emergency slumber party?

598
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:34,768
Thanks, Abby.

599
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:37,603
You're the best. I am...

600
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:39,638
I am sorry I didn't listen.

601
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:42,358
And Abby was the best.

602
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:44,694
Which only made me feel worse.

603
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:46,296
I was totally lying to her,

604
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:49,331
the one person who
kept having my back.

605
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:51,435
Maybe I deserved
Mandi's torture.

606
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:54,020
Jo, I am sorry, I didn't...

607
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,923
How could you
set me up like that?

608
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:59,026
I hope you and Mandi
are very happy together.

609
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:02,563
I can't believe him.

610
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,102
Jo, how are you holding up?

611
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,738
Elliot wanted to do a story
on virgins in high school,

612
00:37:11,738 --> 00:37:13,523
but I totally nixed it.

613
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,226
- Uh, hi. You're Jo, right?
- Yeah.

614
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:20,815
Guys. Last year, all 3 of us fell
for this jerk of a senior.

615
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:23,250
We put out, and he dumped us
the next day.

616
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,970
We should have waited,
like you, for the right guy.

617
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,222
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,407
Tyler wasn't exactly
the right guy.

619
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,511
He was just another one
of Mandi's puppets.

620
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,962
Yeah, well, we just wanted to tell you
we think you're awesome.

621
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,031
- Yeah, definitely.
- See you around.

622
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:39,101
Thanks.

623
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:40,769
Why does he even
put up with her?

624
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,921
Why wouldn't he? You can't
choose your siblings.

625
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:48,410
- What? Siblings?
- I thought he told you.

626
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,979
- Tyler is Mandi's stepbrother.
- I am such an idiot.

627
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,886
- I thought they were just hooking up.
- Oh, gross.

628
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:59,555
But now you see why it was so easy
for Mandi to bug your date.

629
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:02,726
No way, not Tyler. It had
to have been someone else.

630
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:04,794
Oh, my God.
We were in Nick's car.

631
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:07,879
- You dick. You bugged the car?
- Come on, man.

632
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:10,198
- I thought it was fun...
- Don't you turn your back on me, Nick.

633
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,168
What are you going to do, Tyler?
You're going to hit your best friend?

634
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:14,620
- Break it up. That's enough.
- Can't you take a joke?

635
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,489
- I am going to mess you up.
- You don't scare me.

636
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,491
You don't scare me.

637
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:20,893
- Punch me. Bring it on.
- Come on. Are you afraid?

638
00:38:20,893 --> 00:38:22,161
Well, that was fun.

639
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:24,163
Hope, what else do we
have on the Virgin Queen?

640
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:28,469
Well, a 4.5 GPA, high SATs,
three AP classes and...

641
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:31,087
Oh, she's applying for
architecture scholarships.

642
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:34,807
Her dream,
Carnegie Mellon University.

643
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:38,462
- Hm.
- OK, so one more time.

644
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:43,166
She's never made out
with anyone... ever?

645
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,268
Or this week?

646
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,723
Hey, not so fast.

647
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:52,160
Uh, today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

648
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,896
- 20 percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

649
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:58,698
Look, I am just trying
to say I am sorry, OK?

650
00:38:58,698 --> 00:39:00,701
I was clouded by lust.

651
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:05,705
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

652
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,609
You're still a jerk.

653
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:10,612
At least your shirt's funny.

654
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:22,991
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

655
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:24,543
Does this mean I am forgiven?

656
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:28,179
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

657
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:32,167
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi...

658
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,670
in a totally platonic way.

659
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,673
Wait, you thought...?

660
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:39,508
Dude, gross.

661
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:42,278
But despite Quinn
and Abby's urging,

662
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:44,781
I refused to stoop
to Mandi's level.

663
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:50,286
Besides, I was having so much fun
with my new friends, I almost didn't care.

664
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,155
You coming?

665
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:57,261
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

666
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,163
I was just looking
at the Homecoming Web site,

667
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,164
and everybody's talking
about the hot, new couple.

668
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:04,768
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

669
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,004
Not anymore.

670
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,318
So this was it,
the first challenge.

671
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,370
Success was worth 100 points,

672
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,142
and I needed every point I could get
to qualify for the scholarship.

673
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:34,263
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

674
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,652
- Ready?
- Ready.

675
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:40,538
And... drop.

676
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,228
OK, who
switched the eggs?

677
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:50,265
Who? No one?

678
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:58,055
Oh, well. Who's next?

679
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:02,260
Mandi had found a new part
of my life to destroy:

680
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,597
my chance at the
Thomson-Bird scholarship.

681
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,534
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

682
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,287
- You ready?
- Yeah.

683
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,641
Hope called her doctor
on speed dial

684
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,645
and switched our CO2
for laughing gas.

685
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,955
Whoa.

686
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:40,751
Hey, guys, I am here.

687
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,019
Seriously, Chastity?

688
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:45,655
I said "incognito",
not "like a flamingo".

689
00:41:45,655 --> 00:41:48,492
- Oh.
- Go.

690
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:56,750
Ew. Ew. Ew. There's poo
on my Jimmy Choo.

691
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,452
Shake it off, shake it off.

692
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,888
Go, slow.

693
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,323
Faster.

694
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,697
Uh, I can't go any further.

695
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:12,232
What is the matter with you?

696
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:23,328
Funnel.

697
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,831
The funnel.

698
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:28,366
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

699
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:32,103
- Oh.
- Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

700
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:49,388
Coffee?

701
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:04,720
Perfect.

702
00:43:21,956 --> 00:43:27,711
- Dad, what's going on?
- It's ruined.

703
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:30,647
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

704
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:34,418
- It was running perfectly yesterday.
- I don't know.

705
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:38,238
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

706
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:42,226
It doesn't matter because Jimmy and the
boys are expecting a trial run tomorrow.

707
00:43:43,228 --> 00:43:44,712
Dad...

708
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,547
We can figure something out.

709
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:50,901
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

710
00:43:52,404 --> 00:43:57,142
Maybe I can call in a favor,
uh, beg for an extension,

711
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:59,844
tell them it was some kind of
fluke accident, I don't know.

712
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:24,136
But this was
definitely no accident.

713
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:26,838
Mandi had gone too far.

714
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:28,607
Mess with me, fine.

715
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:31,410
Mess with my family...

716
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,662
...you're dead.

717
00:44:33,662 --> 00:44:38,068
It was as if all my girl hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

718
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:41,071
and I was out for blood.

719
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:42,387
The Plastics were going down,

720
00:44:42,387 --> 00:44:46,426
and I didn't care
what rules I had to break...

721
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:48,462
to make her pay.

722
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:55,151
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

723
00:44:58,055 --> 00:44:59,272
Is that all you got?

724
00:44:59,272 --> 00:45:03,711
Going after my dad,
you spoiled, narcissistic bitch.

725
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:07,614
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you.

726
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:10,017
But it was so much fun.

727
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:14,222
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

728
00:45:14,222 --> 00:45:18,142
- Right?
- I don't run away that easy.

729
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:20,678
Get over yourself, man-hands.

730
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:22,780
You're just a passing phase.

731
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,582
I am here for the long run.

732
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:33,324
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure about that?

733
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:45,070
Ooh. Coffee?

734
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:57,099
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

735
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:01,536
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

736
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:09,529
There's something
I need to tell you.

737
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:14,768
This was it,
the moment to tell Abby

738
00:46:14,768 --> 00:46:18,705
I'd made a deal with her father
that I totally regretted,

739
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:21,557
and beg for forgiveness.

740
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:23,126
But looking at her,

741
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:26,329
the idea of losing my first
best friend in a long time,

742
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,814
I couldn't do it.

743
00:46:27,814 --> 00:46:31,351
So, what do you
need to tell me?

744
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:34,481
I, um...

745
00:46:37,757 --> 00:46:42,396
You should know, my
last BFF relationship...

746
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:44,147
crashed and burned.

747
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:47,401
She became snobby
and judgmental

748
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:50,821
and used guys
as pawns of warfare,

749
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:52,973
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

750
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:57,945
Geez.
Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

751
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,481
But don't worry,
we're nothing like that.

752
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,168
Success. OK.

753
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:06,888
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

754
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:10,023
which was pretty much
every issue.

755
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:13,962
- If there's dirt, we will find it.
- What's this?

756
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:18,801
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.
Everybody wants to be invited.

757
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:20,587
But, of course, they aren't.

758
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,288
Mandi never allows anybody
to throw a party when she does.

759
00:47:23,288 --> 00:47:26,275
Is that so?

760
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:35,017
I am so excited.

761
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:37,853
Tonight is going to
be the perfect night.

762
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:41,791
It should be.
It's costing my dad enough.

763
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,059
Our dad, Tyler.

764
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:46,629
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

765
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:50,366
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

766
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:53,520
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

767
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,224
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

768
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:00,927
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

769
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:02,829
But high school
will end, Mandi.

770
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:05,231
And then what
will you have left?

771
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,060
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's going to show up.

772
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,080
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party...

773
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,182
with cocktail dresses
and raw fish,

774
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:25,319
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

775
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,604
People who think
Mandi's awesome.

776
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,689
No one
actually thinks that.

777
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:32,860
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

778
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,860
Ooh.

779
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:38,599
Wait, why aren't
you guys ready? Huh?

780
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,304
- People will arrive any minute.
- We are ready.

781
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:45,039
No. No.

782
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,009
- Abby, no. Honey.
- Mom...

783
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,561
I bought you all those
party clothes for a reason.

784
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:53,314
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

785
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:55,200
Huh? Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, let's go.

786
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,552
Come on, sugar, let's go.

787
00:48:57,552 --> 00:49:02,406
Come on. My little girl
is throwing a party.

788
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,646
- Seriously?
- Mom, stop.

789
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:11,250
Now, Jo, you know you're not going to
have this little body forever.

790
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,086
Mom.
I am just saying she ought to show it off.

791
00:49:14,086 --> 00:49:17,122
- Mom, just stop.
- In something like this.

792
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,893
- Ugh. Ilene Hanover.
- Definitely.

793
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:22,862
I knew it.

794
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,972
- Invitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

795
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:35,241
Oh, no, I am sorry,
it's invite only.

796
00:49:39,013 --> 00:49:40,513
Okay.

797
00:49:45,703 --> 00:49:50,039
Thank you, thank you all so much
for coming to my birth...

798
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:56,730
Where... Where is everyone?

799
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:05,172
# Spend it up so big #

800
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:08,076
# So the whole world
knows my love for you #

801
00:50:08,076 --> 00:50:10,911
# So big
My heart is so big #

802
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:14,181
# My love is so big
For you #

803
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,151
# For you, for you #

804
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:19,220
Wow. I can't believe this.

805
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:23,040
I can't believe this
is my house, my party.

806
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,777
Believe it.

807
00:50:25,777 --> 00:50:30,631
- You both look amazing.
- Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.

808
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:35,454
This party rocks.
Only where's the food?

809
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:39,592
Oh, I heard Mandi's
serving nigiri sushi.

810
00:50:39,592 --> 00:50:43,361
- That's sushi.
- Pizza's coming.

811
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:44,081
Pizza.

812
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:49,368
This is a disaster
of epic proportions.

813
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,037
I mean,
don't panic, Mandi.

814
00:50:52,037 --> 00:50:55,539
Maybe they just got
the wrong address.

815
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:00,112
Or... what if Jo and Abby

816
00:51:00,112 --> 00:51:03,615
are throwing a party tonight?

817
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,988
Stating the
obvious much, moron?

818
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:13,559
- What are we going to do?
- Not go over there?

819
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:19,648
He's inside.

820
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:20,448
# Ooh, ooh-ooh #

821
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:27,090
# Ooh-ooh #

822
00:51:27,509 --> 00:51:30,194
# Now I want to do it up
so big #

823
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:42,973
Hope, do you still have that
vile medicine from your doctor?

824
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:46,744
You mean the ipecac?
Of course.

825
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:47,829
Oh.

826
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:55,286
# Before she got your boy
doing crazy things #

827
00:51:55,286 --> 00:52:00,125
# That I never
thought I'd ever do #

828
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:03,995
Elliot hasn't stopped
staring at you all night.

829
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,747
Really? But he's Elliot.

830
00:52:13,388 --> 00:52:15,072
Thanks.

831
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:18,010
Oh, thank God,
I am starving.

832
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,445
Do these smell funny?

833
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:24,716
Maybe the delivery guy
mixed up our order.

834
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:28,587
- Here you go. Thanks.
- No problem. Glad to help.

835
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,940
- Wait. Don't eat that.
- What? Why?

836
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,245
Because I am not the only one
who paid the pizza guy.

837
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,750
OK, it's done.

838
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,253
Their party's about to
get extremely unsanitary.

839
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:51,761
- What'd I miss?
- Oh, nothing, honey bear.

840
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:53,662
We just have
a party to attend.

841
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:56,500
Oh, and I wouldn't wear
nice shoes if I were you.

842
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,334
Perhaps galoshes.

843
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:13,067
- Happy not your birthday.
- Really, Chastity?

844
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:14,735
Joke.

845
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:22,343
Wait, nobody's puking.

846
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:24,478
Oh, thank God.

847
00:53:24,478 --> 00:53:26,513
I mean, damn it.

848
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:29,534
Where's the pizza?

849
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:32,068
What the hell happened?

850
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:35,005
God, Nick, go do something.

851
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:42,013
- Look at those two.
- God, what does Tyler even see in her?

852
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:45,483
Get over it already, Chastity.
My brother is off-limits.

853
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:47,485
Like what you
say matters, Mandi.

854
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:49,454
You can't even
throw a birthday party.

855
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:51,156
Shut up.

856
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,195
I will be right back.

857
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:58,763
Man, the food's all gone.

858
00:53:58,763 --> 00:54:03,202
Oh, Nick, I saved you a piece of pizza.
One second.

859
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:06,571
Why is Mandi here?

860
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:09,575
Well, I think she was hoping
to gloat over a party disaster,

861
00:54:09,575 --> 00:54:13,445
which, if I can count
on Nick, won't take long.

862
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,817
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

863
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:22,955
Mandi, can I see
your invitation?

864
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:28,361
Because I am pretty sure I left
"Vapid Bitch" off the list.

865
00:54:28,361 --> 00:54:31,447
You think you're so clever,
but you're not.

866
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:33,284
You're just using my brother
to get back at me,

867
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:34,584
and I am going to make sure
that he knows that.

868
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:39,539
Not everything is about you, Mandi.
Especially not my love life.

869
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:42,893
At least I have one.

870
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:44,978
Where's your boyfriend
on your birthday?

871
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:49,167
You want to see
a love life, little virgin?

872
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:50,934
I will show you.

873
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:14,258
Oh, my God,
did he just...?

874
00:55:14,258 --> 00:55:17,495
Oh. Oh God,
move. Move.

875
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:20,031
Yep. Sorry
about your patio.

876
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:22,201
Oh, totally worth it.

877
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,818
# Concerning nobody else,
just you #

878
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:26,688
And we didn't
just stop there.

879
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:29,491
Abby, Quinn and I set out
to disband the Plastics...

880
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:30,826
once and for all.

881
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:33,712
We called ourselves
the Anti-Plastics.

882
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:38,784
Not very original,
but it got the point across.

883
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:40,403
Wow.

884
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,438
Wow.

885
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,909
Wow.

886
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,381
- # So here's my confession #
- We gathered our forces.

887
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,683
But as the Anti-Plastics grew,

888
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,103
Mandi started recruiting
for her side.

889
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:00,672
# It's time, it's time #

890
00:56:00,672 --> 00:56:04,477
# I want my name
on the marquee #

891
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:08,064
# I want you to want me #

892
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,901
It was time to break
apart the founding members,

893
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,202
starting with Chastity.

894
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:16,322
So we simply
tipped Principal Duvall.

895
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:19,460
Oh. Oh, Principal Duvall.
A note.

896
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,095
Her weakness:
a raging libido.

897
00:56:22,095 --> 00:56:26,300
OK, where's the back stairwell that's a
herpes infection waiting to happen?

898
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,469
- C-wing.
- Thank you.

899
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,904
# Never let me go #

900
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:32,855
# So I can feed
your addiction in the stereo #

901
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:38,045
# I could be just
your type of high #

902
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:40,047
Elliot, let me borrow that.

903
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:42,601
# You're talking
about the narcissist #

904
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:45,069
The camera. Get to class.

905
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,805
For the love of all that's sanitary,
get out of there, people.

906
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:53,428
# Let the music
just take control #

907
00:56:53,428 --> 00:56:55,078
# So here's my confession #

908
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,114
You wait right here,
young lady.

909
00:56:57,114 --> 00:57:01,286
You officially earned detention for a week.
Unbelievable.

910
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:04,890
No, no, no. In solitary confinement.
Let's go, move it.

911
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,191
- Principal Duvall.
- What?

912
00:57:06,191 --> 00:57:09,127
- The announcements.
- Oh, yeah, let's go.

913
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,369
- And action.
- Good afternoon, everybody.

914
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:20,138
We have a winner for the
Homecoming Dance Charity.

915
00:57:20,138 --> 00:57:23,809
The winner
is the Humane Society.

916
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:27,363
So... Where did
you come from?

917
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:31,067
Get out of here. I am talking about
the importance of neutering here, people.

918
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:32,701
Cut it off.

919
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:37,023
- How could you do that?
- Do what?

920
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:41,911
Rat out all of my make-out spots.
You're the only one I told, Mandi.

921
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:45,381
Now, who's going to do my homework
and tell me I am special?

922
00:57:49,621 --> 00:57:51,153
- Sorry.
- Hey.

923
00:57:51,153 --> 00:57:53,389
For Hope,
who'd been a hypochondriac

924
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:55,826
since contracting mono
from a water fountain,

925
00:57:55,826 --> 00:57:59,229
we said goodbye to Mandi's
"no bodily fluids" rule.

926
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:02,999
Ew. Oh, my God, oh, my God.

927
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:07,137
- I am going to contract E. coli.
- Even worse, you have a zit.

928
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,442
I knew ugliness was contagious.

929
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:13,877
Hope booked an emergency
healing massage and seaweed facial.

930
00:58:15,263 --> 00:58:16,896
# Takes a flash
to figure it out #

931
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:19,534
# But in your memory
you might find some holes #

932
00:58:19,534 --> 00:58:23,304
# Oh, like the last six hours
That made you realize... #

933
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:26,874
Unfortunately, there
was a mix-up at the spa,

934
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:29,811
and Hope ended up resembling
the Wicked Witch of the West.

935
00:58:29,811 --> 00:58:33,815
It still hadn't faded
after an entire weekend.

936
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:39,788
Mandi. What is wrong with you?

937
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:42,958
You didn't pick me up.
I had to ride my Schwinn.

938
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,994
I don't pick up ogres.

939
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:48,029
And green, definitely
not your color.

940
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,597
Wha...?

941
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:53,586
Why hasn't it washed away?

942
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:56,121
I added some
long-lasting henna ink.

943
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:58,257
Don't you think
that's a bit much?

944
00:58:58,257 --> 00:59:01,493
Come on,
she deserved it.

945
00:59:01,493 --> 00:59:04,263
# Time to do
the walk of shame #

946
00:59:04,263 --> 00:59:06,448
# Hide your face... #

947
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,716
Peace out.

948
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:28,821
Nobody will ever see that.

949
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:31,241
With Chastity
and Hope down,

950
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:33,476
there was only
one Plastic left.

951
00:59:33,476 --> 00:59:37,213
Cupcakes. Cupcakes.

952
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:38,982
Red velvet,
or perhaps devil's food cake?

953
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:40,701
- Thank you.
- Traitor.

954
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:44,054
- You don't own me, Mandi.
- Oh, yeah?

955
00:59:44,054 --> 00:59:44,804
Oh.

956
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,143
I don't like you right now.

957
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:51,812
You totally lost my vote.

958
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:56,250
Yummy frosting, though.

959
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,169
Nice job, Quinn.

960
00:59:59,169 --> 01:00:01,706
You truly are an amazing
investigative reporter.

961
01:00:01,706 --> 01:00:05,444
I have been obsess... I mean,
watching them for years.

962
01:00:05,444 --> 01:00:08,078
Just needed to dig
a little deeper.

963
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:11,299
Hi.

964
01:00:12,302 --> 01:00:13,302
Hey.

965
01:00:14,337 --> 01:00:17,572
- Hey.
- Hey.

966
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,441
- Hi.
- Hey.

967
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:22,494
- Hello, girls.
- Hey.

968
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,796
- I already got my dress.
- Hey.

969
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:25,983
Oh, hey, Abby.

970
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,383
Okay, Jo, this year the music
better not suck at the dance.

971
01:00:28,383 --> 01:00:30,185
- You have sway with the DJ, right?
- Of course.

972
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:32,354
- What are your requests?
- Okay...

973
01:00:32,354 --> 01:00:35,257
- We could get that guy who...
- You know, if she keeps...

974
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,394
inviting everybody
to join our group,

975
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:40,295
there won't be any room left.

976
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:43,999
At least Mandi understood
the importance of exclusivity.

977
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:47,037
Someone has to be
the proletariat.

978
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:49,472
That's lower class.

979
01:00:56,396 --> 01:00:58,564
Hey, kid.
Lend me a hand, huh?

980
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:01,218
Jimmy gave me an extension
on delivering the engine.

981
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:02,869
Um, sorry, Dad.

982
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:05,404
I have got shopping with Quinn
and a movie with Tyler,

983
01:01:05,404 --> 01:01:08,475
and I still have
to make my campaign buttons.

984
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:10,677
Busy, busy.

985
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:16,533
Busy, busy.

986
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:19,653
- Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

987
01:01:19,653 --> 01:01:21,238
- Hey.
- Hi.

988
01:01:21,238 --> 01:01:22,923
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

989
01:01:23,274 --> 01:01:25,992
- What's up?
- Hi.

990
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:29,763
I wonder how much
sugar is in this.

991
01:01:29,763 --> 01:01:32,934
- You did not just ask that.
- What?

992
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:36,071
Jo, you ate, like,
two funnel cakes, a hot dog...

993
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:38,522
and a bag of kettle corn
on our first date.

994
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:42,610
And you didn't wear
these crazy studded boots.

995
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,269
Come on.
You're kidding me, right?

996
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:54,105
- Using me to make Chastity jealous?
- Look, I was just...

997
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:56,825
Starting to act a hell
of a lot like Mandi,

998
01:01:56,825 --> 01:01:59,277
which is not the kind of
girl I want to be dating.

999
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:02,480
Hey, I am nothing like Mandi.

1000
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,052
Oh, really? Running
for queen, humiliating people,

1001
01:02:07,052 --> 01:02:10,455
using their secrets against them, dressing
like you're on the cover of Rolling Stone,

1002
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:13,659
which, OK, it's kind of hot sometimes,
but not the part...

1003
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:17,145
where you suddenly care about
what everyone else thinks.

1004
01:02:18,682 --> 01:02:19,932
Jo...

1005
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:24,270
What happened to that girl
I met in shop class?

1006
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:46,526
And when I got home,
there it was,

1007
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:49,496
waiting for me:
my future.

1008
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:52,133
How had I almost forgotten?

1009
01:02:59,073 --> 01:03:01,309
The fat letter.

1010
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:04,862
- It's good news, right?
- The best.

1011
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:08,682
Ah, Jo. Look, honey,

1012
01:03:08,682 --> 01:03:12,403
I feel lousy
about your tuition fund.

1013
01:03:12,403 --> 01:03:14,672
But, honey, that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't be excited.

1014
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:17,826
I mean, CMU, that's...
that's big stuff.

1015
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:19,860
And if I can just get
this engine finished,

1016
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,114
or... what about that
architectural scholarship?

1017
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:24,667
The scholarship.

1018
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,535
But somehow,
all this campaigning...

1019
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:30,137
and preening and plotting
had gotten in the way.

1020
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:33,909
I didn't even know what my grade was
in shop class anymore.

1021
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,330
Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Um...

1022
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,784
Abby's dad dropped
this off for you.

1023
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,635
So does she know where
she's going to college yet?

1024
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:47,956
Um, Abby wants art school, but
her dad's more of a pre-med guy.

1025
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:52,194
Well, just make sure that she knows
that to, um, to win the race...

1026
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,613
You got to be in the race.

1027
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:08,778
But what if I wanted out?

1028
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,413
What if I wanted
to forfeit the race...

1029
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:14,118
because I didn't
deserve to win?

1030
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:16,969
Got something
that's real revolutionary.

1031
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:20,941
It's going to revolutionize
your gardening experience.

1032
01:04:21,709 --> 01:04:24,211
Hey, Mr. Hanover.

1033
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:25,845
Abby's not home
from the movie yet, is she?

1034
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:28,816
No,
thought you'd be with them.

1035
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:34,622
- But glad you're here.
- Listen, Mr. Hanover, I...

1036
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:39,126
- I brought back the money.
- Jo, what, are you crazy?

1037
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:42,279
The money's for you,
every damn penny. You have earned it.

1038
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:46,468
Hiring you to be her friend was
the best money we have ever spent.

1039
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:50,354
Please, Mr. Hanover,
I can't.

1040
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:53,758
Jo, I am sending it
right back to you.

1041
01:04:53,758 --> 01:04:56,011
I'd give a bonus,
if I gave them.

1042
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:57,629
Which I don't.

1043
01:05:10,759 --> 01:05:14,696
Is it true? Did my dad pay
you to be friends with me?

1044
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:18,134
Quinn finally
got her big story.

1045
01:05:18,134 --> 01:05:20,602
She quoted Mandi
as a witness.

1046
01:05:20,602 --> 01:05:22,287
Why would Quinn do this?

1047
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:25,391
How could you?

1048
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,828
- I was going to tell Abby everything.
- Face it, Jo.

1049
01:05:28,828 --> 01:05:30,712
The Plastics
are the originals,

1050
01:05:30,712 --> 01:05:33,265
and they don't have to pay
anyone to be their friend.

1051
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:35,935
No. You just sold out
your friends for free.

1052
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:37,937
Oh, what,
like you sold me out?

1053
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:40,339
God, I trusted you.

1054
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:43,376
You know what?
You go to hell, Jo Mitchell.

1055
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:45,044
I wish I never even met you.

1056
01:06:28,373 --> 01:06:30,324
Just
to see their faces.

1057
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:33,761
You were so good, Mandi.
I totally voted for you.

1058
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:36,381
- It's too bad this didn't come out earlier.
- Why?

1059
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:39,919
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

1060
01:06:39,919 --> 01:06:42,220
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

1061
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:47,726
- That is, if she's eligible.
- Eligibility is based on matriculation.

1062
01:06:47,726 --> 01:06:53,048
- So she'd have to be expelled or something.
- Oh.

1063
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,886
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

1064
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:16,204
This is going to be
the best senior prank ever.

1065
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,756
The best.

1066
01:07:19,927 --> 01:07:23,263
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

1067
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,165
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

1068
01:07:26,165 --> 01:07:29,136
and if there's no dance,
I am not the queen.

1069
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,655
I don't know.

1070
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:35,309
Money can't do this.

1071
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,855
As many of you know,
we had a robbery last night.

1072
01:07:48,855 --> 01:07:53,343
Now, the evidence strongly
suggests that the thief

1073
01:07:53,343 --> 01:07:57,665
was a student, because of his
wanton disregard for school property.

1074
01:07:57,665 --> 01:08:01,568
This student, or students,
clearly degenerates,

1075
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:05,840
stole the money that was
intended for helpless animals.

1076
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,625
Now, unless
the money is returned,

1077
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:12,529
I have no choice but
to cancel the Homecoming Dance.

1078
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:16,585
This is your principal,

1079
01:08:16,585 --> 01:08:18,003
signing off for today,

1080
01:08:18,003 --> 01:08:22,340
reminding you to stay left
or right, not center.

1081
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:32,484
Miss Mitchell, I received an anonymous
tip today that you stole the money.

1082
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:36,021
That's a lie.
I would never do that.

1083
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:37,605
Well, apparently you did.

1084
01:08:37,605 --> 01:08:40,843
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

1085
01:08:42,513 --> 01:08:44,913
And I am afraid we
found the stolen money.

1086
01:08:45,215 --> 01:08:47,951
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear.

1087
01:08:47,951 --> 01:08:50,303
Somebody must have
put it there, and...

1088
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,321
I would bet anything
it was Mandi.

1089
01:08:52,623 --> 01:08:55,759
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

1090
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,327
but unless you have proof,

1091
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:59,462
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

1092
01:08:59,462 --> 01:09:02,816
It officially
couldn't get much worse.

1093
01:09:02,816 --> 01:09:06,653
I am also sorry to say that I am going to
have to report this to Carnegie Mellon,

1094
01:09:06,653 --> 01:09:10,574
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

1095
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:14,327
Miss Mitchell, where are
you going? Come back here.

1096
01:09:14,327 --> 01:09:16,130
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

1097
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,898
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

1098
01:09:17,898 --> 01:09:21,418
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

1099
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:24,154
I tried to protect
you all from her.

1100
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:27,124
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

1101
01:09:27,124 --> 01:09:30,794
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch.

1102
01:09:30,794 --> 01:09:34,865
Wait. As much as we all might like that,
I can't let it happen.

1103
01:09:34,865 --> 01:09:38,169
This is crazy. Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

1104
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:40,288
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

1105
01:09:40,288 --> 01:09:42,056
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls.

1106
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:45,843
I am sick of the mind games
and the backstabbing and the set-ups.

1107
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:50,247
I know you framed me, Mandi.

1108
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:53,701
So we're going to settle this
like men, on the battlefield.

1109
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:56,004
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

1110
01:09:56,004 --> 01:09:57,488
I challenge you...

1111
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:04,679
...to a football game,

1112
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:07,683
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

1113
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:10,185
I... I don't do sports.

1114
01:10:10,185 --> 01:10:12,705
Aw, you scared?

1115
01:10:12,705 --> 01:10:16,008
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

1116
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:18,544
I thought you were
the best at everything.

1117
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:23,417
I thought people trembled in
the presence of the Plastics.

1118
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:25,201
You want to win?

1119
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:30,740
The only way you're going to
become queen is by default.

1120
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,047
Fine, you're on.

1121
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:40,416
But be prepared to lose.

1122
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:43,620
You know, you
and your team of one.

1123
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:55,850
I realized a little too late
that I no longer had any friends.

1124
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:01,137
But if I had to take on
all the Plastics by myself, I would.

1125
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,016
All right, let's get to class, everybody.
Hang out in the hallway.

1126
01:11:12,016 --> 01:11:15,419
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

1127
01:11:15,419 --> 01:11:17,455
Certainly not about Jo.

1128
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:33,822
Hey, Mr. Hanover, this was in our mailbox.
It's for you.

1129
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:37,359
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend, right?
- Ex-boyfriend.

1130
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,845
Huh, awkward.

1131
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:43,265
Thing is, I have got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

1132
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:47,102
Would you give it to her? A deal's a deal.
It's not her fault Abby found out.

1133
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:52,775
- She gave the money back to you?
- Of course.

1134
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,644
I was expecting it, really.

1135
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,912
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

1136
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,346
I just needed
to make that happen.

1137
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:00,617
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

1138
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:02,418
Those are my colors.
And I am wearing my hair up,

1139
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,255
because it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

1140
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:09,659
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

1141
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:16,567
Hey, Abby.

1142
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:21,303
- Look, just don't.
- But...

1143
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:23,891
You know, Jo may
have lied to me,

1144
01:12:23,891 --> 01:12:25,693
but at least she
taught me one thing.

1145
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:30,164
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

1146
01:12:30,164 --> 01:12:33,150
Fine, hate me.

1147
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,187
But you should know I don't
think Jo stole the money.

1148
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,657
I think Mandi did.

1149
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:43,260
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her...

1150
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,163
the idea to get Jo expelled.

1151
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:52,370
Also, Jo spent an awful lot
of time putting together...

1152
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:56,307
and sending out college
applications for you.

1153
01:12:56,307 --> 01:12:59,577
She even put together
your portfolio.

1154
01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:07,068
I helped her make about a dozen of those
with journalism equipment.

1155
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:12,124
I hope you get
into art school, Abby.

1156
01:13:12,124 --> 01:13:13,993
I really do.

1157
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:35,247
So Mr. Hanover just called.

1158
01:13:35,247 --> 01:13:38,935
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

1159
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,438
That's great, right?

1160
01:13:42,438 --> 01:13:46,677
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

1161
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:49,878
So, you, uh...
You heard from Abby?

1162
01:13:51,614 --> 01:13:53,917
I have texted, called.

1163
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:57,354
I tried her
NorthShoreCentric page.

1164
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:02,960
No luck. That girl
really hates my guts.

1165
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,097
But I can't blame her.
I am not sure why you don't hate me.

1166
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:12,536
Listen, kid, I am not proud
of what you did to Abby,

1167
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:15,505
but I know
that you care about her.

1168
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:20,260
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

1169
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:26,300
Oh, I don't
think it's just me.

1170
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:36,860
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

1171
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,563
Not even close.

1172
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:44,285
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

1173
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:47,622
- That's right, we have got your back.
- Mandi's going down.

1174
01:14:47,622 --> 01:14:49,742
I knew it.

1175
01:14:49,742 --> 01:14:52,393
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

1176
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:55,548
you guys came to rescue me.

1177
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:59,218
I don't deserve you.

1178
01:15:00,253 --> 01:15:02,087
Oh, my God, are you crying?

1179
01:15:02,087 --> 01:15:02,887
No, I never cry.

1180
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:11,013
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

1181
01:15:11,013 --> 01:15:13,983
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

1182
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:16,286
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

1183
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:42,061
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

1184
01:15:42,061 --> 01:15:45,766
Not easy, but not impossible.
I just have to detect their wireless signal,

1185
01:15:45,766 --> 01:15:48,536
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

1186
01:15:48,536 --> 01:15:50,771
Uh, wait, got it.

1187
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,557
They named their Wi-Fi
"AlwaysWatching?"

1188
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:55,759
What's their
pass code, "666?"

1189
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:59,397
It will take a few days, but if
Mandi planted the evidence,

1190
01:15:59,397 --> 01:16:01,133
I will find the footage.

1191
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:05,403
But... I want
something in return.

1192
01:16:05,403 --> 01:16:07,371
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

1193
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:09,741
What do you
want, Elliot?

1194
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:13,745
A date to the dance,
with Abby.

1195
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:21,353
Oh, um, hey, good luck at the game.
I will be rooting for you.

1196
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:23,788
Uh, even got my
own side biz going on.

1197
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,525
Odds are 30 to one
in Mandi's favor.

1198
01:16:26,525 --> 01:16:29,961
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

1199
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:34,667
Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

1200
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:38,837
a fifth-year senior
who felt no pain...

1201
01:16:40,373 --> 01:16:45,043
and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

1202
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:48,747
But we weren't backing down.

1203
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:51,083
And neither was Mandi.

1204
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,786
She wasn't going
to pull any punches.

1205
01:16:53,786 --> 01:16:57,140
It was time to end this
once and for all.

1206
01:17:04,398 --> 01:17:06,266
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

1207
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:08,268
Good.

1208
01:17:08,268 --> 01:17:11,404
Hi, baby.
Oh, you look so cute.

1209
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:12,774
Our little athlete.

1210
01:17:12,774 --> 01:17:15,574
Mom, Dad, come on.
You know you can't be in here. Just go.

1211
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:17,994
You're right, you're right.
We need to find a seat.

1212
01:17:17,994 --> 01:17:21,632
- The bleachers are already filling up.
- Yay. Yay.

1213
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:28,789
- I am going to vomit.
- It's going to be OK, I promise.

1214
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:31,792
- What's the worst that could happen?
- We lose?

1215
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:35,178
Is everybody decent in here?

1216
01:17:35,178 --> 01:17:38,165
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

1217
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,684
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

1218
01:17:39,684 --> 01:17:41,986
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

1219
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:45,189
Well, I have tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

1220
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:48,042
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

1221
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:52,680
and you have plastered the school
with posters made that kind of hard.

1222
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,733
Thought you guys would wimp out.

1223
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:57,886
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

1224
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:01,455
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

1225
01:18:01,455 --> 01:18:04,676
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

1226
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:07,029
you are not allowed
on school grounds.

1227
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:08,930
Thus, you cannot play the game.

1228
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:13,452
- Damn it. Mandi was counting on this.
- I know.

1229
01:18:13,653 --> 01:18:14,555
You know?

1230
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:17,355
Yep, which is why I looked
into this issue days ago.

1231
01:18:17,355 --> 01:18:18,925
You know, technically,

1232
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:21,826
the football field is public property
since it's on park land.

1233
01:18:21,826 --> 01:18:24,530
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

1234
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:28,734
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

1235
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:31,620
Oh. Well, great then.

1236
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:35,591
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

1237
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:37,031
Oh. See you.

1238
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:42,399
Well, I guess my
job here is done.

1239
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:44,651
Ha-ha. Let's go, team.

1240
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:47,453
Kill. Maim. Dismember.

1241
01:18:55,312 --> 01:18:57,214
Whoo. Yeah.

1242
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,503
Yeah. Whoo.

1243
01:19:02,503 --> 01:19:04,988
Go, Abby.

1244
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:08,392
The big day was upon us,

1245
01:19:08,392 --> 01:19:11,628
and we were going
to take the Plastics down.

1246
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,651
Come on, girls.

1247
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:19,403
We were ready
for anything.

1248
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,628
Didn't expect to see me here?

1249
01:19:27,628 --> 01:19:30,281
I am still going to
kick your team's ass.

1250
01:19:30,281 --> 01:19:31,683
OK, girls, listen up.

1251
01:19:31,918 --> 01:19:35,670
Football is a religion,
and you are now in church.

1252
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,957
Do not disgrace this field.
We will play by playground rules.

1253
01:19:38,957 --> 01:19:43,327
Fumbles that hit the ground
are live balls. Four downs and out.

1254
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:47,433
No punts, no extra points
and a touchdown is seven points.

1255
01:19:47,433 --> 01:19:52,237
Get it? Got it? Good.

1256
01:19:52,237 --> 01:19:54,840
We will flip a coin to see
who receives the ball.

1257
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,143
- Pink Team, you call it.
- Heads.

1258
01:19:58,696 --> 01:20:01,546
- Heads it is.
- We will receive.

1259
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:04,284
All right, shake hands.

1260
01:20:06,253 --> 01:20:08,388
OK, then.

1261
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:09,789
Ow.

1262
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,820
Run, moron, run.

1263
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,410
Take it, take it.

1264
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:53,952
- There's no nunchakus in football.
- Man.

1265
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,675
Ball, now.

1266
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:17,275
Touchdown.

1267
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:18,275
Yay.

1268
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:05,742
So listen. My dad always
says to win the race,

1269
01:22:05,742 --> 01:22:07,176
you have got to be in the race.

1270
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:09,713
So think of the worst thing
the Plastics have done to you,

1271
01:22:09,713 --> 01:22:11,915
and knock them down.

1272
01:22:11,915 --> 01:22:14,619
If they're going to play
full contact, so are we.

1273
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:17,254
Fumble-rooski on two.

1274
01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:19,923
- Break.
- Break.

1275
01:22:19,923 --> 01:22:21,542
Yeah.

1276
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:28,366
- Yay.
- Yeah, Jo.

1277
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,152
Good job, honey.

1278
01:22:32,621 --> 01:22:36,625
What... What's going on?
What... What are you doing?

1279
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:37,625
Yes.

1280
01:22:38,528 --> 01:22:40,678
Touchdown.

1281
01:22:43,215 --> 01:22:45,834
That's not fair.
She can't do that. Can she do that?

1282
01:22:48,721 --> 01:22:51,923
- You girls can really play. Who knew?
- Thank you.

1283
01:22:53,926 --> 01:22:56,428
Damn it, we're tied.

1284
01:22:56,428 --> 01:23:00,567
I swear, if you let that psycho Jo near
me, I will end your social lives.

1285
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:04,570
- Time for D and D.
- Ooh, dirty dancing?

1286
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:07,205
Yeah, Chastity, dirty dancing.

1287
01:23:07,205 --> 01:23:11,077
No. Down and dirty, OK?
Down and dirty.

1288
01:23:11,077 --> 01:23:12,911
Let's get them. Go.

1289
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:15,814
OK, they were big,
they were bad.

1290
01:23:17,084 --> 01:23:19,702
We were dead.

1291
01:23:22,672 --> 01:23:25,658
I can't see. I can't see.

1292
01:23:25,658 --> 01:23:28,962
- Nothing? How bad's your vision?
- I am legally blind.

1293
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,030
Number one.

1294
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:36,535
Just freshening up.

1295
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:39,723
Smells like lavender
and ocean breeze, doesn't it?

1296
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:43,461
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, girls.

1297
01:23:43,461 --> 01:23:45,812
Enough of this,
let's play football.

1298
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,298
All right.
My muscles are mush,

1299
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:50,601
my lungs are about to burst
and just look at us.

1300
01:23:50,601 --> 01:23:53,336
I agree, we're totally not going to lose.

1301
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:55,238
- Gesundheit.
- Cover your mouth.

1302
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:58,442
- Really? because they have the ball.
- We have to take a stand.

1303
01:23:58,442 --> 01:24:00,544
We can't let them score.

1304
01:24:00,544 --> 01:24:03,179
- Gesundheit.
- Dude, cover your mouth.

1305
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:06,250
- OK, I got it.
- Jo. I did it.

1306
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,453
- Look, he did it.
- He did what?

1307
01:24:08,453 --> 01:24:11,104
Yeah. Yeah.

1308
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:12,407
Is that yours?

1309
01:24:12,407 --> 01:24:16,278
Cool, Mandi is going down.

1310
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:29,091
I told you.

1311
01:24:29,091 --> 01:24:30,660
Let me see that,
let me see that.

1312
01:24:39,302 --> 01:24:41,470
- Ling... Come on.
- What?

1313
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:46,141
What are you waiting for?
This is football. Come on.

1314
01:24:48,044 --> 01:24:51,380
Making everyone else do
your dirty work, Mandi?

1315
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,866
You're still going to lose.

1316
01:24:55,218 --> 01:24:56,752
Give me the ball.

1317
01:24:56,752 --> 01:24:58,220
Now.

1318
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:01,841
Is that Nick Zimmer?

1319
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,396
One, two,
three... hut.

1320
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:14,154
No, no, no. No, no.
Come on, man, it was her idea.

1321
01:25:14,154 --> 01:25:18,408
Right there, Mandi. Number one.
You're not number one anymore.

1322
01:25:18,408 --> 01:25:22,996
But I love you, baby. It wasn't my idea.
Why are you handcuffing me?

1323
01:25:54,045 --> 01:25:56,798
- Get off me.
- I'd love to.

1324
01:25:57,967 --> 01:26:00,185
Let me go.
Get off me.

1325
01:26:00,886 --> 01:26:01,937
That's not me.

1326
01:26:01,937 --> 01:26:03,738
It sure looks like it's you,
Miss Weatherly.

1327
01:26:07,643 --> 01:26:10,596
Are you crazy?
Do you know who I am?

1328
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:14,249
I am Mandi Weatherly.
My mother will sue you.

1329
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:17,385
How dare you touch me.
She will sue all of you.

1330
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:20,472
Let me out of here.
I will have you fired.

1331
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:22,442
I am so sorry for the
misunderstanding, Jo.

1332
01:26:22,442 --> 01:26:25,494
Consider yourself
officially un-expelled.

1333
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:27,896
And I will make some calls and
sort things out college-wise.

1334
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:29,146
Yeah.

1335
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:34,470
[Jay Sean: 2012 It Ain't The End]

1336
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:37,773
# Going to live like

1337
01:26:37,773 --> 01:26:40,560

01:26:52,655 --> 01:26:55,776
I might as well go for the
whole high school experience.

1344
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,228
# because we got each other
Turn it up #

1345
01:26:58,228 --> 01:27:02,750
# Turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world #

1346
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:07,321
# Turn it up, turn it up
Mash it up #

1347
01:27:07,321 --> 01:27:11,158
# It ain't the end
of the world #

1348
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:13,944
All right, quiet down,
everybody. Quiet.

1349
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:17,398
Stop your dancing, stop your fun.
Stop it right now.

1350
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,034
Quiet down.

1351
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:23,253
Quieter. Good.

1352
01:27:23,253 --> 01:27:25,255
Well, you should all
be very happy to know...

1353
01:27:25,255 --> 01:27:30,729
that we raised $6,800 for
the Humane Society, huh?

1354
01:27:33,783 --> 01:27:36,234
All right, forget it.
Um, I know the announcement

1355
01:27:36,234 --> 01:27:39,404
you guys really care about,
so let's get to it.

1356
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:43,808
The Homecoming King is...

1357
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:49,932
- Elliot Gold?
- My God, it's you.

1358
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,435
- Elliot Gold.
- Go.

1359
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:53,685
Whoo.

1360
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:59,208
Wow. Elliot really
is going to rig...

1361
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:01,444
the presidential election
someday, isn't he?

1362
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:03,779
Yep. Just as soon as
the voting goes hi-tech.

1363
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:04,579
Congratulations.

1364
01:28:08,084 --> 01:28:09,785
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1365
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:13,189
And your Homecoming Queen...

1366
01:28:14,142 --> 01:28:16,226
Abby Hanover.

1367
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:18,110
Oh, my God.
I have never won anything.

1368
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:21,731
Go. You won, go.

1369
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:24,084
Yeah, Abby.

1370
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:28,038
You won.
That's so awesome.

1371
01:28:28,038 --> 01:28:31,174
- That crown is mine. It's mine.
- Get out of here.

1372
01:28:31,174 --> 01:28:34,177
No, don't reach for me.

1373
01:28:34,177 --> 01:28:37,481
Get out of here. You're not
allowed on school grounds.

1374
01:28:37,481 --> 01:28:40,901
- Get off me.
- Oh, I am sorry.

1375
01:28:42,337 --> 01:28:44,038
Uh,
a little to the right.

1376
01:28:44,038 --> 01:28:47,708
- Give me that.
- I am legally blind.

1377
01:28:48,344 --> 01:28:49,064
There.

1378
01:28:50,546 --> 01:28:53,347
Here's your Homecoming King
and Queen, let's give it up.

1379
01:28:53,347 --> 01:28:56,501
Make some room, let them
have their first dance.

1380
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:59,921
You guys have a good time.
No dirty dancing, I am watching.

1381
01:29:19,242 --> 01:29:23,328
I have a feeling Elliot wasn't
the one who rigged this vote.

1382
01:29:23,328 --> 01:29:26,431
Well, we both know
crowns aren't my thing.

1383
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:28,600
So you dropped
out of the race?

1384
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,736
Sometimes, it's not
about winning the race,

1385
01:29:30,736 --> 01:29:33,572
it's just about
being a part of it.

1386
01:29:33,572 --> 01:29:36,742
Besides...

1387
01:29:36,742 --> 01:29:39,845
I have enough already.

1388
01:29:39,845 --> 01:29:41,963
# We cry and we live
and we die #

1389
01:29:48,738 --> 01:29:51,941
# Mon cheri
Oh, I will always love you #

1390
01:29:51,941 --> 01:29:55,512
# Mon cheri
Just a fool for you #

1391
01:29:55,512 --> 01:29:59,349
OK, well, it's not like we all lived
happily ever after.

1392
01:29:59,349 --> 01:30:02,719
Mandi and Nick did get community service
instead of jail.

1393
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,055
And her mom donated a new
library to North Shore,

1394
01:30:06,055 --> 01:30:08,559
so Principal Duvall
let her graduate.

1395
01:30:08,559 --> 01:30:11,093
But she never
regained her status.

1396
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:15,800
Quinn took over Mandi's role
as lead Plastic.

1397
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:20,137
But we had a deal: She let the senior
class end their year in peace.

1398
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:24,642
She also wrote an award-winning article
on the "Social Dynamics of Mean Girls".

1399
01:30:24,642 --> 01:30:30,147
Chastity finally looked up her name,
and joined the Abstinence Club.

1400
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:35,435
And Hope finally braved her fear
of water fountains and public germs...

1401
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:36,804
# Crazy girl #

1402
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:39,707
# Crazy, crazy, crazy, girl #

1403
01:30:39,707 --> 01:30:41,545
only to catch...

1404
01:30:41,545 --> 01:30:43,245
a nasty case of swine flu.

1405
01:30:43,245 --> 01:30:46,948
From then on, she swore to overcome
her fears, and, instead,

1406
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:51,853
put her trust in antibiotics
and hot doctors.

1407
01:30:51,853 --> 01:30:54,322
Tyler decided to go
to Penn State,

1408
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:59,527
which, by total coincidence, was only
a few hours away from my school.

1409
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:01,296
As for me, I managed to earn...

1410
01:31:01,296 --> 01:31:04,633
my Carnegie Mellon tuition
with Sidney's help after all.

1411
01:31:04,633 --> 01:31:07,402
The man could truly
sell anything,

1412
01:31:07,402 --> 01:31:09,171
even my shop class project.

1413
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:12,275
A birdhouse and
security camera, all in one.

1414
01:31:12,275 --> 01:31:14,543
Only $19.99.

1415
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:17,345
Mr. Hanover even compromised
on Abby majoring in art,

1416
01:31:17,345 --> 01:31:21,250
so long as she went to a top college,
which worked out perfectly for me.

1417
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,385
- So how does it look?
- Nice crown.

1418
01:31:23,385 --> 01:31:25,388
Thanks. I thought it
went with the t-shirt.

1419
01:31:27,792 --> 01:31:30,659
So I guess my dad
was right after all.

1420
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:33,495
To win the race,
you have to be in the race.

1421
01:31:33,495 --> 01:31:38,335
Sometimes it just takes a little girl
drama to find out who your friends are.

1422
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:42,972
And, once you have that, you
can survive almost anything...

1423
01:31:42,972 --> 01:31:46,409
even high school.

1424
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:49,913
# I know, I know #

1425
01:31:49,913 --> 01:31:52,515
# Every day you're
getting closer #

1426
01:31:52,515 --> 01:31:54,284
# The time is ticking slow #

1427
01:31:54,284 --> 01:31:56,753
# And I know, I know #

1428
01:31:56,753 --> 01:31:59,089
# I know #

1429
01:31:59,089 --> 01:32:01,759
# There's no room
to be impatient #

1430
01:32:01,759 --> 01:32:05,896
# I don't mind waiting #

1431
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:10,668
# What's your name?
One day you're going to know mine #

1432
01:32:10,668 --> 01:32:16,174
# Going on this way... #

1433
01:32:16,174 --> 01:32:18,476
# My mama would say #

1434
01:32:18,476 --> 01:32:21,913
# You're going to find
the right one #

1435
01:32:21,913 --> 01:32:25,449
# At the right time #

1436
01:32:25,449 --> 01:32:27,952
# It ain't right for me
to know #

1437
01:32:27,952 --> 01:32:31,289
# Who you are
I should have met you first #

1438
01:32:31,289 --> 01:32:34,526
# But that's not
how it works #

1439
01:32:34,526 --> 01:32:37,095
# So I am giving all control #

1440
01:32:37,095 --> 01:32:40,299
# Hoping, praying
Wishing, waiting #

1441
01:32:40,299 --> 01:32:42,234
# For you #

1442
01:32:42,234 --> 01:32:44,703
# Yes, I know, I know #

1443
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:47,039
# I know #

1444
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:49,641
# Every day you're
getting closer #

1445
01:32:49,641 --> 01:32:51,443
# The time is ticking slow #

1446
01:32:51,443 --> 01:32:53,812
# And I know, I know #

1447
01:32:53,812 --> 01:32:55,949
# I know #

1448
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:58,784
# There's no room
to be impatient #

1449
01:32:58,784 --> 01:33:00,752
# I don't mind waiting #

1450
01:33:00,752 --> 01:33:03,122
# I know, I know #

1451
01:33:03,122 --> 01:33:05,191
# I know #

1452
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:07,961
# Every day you're
getting closer #

1453
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:09,695
# The time is ticking slow #

1454
01:33:09,695 --> 01:33:12,032
# And I know, I know #

1455
01:33:12,032 --> 01:33:14,267
# I know #

1456
01:33:14,267 --> 01:33:17,070
# There's no room
to be impatient #

1457
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:20,107
# I don't mind waiting #

1458
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:22,875
# Wait forever on the line #

1459
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:25,145
# I am looking for a sign #

1460
01:33:25,145 --> 01:33:27,982
# A little bit of winds
below these clouds #

1461
01:33:27,982 --> 01:33:31,118
# There is a light #

1462
01:33:31,118 --> 01:33:36,958
# To let me know
that it was all worthwhile #

1463
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,460
# because I know, I know #

1464
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,829
# I know #

1465
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:44,382
# Every day you're
getting closer #

1466
01:33:44,382 --> 01:33:46,233
# The time is ticking slow #

1467
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:48,569
# And I know, I know #

1468
01:33:48,569 --> 01:33:50,871
# I know #

1469
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:53,641
# There's no room
to be impatient #

1470
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:55,443
# I don't mind waiting #

1471
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:57,878
# I know, I know #

1472
01:33:57,878 --> 01:34:00,115
# I know #

1473
01:34:00,115 --> 01:34:02,884
# Every day you're

1474
01:34:02,884 --> 01:34:04,586

01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:06,887
# And I know, I know #

1476
01:34:06,887 --> 01:34:09,157
# I know #

1477
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:11,926
# There's no room
to be impatient #

1478
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:15,563
# I don't mind waiting #
