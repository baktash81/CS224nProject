1
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,515
That's a first down.
Husky ball at the 35-yard line.

2
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,817
Hut!

3
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,121
Touchdown! Paul Taylor.
17-yard pass from Terry Stokes.

4
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,511
Paul, look at her, man. Look at her!
I think she wants your body.

5
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,847
You got to ask her out, Paul.

6
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,598
Isn't she dating Pulver?

7
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,935
Yeah, but that's going nowhere.
Take a shot, for Christ's sake.

8
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,187
Hey, I'm going to ask her out.

9
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
Bullshit!

10
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,149
When, when, when?

11
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,484
-When the time is right.
-Yeah, right.

12
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,028
Timing's everything.

13
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,452
Hit him! Hit him!

14
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
Yeah! All right!

15
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,999
Wildcat fumble.

16
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,460
Husky ball. First and ten.

17
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,611
7-yard pass complete to Paul Taylor.

18
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,955
Meg, you have any plans this evening?

19
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,936
Go!

20
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,688
Go!

21
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,107
Go!

22
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,458
Looks like the game
put you out of business.

23
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,169
Don't worry.
When they're through screaming...

24
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,129
...they'll be in here like a flood.

25
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,631
More iced tea?

26
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,965
Please.

27
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,053
It's good that this town's got up
on its hindlegs about something.

28
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,473
It takes people's minds off their troubles.

29
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,142
It's been a lean year for most folk.

30
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,147
The ski season is about to start.
There will be tourists.

31
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,822
You know, there's a new band
out at the Tin Palace tonight.

32
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,824
Is that right?

33
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,534
Supposed to be pretty good.

34
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,119
That's nice.

35
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,372
You like country music?

36
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,670
Herb, are you asking me out?

37
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,299
Yeah, well, I guess I am.

38
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,178
I don't know.

39
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,681
I'm kind of stuck here.

40
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,809
You know, I've got to earn a living.

41
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,730
Yeah, it must be tough trying to get away.

42
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,941
Shoot!

43
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,194
George, here they come.

44
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,285
Is that my check?

45
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,167
If you do get any free time to yourself...

46
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,836
...that's my number there
down at the station.

47
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,423
Okay.

48
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,843
Okay. One at a time.

49
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,467
Flagg. Congratulations.

50
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,844
For what?

51
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,347
I hear you have a birthday coming up.

52
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,391
No more juvie hall, right?

53
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,892
Yeah, right.

54
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,104
You mess up now and you're in the majors.

55
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,316
I'll see you around, Flagg.

56
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,088
Moss, what's happening?

57
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,382
You look like hell.

58
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,176
It's a fashion statement, man.

59
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,222
The only statement those clothes
have got to make is, "I look like hell."

60
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,393
My bike's broken down at Elkin's Grove.
I was thinking...

61
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,354
...maybe I could borrow your ratchet set?

62
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,443
The Summit's got me overhauling
six damn Skidoos, three Cats...

63
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,070
...and two flatbed snowmakers, by Monday.

64
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,366
What's the hurry?
It must be 70 degrees out there.

65
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,785
It's Indian summer, boy.

66
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,124
Very soon winter will be tear-arseing
through this town...

67
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,459
...with no apologies.

68
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,295
Come on. It barely pissed snow
the last couple of years.

69
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,756
This whole town's ready to fold.

70
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,091
This year's going to be different.

71
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,217
Is that right?

72
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,969
Take my word.

73
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,805
You'll wish your piece of shit excuse
for a motorcycle...

74
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,974
...was one of these sweet little rigs.

75
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,188
So how about the ratchet?

76
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,818
All right. Maybe I'll put in
a couple of hours over the weekend.

77
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,321
Maybe that'll lighten things up a bit.

78
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,368
There are twelve sockets in that set.

79
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,952
Twelve.

80
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,663
They better all be there when I get it back.

81
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,208
You got it, buddy. You got it.

82
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,586
Thanks a lot, Moss.

83
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,630
I owe you one.

84
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,757
You owe me too damn many.

85
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,471
Holy cow!

86
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,949
Lend me $5 just until tomorrow, okay?

87
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:03,950
What for?

88
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,995
You know, you're not the only one
with a date tonight.

89
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,790
I'm going to score with Vicki tonight.
I want to invest in some protection.

90
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,459
Let's go. It's closing time.

91
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,210
All right, here.

92
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,254
Make it quick.

93
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,635
Look, pal. Give me a pack of Trojans,
and a Binaca spray.

94
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,064
Scott Jeskey.

95
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,148
Reverend.

96
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,900
Good game today.

97
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,570
Thanks. Thanks, Reverend.

98
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,658
How are you?

99
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:49,662
The hay fever's acting up a little bit,
but I'll live.

100
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,833
Haven't seen you
at the Sunday services lately.

101
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,961
You want the ribbed, or the regular?

102
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,008
Ribbed, I guess.

103
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,428
They're not for me, you know.

104
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,555
They're for my friend.

105
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:13,645
There's this sort of naive girl
that he's planning on...

106
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,855
Well, you know.

107
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,651
I insisted that he take precautions.

108
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,445
Why doesn't he pay for them?

109
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,908
I had to drag him down here as it is.
The guy is totally irresponsible.

110
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
Come on, Scott. What's the hold up?

111
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,829
I can't keep this girl waiting.

112
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,833
The boy doesn't need condoms.
He needs a muzzle.

113
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,774
Kevin! Don't eat with your face.

114
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,735
Mum, we're in a hurry.
We're going bowling with Anthony.

115
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,737
And then to the movies.

116
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,656
What movie?

117
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,534
Garden Tool Massacre.
It's your basic slice-and-dice.

118
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,785
Your basic what?

119
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,414
This guy in a hockey mask,
he chops up a few teenagers.

120
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,709
But don't worry,
there's no sex or anything bad.

121
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,044
They won't let you kids
into a movie like that.

122
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,839
No problem. My brother's an usher.

123
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,009
No. Absolutely not.

124
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,927
Mum, come on!

125
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,973
Kevin! I will not have you seeing
that kind of trash, and that's final.

126
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,391
Do you understand?

127
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,143
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,812
Mum, have you seen my pink sweater?

129
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,981
It's on the hamper, honey.

130
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,483
I meant to talk to you about that.

131
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,902
-Why did you do that?
-What did I do?

132
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,447
We had a little accident.

133
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,951
What happened?

134
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,995
It got mixed up in the wash.

135
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,872
Interesting look.

136
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,915
Why don't you wear
my cashmere sweater?

137
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,335
-Are you serious?
-Sure.

138
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,795
Oh, my God! That's him.

139
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,718
What do you want?

140
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,137
Hi. I'm here to see Meg.

141
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,264
What for?

142
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,933
Just to see her.

143
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,478
-ls she home?
-Just a minute.

144
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm terribly sorry.

145
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,280
You must be Paul. I'm Meg's mother.

146
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,573
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

147
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,534
Come on in. Meg will be right down.

148
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,414
Where are you going?

149
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,833
-I'm sleeping over at Eddie's, remember?
-Right.

150
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,836
But you're not going anywhere
without your jacket.

151
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,630
Mum, it's boiling out.

152
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,300
It's October. It's night-time.
You're wearing your jacket.

153
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,346
-Stupid coat.
-No, here, let me.

154
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,265
Bye, honey. Enjoy yourself.

155
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,225
Bye, Mum.

156
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,518
Bye, Eddie.

157
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,936
Oh, yeah.

158
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,898
Won't you sit down?

159
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,442
Excuse me.

160
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,613
Hi, Paul.

161
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,950
Are you surviving my family so far?

162
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,536
-Yeah. You look great.
-Thank you.

163
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,662
You want to go?

164
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,623
I just want you to meet my dad.
It'll just take a second.

165
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:44,874
Sure.

166
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,716
Daddy, I'd like you to meet my friend, Paul.

167
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,181
Ribbed.

168
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,797
Hey!

169
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:24,391
I'm really sorry about my dad.
I've never seen him like that before.

170
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,975
That's okay.

171
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,853
It was just a misunderstanding.

172
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:34,359
I've made better first impressions.
That's for sure.

173
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,736
No harm done, I guess.

174
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,904
No, wrong.

175
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,615
Scott Jeskey is going to die.

176
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,789
Paul, watch out!

177
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,463
Flagg! Jesus Christ.
What did you do to him?

178
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,924
I'm not the one
who bounced him off my car, pal!

179
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:01,177
-You ran him into the road!
-Stop it! Let's get him to a doctor.

180
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,347
Watch out. He's got some kind of
corrosive shit on his hands.

181
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:10,520
Come on. Take it easy, mister.
We'll get you some help. All right?

182
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,947
The sky. It fell from the sky.

183
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,240
What's he saying?

184
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,617
He's in shock. Let's just go.

185
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,329
Get in the car.

186
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,541
What for?

187
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,711
There'll be a lot of explaining to do,
and you're part of it.

188
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,715
Are you going to get in the car,
or am I going to make you get in?

189
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:43,636
What's the matter? You worried
about a little insurance claim...

190
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,597
...on Daddy's car?

191
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,141
Maybe I will come along...

192
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,852
...just to make sure
you don't blame it all on me.

193
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,229
Are you two finished?

194
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,661
Whenever you're ready.

195
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,925
-Excuse me, nurse.
-One moment, please.

196
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,771
How may I help you?

197
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,732
We've had a car accident.
This guy needs a doctor.

198
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:41,194
He has something on his hand, too.
Some kind of acid or something.

199
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,614
Does he have Blue Cross?

200
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,450
-I don't know.
-Medical insurance of any kind?

201
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,077
I don't believe this shit.

202
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,621
We don't even know who the guy is.

203
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,291
The doctor's with another patient
right now.

204
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,464
Could you put this gentleman
in Room 3, please?

205
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,301
You'll have to fill these out.

206
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,428
Okay.

207
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,686
Take it easy, old dude.

208
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,605
These guys are going to fix you right up.

209
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,659
Where are you going?

210
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,954
These people don't give a shit
about explanations.

211
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,332
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

212
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,484
I bet you've had better first dates.

213
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,778
I don't mind.

214
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,365
You want a soda?

215
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,951
That would be great. Something diet.

216
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,107
Absolutely. At this point
the prognosis is very positive.

217
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:48,071
In cases like this, the question is always
the quality of physical therapy.

218
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,992
The follow-up to any operation is
to a great extent...

219
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,509
Doctor, come in here quickly!

220
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,221
-I'm with a patient...
-There's a man dying in here! Hurry!

221
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,683
Excuse me a moment.

222
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,567
Is this the hand injury?

223
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,789
What is this?

224
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,083
That thing on his hand.

225
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,547
Nurse!

226
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,894
-Sheriff's Department.
-Get me the Sheriff! It's an emergency.

227
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:04,939
Paul?

228
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,657
Geller speaking.

229
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,409
Sheriff, this is Paul Taylor.

230
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,827
Paul, what's wrong?

231
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:21,498
I'm at the Arborville Hospital.
An old man's just been killed down here.

232
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,583
-You said "killed"?
-Yes, sir.

233
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,670
You sit tight. I'll be right down.
Who else is involved?

234
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,129
I'm with Meg Penny.

235
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,674
-And Brian Flagg was here earlier.
-Flagg?

236
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,425
Where is he now?

237
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,686
Paul?

238
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,194
Paul!

239
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,892
I did see it, Dad. It killed Paul.

240
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,936
Sheriff.

241
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,480
How about it, Herb?
Can we take her home?

242
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,482
You may as well, Tom.

243
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,901
Make sure she gets a good sleep.

244
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,116
We're not going to get anything
out of her tonight. She's hysterical.

245
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,619
I have to call Paul Taylor's folks.
They haven't heard from him.

246
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,874
Let's face it, Bill. They're not going to.

247
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:52,297
You get that to Sacramento tonight.
And I want the autopsy pronto...

248
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,132
...not next week.

249
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,768
Jesus wept!

250
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,145
Herb, you okay?

251
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,106
Taylor was a good kid.

252
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,862
I want the son of a bitch who did this.

253
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,122
I think we've already got him.

254
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,688
Scott! Cut it out. I told you.

255
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,400
Come on, Vicki. You're wearing my ring.

256
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,153
That makes you my girl.
Doesn't that count for something?

257
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:05,662
What are all those lights down there?
Isn't that the hospital?

258
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,623
It's probably a promotional gimmick.

259
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,126
They're giving away free tonsillectomies.

260
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,964
I think that you're about ready
for another one of my famous...

261
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,258
-...cherry coolers.
-I think I've had enough.

262
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,593
Nonsense. You've never had enough.

263
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,693
My very own blend
of special imported liquors.

264
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:30,997
Okay.

265
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,503
It's like a steam bath in here.
Here's your drink, Vicki.

266
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,146
Hot as a dog out there tonight.

267
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,615
That's a...

268
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,120
That's a nice blouse.

269
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,792
Nice material.

270
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,837
It must be hot, though.

271
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,342
I'll just undo one of these for you.

272
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:26,886
That's better, huh?

273
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,347
Oh, no?

274
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,224
Oh, well.

275
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,600
I'll just...

276
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,311
...undo another one then.

277
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay.

278
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,339
Oh God, Vicki!

279
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,215
No!

280
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,284
I shouldn't have let her
go out with the son of a bitch...

281
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:32,744
...in the first place.

282
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,164
Lower your voice.
That poor boy's probably dead.

283
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,126
I want to know
what happened out there tonight.

284
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,671
Whatever it was
that Flagg kid was behind it.

285
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,340
It's about time they nailed
that little psychopath.

286
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,968
His arse is going to fry this time.
Believe me.

287
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,572
Here, take this.

288
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,824
I don't want it.

289
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,326
Come on, honey.
You have to get some sleep.

290
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,169
That's my good girl.

291
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,758
Now, just let it alone.

292
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,638
I'm sure the police will have
this whole thing settled by the morning.

293
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:37,851
Come on.

294
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,742
Mum?

295
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,708
You don't believe me either, do you?

296
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,628
You're home now.

297
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,422
You're safe.

298
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,092
That's all that matters.

299
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:18,493
Look at him. He's too stupid
to know how much trouble he's in.

300
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,538
Why don't you wise up?

301
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,291
I told you everything.
I'm getting tired of hearing myself talk.

302
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,961
We're not boring you, are we?
A bright kid like you?

303
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,796
Am I under arrest?

304
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,840
Because if I am, I want a lawyer.

305
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,425
Now he wants a lawyer.

306
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:37,137
That's right. If you're not booking me,
I'd like to leave.

307
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,514
Either way, I want you out of my face.

308
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,057
Oh yeah, hard-arse?

309
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,185
I'm in your face to stay.
What are you going to do about it?

310
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:48,106
Go ahead, hit me!

311
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,026
Go ahead.

312
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,455
Any luck with his mama?

313
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,206
I can't seem to find her.

314
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,875
That's not unusual, is it?

315
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,461
She takes vacations
with Johnnie Walker Red...

316
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:11,963
...and anyone else
who happens to be around.

317
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,966
We could call his dad,
if anyone knew who he was.

318
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,344
Call a shrink. I'm a broken man.

319
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,679
You think this is a joke?

320
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,441
Turn him loose.

321
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,153
We got eyewitnesses
placing him at the crime scene.

322
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:39,699
We got no motive. No evidence.
He hasn't got a drop of blood on him.

323
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:44,329
-Flagg's a punk. But he's no killer.
-I think it's a mistake.

324
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:49,167
Your objection is duly noted.
Now turn him loose. We got work to do.

325
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,545
Go on.

326
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,720
Take a hike.

327
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,401
Brian! I need to talk to you.

328
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,119
What the hell are you doing here?

329
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,955
Look, I came down to bail you out.

330
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,043
What do you think they are,
Neiman-Marcus?

331
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,420
They don't take plastic.

332
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,715
Look, I appreciate the thought.
Now, go home, okay?

333
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,759
I need to talk to you.

334
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:43,722
I'm sorry about your boyfriend. I really am.

335
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:48,935
I'm tired and hungry, and I'm not
in the mood for conversation, okay?

336
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,656
George. Frannie. Que pasa?

337
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,992
Hey, hotshot, we're closed.

338
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:08,121
Come on. I've been dumped on all day.
Give me a break.

339
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:11,541
What's the matter, dear,
tough day at the office?

340
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,045
Well, grill's shut down.
How about a sandwich?

341
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,588
Beautiful.

342
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:32,228
You don't give up, do you?

343
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,231
I need your help.

344
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,360
For three years in school
you haven't said shit to me.

345
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:42,655
All of a sudden you need my help
and we're best friends, right?

346
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:46,701
Nobody believes me
about what happened tonight.

347
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,162
What did happen?

348
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:51,164
You were there. You saw.

349
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:55,168
All I saw was an old man
with a funky hand. That's all I saw.

350
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,005
Thanks.

351
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:00,924
Can I get you something, hon?

352
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,425
No, thank you.

353
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,145
The thing on that man's hand killed him
and then it killed Paul.

354
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:17,941
And whatever it is, it's getting bigger.

355
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,819
Is that what you told the cops?

356
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:31,663
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

357
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,667
I know you're the homecoming queen type
and all, but...

358
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,045
...are you strung out on something,
or what?

359
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,425
You're just the same.

360
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,137
What are you talking about?

361
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:50,974
You act like you're different.
You put on this big show.

362
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:55,478
But you're just like everyone else
in this town. You're full of shit, Flagg!

363
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,106
Wait a second!

364
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:04,237
Calm down, all right? I'm sorry, okay?

365
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,158
Come on, sit down.

366
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,876
You okay?

367
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,381
You want something to eat?

368
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:26,634
Here. Go ahead, it'll make you feel better.

369
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,596
Unbelievable.

370
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:35,018
It's just that I've never heard
you say "shit" before.

371
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,770
What was that like for you?

372
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,993
We're coming up empty here.
Should we head to the foothills?

373
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,829
Negative.
I'd rather have you patrolling the streets.

374
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:58,041
We'll start that at first light,
when the state police come in.

375
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,250
Ten-four.

376
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,919
You look exhausted.

377
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,463
It's been a long night. Thank you.

378
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,674
It's going to be even longer.

379
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,968
That's the truth.

380
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:13,598
One deputy and six volunteers.
I feel like the one-legged man...

381
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,809
...in an arse-kicking contest.

382
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:20,939
You're doing all you can, Herb.
This isn't your normal, Friday night drunk.

383
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:22,732
Something wrong?

384
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:26,236
I'm just worried about a friend of mine.

385
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:31,199
I guess I'm worried
about everybody tonight.

386
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,913
Dessert.

387
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:40,375
Fran. That sandwich busted me.

388
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:45,046
On the house. Last two pieces.
Eat up, or I chuck it in the garbage.

389
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,090
Thanks.

390
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,822
Shit.

391
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,835
Here. I'll get that.

392
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll get it.

393
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,548
-Here. Knock yourself out.
-Well, thanks.

394
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,094
What is this?

395
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,659
Don't touch him!

396
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,719
Fran, come on!

397
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,059
In the freezer!

398
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:02,786
Hear anything?

399
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:08,166
I'm okay.

400
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,968
I'm going to get us out of here. I promise.

401
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:32,982
Come on, answer!

402
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,115
Your call can not be completed as dialled.

403
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:43,034
Please check the number, and dial again.

404
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:04,806
-Sheriff's Station.
-Help me!

405
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:06,891
Get me Herb. Get Herb Geller.

406
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,144
He went down to the diner.

407
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:30,874
You ready?

408
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:47,682
Okay.

409
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,588
Great. I killed the strawberry jam.

410
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,009
Let's get out of here.

411
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,178
The front door is locked.

412
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,016
That's okay. I got a key.

413
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:10,640
Merciful God.

414
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,375
Hello?

415
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,462
Is anybody...

416
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:42,589
...hurt?

417
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,616
We need to see the Sheriff!

418
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,368
I don't know where he is.

419
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:55,662
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.

420
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,247
What about Briggs?

421
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,083
I can't raise anybody.
All I'm getting is static.

422
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:03,003
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.

423
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:06,589
The last I heard from the Deputy,
he was on his way up to Elkin's Grove.

424
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:08,842
Elkin's Grove.

425
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,512
That's where I found the old man.
Come on, let's go.

426
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,956
It looks like he left in a hurry.

427
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,551
He's got to be around here somewhere.

428
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:53,511
In the woods.

429
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,431
In the dark woods.

430
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:59,351
Right. We could wait here.

431
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,944
I never thought I'd go out of my way
to find a cop.

432
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:21,873
Hello!

433
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:28,338
I feel like fucking Hansel and Gretel here.
We should have brought bread crumbs.

434
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:32,467
Wait.

435
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,678
I think I hear something.

436
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,395
What the hell is that?

437
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:10,839
Put those weapons down.

438
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:17,095
We're here to help you.

439
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:19,723
-Name?
-Meg Penny.

440
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:22,350
-Are you a resident of Arborville, Meg?
-Yes, I am.

441
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:25,186
Have you experienced any vomiting,
nausea or diarrhoea?

442
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,604
Back off!

443
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:30,150
Hey, pal. You want to fill us in?
Who the hell are you people?

444
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:34,946
I'm Dr. Meddows. We're a government
sanctioned, biological containment team.

445
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:36,990
"Biological containment?"

446
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:38,950
We're microbe hunters, young lady.

447
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:40,326
Flagg?

448
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:44,205
What are you doing here, boy?

449
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:48,835
The men from Glad here are showing us
how to keep our leftovers fresh.

450
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,547
They're here on business.
They don't have time for bullshit. Okay?

451
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,216
Colonel, has the Deputy been briefed
in detail?

452
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,092
Yes, sir.

453
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,011
I'm heading to town now to get started.

454
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,764
Splendid.
Colonel Hargis will arrange an escort.

455
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:03,725
What is going on over there?

456
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:09,564
That's the source of our worries.
A troublesome souvenir from space.

457
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,358
-What?
-A meteorite.

458
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,568
Don't get too close.

459
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,737
There's danger of contamination.

460
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,697
I don't understand.

461
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:20,033
Let me tell you a story.

462
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:24,245
The dinosaurs ruled our planet
for millions of years...

463
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:27,999
...and yet they died out almost overnight.

464
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,417
Why?

465
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:31,753
The evidence suggests...

466
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:35,340
...that a meteor fell to earth bearing
an alien bacteria.

467
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,927
Plague? Is that what this is all about?

468
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,387
Prevention.

469
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,474
And you think this meteor brought
some kind of a killer germ?

470
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:49,229
It's something I've expected
and prepared for, all my life.

471
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:54,025
Your meteor brought something all right.
But if it's a germ...

472
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:57,320
...it's the biggest son of a bitch
you've ever seen.

473
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,083
What's the matter?

474
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,919
Isn't it awfully late
to be trimming the hedges?

475
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,422
Maybe this guy's a peeping Tom
or something.

476
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:18,466
So, let's give him something to peep at.

477
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:30,145
Wait a minute.
Hockey season ended months ago.

478
00:54:33,356 --> 00:54:37,277
He's going to get the camp counsellor
with the hedge trimmer.

479
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,534
But the girl gets away.

480
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:51,207
She's going to run into the lodge and hide,
but he's going to get her anyway.

481
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,376
Please be quiet.

482
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:55,086
You shut up!

483
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,130
Hey!

484
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,382
You've got to shut up. If you get caught...

485
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,135
...your mum'll kill me.
Get your feet off the seat!

486
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:03,928
Anthony, come on.

487
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:07,057
Jerk.

488
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:09,059
What a wimp!

489
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,562
Check out the body on the blonde.

490
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:49,933
Wonderful.

491
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:56,064
Yeah?

492
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:59,275
It's Hobbs. It's boiling up here.
Is the air conditioning on?

493
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,944
It's on full blast.

494
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:03,029
It must be blocked up or something.

495
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,031
There's nothing wrong with it.

496
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,701
Come up and see for yourself.

497
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,532
Hobbs, are you in here?

498
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:08,720
I can't begin to thank you both.

499
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:11,765
This information is incredibly valuable.

500
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:13,641
Please, get in.

501
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,061
-Where are we going?
-Back to town.

502
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,689
Arborville is under quarantine
until we've isolated that organism...

503
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,692
...and checked every living soul
for signs of infection.

504
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:26,404
-ln the meantime, we're your prisoners.
-Not at all. You're my patients.

505
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,782
Sounds like the same thing to me.

506
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,952
Young man, please, step into the van.

507
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:39,584
Thanks for the offer, Doc. But my bike's
back there and we can make it back...

508
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,086
...on our own.

509
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:44,339
By the way, I love your tailor.
I got to get me one of those.

510
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:49,260
Get in the van.

511
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:56,184
Van ride sounds nice.

512
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:04,234
Clear.

513
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:20,250
-lt's locked.
-So what?

514
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:24,587
Brian, what is with you?
You're acting like a complete jerk.

515
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:27,716
I have a problem with authority figures.

516
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,092
What are you doing?

517
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:32,595
We ought to get out of here.
Take my bike and blow this town.

518
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:35,265
It's getting thick around here,
don't you think?

519
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,643
That's crazy.
These people are here to help us.

520
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:42,564
Come on, Meg.
We don't even know who they are.

521
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,691
NASA? CIA?

522
00:58:44,816 --> 00:58:46,985
The Royal Canadian Mounties?

523
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:50,030
All I know is I saw a bunch
of unmarked trucks.

524
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:52,073
I think this whole thing stinks.

525
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:54,451
Well, we can't just run out.

526
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,664
Let's just think of it
as looking out for our best interests.

527
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:04,836
You coming?

528
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,716
Brian, I have to go back.
My family's there, people that I care about.

529
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,969
I'm going.
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

530
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:19,976
Then go. Take care of yourself.
That's the only thing you're really good at.

531
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,938
No one else ever volunteered for the job.

532
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:36,701
Christ, Flagg. A cheerleader.

533
01:00:00,725 --> 01:00:01,976
Come on, ma'am.

534
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:07,148
There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat, there is no cause for alarm.

535
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:12,112
This is a precautionary quarantine,
due to a potential biological hazard.

536
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:16,074
Please proceed toward Town Hall
in an orderly fashion.

537
01:00:16,866 --> 01:00:18,326
Mum! Dad!

538
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:23,748
Meg! Thank God you're all right!

539
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,917
Honey, is Kevin with you?

540
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,294
No. Isn't he staying at Eddie's house?

541
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,422
Eddie says they were staying
at your house.

542
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:33,633
Oh, God! He must've snuck off
to that damn movie.

543
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,302
What movie?
You didn't tell me about any movie.

544
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,931
Sir, my little brother is
at the movie theatre on Main Street.

545
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:42,142
We're going by sector.
We'll be there soon.

546
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:44,477
-You don't...
-We'll handle it. Back in line.

547
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:46,771
Seems you're doing nothing.
You on a break?

548
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,190
-Look, Mr....
-Don't "Look, Mr." me. I pay taxes.

549
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,401
I pay your salary.
I want you to find my son!

550
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,278
I know you're upset, but get in line...

551
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:54,946
...we have everything under control.

552
01:00:55,488 --> 01:01:00,452
Did you know that ten years ago tonight,
there was a horrible murder in this house?

553
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:03,538
-No way! Come on.
-This man...

554
01:01:03,788 --> 01:01:05,206
You'll love this.

555
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,417
He hot-curls her to death.

556
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:11,087
Mister, we're trying to watch a...

557
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:35,880
My zipper!

558
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,554
Come on! Hurry!

559
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:44,973
Your feet!

560
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:50,603
No!

561
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:56,026
Hurry!

562
01:03:07,537 --> 01:03:08,621
Here!

563
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:10,248
Open it up!

564
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:15,211
Eddie!

565
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,512
Hurry! Go!

566
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:27,682
Go!

567
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:43,948
Come on, Meg!

568
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,618
Meg, come on!

569
01:04:01,424 --> 01:04:03,718
-Alpha Team, do you copy?
-Affirmative.

570
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:05,053
Status report?

571
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:06,721
Highway 31 closed.

572
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:08,598
Phone lines down.

573
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:11,226
We've got this town locked up tight.

574
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,028
On up.

575
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:51,016
We suspected that conditions in space
would have a mutating effect on bacteria...

576
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:52,434
...but this!

577
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:54,978
Its activity threw the satellite out of orbit.

578
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:58,857
Correct. Our little experimental virus
seems to have grown up...

579
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,611
...into a plasmic life form
that hunts its prey.

580
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:06,531
A predator. It's fantastic.

581
01:05:06,656 --> 01:05:09,909
Sir, the organism is growing
at a geometric rate.

582
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:14,205
By all accounts, it's at least
a thousand times its original mass.

583
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:17,208
This will put U.S. Defence years ahead
of the Russians.

584
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,543
You don't understand.

585
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:21,838
At this rate, by next week,
there may be no U.S.

586
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:22,839
Nonsense!

587
01:05:23,214 --> 01:05:27,052
All we have to do is contain it.
As far as the locals are concerned...

588
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:29,220
...this is simply a medical quarantine.

589
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,306
Nobody gets in, or out.

590
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:42,484
Dr. Meddows, just for the record...

591
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:46,321
...I don't agree with any of this.
Those people's lives are at stake.

592
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:49,074
Don't you think I know that?

593
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,786
This isn't one of your textbook exercises,
Mr. Jennings.

594
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,415
This is an experiment in biological warfare,
or hadn't you noticed?

595
01:05:57,874 --> 01:06:01,544
That organism could be the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research...

596
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,046
...since man split the atom.

597
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:06,424
What we do here will affect the balance
of world power!

598
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:10,470
Of course there are lives at stake.
Whole nations, in fact.

599
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:14,516
And that's far more important than
a handful of people in this small town.

600
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,727
And that is my cross to bear...

601
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:22,315
...Mr. Jennings.
Now, carry out your orders.

602
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,651
Yes, sir.

603
01:06:26,194 --> 01:06:27,153
Colonel!

604
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:29,614
Colonel, we've got a sighting.

605
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:32,575
Hargis here.

606
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,161
An eyewitness saw the organism
pursue civilians...

607
01:06:35,286 --> 01:06:38,415
-...into the sewers.
-lt's got Kevin, Eddie and Meg down there.

608
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:39,874
You've got to do something.

609
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,001
Excellent!

610
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,836
We need a schematic of the sewers.

611
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:46,548
We'll contain it down there.
I want that organism alive.

612
01:06:46,756 --> 01:06:48,842
What about the civilians?

613
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,724
They're expendable.

614
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,021
Get up.

615
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,446
Stop him!

616
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:12,907
Attention!

617
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:15,452
We have an infected civilian
trying to escape.

618
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:18,079
Stop him before he reaches
a populated area!

619
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,271
Halt, or we'll open fire!
I repeat: Halt, or we'll open fire!

620
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:16,930
Turn!

621
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:26,958
Handicapped persons,
or persons in need of special assistance...

622
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:31,046
...may report to the Blue Station,
located on the north lawn.

623
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:37,552
Dr. Sims and Dr. Divatni,
please report to Med. Unit 1.

624
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:47,896
-Are these the schematics?
-Yes, sir.

625
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:50,774
The whole town's sitting
on a system of aqueducts...

626
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:52,484
...run off from the mountains.

627
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,736
Can the organism be contained?

628
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:59,282
There seem to be three main junctions.
Here, here, and here.

629
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:03,661
If we close off those valves,
I think we got it.

630
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,626
Is it still after us?

631
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:10,919
I don't think so.

632
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:15,382
I'll be good, I swear.
I'll never see a movie, ever again.

633
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,342
It's going to be okay.

634
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:20,804
Let's just find a way out of here.

635
01:10:25,016 --> 01:10:26,267
This way.

636
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:31,064
Baker Team,
we place you 80 metres south of Valve 2.

637
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:49,374
Come on. That's our way out of here.

638
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:56,756
Watch out for the rat.

639
01:10:56,923 --> 01:10:58,258
What rat?

640
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,017
Run!

641
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,105
Run!

642
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:18,361
Get up the post. Move!

643
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:20,655
Come on, climb! Go!

644
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:30,081
No!

645
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:32,125
Get him out of there!

646
01:11:33,668 --> 01:11:34,961
No!

647
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:53,146
Come on!

648
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,092
I can't get through!

649
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:23,927
You can make it, Meg! Come on!

650
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,679
Run, Kevin! Run!

651
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,233
We have orders not to shoot!

652
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:44,823
Run, Kevin! Go to Town Hall!

653
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:45,949
No! But, Meg...

654
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,450
Do it now!

655
01:13:52,223 --> 01:13:54,059
What are you doing?

656
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:56,478
Hang on!

657
01:14:00,857 --> 01:14:02,067
Brian!

658
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:13,661
-You all right?
-Yeah.

659
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:26,091
Forget about it, Brian.
Let's go. Forget about it!

660
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,477
It got them. Bigelow and Wilson.

661
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:39,270
How do we get out of here?

662
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:42,774
They were trying to scream.
Inside it. Trying to scream...

663
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:45,652
Listen to me! How do we get out of here?

664
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:47,362
Brian, he's hurt!

665
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:57,706
I think...

666
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:00,792
...we'd better go now.

667
01:15:07,632 --> 01:15:11,553
Baker Team, Baker Team,
what the hell's going on down there?

668
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,394
We're coming up!

669
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:25,066
Close the manhole.

670
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:28,194
That's my man down there!

671
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:33,324
We've got to contain that thing.
Now, close it off! That's an order!

672
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,120
Do it.

673
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,417
Hey!

674
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:45,545
No!

675
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,396
You son of a bitch!

676
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:10,278
Colonel, you can't!
That thing's down here with us!

677
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:12,781
Meddows!

678
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:14,657
Do you hear me, Meddows?

679
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,411
Talk to me, man!

680
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:21,164
Meddows!

681
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:24,084
The water's rising.

682
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:27,253
It's coming for us.

683
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:34,719
I thought you were going to take care
of yourself.

684
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:38,139
I guess I blew it.

685
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,102
I'm sorry, Meg.

686
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:44,854
I really am.

687
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,492
This thing work?

688
01:16:57,992 --> 01:17:00,120
-Does this thing work?
-It won't do any good.

689
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:02,205
Not against that thing.

690
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:04,374
All right, Meddows.

691
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,001
If you won't listen to me...

692
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:07,711
...listen to this.

693
01:17:09,045 --> 01:17:10,213
Shit!

694
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:19,764
Fire in Sector 2!
Charlie Squad to Sector 2!

695
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,317
All right, people, please stay
where you are! Stay out of the street!

696
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:36,406
Mobile weapon units to Sector 2!
Mobile weapon units to Sector 2!

697
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:42,412
We got a man down in Sector 2.
On the double!

698
01:17:53,256 --> 01:17:54,299
Flagg!

699
01:17:55,508 --> 01:17:56,551
Drop it!

700
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:58,762
Stay back.

701
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,096
It's a lie!

702
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,639
All of it!

703
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:09,564
I said, put it down!
I'll blow you out of your shoes, boy.

704
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:14,444
Shoot him.

705
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,654
Freeze, mister!

706
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:21,910
All right, hold on.

707
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,662
Everybody...

708
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,791
...just lower your weapons.

709
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,835
Hold your positions.

710
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:32,337
Don't come any closer.

711
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:36,466
He's infected! Contagious!

712
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:39,969
He'll spread a plague through this place...

713
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:41,888
...and kill all of you!

714
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:45,934
Listen to me, Briggs. Think for a minute.

715
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:50,355
Do you think an army of guys,
in plastic suits, show up every time...

716
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:52,232
...a meteor falls?

717
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:54,359
Shoot him. That's a direct order!

718
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:56,945
How do you think they got here so quick?

719
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,198
-How did they know when to come?
-Shoot! Damn it, shoot!

720
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:03,493
I'll tell you how! That meteor is manmade!

721
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:06,579
Some kind of a germ warfare test
they fucked up!

722
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,164
Don't try it!

723
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:46,661
Let's scrag that son of a bitch!

724
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:01,926
Satchel charge! Short fuse!

725
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,757
Chew on that, slime ball.

726
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:05,615
What's happening?

727
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:08,284
I think you pissed it off.

728
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:30,932
Go!

729
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,784
My God...

730
01:21:50,368 --> 01:21:52,495
-...the day has come.
-Reverend, come on!

731
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,456
You don't understand.

732
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,251
This has all been prophesied.

733
01:22:03,965 --> 01:22:07,802
Move! Get out, everybody!
Everybody, back!

734
01:22:10,263 --> 01:22:13,308
He ran for it, Meg. Let's go! Move!

735
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:16,644
Come on.

736
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:36,289
Reverend!

737
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:44,714
Meg, look out!

738
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:51,721
It's the cold. It can't stand the cold!

739
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:12,534
Hurry!

740
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:21,459
Barricade all the entrances!

741
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,608
Get some more CO2 over here!

742
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,279
Look out! Coming through.

743
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:52,449
It's empty, Meg! Get back!

744
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,659
Stay here!

745
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:09,883
And the great voice spoke
to the seven angels and said: "Go your..."

746
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,054
There! Right there!

747
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:19,017
It's out!

748
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,602
Find some more!

749
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,451
Help me.

750
01:26:31,816 --> 01:26:34,903
Come on! You can do better than that!

751
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:44,621
Come on, you son of a bitch.

752
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:05,452
What a rush.

753
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,647
Hey, man...

754
01:28:34,814 --> 01:28:36,524
...I told you we'd get snow.

755
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:38,568
You got to have faith.

756
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,906
I wonder if I'm covered
for this sort of thing.

757
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:45,658
Dave, bring in the dump truck.

758
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,454
We better get this thing
to the icehouse before dawn.

759
01:28:59,422 --> 01:29:04,427
The will of God is written in the sky
in fingers of flame.

760
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:09,057
Wormwood falls from Heaven...

761
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,851
...consuming sinner and saint alike!

762
01:29:12,644 --> 01:29:16,690
Who shall be lifted up to rapture...

763
01:29:16,856 --> 01:29:19,359
...when the judgement trumpet blows?

764
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:23,488
None but the faithful...

765
01:29:24,322 --> 01:29:26,533
...brothers and sisters!

766
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:30,912
None but the faithful.

767
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:07,907
When, Reverend?

768
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:11,578
Ma'am?

769
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:15,248
The day of reckoning, how far off?

770
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:19,669
Soon, madam. Soon.

771
01:30:26,217 --> 01:30:29,012
The Lord will give me a sign.
