00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:19,348
<i>This is the end</i>

2
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,980
<i>Beautiful friend</i>

3
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,716
<i>This is the end</i>

4
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,419
<i>My only friend</i>

5
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,495
<i>The end</i>

6
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:37,263
<i>Of our elaborate plans</i>

7
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:39,336
<i>The end</i>

8
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,358
<i>Of everything that stands</i>

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,107
<i>The end</i>

10
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:49,111
<i>No safety nor surprise</i>

11
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,600
<i>The end</i>

12
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:57,049
<i>I'll never look into your eyes</i>

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,985
<i>Again</i>

14
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:06,264
<i>Can you picture</i>

15
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,831
<i>What will be</i>

16
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:13,263
<i>So limitless and free</i>

17
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,634
<i>Desperately in need</i>

18
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:19,697
<i>Of some</i>

19
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,446
<i>Stranger's hand</i>

20
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,379
<i>In a</i>

21
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,043
<i>Desperate land</i>

22
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:18,968
<i>Lost in a Roman</i>

23
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:23,052
<i>Wilderness of pain</i>

24
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:30,306
<i>And all the children</i>

25
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:34,145
<i>Are insane</i>

26
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:41,385
<i>All the children</i>

27
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:45,258
<i>Are insane</i>

28
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:53,101
<i>Waiting for the summer rain</i>

29
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:55,763
<i>Yeah</i>

30
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:24,303
<i>Saigon.</i>

31
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:27,268
<i>Shit.</i>

32
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,078
<i>I'm still only in Saigon.</i>

33
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:43,090
<i>Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle.</i>

34
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:52,395
<i>When I was home after
my first tour, it was worse.</i>

35
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,180
<i>I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing.</i>

36
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,825
<i>I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.</i>

37
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:21,640
<i>When I was here,
I wanted to be there.</i>

38
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,417
<i>When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.</i>

39
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:32,562
<i>I'm here a week now.</i>

40
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,272
<i>Waiting for a mission...</i>

41
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,463
<i>getting softer.</i>

42
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:48,940
<i>Every minute I stay
in this room, I get weaker.</i>

43
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:54,155
<i>And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger.</i>

44
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:02,267
<i>Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.</i>

45
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,707
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

46
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:23,684
<i>Come on, babe, come on now
Livin' life, yeah</i>

47
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:27,587
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah</i>

48
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:31,092
<i>Fuck, yeah, come on, baby</i>

49
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,594
<i>Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck</i>

50
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,995
<i>Oh, yeah, oh, fuck</i>

51
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,090
<i>Yeah, do it, yeah, come on</i>

52
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:43,468
<i>Yeah, all right</i>

53
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,544
<i>Yeah</i>

54
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:08,161
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

55
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,665
<i>Yeah</i>

56
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:14,464
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,664
<i>Yeah</i>

58
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,348
<i>Everyone gets everything he wants.</i>

59
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,421
<i>I wanted a mission...</i>

60
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:52,038
<i>and for my sins,
they gave me one.</i>

61
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:54,675
<i>Brought it up to me
like room service.</i>

62
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:57,340
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?

63
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,507
Yeah, I'm comin'.

64
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,450
<i>It was a real choice mission.</i>

65
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:07,887
<i>And when it was over,
I'd never want another.</i>

66
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,272
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

67
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,922
What does it look like?

68
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:32,711
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

69
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,716
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,613
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, one of you guys gonna shut the door?

71
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:41,985
We have orders to escort you
to the airfield.

72
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:47,561
- What are the charges?
- Sir?

73
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,997
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.

74
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:54,901
You have orders to report to
Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.

75
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,906
- I see.
- All right?

76
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:01,000
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

77
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:04,512
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

78
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:08,132
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

79
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,149
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

80
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,281
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

81
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,518
- Don't be an ass.
- Get a hold of him good.

82
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,857
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.

83
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:23,455
Stand underneath this, Captain.

84
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,977
<i>I was going to the worst place
in the world...</i>

85
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,573
<i>and I didn't even know it yet.</i>

86
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:41,917
<i>Weeks away and hundreds
of miles up a river...</i>

87
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:45,215
<i>that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable...</i>

88
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,717
<i>plugged straight into Kurtz.</i>

89
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,923
<i>It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker...</i>

90
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,759
<i>of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory--</i>

91
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:59,627
<i>any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.</i>

92
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:04,605
<i>There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own.</i>

93
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,301
<i>And if his story
is really a confession--</i>

94
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,935
<i>- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- then so is mine.</i>

95
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:13,243
- Captain. Good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:16,600
- Stand at ease.
- General.

97
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:20,354
You want a cigarette?

98
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,956
No, thank you, sir.

99
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,240
Captain, have you ever seen
this gentleman before?

100
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,781
No, sir.

101
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,994
- Met the General or myself?
- No, sir.

102
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,665
Not personally.

103
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:36,170
You've worked a lot on your
own, haven't you, Captain?

104
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,163
Yes, sir, I have.

105
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,602
Your report specifies intelligence...

106
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,954
counterintelligence with Com-Sec, "I" Corps.

107
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,573
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

108
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,671
Did you not work for
the CIA in "I" Corps?

109
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:58,993
No, sir.

110
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,825
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector...

111
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,695
Quang Tri Province,
June 18, 1968?

112
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,820
Captain?

113
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:15,198
Sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation--

114
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,473
nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation...

115
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:25,200
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.

116
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,895
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

118
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:46,841
I notice that you have
a bad hand there. You wounded?

119
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,275
I had a little fishing accident
on R and R, sir.

120
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,974
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.

121
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:55,482
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

122
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,053
Yes, General.
Very much so, sir.

123
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:03,683
Well, let's see what we have here,
roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

124
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:08,222
Try some, Jerry,
and pass it around.

125
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:12,392
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

126
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,769
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp...

127
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,378
but if you'll eat it...

128
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,546
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

129
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:28,550
I swear, why don't I
just take a piece here?

130
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:32,453
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

131
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,151
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

132
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,128
Oh, Jesus! Operations officer,
Fifth Special Forces.

133
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,791
Luke, would you play that tape
for the captain, please?

134
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:47,392
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

135
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,899
<i>October 9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King.</i>

136
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,479
These were monitored
out of Cambodia.

137
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,009
This has been verified
as Col. Kurtz's voice.

138
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:02,462
<i>I watched a snail...</i>

139
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,688
<i>crawl along the edge
of a straight razor.</i>

140
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,226
<i>That's my dream.</i>

141
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,747
<i>That's my nightmare.</i>

142
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,196
<i>Crawling, slithering...</i>

143
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:23,152
<i>along the edge...</i>

144
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:27,715
<i>of a straight razor...</i>

145
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,541
<i>and surviving.</i>

148
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:44,425
<i>But we must kill them.</i>

149
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:47,087
<i>We must incinerate them.</i>

150
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,596
<i>Pig after pig.</i>

151
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,633
<i>Cow after cow.</i>

152
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:57,244
<i>Village after village.
Army after army.</i>

153
00:13:58,074 --> 00:14:00,975
<i>And they call me an assassin.</i>

154
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:05,884
<i>What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?</i>

155
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:11,518
<i>They lie. They lie,
and we have to be merciful...</i>

156
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:13,851
<i>for those who lie.</i>

157
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:16,754
<i>Those nabobs.</i>

158
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,335
<i>I hate them.</i>

159
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:24,492
<i>I do hate them.</i>

160
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:32,266
Walt Kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers...

161
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,502
this country's ever produced.

162
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,929
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

163
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:44,092
And he was a good man, too,
a humanitarian man.

164
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:47,304
A man of wit and humor.

165
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:50,045
He joined the Special Forces.

166
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:54,142
And after that his...

167
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,759
ideas, methods...

168
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,538
became...

169
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:06,934
unsound.

170
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,135
Unsound.

171
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:21,281
Now he's crossed
into Cambodia with this...

172
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,369
Montagnard army of his
that worship...

173
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,845
the man like a god...

174
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:31,153
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.

175
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:36,732
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

176
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:42,140
Col. Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

177
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,413
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?

178
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:50,508
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents--

179
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,835
men he believed
were double agents.

180
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:57,505
So he took matters
into his own hands.

181
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,382
Well, you see, Willard...

182
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:08,330
in this war, things
get confused out there.

183
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:12,271
Power, ideals,
the old morality...

184
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,208
and practical
military necessity.

185
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,817
But out there
with these natives...

186
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:24,802
it must be a temptation to...

187
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,371
be God.

188
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:33,978
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart...

189
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,658
between the rational
and the irrational...

190
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,434
between good and evil...

191
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:44,134
and good does not
always triumph.

192
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,396
Sometimes...

193
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,609
the dark side...

194
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:56,535
overcomes what Lincoln called
the better angels of our nature.

195
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,945
Every man has got
a breaking point.

196
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:03,706
You and I have them.

197
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,959
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

198
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:12,299
And very obviously,
he has gone insane.

199
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:29,148
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
Obviously insane.

200
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:37,526
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat--

201
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:42,353
pick up Col. Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba...

202
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,628
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

203
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,068
When you find the Colonel
infiltrate his team by--

204
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:54,219
whatever means available and
terminate the Colonel's command.

205
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,047
Terminate the Colonel?

206
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,891
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint...

207
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:12,384
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable...

208
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,463
human conduct...

209
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:17,871
and he is still on the field,
commanding troops.

210
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,326
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

211
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:26,234
You understand, Captain,
that this mission...

212
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:31,237
does not exist
nor will it ever exist.

213
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:29,589
<i>How many people
had I already killed?</i>

214
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:33,414
<i>There were those six
that I knew about for sure--</i>

215
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:37,401
<i>close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.</i>

216
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:42,859
<i>But this time
it was an American...</i>

217
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,209
<i>and an officer.</i>

218
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:58,728
<i>That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me...</i>

219
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,809
<i>but it did.</i>

220
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:06,408
<i>Shit. Charging a man
with murder in this place...</i>

221
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:11,018
<i>was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.</i>

222
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:16,584
<i>I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?</i>

223
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:21,715
<i>But I really didn't know
what I'd do when I found him.</i>

224
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:32,863
- Did you check the tank?
- Yeah.

225
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,406
<i>I was being ferried down
the coast in a navy PBR...</i>

226
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:42,500
<i>a type of plastic patrol boat--
a pretty common sight on the rivers.</i>

227
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:45,512
<i>They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move...</i>

228
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:49,846
<i>without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay.</i>

229
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:52,253
<i>I needed the air and the time.</i>

230
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,387
<i>Only problem was
I wouldn't be alone.</i>

231
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:57,550
Mornin', Captain.

232
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,431
<i>The crew were
mostly just kids--</i>

233
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,269
<i>rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves.</i>

234
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,664
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

235
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:14,231
<i>The machinist-- the one they
called Chef-- was from New Orleans.</i>

236
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:17,244
<i>He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam.</i>

237
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:20,076
<i>Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.</i>

238
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:22,116
<i>Lance, on the forward fifties...</i>

239
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,947
<i>was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of L.A.</i>

240
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:28,888
<i>To look at him, you wouldn't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.</i>

241
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,957
<i>Clean-- Mr. Clean-- was
from some South Bronx shit-hole...</i>

242
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,225
<i>and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam...</i>

243
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,928
<i>really put the zap on his head.</i>

244
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:44,966
<i>Then there was Phillips,
the chief.</i>

245
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:49,010
<i>It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief's boat.</i>

246
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,285
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water...

247
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,348
to get into the Nung River.

248
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:56,994
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.

249
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,871
Don't worry about it.

250
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:02,301
Don't smoke.

251
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,788
You know, I've pulled
a few special ops in here.

252
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:09,489
About six months ago...

253
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:12,792
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

254
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,699
He was regular Army, too.

255
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:22,143
Heard he shot himself in the head.

256
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:33,954
<i>At first I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.</i>

257
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:36,616
<i>I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.</i>

258
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,161
<i>Third-generation West Point,
top of his class.</i>

259
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:45,495
<i>Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations.</i>

260
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,592
<i>Et cetera, et cetera.</i>

261
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:54,339
<i>I'd heard his voice on the tape,
and it really put the hook in me...</i>

262
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,564
<i>but I couldn't connect up
that voice with this man.</i>

263
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:09,789
<i>Like they said,
he had an impressive career.</i>

264
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:14,795
<i>Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.</i>

265
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:19,129
<i>He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation--</i>

266
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:22,533
<i>General, chief of staff,
anything.</i>

267
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:28,266
<i>In 1964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam...</i>

268
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,743
<i>and things started to slip.</i>

269
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,939
<i>His report to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff...</i>

270
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:35,482
<i>and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.</i>

271
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:40,413
<i>Seems they didn't dig
what he had to tell them.</i>

272
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,991
<i>During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer...</i>

273
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:49,156
<i>to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.</i>

274
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,300
<i>Airborne?</i>

275
00:23:56,238 --> 00:23:58,900
<i>He was 38 years old.</i>

276
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:02,272
<i>Why the fuck would he do that?</i>

277
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:08,879
<i>1966, joins Special Forces...</i>

278
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:11,009
<i>returns to Vietnam.</i>

279
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:13,277
Hey, what's that?

280
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:15,879
- Arc light.
- What's up?

281
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:18,551
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?

282
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,560
- What's that?
- Arc light.

283
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:23,631
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

284
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,632
Charlie don't never
see 'em or hear 'em, man.

285
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:26,962
There they are.

286
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,367
Concussion will suck the air
out of your damn lungs.

287
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,496
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

288
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:35,236
Smoke! Secondary burning.

289
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,116
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

290
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,260
Let's have a look, Chief.

291
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:44,578
<i>It was the Air-Cav.
First of the Ninth--</i>

292
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:45,516
That's them.

293
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:48,522
<i>our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.</i>

294
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:52,492
<i>But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometers ahead.</i>

295
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:57,053
<i>Well, Airmobile.
Those boys just couldn't stay put.</i>

296
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:12,413
Hey, kid, come on.
Get down. Come on.

297
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,359
<i>First of the Ninth was
an old cavalry division...</i>

298
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,361
<i>that had cashed in its horses
for choppers...</i>

299
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:31,652
<i>and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit.</i>

300
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,376
<i>They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time here.</i>

301
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:41,510
<i>What they were mopping up now hadn't
even happened yet an hour ago.</i>

302
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:44,375
Just keeping running by.
We're for television.

303
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,777
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep-- Go on. Keep going.

304
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,782
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

305
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:52,183
Just go by like you're fighting,
like you're fighting.

306
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:55,814
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television. Just go through.

307
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,915
Just go by. Keep on going.

308
00:25:58,026 --> 00:26:00,153
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
Go on. Keep going.

309
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,127
All right, come on. Go.

310
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,170
Right here. Yes.
Over here. Over here.

311
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:24,944
Where can I find the CO?

312
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:27,879
That's the Colonel comin' down!

313
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,961
The CO's on that chopper.

314
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:06,518
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 100 yards!

315
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,756
- Give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

316
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:15,765
Body cards!

317
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:17,896
- Sir?
- Bring my body cards!

318
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:18,923
Yes, sir!

319
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:25,742
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

320
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:28,038
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

321
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,379
Captain Willard!

322
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:33,886
I carry priority papers from
Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.

323
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,923
I understand Nha Trang
has briefed you...

324
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:37,924
on the requirements of my mission.

325
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:40,620
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

326
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:43,664
Sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

327
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,009
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!

328
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:48,515
But just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

329
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,075
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

330
00:27:56,421 --> 00:28:00,856
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

331
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,978
six of clubs, eight of spades.

332
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,112
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

333
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,199
Four of diamonds.

334
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:13,989
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

335
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:17,395
- What?
- Death cards!

336
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,831
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

337
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:26,238
<i>- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt or harm you.</i>

338
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:29,511
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

339
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:33,837
<i>This is an area
that is controlled...</i>

340
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:36,349
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.</i>

341
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,573
Jim.

342
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:44,975
<i>We are here to help you.</i>

343
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:50,754
<i>- We are here to extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.</i>

344
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:53,014
<i>- to those of you who would like to return...
- Everybody in?</i>

345
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:57,368
<i>to the arms of
the South Vietnamese government.</i>

346
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,787
Get in. Hurry up!

347
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:03,672
Move it out!

348
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:06,304
<i>This is an area
that is controlled...</i>

349
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,009
<i>by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.</i>

350
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:14,282
Hey! What's this?
What is this?

351
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,085
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

352
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:20,628
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

353
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,129
Yeah? What do you got to say?

354
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:29,067
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants
water. He can drink paddy water.

355
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:32,572
Get outta here!
Give me that canteen.

356
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:35,802
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to--

357
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,505
Get outta here!
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

358
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:40,740
He killed a lot of our people!

359
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,942
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts...

360
00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:45,042
strapped on him can drink
from my canteen any day.

361
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:49,214
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

362
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:52,650
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

363
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:54,614
Yeah? Here.

364
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:58,264
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have--

365
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,992
What's your name, sailor?

366
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:05,937
- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir.
- Gunner's Mate Third Class--

367
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:10,137
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,070
It's an honor to meet you, Lance.

369
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:14,482
 I've admired your nose riding for years.

370
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:17,350
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

371
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:20,114
- Thank you, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.

372
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,213
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

373
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:24,224
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,157
I want you to meet some guys.

375
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:28,161
- This is Mike from San Diego.
- Far out.

376
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:31,130
- Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.

377
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,360
None of us are anywhere
near your class though.

378
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:34,554
No way.

379
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:38,905
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.
I like to finish operations early.

380
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,373
Fly down to Yung Tau
for the evening glass.

381
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:43,910
Been riding since you got here?

382
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:46,606
No way. I haven't surfed
since I been here.

383
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:49,115
Through Christ, our Lord...

384
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,310
from Whom
all good things come...

385
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,979
through Him in the unity
of the Holy Spirit.

386
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,419
All glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father, amen.

387
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,526
Let us bring
our iniquities to the Father...

388
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:01,562
in the words our Savior gave us.

389
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:06,600
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

390
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:11,365
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

391
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:14,271
Give us this day our daily bread...

392
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,862
and forgive us our trespasses...

393
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,326
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

394
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:22,242
<i>Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

395
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:35,059
<i>Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself.</i>

396
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:37,290
<i>They choppered in
the T-bones and the beer...</i>

397
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,698
<i>and turned the LZ into a beach party.</i>

398
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,771
<i>The more they tried
to make it just like home...</i>

399
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,500
<i>the more they made everybody miss it.</i>

400
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,805
Make my meat rare--
rare but not cold.

401
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:59,048
<i>Well, he wasn't
a bad officer, I guess.</i>

402
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,646
<i>He loved his boys,
and you felt safe with him.</i>

403
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:06,056
<i>He was one of those guys that
had that weird light around him.</i>

404
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>You just knew he wasn't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.</i>

405
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,898
What happened to your mission, Captain?
Nha Trang forget all about you?

406
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:24,138
Airborne.

407
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:28,605
Sir, two places we can
get into the river.

408
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:31,709
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

409
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,689
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm really sure of.

410
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,817
Well, that village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy, Willard.

411
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:42,260
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

412
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,264
Got some pretty heavy ordinance.

413
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:46,732
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

414
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:50,066
What's the name of
that goddamn village? Vin Drin--

415
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:52,537
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

416
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:55,016
Damn gook names all sound the same.

417
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:59,657
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

418
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,381
That's a fantastic peak.

419
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,917
- Peak?
- About six foot.

420
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,716
Yeah, it's an outstanding peak.
It's got both the long right and left slide...

421
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:10,017
with a bowl section that's unbelievable.

422
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,188
It's just tube city.

423
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:17,764
Well why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

424
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:20,562
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

425
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:22,569
It's all goddamn beach break.

426
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,864
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.

427
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:29,181
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

428
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:32,479
Sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

429
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,639
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

430
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,649
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

431
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:40,088
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

432
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:43,824
We'll pick your boat up and put it
down like a baby right where you want it.

433
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:46,416
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.

434
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:50,646
Airmobile! I can take that point
and hold it just as long as I like.

435
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,991
And you can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

436
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:56,502
Hell, a six-foot peak.

437
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,673
All right, take a gunship
back to the division.

438
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,833
Lance, go with Mike and let him
pick out a board for you.

439
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:04,104
And bring me my Yater Spoon,
the eight-six.

440
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,112
- I don't know, sir--
- What is it, soldier?

441
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:09,274
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

442
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:11,511
Charlie don't surf!

443
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,944
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

444
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:42,615
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

445
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,722
- How are you feeling, Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

446
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,359
All right, son, let 'er rip.

447
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:55,735
Let's go!

448
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:22,413
I never have gotten used to a light
board, and I can't get used to one.

449
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:25,418
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

450
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,148
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

451
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,156
- Really?
- Yeah!

452
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:32,920
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

453
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,419
- You can't ride the nose on those things.
- <i>Big Duke Six.</i>

454
00:36:35,557 --> 00:36:37,892
This is Eagle Thrust Seven.
We've got it spotted.

455
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,557
<i>Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.</i>

456
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:43,103
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.

457
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,570
<i>That's a roger, Big Duke.
Okay, we're going in.</i>

458
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:49,734
Hey, Lance, we'll come in
low out of the rising sun.

459
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:52,312
About a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

460
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:54,779
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

461
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:59,013
Scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

462
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,452
Hey, they're gonna play music!

463
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:11,659
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

464
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:15,065
So we don't get our balls blown off.

465
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:29,550
Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.

466
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:34,315
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Foxtrot. Shall we dance?

467
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:41,823
- Jimmy!
- Yes, sir!

468
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,965
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.

469
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,474
<i>We got a couple--
at that tree line.</i>

470
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,518
<i>We're taking fire from the holes.</i>

471
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:21,505
Run, Charlie!

472
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,168
<i>This should make
everything burn.</i>

473
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:41,236
<i>We got a couple
of people ahead here.</i>

474
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:44,708
<i>- What's going down here?
- We got an automatic! Shoot to kill!</i>

475
00:40:44,787 --> 00:40:48,348
<i>- .50 cal in the open!
- I spotted a large weapon down below.</i>

476
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:50,726
We're gonna go down and check it out.

477
00:40:50,794 --> 00:40:53,350
<i>All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin' in.</i>

478
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,827
<i>All right. What a shot.</i>

479
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:08,790
Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
Get you a case of beer for that one.

480
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:32,084
<i>Six-four-one-zero,
we're over the village right now.</i>

481
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:34,400
I think I see a vehicle
down in the courtyard.

482
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,495
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Well done, hawks. Well done.

483
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:40,226
I want some 20 Mike-Mike-Vulcan
right along those tree lines.

484
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:42,343
Ripple the shit out of 'em.

485
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:44,964
Got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

486
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:48,200
He's moving across to resupply the weapon.

487
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:51,540
<i>Big Duke Six, clear the area.
I'm coming down myself.</i>

488
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:53,443
Don't these people ever give up?

489
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:59,276
Nice shot, Bill.

490
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,050
- Shit!
- All right, all right!

491
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:07,594
- It's just a flare!
- It's a flare! Gotta get outta here!

492
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,925
Un-ass that shit.
Get it outta here!

493
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:14,058
Get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right, it's just a flare.

494
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:17,296
- Everybody alright? Lance, you alright?
- I'm fine!

495
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:33,817
Get down!

496
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,555
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.

497
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:15,254
<i>We got secondaries
down there in the plaza.</i>

498
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,455
<i>Blue 3, Blue 4, hold out over position X-ray.</i>

499
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:20,693
<i>Duke Six, Duke Six, we've
got wounded down there.</i>

500
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:28,540
My God! Oh, my God!

501
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:32,135
- Get a stretcher over here!
- You're all right.

502
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:34,844
Please help me!

503
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:41,873
- Please, God! Help me!
- Give him some morphine.

504
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,254
My God! Oh!

505
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,589
- Seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?

506
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,357
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 15 minutes.

507
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:52,398
I want my men out.

508
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,627
<i>Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.</i>

509
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:58,967
<i>This is 10-10. We're gonna be in,
throw 'em on and get out.</i>

510
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:21,634
She's got a grenade!

511
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:23,284
She's got a grenade!

512
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,796
<i>Oh, Jesus! 
The whole goddamned thing just blew up.</i>

513
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:29,665
<i>- She blew the shit--</i>
- Fucking savages.

514
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:34,264
<i>- Can I get a medevac?</i>
- Holy Christ, she's a sapper.

515
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,070
<i>I'm gonna get that dink bitch.</i>

516
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:39,442
<i>Get over there, Johnny. I'm gonna roll in
and put that right skid right up her ass.</i>

517
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,544
We gotta get some air
in these trees.

518
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,563
It's goddamn eat-up
with enemy down here.

519
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,976
<i>I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.</i>

520
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,275
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!

521
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:52,642
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin' in.</i>

522
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,527
<i>My tail rotor's out.
I got control.</i>

523
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:06,373
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.

524
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:09,705
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- Oh, right.

525
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,507
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.

526
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:16,515
Look! Good six-foot swells!

527
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,473
Come here, Lance.

528
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:47,012
Incoming!

529
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:51,810
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.

530
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:53,753
Maybe you ought to surf
somewhere else.

531
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,253
What do you know
about surfing, Major?

532
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:58,052
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

533
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:02,418
Come here! Come here!

534
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:07,157
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

535
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:10,101
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. Go change.

536
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:12,104
It's still pretty hairy
out there, sir.

537
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,174
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,800
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

539
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:20,642
That clear? Now, get going.
I'll cover for 'em.

540
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:23,091
And bring a board for Lance.

541
00:46:23,918 --> 00:46:26,250
We can't do shit
until the boat gets here.

542
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:29,686
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

543
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,758
- What?
- See how they break both ways?

544
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:35,818
One guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think of that?

545
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,955
I think we oughtta wait
for the tide to come up.

546
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:41,057
- Lance, come here. Look. Look!
- Incoming!

547
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:46,990
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours!

548
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:51,269
You wanna wait here for six hours?

549
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:57,216
Yo! Chief! Chief!

550
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:06,750
<i>Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on!</i>

551
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:10,291
<i>- Let's go, dick-heads, take off!</i>
- Goddamn it!

552
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,888
Don't you think it's
a little risky for R and R?

553
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,061
If I say it's safe to surf this beach,
Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!

554
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,435
I mean, I'm not afraid
to surf this place!

555
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,441
I'll surf this fuckin' place.

556
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,913
Give me that RT, soldier.

557
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:31,276
Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six.
Goddamn it!

558
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:33,512
<i>I want that tree line bombed!</i>

559
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:36,089
<i>Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.</i>

560
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,124
<i>Blow them into the Stone Age, son!</i>

561
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:41,293
- Out!
- No, back, no!

562
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:45,092
All right, now. Let me take care of this.
You all right? Get that out of here!

563
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:48,691
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

564
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,895
- No, ma'am. Sorry!
- Jimmy!

565
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,973
<i>Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three, roger.</i>

566
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:56,531
<i>They need some napalm in the tree line. Can
you guys push ground and put it down there?</i>

567
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:59,613
<i>Right, One-Three. We're fixin'
to fuck with 'em. What's the target?</i>

568
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,944
<i>We're trying to suppress some mortar
fire off the tree line down there.</i>

569
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,211
<i>- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it all you got.</i>

570
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,844
<i>Bring in all your ships.</i>

571
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:11,721
Medevac him in my chopper.
Get him back to the hospital.

572
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:14,055
No, no, no,
you gotta go with him.

573
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:17,028
Come on! Go! Go!
Get it outta here!

574
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,031
Tell my guys I want my board!

575
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,033
<i>Big Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three.</i>

576
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:24,502
<i>The jets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to bomb station.</i>

577
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:27,699
<i>Get your people back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.</i>

578
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:31,168
Don't worry.

579
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:35,442
We'll have this place cleaned up and ready
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

580
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:37,636
Give me those shorts.

581
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:42,817
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

582
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:46,222
I want to see you do your stuff
in 'em out there. Okay?

583
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:11,810
You smell that?

584
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:14,513
- Do you smell that?
- What?

585
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:19,753
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

586
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,806
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

587
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,598
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

588
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,328
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 12 hours.

589
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:32,769
When it was all over,
I walked up.

590
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:36,796
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

591
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:41,338
But the smell--
You know, that gasoline smell.

592
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:45,714
The whole hill smelled like...

593
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:50,953
victory.

594
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:58,130
Someday this war's gonna end.

595
00:50:12,046 --> 00:50:14,640
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?

596
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,682
- The wind!
- What?

597
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:19,844
It's blowin' onshore! It's coming onshore.
It's gonna blow this place out.

598
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:23,081
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

599
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,159
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

600
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,161
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.

601
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:30,491
The kid's got a reputation.

602
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,963
You can't expect him
to surf those sloppy waves.

603
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:35,297
- I understand what you're saying.
- Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.

604
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:40,430
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- Lance, look, I apologize. It's not my fault.

605
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:42,193
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm.

606
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:43,456
Hey, Bill, don't get me wrong--

607
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,301
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

608
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,312
I accept your apology.

609
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:50,110
All right, then. But if you could hang
around just 20 minutes--

610
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,549
- Maybe some other time, Bill.
- Just 20 minutes!

611
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:55,884
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.

612
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:59,982
<i>Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right.</i>

613
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:01,994
<i>Look, Lance.</i>

614
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:03,996
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

615
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:06,032
- Wanna say good-bye to the Colonel?
- No.

616
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,033
- You sure?
- Yeah!

617
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:10,467
<i>- Get the fuck outta here.
- It's the fucking napalm.</i>

618
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:12,835
<i>Just wait 20 minutes!</i>

619
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:15,101
Damn! Fuck!

620
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:17,798
They've been lookin' for ya.

621
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,592
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

622
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,395
Here!

623
00:51:26,854 --> 00:51:28,428
Incoming!

624
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:31,591
That's the Colonel's surfboard!

625
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:34,024
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!

626
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:38,758
- Guys, help!
- Get the board and let's get out of here!

627
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:44,861
Fucking Airborne!

628
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:18,431
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

629
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,097
Come on. Let's get high.

630
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:22,175
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

631
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:25,712
<i>Someday this war's gonna end.</i>

632
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:28,714
<i>That would be just fine
with the boys on the boat.</i>

633
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:31,148
<i>They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home.</i>

634
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:36,211
<i>- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there...</i>

635
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:39,383
<i>and I knew that it just
didn't exist anymore.</i>

636
00:52:42,862 --> 00:52:44,855
Buddha time, here.

637
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:49,095
All right, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

638
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:56,303
<i>If that's how Kilgore
fought the war...</i>

639
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:59,728
<i>I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.</i>

640
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,982
<i>It wasn't just
insanity and murder.</i>

641
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:06,443
<i>There was enough of that
to go around for everyone.</i>

642
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,935
I mean, he never
was hurtin' for pussy.

643
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:25,368
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangos.

644
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,856
I meet Raquel Welch.

645
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:33,430
I make a nice
mango cream pudding.

646
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:38,513
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

647
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:42,350
She's into mangos too.

648
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:44,947
She's like one limb above me.

649
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:48,494
- We're both in the jungle here nude.
- Hey, Chief.

650
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:51,792
- Yeah?
- Here comes that Colonel guy again.

651
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:57,065
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like?</i>

652
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,205
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

653
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:02,502
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

654
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,510
<i>Just give me back the board, Lance.</i>

655
00:54:05,612 --> 00:54:08,911
<i>It was a good board, and I like it.</i>

656
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:12,474
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

657
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:16,420
<i>- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

658
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:18,923
<i>I will not hurt or harm you.</i>

659
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:21,824
<i>Just give me back
the board, Lance.</i>

660
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:24,227
<i>It was a good board,
and I like it.</i>

661
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:28,025
<i>You know how hard it is
to find a board you like.</i>

662
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:32,071
<i>- I will not hurt or harm you.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

663
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:34,766
That guy's too fuckin' much, man.

664
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,843
Do you think
he would have shot us?

665
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,208
He wouldn't have shot us
on the beach...

666
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:42,111
but he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

667
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:44,410
<i>Let's go surfin' now
everybody's learnin' how...</i>

668
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:46,884
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

669
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:48,215
Sucker.

670
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,144
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

671
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:54,213
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

672
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,200
Sock it to me, Lance.

673
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,369
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

674
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,670
Hell, he's probably got them all over
the river with that recording.

675
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:11,676
We'll have to hold up here
till dark, Chief.

676
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,837
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

677
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:15,676
What makes you say that?

678
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,758
You think that big Cav Colonel
wants everyone upriver...

679
00:55:17,784 --> 00:55:19,251
to know we stole his board?

680
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:21,412
I didn't steal it!

681
00:55:23,523 --> 00:55:25,457
- Captain?
- Hmm?

682
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,653
Just how far up
this river we goin'?

683
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:31,598
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.

684
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,658
We're goin' up pretty far.

685
00:55:37,565 --> 00:55:39,760
Is it gonna be hairy?

686
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:44,905
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.

687
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:48,812
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

688
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:50,452
Fuck.

689
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:02,887
Maybe you'll get
a chance to know...

690
00:56:02,996 --> 00:56:04,706
what the fuck you are
in some factory in Ohio.

691
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:10,547
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go
get those mangos now, okay?

692
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,629
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take--

693
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:14,671
I'll go with him.

694
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:21,809
Chef?

695
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:24,850
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

696
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:27,385
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

697
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:31,617
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

698
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:35,105
- I'm a saucier.
- Saucier?

699
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:39,888
Yes, sir.
See, I come from New Orleans.

700
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,437
I was raised to be a saucier,
a great saucier.

701
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:47,769
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

702
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:54,586
Gotta be a mango tree
here somewhere.

703
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:03,787
Then, I was supposed
to go to Paris...

704
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,956
study at the Escoffier school.

705
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:10,776
But then I got orders for my physical.

706
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:24,124
Hell, I joined the Navy.

707
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,652
Heard they had better food.

708
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:29,915
Cook school-- that did it.

709
00:57:30,016 --> 00:57:34,196
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

710
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:40,721
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

711
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:44,024
All of us, you know,
lined up lookin' at it.

712
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:47,931
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.

713
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:54,937
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons--

714
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:57,465
all of it-- boiling it!

715
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:01,346
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.

716
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:05,116
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

717
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:10,173
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me--

718
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:51,875
What is it?

719
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:55,433
Charlie?

720
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:07,971
It's a tiger!

721
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:13,212
Son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

722
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,811
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.

723
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:17,219
- Get on your 60, Clean!
- Got it.

724
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:19,805
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!

725
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,743
A fucking tiger!

726
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:25,222
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!

727
00:59:25,332 --> 00:59:27,493
- Let's go!
- Tiger!

728
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:30,161
Cheif, you were right.
Never get out of the fucking boat.

729
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,966
- Clean, bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

730
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:36,509
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!

731
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,805
Never get out of the boat!

732
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:43,906
- What happened? How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!

733
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:46,577
- What?
- A fuckin' tiger!

734
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:48,613
- Tiger?
- Yes! I've had it!

735
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,980
I've had the whole goddamn
fuckin' shit, man!

736
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:54,819
You can kiss my ass
on the county square...

737
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,896
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

738
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:58,897
I didn't come here for this.

739
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:01,627
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.

740
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:05,328
I didn't get out the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

741
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,503
All I wanted to do
was fuckin' cook!

742
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:11,805
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

743
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:14,812
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?

744
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:19,282
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

745
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:22,981
All right?
It's gonna be all right?

746
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:26,581
Never get out
of the fuckin' boat.

747
01:00:26,693 --> 01:00:30,151
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
Good-bye!

748
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:34,265
<i>Never get out of the boat.</i>

749
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:37,063
<i>Absolutely, goddamn right...</i>

750
01:00:38,171 --> 01:00:40,969
<i>unless you were going all the way.</i>

751
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:48,145
<i>Kurtz got off the boat.</i>

752
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:52,230
<i>He split from
the whole fuckin' program.</i>

753
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,848
<i>How did that happen?</i>

754
01:00:57,757 --> 01:01:00,749
<i>What did he see here
that first tour?</i>

755
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:09,902
<i>Thirty-eight fucking years old.</i>

756
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,604
<i>If you joined the Green Berets...</i>

757
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:15,230
<i>there was no way
you'd ever get above Colonel.</i>

758
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:18,760
<i>Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.</i>

759
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:22,814
<i>The more I read
and began to understand...</i>

760
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,749
<i>the more I admired him.</i>

761
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:28,247
<i>His family and friends
couldn't understand it...</i>

762
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:31,219
<i>and they couldn't
talk him out of it.</i>

763
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:35,583
<i>He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton of shit.</i>

764
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:38,960
<i>But when he threatened
to resign, they gave it to him.</i>

765
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:46,713
<i>The next youngest guy
in his class was half his age.</i>

766
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:50,168
<i>They must have thought
he was some far-out old man...</i>

767
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,222
<i>humping it over that course.</i>

768
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:56,740
<i>I did it when I was 19.
It damn near wasted me.</i>

769
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:01,318
<i>A tough motherfucker.</i>

770
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:04,036
<i>He finished it.</i>

771
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:08,917
<i>He could have gone for General...</i>

772
01:02:10,263 --> 01:02:13,164
<i>but he went for himself instead.</i>

773
01:02:15,602 --> 01:02:17,044
"Dear Eva...

774
01:02:17,637 --> 01:02:20,367
"today was really a new one.

775
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:23,947
Almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin' tiger.

776
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,937
Really un-fucking believable,
you know?

777
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:31,016
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river...

778
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:34,177
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him."

779
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:36,187
<i>Come on, baby</i>

780
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:38,723
"Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood."

781
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:42,590
<i>October 1967.
On special assignment...</i>

782
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:44,890
<i>Kon Tum Province, II Corps.</i>

783
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:48,991
<i>Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces.</i>

784
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,502
<i>Rated a major success.</i>

785
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:57,167
<i>He received no official clearance.</i>

786
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,575
<i>He just thought it up and did it.</i>

787
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,917
<i>What balls.</i>

788
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:07,715
<i>They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.</i>

789
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:10,449
<i>But after the press
got a hold of it...</i>

790
01:03:10,557 --> 01:03:12,718
<i>they promoted him
to full Colonel instead.</i>

791
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:19,027
<i>Oh, man, the bullshit
piled up so fast in Vietnam.</i>

792
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:22,399
<i>You needed wings
to stay above it.</i>

793
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:53,498
This sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit.

794
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,987
Expecting us this time?

795
01:03:58,773 --> 01:04:00,707
Damned if I know.

796
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:07,555
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

797
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,871
Jesus--

798
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:14,511
Wow.

799
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:19,687
- Everything goes back up into the truck.
- What?

800
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,842
We gotta get
all that stuff up.

801
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,727
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

802
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:31,783
- Let's go!
- I bet you we can score up here.

803
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:34,705
Yo, man, check out the bikes, Lance.

804
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:37,742
Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!

805
01:04:37,844 --> 01:04:41,109
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, Sukiyaki.

806
01:04:41,214 --> 01:04:43,478
Yeah, man.
This is something.

807
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,453
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

808
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,337
Right over there.

809
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:53,356
Sergeant. Sergeant?

810
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,793
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five--

811
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,732
Come on, man! Move!

812
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:05,963
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?

813
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:10,004
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

814
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,593
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

815
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:14,407
I don't have no destination.

816
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:16,711
I can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

817
01:05:16,816 --> 01:05:20,274
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!

818
01:05:20,328 --> 01:05:22,485
I can't do a goddamned thing
about it without a destination.

819
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:25,286
Sarge, these guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

820
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,757
I carry priority papers
from COMSEC Intelligence, II Corps.

821
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,489
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

822
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:34,658
- Eight bucks for that, Camo--
- Hey!

823
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:37,031
All right. Damn.

824
01:05:37,136 --> 01:05:40,628
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

825
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,709
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

826
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,904
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

827
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:51,677
Just take this over to the man

883
01:11:02,795 --> 01:11:05,662
<i>Charlie didn't get much USO.</i>

884
01:11:07,066 --> 01:11:10,543
<i>He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.</i>

885
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:18,637
<i>His idea of great R and R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.</i>

886
01:11:20,746 --> 01:11:23,613
<i>He had only two ways home--</i>

887
01:11:23,716 --> 01:11:27,152
<i>death or victory.</i>

888
01:11:38,097 --> 01:11:41,225
<i>No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass.</i>

889
01:11:42,702 --> 01:11:45,686
<i>The war was being run by
a bunch of four-star clowns...</i>

890
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,677
<i>who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.</i>

891
01:11:50,543 --> 01:11:53,410
Hey, you know, man,
that was far-fucking-out.

892
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:57,073
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

893
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,797
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

894
01:12:00,252 --> 01:12:03,085
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

895
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:05,180
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man...

896
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,191
just like that cat in the delta.

897
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:09,386
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

898
01:12:09,495 --> 01:12:12,487
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.

899
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:16,071
Remember? This cat, man--
He really dug his <i>Playboy</i>, man.

900
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:21,454
I mean, like, this cat, when the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

901
01:12:21,741 --> 01:12:25,302
Look at these beautiful
fuckin' jugs, man!

902
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:28,312
Yeah, so anyway,
he was workin' ARVN patrols, you know,

903
01:12:28,414 --> 01:12:31,872
had one of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit.

904
01:12:31,984 --> 01:12:35,147
And one day, the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn't give it back to him.

905
01:12:35,253 --> 01:12:37,685
He said, 
"Give me my magazine back."

906
01:12:37,732 --> 01:12:41,429
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."

907
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:43,888
- Typical fuckin' ARVN, man.
- Yeah!

908
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:47,932
- So, like, then the gook starts to go too far, see.
- Chef, take the wheel.

909
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:52,130
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's tits.

910
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:53,705
Take the wheel.

911
01:12:53,806 --> 01:12:58,174
He started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that.

912
01:12:58,244 --> 01:13:01,236
And the Sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

913
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:03,410
"You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

914
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:05,349
Don't do her like that.", right?

915
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:10,218
- Gook say, "Fuck you" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

916
01:13:10,322 --> 01:13:13,587
The Sergeant, man, he just couldn't
handle it no more.

917
01:13:13,692 --> 01:13:15,956
He just picked up his iron...

918
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:18,462
flipped it to rock and roll and...

919
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,623
Boom!

920
01:13:20,733 --> 01:13:23,463
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the <i>Playboy</i> mag.

921
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:26,504
It blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

922
01:13:26,605 --> 01:13:31,907
There wasn't no more Lieutenant
that day, man. That was <i>it</i>  for his ass.

923
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:35,913
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

924
01:13:36,015 --> 01:13:38,006
They stuck his ass in the LBJ.

925
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:41,300
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothin'.

926
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,249
Fuckin' ARVN, man.

927
01:13:46,358 --> 01:13:48,258
They should have killed the fuck.

928
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,558
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

929
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:56,586

ain't it?

01:18:10,356 --> 01:18:15,885
<i>He joined the Special Forces.
After that his...</i>

993
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:19,430
<i>The Army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold.</i>

994
01:18:19,531 --> 01:18:22,056
<i>- ...methods...
- And if he'd pulled over...</i>

995
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:25,159
<i>- it all would have been forgotten.
- ...unsound.</i>

996
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:27,170
<i>But he kept going.</i>

997
01:18:27,272 --> 01:18:30,366
<i>- Now he's crossed into Cambodia--
- He kept winning it his way.</i>

998
01:18:30,476 --> 01:18:33,445
<i>- with this Montagnard army of his--
- And they called me in.</i>

999
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:38,380
<i>Man like a god and follow
every order, however ridiculous.</i>

1000
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,612
<i>They lost him.</i>

1001
01:18:44,723 --> 01:18:47,214
<i>He was gone.</i>

1002
01:18:47,326 --> 01:18:50,227
<i>Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence...</i>

1003
01:18:50,329 --> 01:18:53,058
<i>mostly from captured VC.</i>

1004
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:57,829
<i>The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared of him.</i>

1005
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,595
<i>He and his men were
playing hit-and-run...</i>

1006
01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:02,818
<i>all the way into Cambodia.</i>

1007
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,638
I know where I'm goin'...

1008
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,374
I'm goin' to the White House
to have dinner...

1009
01:19:12,484 --> 01:19:15,112
...with the President
of the United States, baby.

1010
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,381
That's where I'm goin'.

1011
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,855
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.

1012
01:19:21,393 --> 01:19:23,144
Clean.

1013
01:19:26,598 --> 01:19:29,045
How long has that kid
been on this boat?

1014
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,827
Seven months.

1015
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:34,224
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.

1016
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:37,569
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same of you.

1017
01:19:37,676 --> 01:19:43,046
- Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
- I don't think.

1018
01:19:43,148 --> 01:19:45,776
My orders say I'm not supposed to
know where I'm taking this boat...

1019
01:19:45,884 --> 01:19:47,365
so I don't!

1020
01:19:47,886 --> 01:19:51,638
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

1021
01:20:01,934 --> 01:20:05,768
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Luong bridge.

1022
01:20:10,075 --> 01:20:13,101
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

1023
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:17,584
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

1024
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:20,889
You just get me close
to my destination...

1025
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:23,366
and I'll cut you
and the crew loose.

1026
01:20:26,474 --> 01:20:27,904
All right, Captain.

1027
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,273
<i>"Dear Son...</i>

1028
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:54,352
<i>I'm afraid that both you and your
mother will have been worried...</i>

1029
01:20:54,453 --> 01:20:57,718
<i>at not hearing from me
during the past weeks...</i>

1030
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:01,623
<i>but my situation here
has become a difficult one.</i>

1031
01:21:01,727 --> 01:21:05,322
<i>I have been officially
accused of murder by the Army.</i>

1032
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:15,306
<i>The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.</i>

1033
01:21:15,407 --> 01:21:18,998
<i>We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.</i>

1034
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:25,608
<i>When absolute proof was completed,
we acted-- we acted like soldiers.</i>

1035
01:21:26,585 --> 01:21:29,076
<i>The charges are unjustified.</i>

1036
01:21:29,187 --> 01:21:32,918
<i>They are, in fact, and in the
circumstances of this conflict...</i>

1037
01:21:33,025 --> 01:21:35,255
<i>quite completely insane.</i>

1038
01:21:45,737 --> 01:21:50,401
<i>In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.</i>

1039
01:21:50,509 --> 01:21:53,444
<i>There are many moments
for ruthless action--</i>

1040
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:55,979
<i>what is often
called ruthless...</i>

1041
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:59,380
<i>but may in many circumstances
be only clarity--</i>

1042
01:21:59,484 --> 01:22:01,452
<i>seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it--"</i>

1043
01:22:01,553 --> 01:22:03,384
<i>- Medevac, come in.
- "directly--</i>

1044
01:22:03,488 --> 01:22:07,049
<i>- quickly, awake."
- Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha.</i>

1045
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:09,423
<i>- "Looking at it."
- Request dust-off.</i>

1046
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:11,621
<i>Three, maybe four KIA's. Over.</i>

1047
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:14,927
<i>"I trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter.</i>

1048
01:22:15,033 --> 01:22:18,161
<i>As for the charges against me,
I am unconcerned."</i>

1049
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,170
<i>Medevac, come in.</i>

1050
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:24,174
<i>"I am beyond their timid, lying
morality, and so I am beyond caring."</i>

1051
01:22:24,276 --> 01:22:26,176
<i>Medevac, do you read? Over.</i>

1052
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:29,736
<i>"You have all my faith.
Your loving father."</i>

1053
01:22:49,785 --> 01:22:50,828
Jesus.

1054
01:22:50,936 --> 01:22:53,734
No wonder I couldn't
get 'em on the radio.

1055
01:22:53,839 --> 01:22:55,739
What a dump.

1056
01:22:59,678 --> 01:23:01,669
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?

1057
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,839
Wow. That's a nice
little boat you got there.

1058
01:23:03,949 --> 01:23:06,042
Never seen one
up here before.

1059
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:09,086
You know, we called in a request
for Medevac. You guys receive it?

1060
01:23:09,187 --> 01:23:11,087
Medevac? No.

1061
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:13,555
Yeah, we passed a downed Huey
with some KIA's.

1062
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:16,822
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

1063
01:23:16,928 --> 01:23:20,022
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.

1064
01:23:20,132 --> 01:23:23,932
- Way upriver? Whoa, forget it.
- Why? Why?

1065
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:27,563
Well, we want to send
some people downriver.

1066
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:30,039
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

1067
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:33,669
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1068
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:42,007
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

1069
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:44,045
Why don't you see what
you can do with that engine?

1070
01:23:44,056 --> 01:23:46,024
- I'm gonna have a look around.
- All right.

1071
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:48,614
Hey, don't leave without me.

1072
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:12,944
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1073
01:24:13,051 --> 01:24:15,076
Don't ask me, man.

1074
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:38,204
Give my clothes back,
you asshole!

1075
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:43,860
Asshole!

1076
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,850
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1077
01:24:50,956 --> 01:24:56,053
He stepped on a land mine about two
months ago. He got blown to hell.

1078
01:24:56,161 --> 01:24:59,096
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?

1079
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:01,290
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1080
01:25:01,399 --> 01:25:04,835
Just doin' what I'm told. 
Shit, I'm just a working girl.

1081
01:25:04,936 --> 01:25:07,564
What about you, fella?

1082
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:11,164
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

1083
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:14,040
- Keep it in that condition--
- Hey get off my back. Get off my back!

1084
01:25:14,146 --> 01:25:16,785
- No, man, I'm telling you--
- Lay off!

1085
01:25:17,716 --> 01:25:21,174
Hey! Hey! Come here!

1086
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:23,914
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1087
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,616
What do you want?

1088
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:29,922
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!

1089
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,638
Get out of the rain.

1090
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:37,032
Get off me!

1091
01:25:37,135 --> 01:25:39,439
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.

1092
01:25:39,471 --> 01:25:44,067
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1093
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:47,907
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.

1094
01:25:48,013 --> 01:25:51,073
Chef, your ass is shit!

1095
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:53,184
You're a motherfucker, man.

1096
01:25:56,721 --> 01:25:59,290
What a motherfucker, man.

1097
01:26:00,358 --> 01:26:02,986
Goddamn, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1098
01:26:05,363 --> 01:26:08,992
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.

1099
01:26:10,075 --> 01:26:11,227
Hey, guys.

1100
01:26:11,336 --> 01:26:14,100
I got you!
I got your ass!

1101
01:26:14,206 --> 01:26:17,664
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

1102
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:21,803
- You pulled my fuckin'--
- Hey, guys.

1103
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:25,405
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1104
01:26:25,517 --> 01:26:29,609
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1105
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:38,486
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!

1106
01:26:38,597 --> 01:26:41,498
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?

1107
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,127
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of
barrels and get up to that big tent.

1108
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:46,724
Come on!

1109
01:26:48,406 --> 01:26:49,705
Captain.

1110
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:53,943
You're giving away our fuel
for a playmate of the month?

1111
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:57,074
Nope, playmate
of the year, Chief.

1112
01:26:57,561 --> 01:27:00,599
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!

1113
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,716
Captain, we get in a fire fight
and run out of fuel...

1114
01:27:04,823 --> 01:27:07,314
I want you to tell me
how she was.

1115
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:11,619
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1116
01:27:15,066 --> 01:27:18,467
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1117
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:24,234
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1118
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:27,393
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.

1119
01:27:47,132 --> 01:27:49,066
You know, I got a--

1120
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:51,260
I got every one
of your pictures.

1121
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,202
I got the centerfold,
the playmate's review...

1122
01:27:54,306 --> 01:27:57,002
the playmate of the year runoff.

1123
01:27:57,108 --> 01:27:59,076
I even got the calendar.

1124
01:27:59,177 --> 01:28:04,444
<i>Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?</i>

1125
01:28:04,549 --> 01:28:07,450
I used to be the bird girl
at Busch Gardens.

1126
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:10,898
- Busch Gardens?
- Yeah, I used to train birds there.

1127
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:13,656
You are--

1128
01:28:13,758 --> 01:28:16,852
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1129
01:28:16,962 --> 01:28:18,930
Is it coming?

1130
01:28:26,124 --> 01:28:29,236
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1131
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:32,092
He's not one
of my regular birds.

1132
01:28:33,211 --> 01:28:37,113
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1133
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:39,798
Being playmate of the year...

1134
01:28:40,652 --> 01:28:44,144
is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.

1135
01:28:45,357 --> 01:28:48,884
It's like--
You try to express...

1136
01:28:48,994 --> 01:28:53,829
your feelings to someone
and show them your heart...

1137
01:28:53,932 --> 01:28:55,832
Yeah, I want to hear
about your bird act.

1138
01:28:55,934 --> 01:28:57,834
I'd love to hear
about your bird act.

1139
01:28:57,936 --> 01:29:01,838
But would you mind
just puttin' this--

1140
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:06,639
Would you just mind putting
this black wig on for me, please?

1141
01:29:06,745 --> 01:29:09,475
And there's
this glass wall between you--

1142
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:12,209
this invisible glass.

1143
01:29:12,317 --> 01:29:14,945
and they can see your mouth moving.

1144
01:29:15,053 --> 01:29:17,521
I used to train birds
for at least two years...

1145
01:29:17,622 --> 01:29:19,556
- That's beautiful.
- at Busch Gardens.

1146
01:29:19,657 --> 01:29:22,922
This was cascading over your
right shoulder. This was open here.

1147
01:29:23,028 --> 01:29:26,657
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1148
01:29:26,765 --> 01:29:30,766
I used to train them to stand on their head
and fly uside down and ride little bicycles.

1149
01:29:30,802 --> 01:29:32,702
Your right hand was--

1150
01:29:32,804 --> 01:29:34,704
Hey, Chef!

1151
01:29:34,806 --> 01:29:37,798
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!

1152
01:29:37,909 --> 01:29:40,844
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 15 minutes.

1153
01:29:40,945 --> 01:29:44,972
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1154
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:48,177
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.

1155
01:29:48,286 --> 01:29:51,328
Your ass was sticking out
just a little-- Hey, man, fuck off!

1156
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,790
Fifteen minutes!

1157
01:29:53,327 --> 01:29:56,348
That's why I tried
so desperately...

1158
01:29:56,861 --> 01:30:00,319
to show somebody
that I had some talent.

1159
01:30:00,432 --> 01:30:02,400
Little baby macaws.

1160
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,367
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.

1161
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:07,700
- They're all blue--
- Come on, man, take off, would you?

1162
01:30:07,806 --> 01:30:10,969
I got my rights, man!

1163
01:30:11,076 --> 01:30:13,806
They make you do things
you don't wanna do--

1164
01:30:13,912 --> 01:30:18,241
Like...like, this picture here.

1165
01:30:20,774 --> 01:30:24,587
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1166
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:28,284
You were just kind of bending
forward. Your ass kind of out a little bit.

1167
01:30:28,393 --> 01:30:31,055
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1168
01:30:31,162 --> 01:30:34,563
That's it. That's very--
That's it. Voila.

1169
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:38,727
You're beautiful.
I just want to...

1170
01:30:38,837 --> 01:30:41,704
You know, I can't believe it.

1171
01:30:41,806 --> 01:30:46,072
Me, J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here, you know?

1172
01:30:46,177 --> 01:30:50,773
Maybe I'm unfit
to have a relationship...

1173
01:30:50,882 --> 01:30:55,751
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1174
01:30:55,854 --> 01:30:59,346
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War...

1175
01:30:59,457 --> 01:31:01,755
I never would have met you,
Miss December.

1176
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:03,384
Miss May.

1177
01:31:04,802 --> 01:31:08,296
I wish--
I wish I could find...

1178
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:11,232
just one person...

1179
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:15,738
that could share my point of view.

1180
01:31:22,892 --> 01:31:24,339
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1181
01:31:24,449 --> 01:31:26,644
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!

1182
01:31:27,652 --> 01:31:29,051
Who is that?

1183
01:31:29,154 --> 01:31:34,786
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!

1184
01:31:40,431 --> 01:31:42,527
You finished yet?

1185
01:31:42,634 --> 01:31:44,639
Holy fuck!

1186
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:47,970
Make like a bird!
Take me like a bird!

1187
01:31:48,072 --> 01:31:51,634
Fly, baby! Cockatoo me!

1188
01:31:51,697 --> 01:31:54,072
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1189
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:57,012
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1190
01:31:57,115 --> 01:31:59,309
It drives me crazy!

1191
01:32:08,459 --> 01:32:12,225
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1192
01:32:14,799 --> 01:32:19,099
Lance, there were things
that they made me do...

1193
01:32:19,204 --> 01:32:21,297
that I didn't want to do.

1194
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:25,137
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs."

1195
01:32:25,243 --> 01:32:27,677
and I didn't want to do it.

1196
01:32:27,779 --> 01:32:31,510
but they said that was
what was expected of me...

1197
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,346
that that's what people
wanted to see.

1198
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,999
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.

1199
01:33:00,111 --> 01:33:02,773
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.

1200
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,576
- Didn't know you never got no pussy.
- Shove it, fuck-up.

1201
01:33:05,683 --> 01:33:08,911
Sure, sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd have taken you to New Orleans.

1202
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:11,541
- Man, fuck you.
- Introduce you to cooze, Bubba!

1203
01:33:11,584 --> 01:33:14,649
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.

1204
01:33:14,759 --> 01:33:17,023
You're a fuckin' dog!

1205
01:33:17,128 --> 01:33:20,393
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.

1206
01:33:20,498 --> 01:33:22,398
Lay off, Chef.

1207
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,400
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.

1208
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:26,496
And if I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.

1209
01:33:26,504 --> 01:33:27,477
Lay off, Chef!

1210
01:33:27,505 --> 01:33:30,065
What are you gonna
do with it, cherry boy?

1211
01:33:30,174 --> 01:33:31,539
Chef, I said lay off!

1212
01:33:31,643 --> 01:33:36,080
Chef, knock it off! Give him
a break! What do you think I said?

1213
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,114
Then give your jaws a rest!

1214
01:33:38,216 --> 01:33:42,243
And this ain't the Army.
You are a sailor!

1215
01:33:42,623 --> 01:33:44,583
So get out of that
frizzly Army-looking shirt...

1216
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:46,749
and stop smoking that dope!

1217
01:33:47,105 --> 01:33:48,010
You hear me?

1218
01:33:52,463 --> 01:33:55,125
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1219
01:33:55,233 --> 01:33:57,599
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1220
01:33:57,702 --> 01:33:59,727
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1221
01:33:59,837 --> 01:34:03,273
I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1222
01:34:20,491 --> 01:34:24,393
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1223
01:34:24,495 --> 01:34:26,929
Let's take a look. Lance.

1224
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:31,525
Bring them in.
Clean, on the .60. Chef, get a 16.

1225
01:34:31,636 --> 01:34:34,298
Clean, get on that .60!

1226
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,940
What's up, Chief?

1227
01:34:39,445 --> 01:34:41,879
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1228
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,314
Well, let's forget routine now
and let 'em go.

1229
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:48,317
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1230
01:34:48,419 --> 01:34:50,853
I'm gonna take a look.

1231
01:34:50,955 --> 01:34:52,573
Cheif, my mission's got priority here.

1232
01:34:52,616 --> 01:34:55,857
Hell, you wouldn't even be in this part
of the river if it wasn't for me.

1233
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,487
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1234
01:35:00,047 --> 01:35:03,294
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

1235
01:35:03,401 --> 01:35:06,336
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1236
01:35:19,484 --> 01:35:22,885
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1237
01:35:28,726 --> 01:35:32,059
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker! Moe it!

1238
01:35:33,731 --> 01:35:34,959
<i>Can couc, you too.</i>

1239
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:37,364
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.

1240
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,442
It's clear, Chief.

1241
01:35:48,746 --> 01:35:52,910
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1242
01:35:53,017 --> 01:35:55,679
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.

1243
01:35:55,787 --> 01:35:57,721
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.

1244
01:35:57,822 --> 01:36:01,053
Just some baskets and
some ducks, fuckin' bananas.

1245
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:02,990
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?

1246
01:36:03,094 --> 01:36:06,894
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.

1247
01:36:06,998 --> 01:36:08,898
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables--

1248
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,900
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!

1249
01:36:11,002 --> 01:36:12,526
- Get on it!
- All right!

1250
01:36:12,637 --> 01:36:15,936
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!

1251
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,304
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!

1252
01:36:18,409 --> 01:36:20,900
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1253
01:36:21,012 --> 01:36:23,446
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!

1254
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:28,611
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.

1255
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,914
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!

1256
01:36:31,022 --> 01:36:32,922
Come on!

1257
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,083
Check that vegetable basket!

1258
01:36:35,193 --> 01:36:37,093
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1259
01:36:37,195 --> 01:36:40,255
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1260
01:36:40,364 --> 01:36:42,127
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!

1261
01:36:42,233 --> 01:36:45,031
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!

1262
01:36:45,136 --> 01:36:48,299
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1263
01:36:51,642 --> 01:36:54,076
Chef!

1264
01:36:57,081 --> 01:37:00,312
Motherfuckers!

1265
01:37:02,653 --> 01:37:05,417
Motherfuckers!

1266
01:37:07,325 --> 01:37:10,817
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.

1267
01:37:10,927 --> 01:37:13,425
- Fucking cocksucking mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1268
01:37:13,443 --> 01:37:16,143
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of 'em.

1269
01:37:16,634 --> 01:37:19,899
- Chef, hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1270
01:37:20,004 --> 01:37:22,963
Why the fuck not?

1271
01:37:23,908 --> 01:37:26,323
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1272
01:37:33,918 --> 01:37:36,011
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1273
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,782
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding, huh?

1274
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:42,053
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?

1275
01:37:44,662 --> 01:37:46,653
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1276
01:37:46,764 --> 01:37:49,003
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1277
01:37:49,734 --> 01:37:52,032
Give me that dog!

1278
01:37:52,136 --> 01:37:54,070
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

1279
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:57,436
- Fckig give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!

1280
01:37:57,542 --> 01:38:00,636
Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too!

1281
01:38:00,745 --> 01:38:02,076
- Chef--
- You want that?

1282
01:38:02,179 --> 01:38:05,876
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1283
01:38:05,983 --> 01:38:08,713
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1284
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:12,311
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddamn it!

1285
01:38:12,423 --> 01:38:15,620
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.

1286
01:38:15,726 --> 01:38:17,717
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!

1287
01:38:17,828 --> 01:38:21,127
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.

1288
01:38:21,232 --> 01:38:23,132
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing, Chef?

1289
01:38:23,234 --> 01:38:27,364
- She's hurt. She's bleedin'.
- Man.

1290
01:38:27,471 --> 01:38:29,871
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1291
01:38:29,974 --> 01:38:32,807
- What are you talking about?
- We're taking her to some friendlies, Captain.

1292
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,879
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.

1293
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:38,172
The book says, Captain...

1294
01:38:48,025 --> 01:38:51,290
Fuck you. Fuck 'im.

1295
01:38:51,395 --> 01:38:53,329
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1296
01:39:54,112 --> 01:39:57,168
<i>It was a way we had over here
of living with ourselves.</i>

1297
01:39:58,712 --> 01:40:01,474
<i>We'd cut 'em in half with a
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.</i>

1298
01:40:04,112 --> 01:40:05,938
<i>It was a lie.</i>

1299
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,107
<i>And the more I saw of them...</i>

1300
01:40:09,215 --> 01:40:11,445
<i>the more I hated lies.</i>

1301
01:40:13,353 --> 01:40:16,982
<i>Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again...</i>

1302
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:22,687
<i>but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier.</i>

1303
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:32,095
<i>Do Lung bridge was the last
Army outpost on the Nung River.</i>

1304
01:40:36,509 --> 01:40:38,807
<i>Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz.</i>

1305
01:40:41,312 --> 01:40:42,468
Lance, hey Lance.

1306
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:46,050
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

1307
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,479
Huh? What's the matter with you?

1308
01:40:49,589 --> 01:40:51,687
You're acting kind of weird.

1309
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:55,308
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1310
01:40:55,497 --> 01:40:56,268
Yeah.

1311
01:40:56,496 --> 01:40:59,488
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?

1312
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:00,605
Far out.

1313
01:41:03,136 --> 01:41:06,367
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!

1314
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:13,308
Take me home!

1315
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:15,313
Goddamn it!

1316
01:41:15,415 --> 01:41:18,543
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?

1317
01:41:18,651 --> 01:41:20,551
Don't keep goin'!

1318
01:41:22,956 --> 01:41:25,151
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!

1319
01:41:25,258 --> 01:41:27,385
Fuck you!

1320
01:41:27,494 --> 01:41:29,553
You'll get what you deserve!

1321
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:40,206
Is there a Captain Willard
on board?

1322
01:41:40,269 --> 01:41:41,807
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?

1323
01:41:41,908 --> 01:41:45,275
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1324
01:41:45,378 --> 01:41:48,074
Get that light off me!

1325
01:41:48,181 --> 01:41:51,150
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1326
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:54,709
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1327
01:41:54,821 --> 01:41:57,187
- Don't know how happy this makes me, sir.
- Why?

1328
01:41:57,290 --> 01:41:59,918
Now I can get out of here,
if I can find a way.

1329
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:07,420
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain!

1330
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:13,302
Captain, where you going?

1331
01:42:13,406 --> 01:42:17,172
See if I can find some fuel
and get some information.

1332
01:42:17,277 --> 01:42:19,404
Pick me up at the other side
of the bridge.

1333
01:42:19,512 --> 01:42:21,537
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1334
01:42:21,648 --> 01:42:23,513
I'll go.

1335
01:42:23,616 --> 01:42:25,208
I wanna go.

1336
01:43:17,704 --> 01:43:20,195
Man, listen to the music, man.

1337
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:22,206
Where can I find the CO?

1338
01:43:22,308 --> 01:43:24,208
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1339
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:25,967
Lance!

1340
01:43:26,512 --> 01:43:28,265
Get down here!

1341
01:43:30,216 --> 01:43:33,379
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1342
01:43:33,486 --> 01:43:36,114
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1343
01:43:36,222 --> 01:43:40,784
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!

1344
01:43:40,893 --> 01:43:44,090
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1345
01:44:18,798 --> 01:44:21,790
- Goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.

1346
01:44:21,901 --> 01:44:24,131
Well, you thought wrong, damn it!

1347
01:44:27,507 --> 01:44:29,702
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1348
01:44:29,809 --> 01:44:31,436
You think you're so bad,
huh, nigga?

1349
01:44:31,544 --> 01:44:33,569
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1350
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,739
Gooks! What the fuck
ya think I'm shootin' at?

1351
01:44:35,848 --> 01:44:38,684
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks
out there by the wire.

1352
01:44:38,718 --> 01:44:40,413
But I think I killed them all.

1353
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,613
You ain't shot shit, man. Listen!

1354
01:44:44,257 --> 01:44:47,283
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends, man. Send up a flare.

1355
01:44:55,702 --> 01:44:58,154
Think you so bad, huh, nigger?
You think you bad, huh?

1356
01:44:58,185 --> 01:44:59,584
They're all dead, stupid.

1357
01:44:59,605 --> 01:45:02,665
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1358
01:45:02,775 --> 01:45:04,604
Who's the commanding
officer here?

1359
01:45:05,445 --> 01:45:07,076
Ain't you?

1360
01:45:09,082 --> 01:45:10,640
You think you so bad, huh?

1361
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:15,210
I got something for your ass now,
nigga! I got something for you now!

1362
01:45:16,989 --> 01:45:19,048
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1363
01:45:20,426 --> 01:45:22,621
Go get the Roach, man.

1364
01:45:22,729 --> 01:45:26,324
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.

1365
01:45:30,737 --> 01:45:33,069
Roach. Roach.

1366
01:45:35,675 --> 01:45:37,643
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?

1367
01:45:37,906 --> 01:45:40,136
- Lance!
- Do you hear 'em?

1368
01:45:42,448 --> 01:45:45,076
Fuck you, GI!

1369
01:45:45,184 --> 01:45:46,742
We'll bust 'em!

1370
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:52,151
Hey, GI, fuck you!

1371
01:45:56,262 --> 01:45:57,991
Fuck you, GI!

1372
01:45:59,098 --> 01:46:01,658
Fuck you, GI!

1373
01:46:01,768 --> 01:46:03,929
Hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1374
01:46:05,232 --> 01:46:06,003
Yeah.

1375
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:10,291
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?

1376
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,638
No.

1377
01:46:14,213 --> 01:46:18,115
He's close, man.
He's real close.

1378
01:46:25,691 --> 01:46:29,183
Fuck you, GI!
I kill you!

1379
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:35,566
Fuck you, GI!

1380
01:46:40,406 --> 01:46:42,374
GI, fuck you!

1381
01:46:44,577 --> 01:46:47,273
GI! GI, fuck you!

1382
01:46:52,919 --> 01:46:54,250
Motherfucker.

1383
01:46:55,354 --> 01:46:56,912
Hey, soldier.

1384
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,225
Do you know who's
in command here?

1385
01:47:06,478 --> 01:47:07,577
Yeah.

1386
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:24,510
Shit!

1387
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:31,523
Yo, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1388
01:47:31,624 --> 01:47:34,422
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1389
01:47:38,464 --> 01:47:40,329
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.

1390
01:47:40,433 --> 01:47:42,958
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.

1391
01:47:45,204 --> 01:47:47,968
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1392
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:49,735
Let's move out.

1393
01:47:49,842 --> 01:47:53,573
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1394
01:47:55,648 --> 01:47:57,912
Let's just get goin'.

1395
01:47:58,017 --> 01:47:59,917
Which way, Captain?

1396
01:48:05,591 --> 01:48:08,355
You know which way, Chief.

1397
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:11,191
You're on your own, Captain.

1398
01:48:11,297 --> 01:48:12,696
Still wanna go on?

1399
01:48:12,798 --> 01:48:14,390
It's like this bridge.

1400
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,628
We build it every night, Charlie
blows it right back up again...

1401
01:48:17,737 --> 01:48:20,228
just so the Generals
can say the road's open.

1402
01:48:20,908 --> 01:48:22,289
Think about it.

1403
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:28,342
- Who cares?
- Just get us upriver!

1404
01:48:32,618 --> 01:48:34,882
Chef, on the bow.

1405
01:48:36,122 --> 01:48:38,249
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1406
01:49:30,242 --> 01:49:34,576
You got one, Miller.
Geez, I got some too.

1407
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,238
Whose package is that?

1408
01:49:36,349 --> 01:49:39,648
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.

1409
01:49:39,752 --> 01:49:42,380
- Is that it? - That's it for you. Lance!

1410
01:49:43,222 --> 01:49:46,988
Mr. L.B. Johnson, there you go.

1411
01:49:47,093 --> 01:49:50,585
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.

1412
01:49:50,696 --> 01:49:53,995
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1413
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,534
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine, Lance.

1414
01:49:56,636 --> 01:50:00,197
Sue and I went tripping to Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1415
01:50:00,306 --> 01:50:02,672
Man, I wanna get back
to Antoine's.

1416
01:50:02,775 --> 01:50:07,075
"I remember the time we went up to--"
How could I fucking forget, man? Beautiful.

1417
01:50:07,179 --> 01:50:09,909
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1418
01:50:10,016 --> 01:50:11,210
Let me know."

1419
01:50:11,317 --> 01:50:14,650
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.

1420
01:50:19,191 --> 01:50:21,751
<i>"There has been a new development
regarding your mission...</i>

1421
01:50:21,861 --> 01:50:24,193
<i>which we must now
communicate to you.</i>

1422
01:50:24,296 --> 01:50:27,732
<i>Months ago, a man was ordered on
a mission which was identical to yours.</i>

1423
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:32,264
<i>We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Col. Kurtz.</i>

1424
01:50:33,973 --> 01:50:37,465
<i>Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake...</i>

1425
01:50:37,576 --> 01:50:40,010
<i>but they assumed he was dead.</i>

1426
01:50:40,112 --> 01:50:44,105
<i>Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife."</i>

1427
01:50:47,553 --> 01:50:49,453
<i>Captain Richard Colby.</i>

1428
01:50:51,624 --> 01:50:54,058
<i>He was with Kurtz.</i>

1429
01:50:54,864 --> 01:50:56,651
Disneyland.

1430
01:50:56,762 --> 01:50:59,322
Fuck, man, this is better
than Disneyland.

1431
01:50:59,432 --> 01:51:03,602
"Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home...

1432
01:51:03,652 --> 01:51:05,994
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1433
01:51:06,105 --> 01:51:08,539
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1434
01:51:08,641 --> 01:51:11,872
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1435
01:51:11,977 --> 01:51:15,242
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.

1436
01:51:15,347 --> 01:51:18,714
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1437
01:51:18,818 --> 01:51:21,582
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.

1438
01:51:21,687 --> 01:51:25,054
She pictures me at home
having a beer watching TV.

1439
01:51:26,492 --> 01:51:27,789
Hey, Lance, man.

1440
01:51:27,893 --> 01:51:30,225
Oh, hot potato, hot potato.

1441
01:51:30,329 --> 01:51:33,196
<i>I'm so glad you decided
to join the navy.</i>

1442
01:51:33,299 --> 01:51:36,632
Eva's not sure she can have
a relationship with me, you know?

1443
01:51:36,735 --> 01:51:39,465
Here I am,
13,000 fucking miles away...

1444
01:51:39,572 --> 01:51:42,666
trying to keep a relationship
with my ass.

1445
01:51:42,775 --> 01:51:46,506
<i>That's much more than I can say
for some of your friends.</i>

1446
01:51:46,612 --> 01:51:49,942
<i>If this tape is any good,
I will have Dad and the family...</i>

1447
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:53,189
<i>send you a tape of their own.</i>
- Hey, Lance.

1448
01:52:05,297 --> 01:52:06,662
Fuckers!

1449
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:14,232
There! Over there!

1450
01:52:16,075 --> 01:52:17,975
Motherfuckers!

1451
01:52:28,687 --> 01:52:30,587
There. Over there!

1452
01:52:34,036 --> 01:52:35,798
Lance! Chef!

1453
01:52:39,832 --> 01:52:43,893
- Chef, Chef, check out Clean!
- Captain, he's hit, he's hit! Clean's hit.

1454
01:52:44,769 --> 01:52:46,301
Where'd the dog go?

1455
01:52:46,405 --> 01:52:49,499
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.

1456
01:52:49,608 --> 01:52:53,237
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.

1457
01:52:53,345 --> 01:52:56,508
- Hey, Clean. Hey.
- <i>It's always been nic to have...</i>

1458
01:52:56,614 --> 01:52:58,980
Hey, bubba.

1459
01:52:59,084 --> 01:53:01,075
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1460
01:53:02,988 --> 01:53:04,546
- <i>And so I'm hoping...</i>
- Hey, bubba.

1461
01:53:04,657 --> 01:53:09,959
<i>And so I'm hoping that--
pretty soon-- not too soon--</i>

1462
01:53:10,062 --> 01:53:14,499
<i>but pretty soon I'll have a lot
of grandchildren to love and spoil.</i>

1463
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:18,263
<i>And then when your wife get 'em back,
she'll be mad with me.</i>

1464
01:53:20,506 --> 01:53:22,838
<i>Even Aunt Jessie and Mama...</i>

1465
01:53:22,942 --> 01:53:26,241
<i>will come to celebrate
your coming home.</i>

1466
01:53:26,345 --> 01:53:29,872
<i>Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car...</i>

1467
01:53:29,982 --> 01:53:34,578
<i>but don't tell 'em
because that's our secret.</i>

1468
01:53:34,687 --> 01:53:37,417
<i>Anyhow, do the right thing...</i>

1469
01:53:37,523 --> 01:53:39,889
<i>stay out of the way
of the bullets...</i>

1470
01:53:39,992 --> 01:53:44,088
<i>and bring your heinie home
all in one piece...</i>

1471
01:53:44,196 --> 01:53:46,460
<i>because we love you
very much.</i>

1472
01:53:46,565 --> 01:53:48,465
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1473
01:55:22,394 --> 01:55:24,055
Hold on.

1474
01:55:26,432 --> 01:55:28,332
Throw me the glasses.

1475
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:43,241
Lance, take a 16 on the bow.

1476
01:55:45,951 --> 01:55:49,580
Chef. Chef.
On the .60.

1477
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:12,868
Fuck me.

1478
01:57:21,914 --> 01:57:23,641
Cover the captain.

1479
01:57:24,483 --> 01:57:26,383
Lance! Cover the captain.

1480
01:57:43,669 --> 01:57:45,296
They're French. They're French.

1481
01:57:47,739 --> 01:57:50,503
Chef, pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1482
01:57:50,609 --> 01:57:52,167
Stand fast! Captain.

1483
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:29,539
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.

1484
01:59:24,469 --> 01:59:26,644
We lost one of our men.

1485
01:59:30,108 --> 01:59:34,204
We French always pay respect
to the dead of our allies.

1486
01:59:37,082 --> 01:59:38,982
You're all welcome.

1487
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:43,611
My name is Hubert De Marais.

1488
01:59:45,257 --> 01:59:48,124
This is my family's plantation.

1489
01:59:48,227 --> 01:59:51,287
It has been such for 70 years.

1490
01:59:52,397 --> 01:59:55,730
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1491
02:02:07,265 --> 02:02:10,757
Captain, accept the flag
of Tyrone Miller...

1492
02:02:10,869 --> 02:02:13,360
on behalf of
a grateful nation.

1493
02:02:33,492 --> 02:02:36,359
This food is really wonderful,
isn't it? The wine, the sauces.

1494
02:02:36,461 --> 02:02:39,988
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?

1495
02:02:40,098 --> 02:02:42,328
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

1496
02:02:42,434 --> 02:02:46,200
No kidding? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1497
02:02:46,304 --> 02:02:49,364
Hey, Lance,
the chef's a slope.

1498
02:02:51,553 --> 02:02:52,884
Hey, Lance.

1499
02:03:21,706 --> 02:03:25,369
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.

1500
02:03:25,477 --> 02:03:29,345
But they need it, 'cause
life sometimes is very cruel.

1501
02:03:30,449 --> 02:03:32,349
As you can see...

1502
02:03:36,087 --> 02:03:38,214
Attack repels by the family.

1503
02:03:38,323 --> 02:03:40,348
Just for this war.

1504
02:03:40,459 --> 02:03:44,896
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 12.

1505
02:03:44,996 --> 02:03:48,124
South Vietnamese, 11.

1506
02:03:48,233 --> 02:03:50,167
Americans, six?

1507
02:03:51,503 --> 02:03:54,870
Yes. Well, there were
perhaps mistakes.

1508
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,422
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.

1509
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:20,691
Madame Sarrault.

1510
02:04:20,799 --> 02:04:22,198
Captain.

1511
02:04:48,894 --> 02:04:51,124
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story...

1512
02:04:51,229 --> 02:04:53,595
about Paris and people
starving during the war.

1513
02:04:53,698 --> 02:04:56,394
They are all around the table, and
there was a silence and somebody say...

1514
02:04:56,501 --> 02:04:58,526
"An angel is passing by."

1515
02:04:58,637 --> 02:05:01,902
So somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1516
02:05:02,007 --> 02:05:03,338
Oh.

1517
02:05:09,381 --> 02:05:12,678
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1518
02:05:12,784 --> 02:05:15,412
We stay forever.

1519
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,420
No, no. I mean...

1520
02:05:18,657 --> 02:05:20,648
why don't you go
back home to France?

1521
02:05:21,693 --> 02:05:25,652
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1522
02:05:25,764 --> 02:05:28,384
- Sooner or later, you're...
- No!

1523
02:05:30,168 --> 02:05:32,295
You don't understand
our mentality--

1524
02:05:32,404 --> 02:05:34,804
the French officer mentality!

1525
02:05:34,906 --> 02:05:37,136
At first, we lose
in Second World War.

1526
02:05:37,242 --> 02:05:40,268
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1527
02:05:40,378 --> 02:05:41,402
Oh, Papa--

1528
02:05:42,514 --> 02:05:45,347
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.

1529
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:47,850
In Indochina, we lose!

1530
02:05:47,953 --> 02:05:50,683
But here we don't lose!

1531
02:05:50,789 --> 02:05:53,781
This piece of earth, we keep it!

1532
02:05:53,892 --> 02:05:55,792
We will never lose it.
Never!

1533
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:03,431
You Americans.

1534
02:06:04,869 --> 02:06:09,306
In 1945, yeah...

1535
02:06:09,407 --> 02:06:13,935
after the Japanese war,
your President Roosevelt...

1536
02:06:14,045 --> 02:06:17,276
didn't want the French people
to stay in Indochina.

1537
02:06:18,917 --> 02:06:20,885
So...

1538
02:06:20,986 --> 02:06:23,955
you Americans invent
the Viet Minh.

1539
02:06:25,657 --> 02:06:26,885
What's he mean?

1540
02:06:26,992 --> 02:06:30,428
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong
were invented by the Americans, sir.

1541
02:06:31,563 --> 02:06:32,791
The Americans?

1542
02:06:33,665 --> 02:06:36,156
And now you take
the French place...

1543
02:06:36,267 --> 02:06:38,428
and the Viet Minh fight you.

1544
02:06:38,536 --> 02:06:40,436
And what can you do?

1545
02:06:40,538 --> 02:06:42,870
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1546
02:06:42,974 --> 02:06:46,535
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1547
02:06:46,645 --> 02:06:50,376
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.

1548
02:06:50,482 --> 02:06:54,316
We are all Communists. Chinese,
give us guns. We are all brothers."

1549
02:06:54,419 --> 02:06:56,353
They hate the Chinese!

1550
02:06:56,454 --> 02:07:01,323
Maybe they hate the American
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1551
02:07:01,426 --> 02:07:03,656
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are Communists...

1552
02:07:03,762 --> 02:07:05,662
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1553
02:07:05,764 --> 02:07:08,358
And this is something that you
never understood, you American.

1554
02:07:08,466 --> 02:07:10,366
I don't know.

1555
02:07:10,468 --> 02:07:13,960
Maybe in the future we can make
something with the Viet Minh.

1556
02:07:14,072 --> 02:07:16,199
Don't you understand?

1557
02:07:16,307 --> 02:07:19,105
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."

1558
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:21,735
That's finish for all
the white people in Indochina.

1559
02:07:21,846 --> 02:07:25,111
If you're French, American,
that's all the same.

1560
02:07:25,216 --> 02:07:28,777
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look at them.

1561
02:07:31,156 --> 02:07:34,216
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.

1562
02:07:36,661 --> 02:07:38,364
The white left...

1563
02:07:39,664 --> 02:07:42,758
but the yellow stays!

1564
02:07:49,941 --> 02:07:53,809
When I was in Saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.

1565
02:07:53,912 --> 02:07:56,904
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.

1566
02:07:57,015 --> 02:08:00,178
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.

1567
02:08:00,285 --> 02:08:02,879
Tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines...

1568
02:08:02,987 --> 02:08:05,649
then maybe Europe."

1569
02:08:05,757 --> 02:08:08,817
Come on. Why not Europe?

1570
02:08:08,927 --> 02:08:11,225
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently.

1571
02:08:11,329 --> 02:08:14,924
Even before Second World War Americans
knew exactly what was going on.

1572
02:08:15,033 --> 02:08:18,696
They don't want
that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1573
02:08:20,305 --> 02:08:22,466
All you white people are shit.

1574
02:08:22,574 --> 02:08:25,042
They are fighting--
fighting for freedom.

1575
02:08:25,143 --> 02:08:27,407
Freedom? Bullshit.

1576
02:08:27,512 --> 02:08:30,345
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1577
02:08:30,448 --> 02:08:32,814
Dien Bien Phu,
that serious.

1578
02:08:32,917 --> 02:08:36,785
All soldiers know
they are already dead.

1579
02:08:37,989 --> 02:08:40,082
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1580
02:08:43,261 --> 02:08:45,161
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1581
02:08:46,431 --> 02:08:49,161
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.

1582
02:08:49,267 --> 02:08:50,529
A military mistake.

1583
02:08:50,635 --> 02:08:52,967
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!

1584
02:08:53,071 --> 02:08:54,698
Voluntary!

1585
02:08:56,808 --> 02:09:00,710
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1586
02:09:00,812 --> 02:09:03,940
The Generals and the Colonels believe
it's impossible for the Viets...

1587
02:09:04,048 --> 02:09:06,744
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains.

1588
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:11,083
But they do. Then they wait
for the rain to come.

1589
02:09:12,624 --> 02:09:17,288
When it comes,
no airplane can fly there.

1590
02:09:17,395 --> 02:09:19,727
And our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters.

1591
02:09:19,831 --> 02:09:22,925
I mean, you know,
90 meters-- 70 meters.

1592
02:09:23,034 --> 02:09:25,696
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1593
02:09:25,804 --> 02:09:29,501
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1594
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,394
No! No!

1595
02:09:36,247 --> 02:09:38,442
The French Army was sacrificed.

1596
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:41,041
Sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home.

1597
02:09:41,152 --> 02:09:43,950
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1598
02:09:44,926 --> 02:09:46,785
The students are
marching in Paris...

1599
02:09:47,261 --> 02:09:48,791
protesting, demonstrating.

1600
02:09:48,893 --> 02:09:51,157
They stab the soldiers
in their back.

1601
02:09:51,262 --> 02:09:54,993
The soldier would open
the grenade, it wouldn't work.

1602
02:09:55,099 --> 02:09:59,195
A piece of paper would fall--

1603
02:09:59,304 --> 02:10:02,501
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."

1604
02:10:02,607 --> 02:10:06,270
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.

1605
02:10:08,146 --> 02:10:10,706
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1606
02:10:10,815 --> 02:10:14,717
The French is shit, huh?

1607
02:10:14,819 --> 02:10:17,083
No one care.
No one want--

1608
02:10:19,724 --> 02:10:22,921
Why don't you Americans
learn from us, from our mistakes?

1609
02:10:23,027 --> 02:10:25,002
<i>Mon Dieux, with your army,
your strength...</i>

1610
02:10:25,029 --> 02:10:27,293
your power, you could win
if you want to!

1611
02:10:30,143 --> 02:10:31,964
You can win.

1612
02:10:35,373 --> 02:10:38,774
You know, I'm sure
we can make something here.

1613
02:10:38,877 --> 02:10:40,777
I'm sure about it,
you know?

1614
02:10:40,879 --> 02:10:44,315
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1615
02:10:44,415 --> 02:10:47,299
That's right, but the Communist
at home have never been traitors.

1616
02:11:12,577 --> 02:11:15,239
- Communist!
- Socialist!

1617
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:23,232
Excuse me, I have to go.

1618
02:11:23,388 --> 02:11:26,846
Capitain, good night.
I was a Socialist, you know.

1619
02:11:26,958 --> 02:11:31,088
We can stay. I know
that we can stay. We can.

1620
02:11:34,632 --> 02:11:38,033
You know, we always
helped the people.

1621
02:11:38,136 --> 02:11:40,036
We work with the people.

1622
02:11:41,139 --> 02:11:44,370
So we can be friends,
we are agreed.

1623
02:11:56,454 --> 02:12:00,356
See, Captain,
when my grandfather...

1624
02:12:02,126 --> 02:12:05,027
and my uncle's father
came here...

1625
02:12:06,998 --> 02:12:09,626
there was nothing--
nothing.

1626
02:12:10,735 --> 02:12:13,431
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1627
02:12:15,173 --> 02:12:17,539
So we worked hard...

1628
02:12:17,642 --> 02:12:19,576
very hard, and brought...

1629
02:12:19,677 --> 02:12:23,272
the rubber from Brazil,
and then plant it here.

1630
02:12:24,449 --> 02:12:27,577
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them...

1631
02:12:28,486 --> 02:12:30,351
make something--

1632
02:12:30,455 --> 02:12:33,185
something out of nothing.

1633
02:12:34,213 --> 02:12:37,728
So when you ask me why
we want to stay here, Captain...

1634
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:43,426
we want to stay here because
it's ours-- it belongs to us.

1635
02:12:43,534 --> 02:12:45,757
It keeps our family together.

1636
02:12:47,338 --> 02:12:49,238
I mean, we fight for that.

1637
02:12:51,342 --> 02:12:55,676
While you Americans,
you are fighting for...

1638
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:59,739
the biggest nothing in history.

1639
02:13:06,958 --> 02:13:11,827
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see
if your men need any help to...

1640
02:13:11,929 --> 02:13:14,022
repair your boat...

1641
02:13:14,132 --> 02:13:17,158
so that you can go on
with your war.

1642
02:13:52,837 --> 02:13:55,738
I apologize
for my family, Captain.

1643
02:13:57,308 --> 02:13:59,606
We have all lost much here.

1644
02:14:00,845 --> 02:14:03,643
Hubert-- his wife
and two sons.

1645
02:14:08,519 --> 02:14:10,749
And I have lost a husband.

1646
02:14:16,594 --> 02:14:18,357
I understand.

1647
02:14:18,463 --> 02:14:20,988
You are tired of the war.

1648
02:14:22,667 --> 02:14:25,227
I can see it in your face.

1649
02:14:27,238 --> 02:14:31,299
'Twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1650
02:14:32,777 --> 02:14:36,474
<i>We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus--"</i>

1651
02:14:36,581 --> 02:14:38,811
"The Lost Soldiers."

1652
02:14:43,521 --> 02:14:46,046
If you like,
we can have some cognac.

1653
02:14:51,004 --> 02:14:51,775
No.

1654
02:14:53,231 --> 02:14:56,325
I have to--
to see about my men and--

1655
02:15:03,574 --> 02:15:06,475
The war will be
still here tomorrow.

1656
02:15:16,721 --> 02:15:18,951
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1657
02:15:26,998 --> 02:15:29,728
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1658
02:15:30,835 --> 02:15:33,929
No, I don't drink wine.

1659
02:15:36,974 --> 02:15:41,070
I do like cognac, but I don't want
any now, thank you.

1660
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:43,958
Well...

1661
02:15:44,916 --> 02:15:47,976
then I--
I must drink alone, then.

1662
02:15:58,229 --> 02:16:01,426
Will you go back
after the war, to America?

1663
02:16:05,962 --> 02:16:06,733
No.

1664
02:16:06,987 --> 02:16:10,829
Then you're like us--
your home is here.

1665
02:16:27,992 --> 02:16:31,894
Do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice?

1666
02:16:34,131 --> 02:16:37,692
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1667
02:16:38,836 --> 02:16:42,704
I used to prepare
a pipe for my husband.

1668
02:16:49,113 --> 02:16:53,413
'Twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1669
02:16:57,035 --> 02:17:00,918
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1670
02:17:04,562 --> 02:17:08,521
And I said to him,
"There are two of you.

1671
02:17:08,633 --> 02:17:11,261
Don't you see?

1672
02:17:11,369 --> 02:17:15,271
One that kills
and one that loves."

1673
02:17:17,208 --> 02:17:19,403
And he said to me...

1674
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:24,243
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

1675
02:17:26,751 --> 02:17:28,651
But you are both.

1676
02:18:10,628 --> 02:18:12,528
You want more?

1677
02:18:17,935 --> 02:18:21,666
All that matters
is that you are alive.

1678
02:18:23,374 --> 02:18:26,138
You are alive, Captain.

1679
02:18:29,714 --> 02:18:31,944
That's the truth.

1680
02:19:45,055 --> 02:19:47,888
There are two of you,
don't you see?

1681
02:19:49,927 --> 02:19:52,418
One that kills...

1682
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:54,896
and one that loves.

1683
02:20:23,427 --> 02:20:26,328
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

1684
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:28,990
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1685
02:20:29,099 --> 02:20:32,591
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1686
02:20:32,703 --> 02:20:34,603
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

1687
02:20:34,705 --> 02:20:37,435
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.

1688
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:41,110
You see anything, Chef?

1689
02:20:43,481 --> 02:20:46,211
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1690
02:21:04,735 --> 02:21:06,862
Watch it over here, Chief.

1691
02:21:08,125 --> 02:21:10,093
Got a stump.

1692
02:21:12,676 --> 02:21:14,371
Lance, on the fifties.

1693
02:21:14,478 --> 02:21:16,878
<i>He was close.</i>

1694
02:21:18,315 --> 02:21:20,476
<i>He was real close.</i>

1695
02:21:22,266 --> 02:21:25,043
<i>I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him...</i>

1696
02:21:25,155 --> 02:21:27,123
<i>as if the boat were being
sucked upriver...</i>

1697
02:21:27,224 --> 02:21:30,057
<i>and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.</i>

1698
02:21:32,596 --> 02:21:34,496
<i>Whatever was going to happen...</i>

1699
02:21:34,598 --> 02:21:38,500
<i>it wasn't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.</i>

1700
02:21:43,607 --> 02:21:45,973
- Arrows!
- Fire!

1701
02:21:48,312 --> 02:21:51,179
Chef, open up! Fire!

1702
02:21:54,741 --> 02:21:56,922
Lance, fire!

1703
02:22:04,395 --> 02:22:08,354
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1704
02:22:08,465 --> 02:22:12,128
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

1705
02:22:12,236 --> 02:22:15,205
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1706
02:22:15,306 --> 02:22:17,866
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1707
02:22:17,975 --> 02:22:19,966
Quiet!

1708
02:22:20,077 --> 02:22:22,978
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

1709
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:25,548
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

1710
02:22:25,649 --> 02:22:27,776
Do ya?

1711
02:22:27,885 --> 02:22:31,048
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1712
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:34,854
Lance, get the wheel!

1713
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:39,191
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

1714
02:22:59,483 --> 02:23:01,041
A spear?

1715
02:24:20,597 --> 02:24:23,760
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1716
02:24:23,867 --> 02:24:26,802
There's a Green Beret Colonel
up there who's gone insane...

1717
02:24:26,904 --> 02:24:28,303
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1718
02:24:29,773 --> 02:24:32,708
That's fucking typical!
Shit!

1719
02:24:32,810 --> 02:24:35,074
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1720
02:24:35,179 --> 02:24:38,876
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1721
02:24:38,982 --> 02:24:42,679
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1722
02:24:43,953 --> 02:24:46,950
Shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

1723
02:24:47,057 --> 02:24:50,026
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

1724
02:24:50,127 --> 02:24:53,426
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

1725
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:55,998
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1726
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:59,467
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1727
02:24:59,570 --> 02:25:03,973
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

1728
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,531
<i>Part of me was afraid
of what I would find...</i>

1729
02:26:12,643 --> 02:26:15,043
<i>and what I would do
when I got there.</i>

1730
02:26:17,014 --> 02:26:19,847
<i>I knew the risks...</i>

1731
02:26:19,950 --> 02:26:22,248
<i>or imagined I knew.</i>

1732
02:26:24,188 --> 02:26:26,748
<i>But the thing
I felt the most...</i>

1733
02:26:26,857 --> 02:26:29,951
<i>much stronger than fear...</i>

1734
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:32,790
<i>was the desire to confront him.</i>

1735
02:27:44,601 --> 02:27:46,660
Just keep movin'.

1736
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:50,900
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1737
02:29:17,694 --> 02:29:20,288
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1738
02:29:21,665 --> 02:29:24,691
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1739
02:29:25,879 --> 02:29:29,741
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

1740
02:29:39,516 --> 02:29:41,780
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

1741
02:29:41,885 --> 02:29:45,082
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1742
02:29:45,188 --> 02:29:48,385
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

1743
02:29:49,015 --> 02:29:50,255
I'm an American.

1744
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:53,158
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

1745
02:29:53,263 --> 02:29:55,754
Hi. American.

1746
02:29:55,866 --> 02:29:57,959
American civilian.
It's all right.

1747
02:29:58,068 --> 02:30:01,339
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

1748
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:06,704
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1749
02:30:10,747 --> 02:30:12,374
I'm a photojournalist.

1750
02:30:12,996 --> 02:30:15,178
I've covered the war
since '64.

1751
02:30:15,285 --> 02:30:17,845
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

1752
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:25,320
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1753
02:30:26,436 --> 02:30:27,693
Who are all these people?

1754
02:30:27,798 --> 02:30:31,598
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to--

1755
02:30:31,701 --> 02:30:33,032
to take him away.

1756
02:30:33,136 --> 02:30:36,299
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1757
02:30:38,475 --> 02:30:41,774
Him! Colonel Kurtz.

1758
02:30:41,878 --> 02:30:45,644
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1759
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:49,446
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

1760
02:30:49,553 --> 02:30:53,216
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

1761
02:30:53,323 --> 02:30:57,555
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the Colonel.

1762
02:30:57,661 --> 02:30:59,561
Well, you listen to him.

1763
02:30:59,663 --> 02:31:02,928
The man's enlarged my mind.

1764
02:31:03,033 --> 02:31:06,730
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1765
02:31:07,062 --> 02:31:08,737
I mean, sometimes he'll--

1766
02:31:08,839 --> 02:31:10,431
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

1767
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,940
and he'll just walk right by you
and he won't even notice you.

1768
02:31:13,043 --> 02:31:16,672
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1769
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,771
"Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

1770
02:31:18,882 --> 02:31:21,783
If you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1771
02:31:21,885 --> 02:31:24,217
If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1772
02:31:24,321 --> 02:31:27,415
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1773
02:31:27,524 --> 02:31:30,652
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

1774
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:33,627
scuttling across floors
of silent seas."

1775
02:31:33,730 --> 02:31:35,960
- I mean--
- Stay with the boat.

1776
02:31:36,066 --> 02:31:40,503
Don't go any-- Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

1777
02:31:42,272 --> 02:31:45,639
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

1778
02:31:45,742 --> 02:31:47,642
and he can be right.

1779
02:31:47,744 --> 02:31:50,770
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1780
02:31:54,184 --> 02:31:56,084
I mean--

1781
02:31:58,622 --> 02:32:02,149
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

1782
02:32:02,259 --> 02:32:05,285
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1783
02:32:05,395 --> 02:32:08,125
- Something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1784
02:32:08,231 --> 02:32:10,631
Because I took his picture.

1785
02:32:10,734 --> 02:32:14,295
He said, "If you take
my picture again...

1786
02:32:14,404 --> 02:32:16,929
I'm gonna kill you."

1787
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,940
And he meant it.

1788
02:32:20,644 --> 02:32:23,340
See, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

1789
02:32:23,446 --> 02:32:25,414
Lay back. Dig it.

1790
02:32:25,515 --> 02:32:28,382
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1791
02:32:28,485 --> 02:32:31,818
But you don't-- you don't--
you don't judge the Colonel.

1792
02:32:31,922 --> 02:32:34,584
You don't judge the Colonel
like an ordinary man.

1793
02:32:41,398 --> 02:32:43,992
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1794
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:46,933
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

1795
02:32:47,037 --> 02:32:50,438
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold-- Hey, hello. Hello.

1796
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:52,440
Could you hold up a minute?

1797
02:33:14,497 --> 02:33:15,896
Colby.

1798
02:33:32,015 --> 02:33:33,744
The heads.

1799
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:36,045
You're looking at the heads.

1800
02:33:36,152 --> 02:33:39,349
I, uh-- Sometimes
he goes too far.

1801
02:33:39,456 --> 02:33:42,152
He's the first one
to admit it.

1802
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:46,161
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1803
02:33:47,497 --> 02:33:50,364
If you could have heard
the man just two days ago--

1804
02:33:50,467 --> 02:33:53,095
if you could have heard
him then, God--

1805
02:33:53,203 --> 02:33:56,468
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

1806
02:33:58,575 --> 02:34:00,907
I just wanna talk to him.

1807
02:34:02,245 --> 02:34:05,544
Well, man, he's gone away.

1808
02:34:05,649 --> 02:34:08,379
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1809
02:34:08,485 --> 02:34:11,579
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1810
02:34:11,688 --> 02:34:14,589
He forgets himself with his people.

1811
02:34:15,959 --> 02:34:18,723
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1812
02:34:18,828 --> 02:34:21,820
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1813
02:34:21,931 --> 02:34:23,421
- I think you should--
- Okay, Chef.

1814
02:34:23,533 --> 02:34:25,763
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

1815
02:34:25,869 --> 02:34:28,599
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1816
02:34:51,594 --> 02:34:54,358
This Colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1817
02:34:54,464 --> 02:34:57,024
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

1818
02:34:57,133 --> 02:34:59,567
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

1819
02:34:59,669 --> 02:35:02,137
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1820
02:35:03,173 --> 02:35:06,370
- Shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1821
02:35:06,476 --> 02:35:09,570
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

1822
02:35:09,679 --> 02:35:12,876
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

1823
02:35:12,982 --> 02:35:15,973
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1824
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:21,550
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1825
02:35:23,193 --> 02:35:27,095
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

1826
02:35:27,197 --> 02:35:30,394
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

1827
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:33,104
But now, fuck.

1828
02:35:35,305 --> 02:35:38,274
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1829
02:35:38,375 --> 02:35:42,175
So what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1830
02:35:42,278 --> 02:35:45,213
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1831
02:35:45,315 --> 02:35:49,649
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

1832
02:35:49,753 --> 02:35:52,187
See if I can find
the Colonel, okay?

1833
02:35:53,490 --> 02:35:56,516
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Damn it!

1834
02:35:56,626 --> 02:35:59,789
Here. You take the radio...

1835
02:36:00,371 --> 02:36:04,162
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

1836
02:36:05,735 --> 02:36:07,724
you call in the air strike.

1837
02:36:09,706 --> 02:36:11,537
"Air strike?"

1838
02:36:12,882 --> 02:36:14,475
The code is "Almighty"...

1839
02:36:14,577 --> 02:36:17,978
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1840
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:20,242
It's all in there.

1841
02:36:21,785 --> 02:36:24,583
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1842
02:36:33,096 --> 02:36:37,032

that Kurtz had gone insane.</i>

1843
02:36:40,703 --> 02:36:42,762

1844
02:36:42,872 --> 02:36:47,070
<i>North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.</i>

1845

it was because he wanted me that way.</i>

1846
02:37:31,654 --> 02:37:35,351
<i>It smelled like
slow death in there.</i>

1847
02:37:35,458 --> 02:37:36,824
<i>malaria...</i>

1848
02:37:37,894 --> 02:37:39,794
<i>and nightmares.</i>

1849
02:37:41,698 --> 02:37:44,599
<i>This was the end
of the river, all right.</i>

1850
02:37:58,047 --> 02:38:00,277
Where are you from, Willard?

1851
02:38:05,121 --> 02:38:07,589
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1852
02:38:12,562 --> 02:38:14,369
Were you born there?

1853
02:38:14,998 --> 02:38:16,438
Yes, sir.

1854
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:18,842
Whereabouts?

1855
02:38:19,602 --> 02:38:21,075
Toledo, sir.

1856
02:38:27,510 --> 02:38:30,070
How far are you from the river?

1857
02:38:36,219 --> 02:38:38,119
The Ohio River, sir?

1858
02:38:39,373 --> 02:38:40,144
Uh huh.

1859
02:38:40,456 --> 02:38:42,356
About 200 miles.

1860
02:38:50,199 --> 02:38:53,430
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1861
02:38:57,941 --> 02:39:00,933
There's a place in the river--
I can't remember--

1862
02:39:01,044 --> 02:39:06,277
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1863
02:39:06,382 --> 02:39:10,546
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about--

1864
02:39:10,653 --> 02:39:13,144
for about five miles
you'd think that...

1865
02:39:13,256 --> 02:39:16,210
heaven just fell
on the earth...

1866
02:39:16,963 --> 02:39:19,363
in the form of gardenias.

1867
02:39:35,378 --> 02:39:37,278
Have you ever considered...

1868
02:39:39,082 --> 02:39:40,982
any real freedoms?

1869
02:39:46,122 --> 02:39:49,853
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

1870
02:39:52,528 --> 02:39:55,271
Even the opinions
of yourself?

1871
02:40:10,847 --> 02:40:15,113
Did they say why, Willard?

1872
02:40:16,619 --> 02:40:21,420
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1873
02:40:36,873 --> 02:40:40,365
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

1874
02:40:43,312 --> 02:40:47,339
It's no longer
classified, is it?

1875
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:56,120
What did they tell you?

1876
02:40:58,494 --> 02:41:00,894
They told me...

1877
02:41:00,997 --> 02:41:02,291
that you had gone...

1878
02:41:03,766 --> 02:41:05,666
totally insane...

1879
02:41:07,770 --> 02:41:11,797
and that your methods...

1880
02:41:11,908 --> 02:41:14,809
were unsound.

1881
02:41:18,181 --> 02:41:20,741
Are my methods unsound?

1882
02:41:26,155 --> 02:41:29,784
I don't see any method...

1883
02:41:31,294 --> 02:41:33,194
at all, sir.

1884
02:41:39,302 --> 02:41:40,460
I expected...

1885
02:41:42,004 --> 02:41:44,165
someone like you.

1886
02:41:46,275 --> 02:41:48,300
What did you expect?

1887
02:41:55,918 --> 02:41:57,818
Are you an assassin?

1888
02:42:02,558 --> 02:42:04,321
I'm a soldier.

1889
02:42:07,363 --> 02:42:09,263
You're neither.

1890
02:42:10,967 --> 02:42:13,118
You're an errand boy...

1891
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:16,932
sent by grocery clerks...

1892
02:42:20,343 --> 02:42:22,624
to collect a bill.

1893
02:43:06,088 --> 02:43:08,056
Why, huh?

1894
02:43:08,157 --> 02:43:12,218
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1895
02:43:18,868 --> 02:43:21,098
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1896
02:43:21,204 --> 02:43:22,603
Why?

1897
02:43:24,173 --> 02:43:26,232
Do you know--

1898
02:43:26,342 --> 02:43:29,004
Do you know that the man--

1899
02:43:31,948 --> 02:43:34,075
the man really likes you?

1900
02:43:37,286 --> 02:43:39,413
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1901
02:43:39,522 --> 02:43:43,951
But he's got something
in mind for you.

1902
02:43:44,527 --> 02:43:47,052
Aren't you curious about that?

1903
02:43:47,163 --> 02:43:52,435
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1904
02:43:54,971 --> 02:43:58,236
There's something
happening out here, man.

1905
02:44:01,978 --> 02:44:04,344
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

1906
02:44:05,139 --> 02:44:07,314
That's right, Jack.

1907
02:44:07,416 --> 02:44:10,385
The man is clear
in his mind...

1908
02:44:10,486 --> 02:44:12,784
but his soul is mad.

1909
02:44:14,056 --> 02:44:16,547
Oh, yeah.

1910
02:44:16,659 --> 02:44:18,559
He's dying, I think.

1911
02:44:18,661 --> 02:44:21,721
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1912
02:44:21,831 --> 02:44:24,891
But the man's...

1913
02:44:28,905 --> 02:44:31,567
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

1914
02:44:33,442 --> 02:44:35,273
And a voice...

1915
02:44:36,379 --> 02:44:37,937
a voice...

1916
02:44:40,449 --> 02:44:43,145
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

1917
02:44:43,252 --> 02:44:48,280
He's got plans for you.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

1918
02:44:48,391 --> 02:44:52,327
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

1919
02:44:52,428 --> 02:44:55,158
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

1920
02:44:55,264 --> 02:44:59,826
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1921
02:44:59,936 --> 02:45:03,667
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

1922
02:45:03,773 --> 02:45:07,265
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

1923
02:45:07,376 --> 02:45:09,276
Bullshit, man!

1924
02:45:09,378 --> 02:45:14,611
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1925
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:19,263
You.

1926
02:45:23,960 --> 02:45:26,053
Almost eight hours.

1927
02:45:31,033 --> 02:45:33,661
I'm asleep.

1928
02:45:33,769 --> 02:45:37,296

I'm on this shitty boat.

02:45:48,851 --> 02:45:50,250

two-and-a-half years
after the big buildup began...

02:55:59,027 --> 02:56:02,019
Shape without form...

1981
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:03,722
shade without color...

1982
02:56:03,832 --> 02:56:06,528
paralyzed force...

1983
02:56:07,869 --> 02:56:09,769
gesture without motion."

1984
02:56:09,871 --> 02:56:12,935
Do you know what
the man's saying? Do you?

1985
02:56:12,998 --> 02:56:14,414
"Those who have crossed..."

1986
02:56:14,457 --> 02:56:17,672
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

1987
02:56:17,779 --> 02:56:21,340
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

1988
02:56:21,450 --> 02:56:24,817
You can't travel in space. You can't
go out into space, you know...

1989
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:26,945
without like, you know,
with fractions.

1990
02:56:27,055 --> 02:56:29,546
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1991
02:56:29,658 --> 02:56:32,058
What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

1992
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:33,559
That's dialectic physics, okay.

1993
02:56:33,662 --> 02:56:36,062
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

1994
02:56:36,164 --> 02:56:38,132
You either love somebody
or you hate 'em.

1995
02:56:38,708 --> 02:56:39,572
Mutt!

1996
02:56:41,866 --> 02:56:44,102
You mutt.

1997
02:56:44,206 --> 02:56:46,936
This is the way
the fucking world is.

1998
02:56:47,042 --> 02:56:49,602
Look at this fucking shit
we're in, man!

1999
02:56:49,711 --> 02:56:51,645
Not with a bang.
A whimper.

2000
02:56:51,747 --> 02:56:54,787
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.

2001
02:57:23,945 --> 02:57:26,846
<i>On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him...</i>

2002
02:57:26,948 --> 02:57:28,609
<i>I'd know what to do.</i>

2003
02:57:29,518 --> 02:57:31,813
<i>But it didn't happen.</i>

2004
02:57:32,688 --> 02:57:36,852
<i>I was in there with him
for days. Not under guard.</i>

2005
02:57:36,958 --> 02:57:38,483
<i>I was free.</i>

2006
02:57:39,428 --> 02:57:42,088
<i>But he knew
I wasn't going anywhere.</i>

2007
02:57:42,764 --> 02:57:45,896
<i>He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.</i>

2008
02:57:53,308 --> 02:57:57,608
<i>If the Generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw...</i>

2009
02:57:57,713 --> 02:58:00,045
<i>would they still want me
to kill him?</i>

2010
02:58:01,616 --> 02:58:03,951
<i>More than ever, probably.</i>

2011
02:58:04,753 --> 02:58:07,688
<i>And what would his people back home
want if they ever learned...</i>

2012
02:58:07,722 --> 02:58:10,349
<i>just how far from them
he'd really gone?</i>

2013
02:58:12,461 --> 02:58:14,429
<i>He broke from them...</i>

2014
02:58:14,529 --> 02:58:16,547
<i>and then he broke
from himself.</i>

2015
02:58:17,365 --> 02:58:20,732
<i>I'd never seen a man
so broken up and...</i>

2016
02:58:20,836 --> 02:58:22,736
<i>ripped apart.</i>

2017
02:58:22,838 --> 02:58:25,534
I've seen the horrors--

2018
02:58:25,640 --> 02:58:27,972
horrors that you've seen.

2019
02:58:29,511 --> 02:58:31,536
But you have no right
to call me a murderer.

2020
02:58:31,646 --> 02:58:34,076
You have a right to kill me.

2021
02:58:34,850 --> 02:58:37,751
You have a right to do that.

2022
02:58:38,987 --> 02:58:41,581
But you have no right
to judge me.

2023
02:58:47,896 --> 02:58:50,194
It's impossible for words...

2024
02:58:51,900 --> 02:58:53,458
to describe...

2025
02:58:55,437 --> 02:58:58,736
what is necessary...

2026
02:59:00,776 --> 02:59:03,040
to those...

2027
02:59:03,145 --> 02:59:05,670
who do not know...

2028
02:59:05,781 --> 02:59:09,342
what horror means.

2029
02:59:11,186 --> 02:59:12,585
Horror.

2030
02:59:15,357 --> 02:59:18,258
Horror has a face.

2031
02:59:20,529 --> 02:59:23,862
And you must make
a friend of horror.

2032
02:59:23,965 --> 02:59:27,594
Horror and moral terror...

2033
02:59:27,702 --> 02:59:29,602
are your friends.

2034
02:59:29,704 --> 02:59:31,831
If they are not...

2035
02:59:31,940 --> 02:59:35,740
then they are enemies
to be feared.

2036
02:59:35,844 --> 02:59:38,210
They are truly enemies.

2037
02:59:42,918 --> 02:59:46,752
I remember when I was
with Special Forces.

2038
02:59:50,225 --> 02:59:54,218
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

2039
02:59:57,699 --> 03:00:00,429
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

2040
03:00:02,704 --> 03:00:04,262
some children.

2041
03:00:08,143 --> 03:00:10,873
We'd left the camp...

2042
03:00:10,979 --> 03:00:14,244
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

2043
03:00:15,917 --> 03:00:18,613
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

2044
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:20,620
He couldn't say.

2045
03:00:23,058 --> 03:00:25,322
We went back there...

2046
03:00:25,427 --> 03:00:29,158
and they had come
and hacked off...

2047
03:00:29,264 --> 03:00:31,789
every inoculated arm.

2048
03:00:33,368 --> 03:00:35,734
There they were,
in a pile--

2049
03:00:35,837 --> 03:00:37,395
a pile of...

2050
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:40,940
little arms.

2051
03:00:42,210 --> 03:00:45,202
And I remember...

2052
03:00:46,715 --> 03:00:49,775
I-I-- I cried.

2053
03:00:49,885 --> 03:00:51,785
I wept like...

2054
03:00:53,388 --> 03:00:56,585
some grandmother.

2055
03:00:58,293 --> 03:01:03,094
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2056
03:01:03,198 --> 03:01:06,326
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

2057
03:01:06,434 --> 03:01:09,164
I never want to forget.

2058
03:01:09,271 --> 03:01:12,035
And then I realized...

2059
03:01:13,141 --> 03:01:15,109
like I was shot--

2060
03:01:15,210 --> 03:01:18,475
like I was shot
with a diamond--

2061
03:01:18,580 --> 03:01:22,243
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

2062
03:01:23,785 --> 03:01:27,687
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.

2063
03:01:27,789 --> 03:01:30,189
The genius."

2064
03:01:30,292 --> 03:01:33,056
The will to do that.

2065
03:01:34,529 --> 03:01:39,296
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

2066
03:01:41,202 --> 03:01:43,102
And then I realized...

2067
03:01:43,204 --> 03:01:47,038
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

2068
03:01:47,142 --> 03:01:49,872
These were not monsters.
These were men...

2069
03:01:49,978 --> 03:01:51,732
trained cadres.

2070
03:01:52,580 --> 03:01:55,242
These men who fought
with their hearts...

2071
03:01:55,350 --> 03:01:57,341
who have families,
who have children...

2072
03:01:57,452 --> 03:01:59,386
who are filled with love...

2073
03:01:59,487 --> 03:02:02,854
that they had the strength,

2074
03:02:02,958 --> 03:02:04,858
the strength...

2075
03:02:08,530 --> 03:02:10,430
to do that.

2076
03:02:10,532 --> 03:02:15,560
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

2077
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:19,162
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2078
03:02:20,809 --> 03:02:23,001
You have to have men...

2079
03:02:24,012 --> 03:02:25,912
who are moral...

2080
03:02:27,382 --> 03:02:29,229
and at the same time...

2081
03:02:29,818 --> 03:02:31,877
who are able to...

2082
03:02:32,988 --> 03:02:34,888
utilize their...

2083
03:02:37,192 --> 03:02:40,225
primordial instincts to kill...

2084
03:02:41,062 --> 03:02:44,031
without feeling,
without passion...

2085
03:02:45,266 --> 03:02:48,895
without judgment-- without judgment.

2086
03:02:53,274 --> 03:02:56,766
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

2087
03:03:15,363 --> 03:03:17,839
I worry that my son...

2088
03:03:18,700 --> 03:03:22,602
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

2089
03:03:24,839 --> 03:03:29,970
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

2090
03:03:31,212 --> 03:03:33,976
I would want someone
to go to my home...

2091
03:03:34,082 --> 03:03:37,415
and tell my son everything.

2092
03:03:39,854 --> 03:03:43,868
<i>Everything I did.
Everything you saw.</i>

2093
03:03:44,459 --> 03:03:48,486
<i>Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...</i>

2094
03:03:48,596 --> 03:03:50,928
<i>the stench of lies.</i>

2095
03:03:53,068 --> 03:03:56,299
<i>And if you understand me,
Willard, you--</i>

2096
03:03:58,173 --> 03:04:01,301
<i>you will do this for me.</i>

2097
03:05:06,774 --> 03:05:10,574
<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.</i>

2098
03:05:10,678 --> 03:05:14,546
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.</i>

2099
03:05:15,917 --> 03:05:20,616
<i>PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy?</i>

2100
03:05:25,326 --> 03:05:28,784
<i>They were gonna make me
a Major for this...</i>

2101
03:05:28,897 --> 03:05:31,889
<i>and I wasn't even in
their fuckin' Army anymore.</i>

2102
03:05:34,135 --> 03:05:37,593
<i>Everybody wanted me to do it.</i>

2103
03:05:37,705 --> 03:05:40,640
<i>Him most of all.</i>

2104
03:05:40,742 --> 03:05:43,176
<i>I felt like he was up there...</i>

2105
03:05:43,278 --> 03:05:45,862
<i>waiting for me
to take the pain away.</i>

2106
03:05:48,483 --> 03:05:51,111
<i>He just wanted to go out
like a soldier...</i>

2107
03:05:51,219 --> 03:05:53,915
<i>standing up.</i>

2108
03:05:54,022 --> 03:05:58,049
<i>Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade.</i>

2109
03:06:01,396 --> 03:06:04,490
<i>Even the jungle wanted him dead.</i>

2110
03:06:04,599 --> 03:06:07,864
<i>And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.</i>

We train young men

but their commanders...

2120

won't allow them

2122

it's obscene.

2123
03:09:02,677 --> 03:09:04,577
The horror.

2124
03:09:08,282 --> 03:09:09,613
The horror.

2125
03:14:32,306 --> 03:14:34,331
<i>Calling PBR Street Gang.</i>

2126
03:14:35,309 --> 03:14:38,745

<i>PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty...</i>

2129
03:15:22,923 --> 03:15:24,481
<i>The horror.</i>

<i>The horror.</i>
