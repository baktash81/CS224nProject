00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:12,447
TRANSPORTER 3

3
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:44,896
91, 92, it's down there.
- And if they catch us?

4
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,484
There are one million bottles inside.
Do you think they miss than a bottle?

5
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,084
The weather is us, sir.

6
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,587
We come in a few hours
in the port.

7
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,550
Very good.
- You're welcome, sir.

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,517
I've never smelled something.
Even if you are not sitting on the toilet.

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,021
What then?
Your shit smells like roses?

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,064
Look.

11
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,483
Let me help you out.

12
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,618
I thought you said that the drink was?
- It was there on the paper.

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,375
Captain, we have a security alert
in the lower well. Look.

14
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,128
In what section?
- 101

15
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,714
Take the helm!
- Yes, sir.

16
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,802
There is smoke.
- Get the gas.

17
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:08,355
They are going on.
- Make sure you handle this.

18
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,899
Hello.

19
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,111
Good morning.
- Passport, please.

20
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,785
Rough sea?
- The sea was calm,

21
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,371
but the game was a bit "wild."
If you understand what I mean.

22
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,207
Absolutely.
- Yes, thank you.

23
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,885
When I was a kid, my father took
I often had to fish.

24
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,597
Snapte I never knew how he
where the fish were.

25
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,602
They were always exactly
where he said that they would sit.

26
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,211
Safeguards.

27
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,339
Do we look like a security risk?

28
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,134
Please step out of the car and go
your documents to the office.

29
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:06,348
I have my papers here, sir.
- The computer "is" in the office.

30
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,351
They also.
- She sleeps.

31
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,980
With her papers.
- Okay, good.

32
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,820
I think I bite.

33
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,246
Come on, you have lost touch him so.

34
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,169
Just a little closer.

35
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,093
That is a big,
more to the left again.

36
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,764
Let him not escape.

37
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,520
Much closer.

38
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,652
Go left, go left, go right.

39
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,699
It seems to be Moby Dick,
you need help?

40
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,826
No, thank you.

41
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,789
I fished in the water
before you were born.

42
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,046
You almost had him,
really close, inspector.

43
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,470
Good thing we Frenchmen
a very different sense of humor have.

44
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,932
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

45
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,393
Jerry Lewis was, is a genius.

46
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,978
Dean was a genius.
- No.

47
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,731
Dean stood there with a drink
and a cigarette in hand.

48
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,525
That is exactly my point, everyone
may drop for a laugh.

49
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,362
But how many people can do that, standing
with a drink and a cigarette in your hand?

50
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,918
I fear that our fun day
what is shortened.

51
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:04,674
There was commotion in Marseille, a crazy
drives an Audi with an impossible speed.

52
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,969
Do not look at me.

53
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,181
This is the first place,
where the chef said I had to search.

54
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:16,519
But I will tell him that you
the 'perfect alibi' it.

55
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,023
As always.

56
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,072
Tacorni.

57
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,615
Please!
- Excuse me.

58
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,452
This is the first time I've bite.
- Yes, yes.

59
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,662
Please.
- Yes.

60
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,332
Stop the boat, come on.
- No.

61
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,543
Come on,
Please!

62
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,253
What is the purpose of your visit,
Mr. Johnson?

63
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,007
Affairs.
- What matters?

64
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,427
The protection of the environment.

65
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,351
Go.
- Thank you!

66
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,440
Minister, is known to the EU
an aggressive policy against the companies,

67
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,734
that pollute the environment.

68
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,902
What is the first time in
your list of priorities?

69
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,573
It is a short list with only one item:
'nature and how to protect. "

70
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,284
In an era of increasing
pollution by the industries,

71
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,619
and competition in the
world economy

72
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,498
can sometimes seem utopian
against the stark reality.

73
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,710
Not so utopian as pollution
a complete planet.

74
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,755
But gentlemen, I am now sorry,
I have to save trees

75
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,425
and industrialists disappoint.

76
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,055
Your speech for tomorrow.
- Is it still what?

77
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,267
It does make a lot of people pissed.
- Excellent.

78
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,231
Confidential.

79
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,209
Hello?

80
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,337
Mr. Minister.

81
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,588
Who is this?

82
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,132
My name is not important.

83
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,137
I have the lead on negotiations
where you've been involved EGO Corp.

84
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,599
But you pulled their license
to do business in Ukraine.

85
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,435
You must notify you by your superiors,
whatever your name may orphans.

86
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,771
I have the negotiations broke down,
permanently.

87
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:12,237
I think that you will consider as you once
the documents in the envelope have been studied.

88
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,670
You still hear from me.

89
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes, there is an accident.

90
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,590
Send an ambulance car.

91
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,135
Track this phone.

92
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,070
Malcolm!

93
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,157
Malcolm!

94
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,747
I asked you to a price.
What is this?

95
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,208
Maybe I have no interest
to accept the job.

96
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,377
Not smell good.

97
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,253
My boss says that you
the right man for the job.

98
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,632
Your boss may be the facts
does not have.

99
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,218
There are two things
you need to know about my boss.

100
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,969
He never has the facts wrong.

101
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,930
He never accept a 'no'
in response.

102
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,225
There is a first time for everything.

103
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,361
Well, not this time.

104
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,119
This would you really do not.

105
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,498
I do not think you're in a position
for me to say what I may or may not do.

106
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,835
You have ten seconds
to see your opinions change.

107
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:40,093
I give you five seconds
to recover revoke your hand.

108
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,653
Malcolm.

109
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,115
Malcolm, can you hear me?

110
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,702
I told you to jump within
but not so surprising.

111
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:52,040
I had nowhere else to go.
- Calm down it.

112
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,708
Take me away from the car.

113
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,088
Let me first make comfortable to the ...
- You understand nothing of.

114
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,634
You need a doctor.
You're shot.

115
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,888
Not far from the car.

116
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,807
Relax.

117
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,892
Keep your calm now.

118
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,062
You're so on top again.

119
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,784
He is inside.
Quick, it is urgent.

120
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,580
Sir.

121
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,792
You have to move him gently.
- Sir, we know what we do, okay?

122
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,503
Sir, you hear me?

123
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,130
The car ... No ...

124
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,965
If you hear me
then in my hand.

125
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,509
The car.

126
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,561
Am I in heaven?

127
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,272
Actually, you're in the middle of the mess.

128
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,359
Please help me out here?

129
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,569
That depends on how deep you to get.

130
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,446
Trust no one.

131
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,990
I could not agree more with you.

132
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,868
Come on.
- No, not in the car.

133
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,120
What is so special
to that car?

134
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,290
Not the car ...

135
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,386
Wait!

136
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,042
I had you said.

137
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,463
Trust no one.

138
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,300
I had you said.

139
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,520
I took the liberty,
for you to bring a suit.

140
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,439
That kind of suit you wear it
if you're at work, right?

141
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,193
Very true,
but I'm not at work.

142
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,278
See your boss, I told you.

143
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:56,117
Please, your attempt to get my message
transfer them was not convincing.

144
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,453
Thank you.

145
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,664
As I said.
We came to you in confidence.

146
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,999
You said you was not available.

147
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,379
We contacted the man you
gave us the number, which turned out not effective,

148
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,840
and now I continue to sit
with unfinished business.

149
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,677
And as I see it,
'm responsible for you.

150
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,970
I understand your position.

151
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,182
But I am still not available.

152
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,018
Boss, may I say something?

153
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,523
Still someone else who wants to say something?

154
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,443
Fine.

155
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,530
Make a smarter.

156
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:40,704
You have three seconds. to consider changing
for good or you're not available.

157
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,248
A,

158
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,252
two ...

159
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,631
On one condition.

160
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,176
I listen.

161
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,430
I would drive my own car.

162
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,266
Agreed.

163
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,355
Pending your decision, we have
the freedom to take your car to restore.

164
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,443
Oil refreshed, a tune-up data
and the non-essential material removed.

165
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,030
The plates are replaced
and furthermore

166
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,324
we have replaced the GPS system
by one of our own pre-programmed.

167
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,577
It is much more efficient.

168
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:24,956
I insist
the best man for this job instead.

169
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,169
We are now a bigger game.

170
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:34,215
Consider this is not as simple job
but see this as a mission.

171
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,054
I'm glad we agree.

172
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,139
I make a deal
and that's the deal, just like you.

173
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,142
You shall not name, I can not,
furthermore ...

174
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,437
none of us has interest
where we paid for

175
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,272
but as long as we pay
for what we do.

176
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,025
These are your rules, right?

177
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,701
You're just a forgotten.

178
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,411
I work alone.

179
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,246
I thought you
some company wanted.

180
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,125
I thought you wanted
I fulfilled that mission?

181
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,837
You're right, I do.

182
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,425
Wait.

183
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,012
Want to change the rules now?

184
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:25,558
Every rule has an exception.
Let us create one for today.

185
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,646
You decide.

186
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,441
Anything else?

187
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,320
Is there something I should know?

188
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,950
Think of the clowns that an airplane
wanted by opbazen

189
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,911
by collaborating with two security officers
to boarding.

190
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,163
It is the same principle
only sophisticated.

191
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,250
On 25 meters from the car
is the yellow light is on,

192
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,502
indicating that the first liquid
is ready.

193
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:57,090
At 50 meters, orange, the second liquid
flows into the room.

194
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,594
At 75-feet, you see the red color.

195
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,475
Time to leave.

196
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,646
This phone is programmed
to name just a number to call. Mine!

197
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,108
When you first tolinning underway
come to visit the North to go

198
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,402
Call me
Okay?

199
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,655
Money for gasoline and food.

200
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,158
Still other questions?

201
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,858
Would you mind to the seat belt
to do?

202
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,746
Would you tell me now
what this is about.

203
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,088
Great.

204
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,940
Ocean Blue calls for cargo
to clarify.

205
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:42,028
The documents to the environmental agency.
Throw out your anchor and wait in the dock.

206
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:46,116
We will inform you if they are signed.
- Good.

207
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:59,295
I know what has happened to you
but what happened to Frank?

208
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:09,180
Colonel Medved of Intelligence,
has all the information received.

209
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,890
He knows what has priority.

210
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,560
He let him know that his best men
has put out.

211
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,187
He keeps it from the official channels.

212
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,025
He suggests that you win as much time as possible
if you can.

213
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:31,745
Inspector. They ask if they car
though investigations?

214
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:36,124
Say he starts.
I come here when I'm ready.

215
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,585
You can start.

216
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,049
Asshole.

217
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,843
Come on.

218
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,139
I am of the police.

219
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,416
Look, I do not know
what your role in this, or is not.

220
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,418
It also makes me not.

221
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,295
Because you previously had to do
You know me more as

222
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,631
So let me know what you know.

223
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:29,052
I know nothing.
- How do you know Malcolm?

224
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,845
I did not.

225
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,141
Just in a car and were
by a man who did not know you.

226
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:39,229
I'm now in a car
with a man I do not know.

227
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,816
Had you not to call?

228
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,240
Good to hear you.

229
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,702
Save the formalities but
and give me the code.

230
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,163
One, one, two, six.

231
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:03,003
Call me when you arrive.

232
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,423
What happened in Budapest.

233
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,509
Goulash and beer.

234
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,687
Well, let us start again
with a proper introduction.

235
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,148
What happened to the rule
'no names'?

236
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,776
I suspended that rule for this moment.

237
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,324
My name is Frank Martin.

238
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,078
What is your name?

239
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,583
What makes my name?

240
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,086
Well, we are in the same boat.

241
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,839
No.

242
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:53,970
We sit here together in the car
with explosive bracelets on.

243
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,556
That is what I call it
in the same boat.

244
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:00,685
That is not,
but they still murder you.

245
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,730
I am aware of.

246
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,108
And probably, after I'm killed,
are you on the turn.

247
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:10,904
If we want to avoid
I need some help.

248
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,782
From the beginning ...
We have this problem.

249
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,326
Do you think I do not know
what the problem is?

250
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,079
Maybe I see there stupid for you.

251
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,956
I did not say that you're stupid.

252
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,752
But we have a problem,
it would be very helpful

253
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:29,089
if you could help
to find a solution.

254
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,926
I do not want to talk more.

255
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,018
Well.

256
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,033
What did you say your name was?

257
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,829
Frank,
Frank Martin.

258
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:06,251
My turn.
Valentina.

259
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,381
Pleasant acquaintance.

260
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:56,217
Inspector.
There is no GPS anymore.

261
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:00,805
Inspector?
- Yes, there is no GPS anymore. I know.

262
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,899
The people of EGO Corp. are here.

263
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:14,444
Let them come.

264
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,078
Gentlemen.

265
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:30,251
Mr. Minister, we thank you
our proposal in such a short time to consider.

266
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,671
You make it very difficult not to do so.
- Well, yes,

267
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:36,716
we have a reputation
to 'no' is not as a response to accept.

268
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,552
Here are the contracts.

269
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,888
Absolutely everything for each other.

270
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,015
They told us that the ships
can not be unloaded

271
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:46,476
unless you personally those documents
signing.

272
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,813
Ships?
I thought there was only one.

273
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:54,776
Well, the thing is,
profitable contract for us to make

274
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,405
we need the material in this volume
can trade, it makes sense.

275
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,657
About how many ships
we have it?

276
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,036
Except that the ship waiting
your consent, there are eight.

277
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,579
Eight?

278
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,957
For this year.

279
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,252
Nature
is a prolonged affair.

280
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,421
That said you do not then?

281
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:20,969
And I will again tomorrow in Odessa
I will sign this.

282
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:23,722
We really hoped
that this would be settled today.

283
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:28,309
I wish they review
now there are some obstacles overcome.

284
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:33,857
And 24 hours is not much difference,
an agreement for so long, right?

285
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,152
No, of course not.

286
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,946
I see you guys tomorrow in Odessa.

287
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,366
Let us say at 09.00.

288
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:49,789
Yes?
- Well, I do stay on board,

289
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,042
but the stuff is everywhere in the leak.
- And?

290
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,294
We will no longer can hide.
- That rule I do,

291
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,338
Give me some time.
- If they ever check ...

292
00:29:56,421 --> 00:30:02,344
Quietly, the deal will be completed soon.
- 24 hours, nothing more.

293
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:13,813
Yes?
- I have 24 hours you have additional concerns.

294
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,483
You have until tomorrow, 09:00 AM.

295
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,693
That would be more than enough time
should be.

296
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:23,073
Got a track?
- Even better than a rail,

297
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,033
a location.

298
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,702
Budapest
600 Km.

299
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,170
Inspector?
- Yes.

300
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:40,590
Interpol has your question
on that plate answered.

301
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:46,846
This was flashed by the radar
towards the north.

302
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,932
Show them immediately
to our friends in Germany.

303
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,184
Yes, but what should I say it?

304
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:54,896
What do you think?
What they expect from us?

305
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,448
I am hungry.

306
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,035
We are 100 km away from beer and sausages.

307
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,497
I do not like sausage.

308
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,752
What do you want?

309
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:27,637
Roasted chicken with carrots
and herbs

310
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,182
and filled with Mediterranean vegetables.

311
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,060
And last?

312
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:38,690
A salad,

313
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:44,154
flooded with balsamiek from Medina.

314
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,739
At age?

315
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,700
Of course age.

316
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,872
And if dessert?

317
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,249
Chocolate cake.

318
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,586
With or without whipped cream?

319
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,088
With.

320
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,133
And what do you drink?

321
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,260
Wine.

322
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,679
Torquase perhaps?

323
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,806
IJswijn

324
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,309
Of course.

325
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,819
Wrong direction.

326
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,696
What are you doing?

327
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,949
I go to someone
that sense of bracelets.

328
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,630
He goes off on the route.

329
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,926
Send somebody to him
again the right direction to send.

330
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,970
But kill him.

331
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,749
Frank, it's so good
to see you, my friend.

332
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,043
Otto, also good to see you.

333
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:25,171
You said that your pet is not brought.

334
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,215
It is not really company.

335
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:29,467
It is ...

336
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:33,054
complicated.
- It is with you always complicated.

337
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:38,601
But you can tell me about it,
with a tasty schnitzel with potato salad.

338
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,979
Otto, you know
I think you schnitzel nice, but ...

339
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,274
First this.

340
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,109
Wonder Good.

341
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,863
Resolution Magnetic Technology,
last generation.

342
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,073
In English, please, Otto.

343
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:57,996
There is a program that the Pentagon funded
to one of its subsidized companies.

344
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,499
They have experimented
with this new weapon technology.

345
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,502
Based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

346
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:08,131
Very secret stuff.

347
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:11,343
Can you give us a little bit
Pentagon secret of that show?

348
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,972
You believe what you can discover as you
fingers as you walk over the Internet.

349
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:20,769
You want the invasion plans for Iran to see?
- Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:24,356
But now I do I pick out how I uitkrijg
without that I myself to Iran inflation.

351
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,733
I would not bother you
with the details

352
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:31,529
but there is
a channel plate close.

353
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,579
You would not be doing this.

354
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,706
First, you do not talk
and now give you advice.

355
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,501
It is not advice,
but a warning.

356
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:48,296
It is a bit too late,
do you not?

357
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,970
That I agree with you.

358
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,393
You, of course.

359
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:10,151
Should I do it?
- Yes, do it.

360
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,409
Look, guys ...

361
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:21,413
There is something about the car
that had to be repaired.

362
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,290
In my profession, but the man is so good
as the car he drives.

363
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:28,503
If you make to the car,
makes the car for you.

364
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,507
The boss said;
'back on the route. "

365
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,843
Frank.

366
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,012
Keep doing more.

367
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,181
Go back in the car, Frank.

368
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,600
No.

369
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,464
Did you find it?

370
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,175
Not yet.

371
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,668
Are you 'small'?

372
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,047
No, I'm the 'big'.

373
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,975
You're not as' great 'more, huh?

374
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,166
I've found it.

375
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:42,090
The transmitter.
- Can you remove?

376
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:48,805
He is wired.
If I do that, 'boom'.

377
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:47,697
You fight well.

378
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:52,744
But you started your das bad.

379
00:40:57,957 --> 00:41:01,419
Where are you going?
- I'm tired.

380
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,048
That is the reason why I prefer
keeps busy with cars.

381
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,175
That is the same for me.

382
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:10,470
What do you want me to do,
when they wake up?

383
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:14,140
You can better the rest of the day
Friday take.

384
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,326
Do you not fun anymore?

385
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,495
You would have found it less fun
if you ultimately was dead.

386
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:38,081
If you have wanted me dead, I was that al
You've needed me alive.

387
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:39,833
If you want me to stay alive
and finish the job

388
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,377
you must give me the necessary explanations.

389
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:43,795
I listen.

390
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:47,090
Personally.
- We have "personal" voice.

391
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,843
Not to my satisfaction, apparently.

392
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:53,722
From now would be my satisfaction
your biggest concern should be.

393
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:57,934
The same place about an hour.
Wait for my call.

394
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,657
Hello.

395
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,618
You've disappointed me.

396
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:59,996
You will not be the first
nor the last.

397
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,998
I said that I personally
wanted to discuss.

398
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:04,876
That will not be necessary, because ...

399
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:08,046
Since that call what we had in the beginning
I started thinking,

400
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:11,132
and I do not have the best man
necessary for this job.

401
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,468
Any idiot with a license
would comply.

402
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:16,554
So, with the words
from Donald Trump:

403
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:20,058
"Excuse me,
but you're fired. "

404
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:09,274
Who are you?
- The new driver.

405
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:13,153
I liked the other better.
- He had to agree.

406
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:33,590
I tell you to stop!

407
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:24,265
You're fired.

408
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,895
How was your noon nap?
- Relax.

409
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:31,564
How was your call?
- Disc.

410
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,442
Put your seat belt around.

411
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,872
Tarconi.
- I am.

412
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:51,376
I already asked me when you call.
- I've been busy.

413
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:55,213
Let me guess.
In Budapest?

414
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,173
You are therefore also been pressure.

415
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,135
Never underestimate your old friend, Frank.

416
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:02,679
It does not defector to be
Tell me what you know.

417
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:07,892
There is a black Mercedes in Budapest
with our friends the French.

418
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,563
That is what I know
Tell me what you know.

419
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:15,358
I have 2 sacks in the back seat
and a girl front.

420
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,402
Russian, in my opinion.

421
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:19,738
I do not know what they have something to do.

422
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:21,364
Have you tried
to her questions?

423
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,324
Why I have not thought of?

424
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:26,578
Sorry, of course you have requested.
What did she say?

425
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:27,912
That I would die.

426
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:30,623
It is typical, Russian.

427
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:32,834
They are so gloomy.

428
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:36,421
I remember at school
when I read Dostoievski

429
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:39,382
"When people go who love?"

430
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:44,512
Page after page, misery and suffering.
You can not believe it, Frank.

431
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:46,973
Spare me the literature lesson
for another time, right?

432
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,060
I'm pretty tied now.
- Is that good?

433
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:53,772
No, it's a kind of explosive bracelet.

434
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,399
They explode if we leave it too far
of the car to leave.

435
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,277
They?
- A pair of Americans.

436
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:02,739
you can not be more specific?
A name or number?

437
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:05,784
Nothing.
- Why are you always so 'easy', Frank?

438
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,119
That is my nature.

439
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,621
Where are you? Then I come to you.

440
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:12,207
That is not a good idea.
They have a liquidation list.

441
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,419
I can not really help you
if you tell me anything.

442
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,090
Go to a computer.

443
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:27,055
Yes, Frank?
- That was not very clean.

444
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:30,016
You've broken the rules, not me.

445
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:32,435
Since you right.

446
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,439
So we are now even.
And start with a clean slate.

447
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,068
This is a sort of
gently goedmaker of call?

448
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:41,403
Sort of.

449
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:44,322
You got what I need
to remove the armband.

450
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,575
I have the packets
you must deliver.

451
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,454
These are the new coordinates,
two, six, twelve.

452
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:55,583
That brings you to the new meeting place.
Since then, we can finalize this deal neatly.

453
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:58,003
I look forward.

454
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,884
Frank.

455
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:07,429
Have you traced?

456
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:12,267
We are signaling, Frank.

457
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:16,604
Give us a little time
and then you have his number and location.

458
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:20,108
Please.

459
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,364
More questions?

460
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,075
No.

461
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:35,415
You know where the signal leads you going?

462
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,801
I know a restaurant there.

463
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:50,722
Fish as you never had.
Toasted with small roots

464
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:55,685
and seasoned with black pepper.
Romanian wine is not as good.

465
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:59,731
But if you ask me,
it was worse.

466
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,944
You must begin to think more positively.

467
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,323
I am a realist.

468
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:12,619
Your friend was right
when he told you was dark and gloomy.

469
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:15,121
What does
"dark and gloomy?

470
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:18,625
You see everything dark and gloomy.

471
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:22,087
How is your friend here?
He knows me.

472
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,382
He means it in general.
Russian people.

473
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:28,551
I'm not Russian.
I am a Ukrainian.

474
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,845
Pardon me.
- No excuse.

475
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:36,309
We are totally different people.
We are different 'here' and 'here'.

476
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:45,485
I personally think that there
a bit of an optimist in you.

477
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:50,073
How can you say something like that
if you do not know me?

478
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,243
I see that your makeup does.

479
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:58,123
If you sure that you went to die,
what makes it even matter?

480
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,544
What does look good
to die to do?

481
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,303
Hello.

482
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,724
What is that?
- Souvenirs from Ibiza.

483
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,184
You want one?
- No, thank you.

484
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:21,479
And you do not.
I must remain focused.

485
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,441
Ok.

486
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:31,781
You just stay focused
and I remain, how did you say that again?

487
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,992
Optimist.

488
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:35,869
Let that.
- Give me that!

489
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:39,873
Let me go.

490
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,753
Give me that!
Let me go!

491
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:49,424
Jesus!

492
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,012
Great.

493
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:58,641
Absolutely amazing.
- Come on, Frank Martin, what cheer.

494
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,852
I should be happier?
What's with these pills?

495
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:03,480
You got lucky you do not
as a Christmas decoration hanging in a tree.

496
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,440
That would be nice.

497
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:08,485
Boring.

498
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,984
You better stay in the car.

499
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:53,655
Should I pee in the car?

500
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:00,203
Okay, go ahead.

501
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:07,502
Forget this.

502
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,737
Do not.

503
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,510
Do not.

504
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:02,033
Hold on.
- Why? I drive it?

505
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:04,285
I just want fun.
I'd be happy.

506
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,038
You should try to be cheerful
instead of so serious.

507
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:10,125
It is important to see the positive
as you said, yes, right?

508
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,546
Drink with me, Frankie.
- I do not want to drink.

509
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,970
And who do I see now 'dark and gloomy?
Shall I try? Let me do that?

510
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,889
Forward, get in the car.

511
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:28,685
I'm as free as a bird.

512
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,194
The girl!
Come on! faster!

513
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:50,040
I let the bottle fall.
- Buy only one other.

514
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,972
Have you any idea
why we are haunted?

515
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,392
I do not know me and it does not matter.

516
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:14,356
First you tell me that I'm dark and gloomy
and now you tell me not to be happy?

517
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,900
Decide once.

518
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,409
Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement?

519
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:08,660
That we have.

520
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:12,414
Make me wise that you have nothing to do
with that car that haunts me.

521
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,165
I have nothing to do, Frank.

522
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,960
Is it possible that someone else
has something against you?

523
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,005
I can not imagine.

524
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,843
I think there are other forces in play.

525
00:56:24,926 --> 00:56:27,721
Let me check to see
or I can discover something.

526
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,681
And what do you suggest
I do meanwhile?

527
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:32,308
Row harder.

528
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:09,179
What is he up to?

529
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:12,659
There!

530
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:15,203
There he is!

531
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:20,750
I am hungry.

532
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:25,130
You had to buy a sandwich
instead of a bottle of vodka.

533
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,383
Look!

534
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,390
When I was not hungry.
I was thirsty.

535
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:37,892
Why are you so mean to me?

536
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:42,814
I am not common but fear death.
- What does' fear death '?

537
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:50,613
That means' fear death '!

538
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:03,501
Shooting on the links!
Come on! The tires!

539
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,004
Get down!

540
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:08,506
Shoot me!

541
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:19,851
Watch out!

542
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:39,245
Stop the car!

543
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,998
Damn!

544
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:48,398
What are you doing?
- You're so tense.

545
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:51,151
What you're talking about me.

546
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:57,824
I make sure
that you relax, right?

547
01:00:57,907 --> 01:01:01,202
Yes.
- I am good at.

548
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,330
I let the tension disappear.

549
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,965
What are you doing?

550
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:22,390
I would again feel sex
before I die, not you, then?

551
01:01:22,515 --> 01:01:25,560
What do you do with that die?

552
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,481
Is there something wrong with me?

553
01:01:29,564 --> 01:01:32,233
I'm not sexy?

554
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:35,236
Yes, you're sexy.

555
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,910
You're gay?

556
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:45,372
No, I am not gay.

557
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,916
I do not think that is bad.

558
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:52,545
I am not, right?

559
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:56,716
What is the problem?

560
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:03,181
Have you ever thought that I
maybe not in the mood for me?

561
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:21,866
I thought it was one of your rules
not to open packages?

562
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:25,745
That's right.
- Why do you have rules, if you break them anyway?

563
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:31,710
That question I always off.
Phone books!

564
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:42,887
You're the package.
- Yes.

565
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:44,764
You had something to say.

566
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:48,685
Would that have made any difference?
- Yes.

567
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,104
What are you doing now?

568
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:56,192
You know, in that garage,
saw your sweaty body is good.

569
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,987
Take your clothes off.

570
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,364
I tried five bull bins to block
with my head against saving.

571
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,533
I see no fun in the body.

572
01:03:03,616 --> 01:03:08,705
I think you're man enough
in order to do a striptease.

573
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:14,169
This is not for me, Valentina.
- Put another striptease for me.

574
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:15,962
Give me the keys.

575
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:20,091
This is not fun.
- Do you want the keys?

576
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,305
I want to stop
with that game to play.

577
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:28,975
Maybe this is the first opportunity
for something to play for you and me.

578
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,561
This is not the time
and the place for games.

579
01:03:31,644 --> 01:03:35,899
Why did I feel that with you
never the right time or place.

580
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:41,237
If I make a diagnosis, I want to
a psychiatrist. Give me the keys.

581
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:43,782
Come on, Frank Martin.

582
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:47,160
Make time for me to play.

583
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:07,972
Good?

584
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:11,851
Enough so?
- Not enough. This is not a striptease.

585
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:15,563
A sexy striptease should be.
You know, agitate with the butt.

586
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,816
Come on, Frank Martin.

587
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:20,068
Do you want the keys?

588
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:23,405
I want a striptease.

589
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:31,955
You know what I'm going to do with you
because you let me do this?

590
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,998
Give me Spanking.

591
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:36,918
That is a start.
- Me tie?

592
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:43,299
That love you do not then?
- I love the 'wild thing. "

593
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,679
Really?

594
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,728
But not too wild.

595
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:58,023
This was the striptease.
And now the keys.

596
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:02,068
A new deal:
a kiss for the keys.

597
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:12,120
If you suggest.

598
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:20,503
Have you ever kissed it feels like you, Frank?

599
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:23,757
I think not.

600
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,010
According to me, you live alone.

601
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:29,679
Inside and outside.

602
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:35,101
I think you have no fear to die
but to live.

603
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:38,605
Living with me.
Just this one time.

604
01:05:38,688 --> 01:05:42,317
Only this time.
Living with me.

605
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:28,071
What is his position?
- We lost him.

606
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,989
He went into the mountains.

607
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,742
We do not have a receipt
for lack of equipment.

608
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:36,121
A hack of military satellites.

609
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,503
Yes?

610
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:46,172
Do you think this is a game,
Mr. Minister?

611
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:48,008
I do not know where you are talking about.

612
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:51,678
I got it on a black car,
with your incompetent men.

613
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:54,764
Another such stupidity
and you never see your daughter back.

614
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,349
I want her voice heard.

615
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,893
If the contract signed
and delivered to.

616
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:01,771
I do not sign
before I have her voice heard.

617
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,607
You are not in a position
demanding something, Mr. Minister.

618
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:08,319
You can not, sir Johnson.

619
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,530
Listen, I know who you are.

620
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:13,742
And I can assure you
that if something happens to my daughter,

621
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,953
I will use all my power
and you will frighten away

622
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:22,125
and you in the most horrific way
will pay for this!

623
01:07:24,794 --> 01:07:27,881
We must now move.

624
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:34,721
Take, Frank.
Pick up.

625
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:54,199
I am in Ibiza, with the holiday.

626
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:03,333
Someone gives me a glass of champagne.
I drink it empty.

627
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:07,045
Then I felt not so good.

628
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:23,353
I went to the bathroom
then will I awake in the car.

629
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:25,355
I asked him what that would be.

630
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:29,150
He said he was merely the courier.

631
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:34,114
He was a good driver.

632
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:37,242
Not as good as you.

633
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:39,160
I said to him:

634
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:45,583
"Please, my father is a very powerful man
with many connections. "

635
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,461
"There were very many people.
Let me call him. "

636
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:51,548
He was scared.
He had never previously done.

637
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,383
It had to be simple.

638
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:56,302
Pak on. Liver off.
Easy money.

639
01:08:56,386 --> 01:09:00,265
There was not call him,
and never leave the car.

640
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:03,309
But I convinced him.

641
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:06,271
I called.

642
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:08,732
But before I said to my father
where we were.

643
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:11,818
Boarding!
Come on!

644
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,409
We have escaped, but ...

645
01:09:21,494 --> 01:09:26,666
These people shot at us.
Why? Why they shot at us?

646
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,921
He said there was shooting
because it was not according to plan.

647
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:34,799
I said to him:
'Well, that was the old plan ...

648
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,468
what is the new plan? "

649
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:39,804
He said he had a friend.

650
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:50,273
And when I met you.

651
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:55,570
And I felt that everything
went well come.

652
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:02,869
But you do not even know me.

653
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:09,167
Of course I knew you not.
It is about feelings. Not to know.

654
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:14,756
Well, if it feels better,
then you have a fun way to show.

655
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:20,303
Better for a woman
to be somewhat mysterious, is not it?

656
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,391
No.

657
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:25,934
Yes.

658
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:28,603
Just a little.

659
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,090
They are back on the radar, sir.

660
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:03,513
Yes?
- Where are you?

661
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:07,559
On the road to Bucharest.
- Not anymore.

662
01:11:08,476 --> 01:11:12,981
New coordinates,
three, seven, thirteen.

663
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,437
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

664
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,814
But briefly.

665
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:57,984
I am the Inspector Tarconi, from Marseille.

666
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:01,905
Well, not exactly in Marseille
but from a small village.

667
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:04,574
What do you inspector?
- A short conversation with u.

668
01:12:04,657 --> 01:12:06,701
I do not have time.

669
01:12:06,826 --> 01:12:09,746
It's about your daughter.

670
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:20,173
Odessa, Frank, my country.

671
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:24,844
You brought me home.
Thank you.

672
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:29,224
What happened to Bucharest?

673
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,309
The plan was changed.

674
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:34,896
It is a good change.
I prefer to Odessa.

675
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:37,315
Yes.

676
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,860
I looked forward to all that delicious fish.

677
01:12:40,944 --> 01:12:44,614
Here it is much better.
Do you like chicken?

678
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,324
I do.

679
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:50,203
I know a restaurant here.
It is the best in the world.

680
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:54,791
The chicken is so fresh
and the butter and spices ...

681
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:58,837
You can not believe
that it is so nice.

682
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,844
You know how I feel now?

683
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:10,348
Hungry.

684
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:15,437
Safe.

685
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:27,991
Is this end as in fairy tales?
They lived happily.

686
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:33,621
Tonight, this is only
a vague memory.

687
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:37,876
You and I will be there to laugh,
during the dinner.

688
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:42,714
Liar.

689
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:02,442
Mr. Minister,
an update, please.

690
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:05,862
I'm ready to sign the contract
to sign

691
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:08,782
as I do with my daughter
have spoken.

692
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:12,285
Hello?

693
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:16,081
Keep that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

694
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,800
We are close to the news, Frank.

695
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:30,303
Yes, if the shutdown, make sure that
I have no one to drag out of the car.

696
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,847
You know where this all about?

697
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:38,061
The girl, her father
and toxic waste.

698
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:42,482
He will exchange,
a signature for a life.

699
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:45,860
I have a reputation
I want to keep high, inspector.

700
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:49,114
100% successful deliveries, right?

701
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:53,410
Hear what I have doubts about you?

702
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:58,289
That's not the Frank I know,
with its rules, no names.

703
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,584
Why is everyone so worried
about my rules?

704
01:15:01,668 --> 01:15:08,591
Frank, I've always thought,
you're a romantic.

705
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:11,469
Anything else?

706
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:15,807
For now, no.
- I'll call you back later.

707
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:22,897
Yes?
- We are nearing the end, Frank.

708
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:26,109
Give me the coordinates.
- No more coordinates.

709
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:30,905
Take the road that you now berijdt
the first exit to the left.

710
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:34,159
I would like to know
I heenga.

711
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:40,040
You'll know when you get there.

712
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:13,114
None care,
I got them there, where we want them.

713
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:20,747
My compliments, Frank.

714
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:24,376
Our confidence in your skills
was well deserved.

715
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:28,254
Send now please
the girl here.

716
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:30,340
She is coming.

717
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,926
I am not.

718
01:16:33,259 --> 01:16:35,387
They need you.
They will not kill you.

719
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,264
But they will kill you.

720
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:43,728
Do I look like a man who crossed half of Europe
to die on a bridge?

721
01:16:54,155 --> 01:16:56,700
We do not have the whole day, Frank.

722
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:04,207
Look how many there are.
They all have weapons.

723
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,168
How can it be fine?

724
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,632
We see each other at dinner.

725
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,843
Go now.

726
01:17:14,926 --> 01:17:16,302
Go.

727
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:19,431
Kiss me.

728
01:17:41,494 --> 01:17:44,873
I am still slain, go!

729
01:18:08,396 --> 01:18:11,649
Look at that bastard.

730
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:38,802
Is it better now, baby?

731
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,947
Kill him.

732
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:19,592
Frank, no!

733
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:33,773
His beloved car will be his tomb.

734
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:35,942
He leaves the car, then he exploded.
He remains in there, then he is drowning.

735
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:38,695
Let us leave here.

736
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:50,832
Tarconi.
- They got the girl.

737
01:19:51,082 --> 01:19:55,920
Frank? We are trying to trace him.
Where are you?

738
01:19:56,004 --> 01:20:00,342
In a more
- One more?

739
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:04,429
Can you be more precise.
- There is a dam.

740
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,390
A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

741
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,434
How far from here?
- At least 10 minutes.

742
01:20:09,517 --> 01:20:11,686
Frank, we are within ten minutes.

743
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,564
It may be a bit faster.
- We will do our best.

744
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:17,067
Thank you.

745
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:17,896
Buy tickets for everyone.
- Where to go?

746
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:21,941
Where the train goes, we must
at least half hours by car.

747
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:25,028
Why are we not
Just driving around?

748
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:32,827
Ever in one day.

749
01:22:45,548 --> 01:22:47,884
Sir!

750
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:11,491
Get out!

751
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:33,013
Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

752
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:36,266
Someone wants to talk to you.

753
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:39,269
Dad?
- Are you okay?

754
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:45,692
Not sign.

755
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:49,904
What you have are just 15 minutes.

756
01:23:56,327 --> 01:23:58,121
Have you found
where this all about?

757
01:23:58,204 --> 01:24:01,541
Waste.
- How much waste are we talking?

758
01:24:01,624 --> 01:24:05,337
Enough to cover half the country
at least 100 years.

759
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,506
Try again.

760
01:24:26,524 --> 01:24:30,737
For a modern woman
you're very ongeïnformeerd.

761
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,531
This is the 'new world'.

762
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:36,368
There are no other countries more.
That is the old idea.

763
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:39,829
There is only economic reality.
Profit and loss.

764
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:42,624
Effectiveness and wasteful.

765
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:45,794
Think globally, not locally.

766
01:24:45,877 --> 01:24:48,546
But after thinking about.

767
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,689
Yes?
- How far are we?

768
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:15,073
We are almost there.

769
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,370
Look, he sits on the train.

770
01:25:20,453 --> 01:25:22,580
And where are we?
- Here.

771
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:25,792
You can also get units.

772
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:29,671
That is a good idea, do that.

773
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:36,011
Frank, come on.

774
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,961
Mr. Minister, I assure you
that everything is in order.

775
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,255
I am sure.

776
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:16,009
If there are problems ...
- I know, will you solve them.

777
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:20,013
If you do not mind.

778
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:54,172
You will not believe this,
but in my heart I'm a pacifist.

779
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:57,300
I hate violence.

780
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:01,388
It creates more problems,
than it solves.

781
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:06,309
I never want to do something like this.

782
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:10,105
A customer asked me to
for results, so ...

783
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:14,943
I wanted to create an environment so that
the result would not lead to bloodshed.

784
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:18,530
But nobody wanted to cooperate, or you
neither the first driver nor your father ...

785
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:21,908
nor the recently deceased, Frank Martin.

786
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,787
Everybody wanted to fight.

787
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:42,971
What's so funny?

788
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:46,182
That poor man heard talk.

789
01:29:58,273 --> 01:30:00,525
A step further, Frank.

790
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:03,570
Come on.
One.

791
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:49,324
Look.
It is over.

792
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:52,660
Two minutes before nine.
He has signed.

793
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,624
Oh, my God.

794
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,256
No, Frank. No.

795
01:31:44,879 --> 01:31:46,256
It is over, Frank.

796
01:31:46,339 --> 01:31:48,550
It is over.

797
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:52,679
Mission accomplished.
You and the girls are free to go.

798
01:31:52,762 --> 01:31:57,058
In fact, I am so impressed by your talent
I wish you a job offer.

799
01:31:57,142 --> 01:32:01,730
I would like you an offer.
'For Good disabled. "

800
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:23,793
I hate to say Frank, but I think
that we never will be good friends.

801
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:26,379
You're right.

802
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:59,120
You are a good pair.
You and the bracelet are made for each other.

803
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:37,409
You do it right.

804
01:33:55,218 --> 01:33:57,887
Valentina.

805
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:04,728
Valentina.

806
01:34:13,653 --> 01:34:16,448
Am I in heaven?

807
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:21,619
It seems more like hell.

808
01:34:21,703 --> 01:34:27,208
I don 't care,
but as long as we are together.

809
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:43,516
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

810
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,269
Thank you very much.

811
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:02,577
What are you doing now?
- What you just said, the right thing.

812
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,829
And now gentlemen if you want to excuse me.

813
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:09,084
I have to lead a conference on the
risk to do business with people like you.

814
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:12,462
Thank you very much.

815
01:35:29,062 --> 01:35:30,480
Is the boat ready?

816
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:33,650
That is too water, waiting for us.
- Time to go.

817
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:36,569
Quickly.
- Okay.

818
01:35:54,129 --> 01:35:57,340
I just do not understand.

819
01:35:57,424 --> 01:36:02,887
When I was a kid, my father took
and I fish here the whole day off.

820
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:08,601
Times change inspector.
- As the people.

821
01:36:09,936 --> 01:36:12,731
This refers you to me?

822
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:16,276
I think that is not a very
accurate pronunciation.

823
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:19,487
I have the same car,
I live in the same house.

824
01:36:19,571 --> 01:36:23,616
I did not refer to your car or your house.

825
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:30,665
It's so quiet here.
Is dinner ready?

826
01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:34,294
Miss, there is a certain order
for those things.

827
01:36:34,377 --> 01:36:38,131
In order to eat,
you must first eat the catch.

828
01:36:38,214 --> 01:36:41,968
And if we continue to talk instead of
than to concentrate it's nothing.

829
01:36:42,052 --> 01:36:43,261
I have a better idea.

830
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:47,599
Why continue to eat the catch
and not to eat?

831
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:51,269
I know a nice place,
not far from here.

832
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:54,439
Where they prepare incredibly delicious fish.

833
01:36:54,522 --> 01:36:59,694
They use tomatoes and onions
and a little white lavender.

834
01:37:00,904 --> 01:37:02,989
What kind of wine?

835
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:06,117
I think Rosado.

836
01:37:06,242 --> 01:37:09,537
With maybe a drink?
- Chilled?

837
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:13,625
Of course chilled.
- And if dessert?

838
01:37:15,627 --> 01:37:18,630
