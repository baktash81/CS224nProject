1
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:36,002
<i>This is the one
and only PBR World Final!</i>

2
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,243
<i>Luke Collins is young, easy on the eyes,
and a magician on a bull.</i>

3
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,948
<i>But right now, he's about to face
his ultimate demon.</i>

4
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:51,018
<i>He is about to ride a bull
who needs no introduction.</i>

5
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:55,406
<i>This bull has 74 consecutive buck-offs.</i>

6
00:00:55,506 --> 00:01:00,360
<i>Las Vegas, you know
who I'm talking about.</i>

7
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,897
<i>This is Rango!</i>

8
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,436
And he is ready to rock and roll!

9
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,625
Let go!

10
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,758
<i>...great shape of... wait a minute!</i>

11
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:13,430
<i>Luke Collins is down.
You've gotta get him out of there.</i>

12
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,756
- Hey, do you guys know where Sophia is?
- No, sorry.

13
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,990
Tell them to save our seats.

14
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,494
- Did you see Sophia?
- She's in her room studying.

15
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,596
But you're not gonna get her to go.

16
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,802
Hi, Marcia. Thanks for not disturbing.

17
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,922
I have a present for you.

18
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,706
Wait. You were serious?

19
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,010
- Do I look serious?
- No, you look ridiculous.

20
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,447
- Oh, come on, Soph. They're so much fun.
- I can't. I have work to do.

21
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,451
It's second semester senior year.
Your grades are stellar.

22
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,088
You already have a job
lined up in New York.

23
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,056
An internship. All of the work
and none of the pay.

24
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,559
- Half the house is going.
- I don't see myself as a rodeo gal.

25
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,394
Fine. It's not the rodeo,
it's bull riding. There's a difference.

26
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,599
- You're missing the point.
- Hot guys, I know.

27
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,769
No, not "hot guys."
The hottest guys you have ever seen.

28
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,539
Please.

29
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:29,942
Fine.

30
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,812
But I'm not wearing those cowboy boots.

31
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,684
So, this is it?

32
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,404
Yeah, this is it.
"The toughest sport on dirt"!

33
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:42,789
Yeah, I need a hot cowboy.

34
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,653
Oh, my God!

35
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,355
What was that?

36
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,562
Look at that guy in the chute.

37
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:24,801
<i>Fans, we're gonna go now to the Ridin'
Dirty bucking chute where we...</i>

38
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,634
<i>have got local hero Luke Collins
from Walkertown, North Carolina!</i>

39
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,836
Go, Luke!

40
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,714
<i>He's a three-time
PBR World Finals champion.</i>

41
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,550
<i>For over a year,
an injury has sidelined him.</i>

42
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,939
<i>But he's back. Currently ranked
52nd in the world.</i>

43
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,590
<i>He has a long way to go.</i>

44
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,031
- You ready for this?
- We'll see.

45
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,947
<i>And today, he will be riding
Sweet Thang.</i>

46
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,142
Let's go!

47
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,072
Yeah, go!

48
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,565
Yeah!

49
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,206
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a champion.

50
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:17,144
- Yeah! That's my boy!
- I feel like I should stand!

51
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:22,514
<i>Luke Collins now moves up
to 48th in the world standings.</i>

52
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,635
Hey!

53
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,140
Keep it.

54
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,653
Work it, girl.

55
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,459
- It's so big on you.
- I know.

56
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,105
Nice riding, cowboy.

57
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,642
Of course, my grandma could have made
the eight on Sweet Thang.

58
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,779
It's good to have you back, Luke.
It was getting too easy without you.

59
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,941
Jared! Hey, buddy. I'll be right back.

60
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,987
- Hey, Larry. Good to see you.
- Good to see you here.

61
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,597
Luke, hey, man. How are you doing?
Congratulations, man.

62
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,825
I know it feels good to get a win
under your belt, doesn't it?

63
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,631
- Sure does.
- Yeah. Let me ask you.

64
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,963
You need to come visit us. I wanna
introduce you to some good folks from PBR.

65
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,900
- Important folk. Come get a beer.
- You got it. I'll be right behind you.

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,734
Yes. Okay.

67
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,838
Hey... you had a good night.

68
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,874
But it's a long way back to the top.

69
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,453
I got a hat just like that.

70
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,591
Yeah. Sorry.

71
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,727
No, you hold on to it.
Looks better on you.

72
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,565
Like this?

73
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,505
May I?

74
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,840
Sure.

75
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,416
- Yeah.
- Okay.

76
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,919
Beautiful.

77
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,427
- Luke.
- Sophia.

78
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,892
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

79
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,199
I'm gonna... Can I...
Can I get you a drink?

80
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,539
You were the big winner tonight, right?

81
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,743
I think I should be the one
buying you a beer.

82
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,278
Oh, no. Doesn't work like that
where I'm from.

83
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,413
Okay.

84
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,517
You're buying.

85
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,654
Sophia!

86
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,356
- Hi!
- There you are.

87
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,558
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Yeah.

88
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,161
- This is Marcia. She's my...
- Sister.

89
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,229
- Sorority sister.
- Hi.

90
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:01,333
BFFs, if we're speaking technically.

91
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,857
- You are gorgeous.
- Okay, time to put you in a cab.

92
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:09,142
What? I just need everything
to stop spinning for a sec.

93
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,312
I'm gonna be sick.

94
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,080
- What?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

95
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,815
- How sure?
- High 90s.

96
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,721
- Yeah. We got her.
- Okay.

97
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,324
I should take her home.

98
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,526
Yeah. Probably a good idea.

99
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:30,196
I would say that I'd call you, but I have
a feeling, where you come from,

100
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,297
it just doesn't work like that.

101
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:36,201
That's right. I'll call you?

102
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:40,373
You're telling me that he has called you,
and you haven't called him back?

103
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,926
I'm moving to New York in two months.
What's the point?

104
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:46,980
What's the point?
Have you gotten a good look at him?

105
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,284
Those shoulders, those eyes.
That's the point.

106
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,453
Okay, look. I am starting
a new chapter of my life.

107
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,372
I do not need any distractions.

108
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:59,459
Sophia, you're literally the only girl I know
who wouldn't have a fling with a cowboy.

109
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,336
Okay.

110
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:58,183
Straight to voicemail.
Straight to voicemail.

111
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,488
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Luke. It's Sophia.

112
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,357
<i>I was wondering if maybe you wanted
to hang out sometime</i>

113
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:08,027
- <i>or grab coffee or something.</i>
- No, no. I'm okay.

114
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,496
Okay.

115
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,466
Well, I guess I should
just let you go, then.

116
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,874
I'm just messing with you, Sophia.

117
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,308
How about dinner?

118
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,210
You mean, like a date?

119
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,279
Yeah, like a date.

120
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,117
Most guys, they just say,
"What are you doing later?"

121
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,320
Or they text late at night,
"Hey, come over."

122
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,090
Yeah, well, you know...
call me old-school.

123
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,993
- <i>Should I meet you somewhere?</i>
- <i>No. I'll pick you up at your place.</i>

124
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,199
- <i>Does 6:00 work for you?</i>
- Okay.

125
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,063
Ladies.

126
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,084
- I know you.
- Marcia, right?

128
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:41,353
The last time I saw you
you were a little blurry.

129
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:44,237
- Yeah.
- You can come in.

130
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,626
- Thank you.
- She's upstairs getting ready.

131
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,163
Hi.

132
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,734
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:03,242
Thank you. So sweet.

134
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,783
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

135
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,154
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night, you guys.

136
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:20,293
- Oh, my God!
- I want a cowboy!

137
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,161
He is so hot!

138
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:27,179
So, you never said
you lived in a sorority house.

139
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,769
Yeah, well, it's the cheapest rent
on campus.

140
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,674
Is it like I would imagine?

141
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,244
How would you imagine?

142
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,281
Pillow fights in your underwear.

143
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,116
No. Come on!

144
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,320
We don't wear underwear.

145
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,929
- I got you, a little.
- You did.

146
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,565
Okay. So where are we going?

147
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,480
That's a surprise.

148
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,702
It's breathtaking.

149
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,273
Yeah.

150
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,978
Well, aren't you full of surprises?

151
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,617
- I can't believe you made dinner for me.
- Well, Amy made dinner.

152
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,355
- Who's Amy?
- Amy. Smokin' Amy's.

153
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,025
Best barbecue in North Carolina.

154
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,896
I kind of got into that and classical,
which is so strange.

155
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,532
I know, I know. It's weird.
It's totally like...

156
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,069
How did a girl from Rutherford, New Jersey
end up in the middle of North Carolina?

157
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,171
Yeah, something like that.

158
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:16,376
I ended up getting a scholarship
down here, so I couldn't pass it up.

159
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,679
Scholarship? Pretty fancy.

160
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,717
I kind of knew that tips from my dad's
diner weren't really going to cut it. And...

161
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:30,657
You know, I just... I love art.
I love...

162
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:34,127
everything about it. I love studying it.
I love the culture that it brings

163
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:39,598
and the whole human experience...
just all wrapped up into one, you know.

164
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:46,989
Anger, sadness, love, passion,
acceptance... history.

165
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,979
Never mind. I don't know. What about you?
Tell me about you. What's your story?

166
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,017
No. No, mine's... mine's pretty simple.

167
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,320
Just keep winning events.

168
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,022
Yeah. Make it to the top 35.

169
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,725
Go to Vegas. Make it to the finals.

170
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,630
I got some making up to do.
I got hurt last year. So...

171
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,968
- What do you mean you got hurt?
- All bull riders get hurt.

172
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:20,005
It's not "if." It's...

173
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,841
"when."

174
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,278
And how bad.

175
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,181
So how bad was yours? Serious?

176
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:35,186
I've got a few more years
to ride before...

177
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,256
before I'm just a washed-up bull rider.

178
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,650
I'm going to be the best.

179
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,397
- It's just all about winning?
- No, it's not all about winning.

180
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,202
Well, not entirely.

181
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:53,439
I've got a family ranch. And...

182
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,344
It's been a tough couple years.
My mom is kind of all on her own.

183
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,881
I just gotta keep making money.

184
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,164
Are you cold? You're cold.

185
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,993
A little. Where are you going?

186
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:19,599
What do they call
this nail polish color?

187
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,042
- This would be "clear."
- Clear.

188
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,704
- Yeah.
- Right. Clear. That makes sense.

189
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,741
It's good.

190
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,514
You are pretty smooth for a country boy.

191
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,083
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

192
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,721
Come on, I saw the way
those girls stared at you.

193
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,158
And you think I'm that type of guy?

194
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,998
No. No one has ever done
anything like this for me before.

195
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,324
So... do you like North Carolina?

196
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:11,650
Yeah, I do.

197
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,719
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

198
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:21,460
I'm actually moving to New York
at the end of next month.

199
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,333
I got this job.

200
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,304
Well, it's an internship,
actually. But...

201
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,006
it's a pretty big deal.
It's at a gallery in Manhattan.

202
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,475
Okay.

203
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,750
That's why it took me so long
to call you back.

204
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,986
I just didn't think that this
would even be a good idea.

205
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,721
I'm glad you did.

206
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,924
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

207
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,930
This is just bad timing.

208
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,419
Yeah.

209
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,639
I probably should take you home.

210
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,746
Gonna rain.

211
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,623
- Did you see that?
- What?

212
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,238
Luke! What is it?

213
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,933
Call 911!

214
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,823
- Hey! Wake up!
- Is he alive?

215
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,158
Here, hold this.

216
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,537
Box.

217
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,441
- Box.
- What did he say? "Box"?

218
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,743
- I think you just saved that guy's life.
- We both did.

219
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,780
Come on, I held the flashlight.
You were amazing.

220
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,451
I just hope that he's okay, you know.

221
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,755
I'll take you home.

222
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,358
- I think I'm going to stay.
- Really?

223
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:11,029
Yeah, at least until he gets out
of the emergency room.

224
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:15,608
- Then I'll wait with you.
- No, it's fine. Really.

225
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,699
And thank you for tonight.

226
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,208
Yeah, it was a... it was a great night.

227
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,743
Kind of.

228
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,113
Good luck with everything,
you know, in New York.

229
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,837
"April 10th, 1940.

230
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,840
<i>"My dearest Ruth...</i>

231
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,243
<i>"Today started out like any other day.</i>

232
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,079
<i>"But when you walked in

233
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,950
<i>"so beautiful, so vibrant...</i>

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,852
<i>"I knew my life
would forever be changed."</i>

235
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,891
You are the new family
the Rabbi has told us about.

236
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,395
- From Vienna?
- Yes.

237
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:27,266
I am Hannah
and this is my daughter, Ruth.

238
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:33,705
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sarah and this is my son, Ira.

239
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:39,443
Ira? Ira?

240
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:56,527
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

241
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,435
Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

242
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,505
Good <i>Sha...</i>

243
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,575
<i>The following days were consumed</i>

244
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,944
<i>with plotting ways in which
I could talk to you...</i>

245
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:16,480
<i>now that you had found a home
in my small community.</i>

246
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,741
<i>But I wasn't the only one
seeking your attention.</i>

247
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,496
<i>This would take some more time.</i>

248
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,729
He's awake, if you'd like to see him.

249
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,299
You have to eat something, Mr. Levinson.
It's the only way you're going to get better.

250
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,502
I'm old. I've had a heart attack...

251
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,305
a hip replacement,
surgery in both knees.

252
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,241
How much better am I going to get?

253
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:23,147
Who are you?

254
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:27,652
- I... I came to drop this off.
- How'd you get that?

255
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,389
From your car.
You asked me to get it for you.

256
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,991
Oh, you...

257
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:36,095
You pulled me out?

258
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:40,265
No, my friend Luke pulled you out, but you
asked me to go back and get this box.

259
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,736
You don't remember?

260
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:51,141
Well, thank you.

261
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,312
Very much.

262
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:57,016
He seems to like you,
which is a first for him.

263
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,318
See if you can get him
to eat something, would you?

264
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,881
She has the coldest hands
I've ever felt.

265
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:10,761
I think she soaks them in ice water
before she comes by.

266
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,606
You really should eat something.

267
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,974
I'm done.

268
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,521
Is that what Ruth would want?

269
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,162
How do you know about Ruth?
Did you read my letters?

270
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,765
What do you care? You're done.

271
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,468
They're beautiful.

272
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,055
She was a beautiful woman.

273
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,468
In every way.

274
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,993
I can see why they were
so precious to you.

275
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,981
I haven't been able
to read them for years.

276
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,884
Even with my glasses.

277
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,819
Do you want me to read them to you?

278
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,732
But you have to eat first.

279
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:14,686
"May 25th, 1940.

280
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,388
"For the first time in my life

281
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:21,526
"I was hoping the service
at the synagogue would be longer."

282
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:33,771
Excuse me.

283
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:46,183
Are you ever going to talk to me?

284
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,790
- Excuse me?
- I always see you there, lurking around.

285
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,329
- I don't lurk.
- You do lurk.

286
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,665
But then you never talk to me.
Am I so frightening?

287
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,068
No, I...

288
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:12,050
What you did to that poor rose
was unforgivable.

289
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,213
You saw that?

290
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:20,652
Don't be embarrassed.
It was a lovely gesture.

291
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,620
Ruthie?

292
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,113
Want to walk me home?

293
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,630
- What about David Stein?
- He can walk my mother home.

294
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,302
Vienna is beautiful and so cultured.

295
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,271
It has more artists than Paris.

296
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,009
At least it did before the war.

297
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,777
It must have been hard for you to leave.

298
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,045
Yeah.

299
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,143
Especially for my parents.

300
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:54,285
But it would have been worse
if we had stayed.

301
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,722
Everyone thought we were being foolish
that my father was overreacting.

302
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,298
Now we can't even contact
our relatives anymore.

303
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:07,702
You know, sometimes I think...

304
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:12,704
What right do I have to be happy when
there's so much suffering in the world?

305
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,707
I guess you could say,
what right do you have to be unhappy?

306
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,445
True.

307
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,281
You know, for a country pumpkin,
you're quite philosophical.

308
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,219
What?

309
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,520
It's a "country bumpkin"
not a "country pumpkin."

310
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,456
What?

311
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,977
I think I prefer the way you said it.

312
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:42,866
Well.

313
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,170
Thank you for walking me home.

314
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,773
Oh, you're welcome. It was a pleasure.

315
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,955
Ruth...

316
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,127
Do you want to go out with me sometime?

317
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,593
I'm free after Shabbat.

318
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:20,271
- Wait. You want to go out tonight?
- We're not getting any younger, Levinson.

319
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,575
You can wait there if you want.

320
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,985
"Forever yours...

321
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,754
"Ira."

322
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:44,261
You want me to read you another one?

323
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,134
But...

324
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,950
Could you maybe...

325
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,325
Could you maybe come back?

326
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:12,076
Carolina Thunder's a good draw.
You sure you can handle him?

327
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:15,360
<i>Savannah, Georgia fans,
put your hands together</i>

328
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,130

That looks familiar.

342
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,816
<i>You really gotta wonder
where this guy is mentally right now.</i>

343
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,118
<i>The incident with Rango
before he rode...</i>

344
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,721
- Good ride, Luke.
- <i>...has affected his mental focus.</i>

345
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:07,337
Damn it!

346
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,783
Return of the conquering hero.

347
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,552
Hey, Mom.

348
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:58,356
- You want eggs?
- No.

349
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:03,026
So, how did it go?

350
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:10,435
Well, you left the ring on your own
two feet. So, it's a victory for me.

351
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,571
When are you gonna stop
the bull riding, Luke?

352
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,309
Mom, I told you, I can't.

353
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,211
Really? So you forgot
about your head injury?

354
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,081
- I'm a grown man.
- I just want you to get to be an old man.

355
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,451
Thanks.

356
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:35,951
You're scaring the hell out of me, Luke.
Please just give it up.

357
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:38,161
Don't worry.

358
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:44,467
So, what's going on?

359
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:48,172
Nothing.

360
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,142
Nothing.

361
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,315
I met a girl.

362
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,617
- You meet girls all the time.
- No.

363
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,202
This one's different.

364
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:08,293
- I can't stop thinking about her.
- So?

365
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,828
She moves to New York in two months.

366
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:16,133
So, I guess that's that, right?

367
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,570
- You soak your hand in ice water.
- I do no such thing.

368
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm the only person at the hospital
who still talks to you.

369
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,171
- Am I interrupting?
- I was just about to strangle him! But...

370
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,581
Strangle me before dinner so I don't
have to eat another hospital meal.

371
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,149
The sooner the better.

372
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,551
Enjoy his letters.

373
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,589
You look good.

374
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:44,194
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

375
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:04,614
"July 12th, 1941."

376
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,479
That was a good day.

377
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,679
"Dearest Ruth,

378
00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:18,429
"the memories of our adventure
are always dancing in my mind."

379
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,766
<i>Seems like yesterday</i>

380
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,835
<i>you helped me see the world
in a whole different way.</i>

381
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,371
...why you insist on getting all
dressed up just to go to a movie.

382
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,107
What? In Vienna, everyone
always dresses up.

383
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,643
Even just to stroll in the park.
It's elegant.

384
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,712
It is also July in North Carolina.

385
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,713
Let me show you something.
I have to show you something!

386
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,983
What? No. Ruth, we're going to be late.

387
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,899
It's by an artist in Black Mountain.

388
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,102
- What's Black Mountain?
- It's an arts college.

389
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,671
A whole movement,
right here in North Carolina.

390
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,773
And isn't it wonderful?

391
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,075
Such a personal landscape.

392
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:09,613
It's so direct, and frank and...

393
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:14,251
simplified and distorted.
All at the same time.

394
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,220
Don't you love it?

395
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,027
I love how much you love it.

396
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,035
Come on.

397
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,561
What? No, no, no.

398
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,739
Excuse me.

399
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:47,551
All right. You want to dance?
Let's dance.

400
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,146
<i>That kiss, our first kiss...</i>

401
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:52,115
<i>it was a promise of everything to come.</i>

402
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:03,494
<i>The days became months.</i>

403
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,531
<i>We ventured on weekends to new places.</i>

404
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,600
<i>Never once had I been on vacation.</i>

405
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,405
<i>Had I, though, it could never
have been as memorable as these.</i>

406
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:17,840
What?

407
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,382
It's the first time North Carolina
has felt like home.

408
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:58,650
But yet, with my most important
student I am a total failure.

409
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,852
Ruth has fallen in love
with contemporary art.

410
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,922
Father thinks that art stopped
with Matisse and Picasso.

411
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,158
I don't think it stopped.
But it's taken a long nap.

412
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,694
You try and raise
your children right, Ira,

413
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,697
and they grow up
and think for themselves.

414
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,299
- Very good. Very good.
- It's tragedy!

415
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,090
It was nice seeing you talk like that.

416
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:26,210
Nothing would make me happier
than a lifetime of days like this.

417
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,679
Hey, Ruth. I need to ask you something.

418
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,814
Wait.

419
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,389
I want a big family.
A really big family.

420
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:44,328
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl. And...

421
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:49,299
With everything that's going on now...

422
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:54,498
I feel this need, this responsibility,
to bring life back into the world.

423
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,055
Sounds perfect.

424
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:04,681
You can ask me now.

425
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,120
Ruth, I know I'm not a rich man.

426
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,089
Don't know the last thing about art.

427
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,749
All I can do is promise to love you
every second of every day

428
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:18,128
- for the rest of my life.
- Really?

429
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,369
- Will you marry me?
- Yes!

430
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,505
Yes, yes, yes! What took you so long?

431
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,144
Welcome to the family.

432
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,846
- Thank you.
- So good to have you.

433
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:43,720
"With love, Ira."

434
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:07,753
I'll come back tomorrow.

435
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,536
- Mr. Levinson?
- Do I know you?

436
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,938
Luke Collins.

437
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,442
Remember, off 119...

438
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,445
when you decided to bust open
that guard rail?

439
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:20,250
Oh, you saved my life.

440
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,351
Thank you.

441
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,520
Hi.

442
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,665
Hi.

443
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:34,164
- Is this your Luke?
- This is my friend Luke.

444
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:37,835
- Yes.
- Your friend.

445
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,507
What are you doing here?

446
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:48,480
I... found this
on the floor of my truck.

447
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,549
Figured you might wanna
hang on to that one.

448
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,189
<i>December 7th, 1941.</i>

449
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:02,160
<i>Nothing made me happier than knowing
we were going to be married.</i>

450
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,432
<i>But the world you and your family
had fled finally caught up to us.</i>

451
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,234
<i>The United States of America</i>

452
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,904
<i>was suddenly and deliberately attacked</i>

453
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:19,462
<i>by Naval and Air Forces
of the Empire of Japan.</i>

454
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,113
- Promise me you'll come back.
- I will.

455
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,283
Promise me, Ira!

456
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,484
I promise.

457
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:31,288
Look at me. I promise.

458
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,065
Come back to me!

459
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,566
Help!

460
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,522
We can't just leave him out there.

461
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,348
Help! Help me!

462
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:15,265
Somebody help me!

463
00:47:16,265 --> 00:47:17,835
I gotta save him.

464
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,239
Are you crazy?

465
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,473
Those Panzers are 200 yards away.
You'll never make it back.

466
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:26,044
I'll make it back I made
a promise I have to keep.

467
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:29,780
You getting killed ain't gonna
help anyone but the Germans.

468
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:36,649
Help me! Please!

469
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,894
Oh, my God!

470
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:43,726
Can somebody help me?

471
00:47:49,122 --> 00:47:51,129
Shit.

472
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,544
Put your arms around my neck.

473
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:08,184
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to Ruth.

474
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,587
That was goddamn crazy, Levinson.
Do you know that?

475
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,474
Shit!

476
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:41,418
I'm very sorry.

477
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,534
<i>When I came back from the war,
I wasn't the same.</i>

478
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,738
<i>I was fighting a bigger battle now.</i>

479
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,874
<i>And I couldn't honor the promise
I had made to you.</i>

480
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:52,690
Your mother says you've been home
since Monday.

481
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:03,895
I can't pretend to know what you've
been through but I want to help.

482
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,781
Don't you think
I deserve an explanation?

483
00:50:21,784 --> 00:50:25,077
Well... I do.

484
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,839
You don't understand.
It wasn't the injury itself.

485
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:45,693
The wound got infected.
I ran a high fever for almost two weeks.

486
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,212
You need to see more doctors.
Get a second opinion.

487
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:52,850
Don't you think I've already done that?
There's nothing they can do.

488
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,521
This is my life, I have to accept it.
But I don't want it to be yours.

489
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,625
But there is still a chance.
I want to marry you.

490
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,260
If you marry me,
you may never have a family.

491
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,630
Are you honestly willing
to give that up?

492
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,262
<i>The war was over...</i>

493
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:44,060
<i>and as far as I was concerned
so was my life.</i>

494
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,908
We're closed!

495
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:58,381
I know what you're doing! You cannot
tell me what I'm willing to give up!

496
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:03,721
When you went to war
I was here, clinging to the hope

497
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:07,090
that you would come home
and we would get married.

498
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:11,060
Yes, and have kids.
But that's a dream, Ira.

499
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,281
You're real.

500
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:17,301
I don't know what the future holds
but I know there's no future without you.

501
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:25,308
Unless you don't love me anymore.

502
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,155
<i>And in that moment we both knew...</i>

503
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,251
<i>a chance at life together</i>

504
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:16,639
<i>was greater than the risk
of being apart.</i>

505
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:30,139
It was really nice of you
to bring that photo.

506
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,943
Yeah, well, he sure
has been through a lot.

507
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,044
Yeah.

508
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,450
Well, you take it easy.

509
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,652
Luke.

510
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:51,028
It was really good to see you.

511
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,774
What are you doing right now?

512
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,574
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

513
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,475
- I'm ready.
- All right.

514
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,479
- I'm so ready.
- I'll give you the little stick.

515
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,548
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Well, ladies first.

516
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:16,504
You know, I'm still getting used
to your Southern gentlemanly ways.

517
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:18,480
I'm still trying to impress you.

518
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:23,393
- It's kind of working.
- A little.

519
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:28,490
Just don't let me win.
I enjoy good, healthy competition.

520
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,499
Noted.

521
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,577
- What are you doing?
- You told me not to let you win.

522
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:44,848
So I'm going with plan B. Distraction.

523
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:56,827
Yes! Yes! Sorry!

524
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,140
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

525
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,331
I love mac and cheese.

526
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,334
- Comfort food?
- Yeah.

527
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,436
What's your comfort food?

528
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,440
Kolduny.

529
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,842
- Kol-what?
- Kolduny.

530
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:17,080
They're these super, super delicious
Polish meat dumplings that my mom makes.

531
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,657
We serve them at the diner
and I promise you,

532
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:23,120
with one bite of those it would put
your mac and cheese to shame.

533
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,854
Is that an invitation?

534
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,724
Maybe.

535
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:30,427
Oh. No, no. Help yourself.

536
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,564
- No! Just a bite.
- Yeah.

537
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,398
So, when did your parents
come to the States?

538
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,603
- Before I was born.
- That's crazy. I couldn't have done that.

539
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,705
- Really?
- No.

540
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,575
You ride bulls for a living.
I mean, you could do anything.

541
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,277
Riding bulls has got nothing
on moving clear across the world.

542
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,879
- What?
- Yeah.

543
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,781
Your parents had to adjust
their whole life.

544
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:54,350
No, no, they didn't adjust anything.

545
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,989
Growing up with immigrant parents,
my life was always really different.

546
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,559
Everyone was always screaming
in weird languages.

547
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:04,011
I brought smelly,
strange snacks to school.

548
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,363
My pants were too short always.

549
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,199
Pants still are too short.

550
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,402
I mean, growing up on a cattle ranch,
everybody I knew was the same.

551
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:16,556
Everybody you know is... you know,
fourth generation cattle ranchers.

552
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,342
- Jealous.
- Why?

553
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:22,045
I wanted to be like everyone else
when I was little.

554
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:26,049
The reason I like you is because
you're nothing like everyone else.

555
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:31,757
You're not so bad yourself.

556
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,028
I think before I met you,
the closest thing I came to cattle was...

557
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,534
- steak.
- Steak?

558
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:42,282
- Time to get you on a bull, then.
- A bull?

559
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:44,301
- Yeah.
- No way!

560
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,638
- One bull, one time.
- No! How about one horse, one time?

561
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,775
- We could do that. Next week.
- Okay.

562
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,247
I've got an idea.

563
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,582
- It's so good.
- What?

564
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,919
- So good! Come on!
- What? Where am I going?

565
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,554
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

566
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,656
- After you.
- Thank you.

567
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,093
Ready?

568
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:14,596
- Crazy face.
- Yeah.

569
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,658
Yeah, that looks good.

570
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:44,792
Thank you.

571
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:51,201
Okay.

572
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,170
There you go.

573
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:58,506
Put your feet in. Grab the reins.

574
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,416
- You ready?
- Yeah.

575
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,685
Pull back on those reins.

576
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,819
Come on.

577
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:13,857
Hey, there we go, there we go!

578
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,560
We're going backwards! This is awesome!

579
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,194
Yeah, there you go, just like that.
Lay your hands down.

580
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:21,163
Okay.

581
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:30,239
How are you doing that?
Why am I bouncing so much?

582
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:34,443
- Okay, ease up on those reins a little bit.
- All right.

583
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,225
Atta girl!

584
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,193
I don't think you can keep up with me!

585
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:09,379
You know, I have to admit
you're pretty good on a horse.

586
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,747
Well, thank you.

587
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:18,522
But I don't know... I bet
you couldn't beat me to the barn.

588
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,059
Oh, I wouldn't go that way!

589
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:24,893
Oh, my God!

590
00:59:25,928 --> 00:59:27,697
Oh, my God!

591
00:59:30,499 --> 00:59:31,869
Come here.

592
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,732
- I tried to tell you.
- I know you did.

593
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,411
- Well, this is... this is home.
- Wow. This is nice.

594
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:44,314
- Really nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.

595
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,218
Oh, the shower's right in there,
and there should be towels and everything.

596
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,119
Okay.

597
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,155
Hey, Sophia?

598
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,890
Did you want soup?

599
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,726
Oh, you make soup, too?

600
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:02,161
Kind of. Soup, soup, soup...

601
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:18,981
Oh, my God.

602
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:50,840
Come on.

603
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,646
There you go.

604
01:01:57,746 --> 01:02:00,148
Put your hands right here.

605
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:06,020
The goal's pretty simple. All you
gotta do is hang on for eight seconds.

606
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,200
There's nothing to it.

607
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,704
Yeah, some bulls are nice like that.

608
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,406
This is... Yeah, okay.

609
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,507
Excuse us, sorry.

610
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:27,776
Sorry.

611
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,622
So how do you know
which one you're gonna get?

612
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:40,824
You don't.

613
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,760
<i>You pick from a bowl.</i>

614
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,530
<i>...from Walkertown, North Carolina</i>

615
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,799
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

616
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:54,703
<i>Number four is the chip you selected
and that is Gunpowder and Lead, Luke.</i>

617
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:58,608
<i>Jared Middleton reaching in
and pulling out chip number two.</i>

618
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,643
<i>You have Asteroid.</i>

619
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,515
- That's impossible!
- Yeah!

620
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:09,085
You can only touch with your riding hand.
All other touching's against the rules.

621
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,055
Okay. Okay. I got it. I got it.

622
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:17,001
<i>Take a look at the local hero Luke Collins,
from Walkertown, North Carolina.</i>

623
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:23,231
Let's go!

624
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,826
If you are off balance
even a little, you lose points.

625
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:54,229
<i>But if you control the bull,
you get style points.</i>

626
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:59,801
Is that how you do the hand?
That? More or less.

627
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:11,581
The bull is judged too,
on speed, agility and power.

628
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,717
<i>Whether it bucks or blows out,
turns back around on you.</i>

629
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,966
Yeah!

630
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,151
Some bulls are just plain mean.
And others...

631
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:53,289
<i>Others are monsters.</i>

632
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:59,995
- Let's brave the storm.
- Let's do it.

633
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,742
This is certainly better
than the hospital, isn't it?

634
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,415
How are you feeling?

635
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,818
The better question is, how do I look?

636
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,988
- Very handsome.
- All I care about.

637
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,160
Hold on one second. Hello?

638
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,030
- <i>Hi, Sophia. This is Adrienne.</i>
- Hi, Ms. Francis.

639
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,400
<i>My client has an exhibit in Charlotte
next weekend. Can you be there?</i>

640
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,929
- Yeah, I'd love to. That sounds great.
- <i>This could be a real opportunity for us.</i>

641
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:41,605
- Okay.
- <i>I'll email you the details.</i>

642
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,940
- Okay. All right, I'll talk to you soon.
- <i>Bye, Sophia.</i>

643
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,174
Thanks, bye.

644
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:50,045
- Good news?
- Yeah.

645
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,616
The woman I'm working for this summer,

646
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:56,370
she has a client with an art exhibit in
Charlotte and wants me to help her out.

647
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,888
I didn't know you had
an interest in art.

648
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,091
Only since I was, like, five.

649
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,627
- Ruth also loved art.
- Yeah.

650
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:07,464
Yeah, I remember the story
with the painting in the hotel lobby.

651
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:12,267
You know... you've heard
of Black Mountain College?

652
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,272
I'm doing my senior thesis
on it right now.

653
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:20,374
That's where I was headed when I got
in that fight with the guardrail.

654
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,708
Are you sure this is how you want
to spend your honeymoon?

655
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:27,784
I promise you're going
to love it, I promise!

656
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,719
I'd rather we'd just stayed in bed.

657
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:53,738
<i>You weren't able to engage your passion
for contemporary art in our little town.</i>

658
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:59,881
<i>So Black Mountain College was a godsend.</i>

659
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,727
It's so amazing!

660
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,029
Really look at your work
to understand it.

661
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:16,600
But I want to be able to control
the accidents and not leave them to fate

662
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,669
or the Lord or chance,
whatever you want to call it.

663
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,405
I teach you to see.

664
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:28,010
Then even an accident will have
purpose and direction.

665
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,619
Oh, I love it!

666
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:38,121
For over 500 years,
artists have been reproducing

667
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,223
quite literally what they see
in front of them.

668
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:44,159
Then Kandinsky came and broke
all the rules, all of them!

669
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:46,930
Sorry.

670
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,498
I love it!

671
01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:59,742
I can't believe we met
Josef Albers today.

672
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,625
It's just a bit further.

673
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,991
You all right?

674
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:21,296
- You ready?
- Yeah.

675
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,035
You like it?

676
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:30,139
<i>From one happy day to the next</i>

677
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:34,010
<i>we began the process
of creating a life together.</i>

678
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,580
- Doesn't look like anyone's home.
- No, I don't think you should go in.

679
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,015
- Ira!
- What?

680
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,918
Well, let's just use the key.

681
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:45,487
No! Oh, my God!

682
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:49,825
- You wonderful person!
- Wait, wait, wait. Come here.

683
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,662
Yeah, there.

684
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,400
No.

685
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,446
There.

686
01:09:04,072 --> 01:09:06,543
There! First thing you see
when you come in!

687
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,078
<i>Life was busy and happy for us.</i>

688
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,749
<i>I took over my dad's booming business</i>

689
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:15,252
<i>and you found a job
teaching at the local school.</i>

690
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,788
Oh! Look at this!

691
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,791
You're all on your way
to becoming math geniuses.

692
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,693
Solve the problems on the board.

693
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,263
If you have any questions, please ask.

694
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,998
It sounds like you made her very happy.

695
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:32,334
I did.

696
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:34,338
For a while.

697
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,043
- His first cowboy hat.
- That is so cute!

698
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,981
Never took it off.
He ate in it. He slept in it.

699
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:46,882
He even tried to glue it to his head
so it wouldn't come off!

700
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,551
- Mom!
- What?

701
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,123
He broke his arm riding a calf
when he was seven.

702
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:56,026
I found him sneaking into the barn
at night to practice,

703
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,428
hanging on with his non-cast arm.

704
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,230
Even then, I couldn't get him
to stop riding when he shouldn't.

705
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,748
- Hey. There you go.
- Thank you. Sweet.

706
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,213
That's Luke's dad, Jack.
He was a great man.

707
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,265
Great rider, too.

708
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:25,220
You know, even if you stop now, you'd
still have a better career than he had.

709
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:30,477
- What happened?
- He died of a heart attack.

710
01:10:30,577 --> 01:10:33,995
Yeah, almost five years ago now.

711
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,067
How about a little dessert?

712
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,837
Luke, wait till you see
what I made for you.

713
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:44,262
Sophia, it's worth the calories.

714
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,344
No.

715
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,219
How come your mom keeps talking
about you giving up riding?

716
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,548
She's just being an overprotective mom.

717
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,486
- How bad did you get hurt?
- Sophia

718
01:11:05,586 --> 01:11:09,832
No. I know all riders are bound to get hurt.
It's not a matter of "if" but "when."

719
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,202
That's right. They say all bull riders
are either stupid or crazy.

720
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,204
Yeah, and which one are you?

721
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:21,309
I don't know. I guess a little of both.

722
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:22,704
What are you doing?

723
01:11:22,804 --> 01:11:26,416
This is a new painting by an artist
that Adrienne Francis represents.

724
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,218
You know, the woman I'm interning for?

725
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,087
$80 grand, really?

726
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,855
A lot of people think he's a genius.

727
01:11:33,955 --> 01:11:39,028
Yeah, he most certainly is getting people
to fork over $80 grand for that.

728
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:46,202
Are you sure that you wanna go
to this gallery showing in Charlotte?

729
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,104
- You want me to, right?
- Of course.

730
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:52,775
- Then I'll be there.
- Yeah, but you're riding that afternoon.

731
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,143
I'll be there.

732
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:12,160
Don't you look nice!

733
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:14,797
Never seen you in a coat and tie before.

734
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,814
Yeah, doesn't happen too often.

735
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:21,404
Oh, that's my boss, Adrienne Francis.

736
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,740
- I gotta go. Okay?
- Yeah. Go.

737
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,659
Hi. Sophia. Nice to meet you.

738
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:32,580
Hopefully, Sophia will be joining me
in New York, and my team.

739
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,654
You usually find these sort of things
in process art or lenticular prints

740
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:40,357
but it's very rare in brushwork.

741
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,404
That is what makes
this piece so special.

742
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:08,683
If you have any questions,
let me know. Thank you.

743
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:13,454
- Excuse me.
- Just one second.

744
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,927
It'll be worth twice that
a year from now.

745
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:20,029
At $20,000, it's a steal.

746
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,899
- Sure.
- Good. Do you wanna get it?

747
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,481
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

748
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,987
I'll fly you to New York.
See the space, meet the team.

749
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:38,414
- Yes!
- These are some very important people.

750
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,817
- So if you can't do it, don't say yes.
- No

751
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,619
I know you have finals
and other commitments.

752
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,688
I'd love to.
This is the most important thing to me.

753
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:51,974
Oh! Luke, hi. This is Adrienne Francis.
Adrienne, this is my boyfriend, Luke.

754
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:54,096
- Nice to meet you, Miss Francis.
- Nice to meet you, Luke.

755
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:57,205
- Are you in college with Sophia?
- No, never made it to college.

756
01:13:57,305 --> 01:13:59,086
Luke's a professional bull rider.

757
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,538
I've never met a professional
bull rider before.

758
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:04,840
Well, probably not too many
in Manhattan.

759
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,376
Are you an art lover, like Sophia?

760
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,411
No, I can't say that I am.

761
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,348
What did you think of tonight?

762
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:16,385
- Honestly?
- Of course.

763
01:14:17,097 --> 01:14:21,983
Well... I think there's more
bullshit here than where I work.

764
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,475
I like him. Keep this one.

765
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,679
How could you say that to her?

766
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:46,315
It was a joke.

767
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,718
To the woman who's gonna be my boss?

768
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,620
To the woman who I hope
is gonna launch my career?

769
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,555
- That lady? Come on.
- No, you come on.

770
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:56,225
You know how hard I have just tried
to fit into your world.

771
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,594
- Why can't you try to fit into mine?
- I do!

772
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,052
It was a joke, okay?
She thought it was funny. She laughed.

773
01:15:03,152 --> 01:15:07,268
You don't know that. What if she
was just trying to be polite?

774
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:09,305
Does this make sense?

775
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:11,828
- What?
- How are we gonna make this work?

776
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:15,878
Do you really see yourself living on a ranch?
Working a ranch the rest of your life?

777
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:19,881
And what am I gonna do?

778
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:21,751
Move to Manhattan?

779
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,520
Go out with your artist friends?
Go to brunch?

780
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,330
Talk about squiggly lines on a white canvas
like they're more than squiggly lines

781
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:29,892
- on a white canvas?
- I know all of that, I do. I get it.

782
01:15:43,638 --> 01:15:45,840
I just...

783
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:49,077
I just don't know how to make this work.

784
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,580
I don't know either.

785
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,975
But I know that I want to.

786
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,840
Are we just crazy?

787
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,221
Do you think it could work between us?

788
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:26,581
We just come from such different worlds.

789
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:31,020
But I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

790
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,441
Not everybody gets that.

791
01:16:34,722 --> 01:16:36,002
You did.

792
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,529
It wasn't that simple.

793
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:50,465
<i>As the years went by I could see
how much she wanted to start a family.</i>

794
01:16:51,973 --> 01:16:56,477
<i>We tried to adopt.
But it wasn't so easy back then.</i>

795
01:17:21,806 --> 01:17:25,117
Now, today we're going to learn about...

796
01:17:25,217 --> 01:17:27,575
my favorite...

797
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:29,395
book.

798
01:17:29,495 --> 01:17:33,280
It's called <i>Pippi Longstocking.</i>

799
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:57,505
If anyone teases him about this,
they'll have me to deal with.

800
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:14,729
Good morning.

801
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:21,698
Hello.

802
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,300
My name is Ruth Levinson.
I'm Daniel's teacher.

803
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:31,140
I came here because I'm slightly concerned.
He's... he's falling asleep in class.

804
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,874
<i>We were surprised to learn
that Daniel McDonald</i>

805
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:37,613
<i>was being raised
by a half-brother and his wife.</i>

806
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,049
<i>Neither seemed to care
if he ate or starved.</i>

807
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,285
He's a very bright boy.

808
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:48,056
Infinite potential.
Maybe I could tutor him after class?

809
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,359
- All right.
- Yes?

810
01:19:36,904 --> 01:19:39,207
Are you a wolf?

811
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,476
No, ma'am.

812
01:19:43,277 --> 01:19:46,508
- Are you a bear?
- No, ma'am.

813
01:19:47,615 --> 01:19:49,451
Are you a boy?

814
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,853
Yes, ma'am.

815
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,798
Boys use knives and forks.

816
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,568
Almost.

817
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:09,972
Yeah. Okay.

818
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:13,075
What star is that?

819
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:17,578
- The North Star, Polaris.
- Good. Look.

820
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:23,336
"That was because she didn't
want to turn around to get home.

821
01:20:23,436 --> 01:20:27,722
"When she reached Tommy's
and Annika's gate, she stopped.

822
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:34,563
<i>Pretty soon, the tutoring was every day.</i>

823
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,559
<i>And sometimes he stayed for dinner.</i>

824
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:52,482
<i>We never said he was the child
we could never have,</i>

825
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:54,917
<i>but even so...</i>

826
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:06,629
What do you think?

827
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:10,798
She's making her son dinner. Right?

828
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:12,700
Yeah.

829
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:20,109
I hate taking him back there.
Why can't we adopt him?

830
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,378
Because they're his legal guardians.
There's nothing we can do.

831
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:25,548
- Did you speak to the lawyer?
- I did, and that's what he said.

832
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:28,117
They don't care about him. They don't!

833
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,683
They're his next of kin and they're proud
people. They're not gonna let us take...

834
01:21:30,783 --> 01:21:33,221
There must be something more we can do.

835
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,665
Ruth?

836
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,233
We better go.

837
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:33,147
- You be good. Okay, pal?
- Okay.

838
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,143
Maybe I'll raise chickens...

839
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:39,688
- or work at the factory.
- If that's what you want.

840
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,525
You can be anything you want,
Daniel McDonald.

841
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:47,694
Anything at all. A farmer,
a lawyer, an astronomer.

842
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,665
You're a very clever boy.

843
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:54,336
- You really think so?
- Yeah! I know so.

844
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,306
All right, come on.

845
01:23:04,845 --> 01:23:07,015
- Okay.
- I'm just saying goodbye.

846
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,787
You can't... you can't stop me!
I'm just saying goodbye!

847
01:23:10,887 --> 01:23:13,756
I know you are, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the car.

848
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:15,791
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.

849
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:19,061
- Please reconsider. Please reconsider!
- There's nothing we can do.

850
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:22,865
- He deserves better than this.
- Sweetheart, get in the car.

851
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:24,600
- They don't care about him.
- I know they don't.

852
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,368
They don't care about him!

853
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:39,580
Ruth.

854
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:43,317
Ruth.

855
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,023
What was I supposed to do?

856
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:55,464
Fight for custody.

857
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,433
From a half-brother
in small-town North Carolina?

858
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:01,137
Come on. We wouldn't have had a chance!

859
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:05,005
And who knows what they
would've done to Daniel.

860
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,770
We were a family.

861
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:15,324
We are a family.

862
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,204
Ruth, you are my family.

863
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:41,411
I wanted kids too, you know.

864
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:55,322
We never saw Daniel again.

865
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,395
Oh, my God.

866
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,650
Oh, shit.

867
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:05,862
<i>Luke Collins is trying to come around.</i>

868
01:26:05,962 --> 01:26:10,266
<i>The bull fighter's taking the bull away
in the other direction.</i>

869
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:13,335
<i>I think he's gonna be okay.
He's trying to get up. He is!</i>

870
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:16,338
<i>Let me get him something
to make him feel a little bit better.</i>

871
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:18,341
<i>92 points!</i>

872
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:20,676
<i>264 on three bulls!</i>

873
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:24,044
<i>Luke Collins is your clear-cut winner...</i>

874
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:32,986
<i>...number nine spot in the world.</i>

875
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,560
Are you okay, Luke?

876
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,376
I'm fine.

877
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:48,854
- You have an amazing time in New York.
- Yes, I will.

878
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,731
You impressed Adrienne,
you'll impress her team.

879
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,608
- Okay. Gotta go.
- This is what you've always wanted!

880
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,877
- I know!
- Bye! See you on Monday.

881
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,515
Hey, babe. I'm walking
to the taxi right now.

882
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:01,717
<i>Sophia, it's Luiz.</i>

883
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:04,712
- Hi, Luiz.
- <i>Something's happened to Luke.</i>

884
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:10,658
Hi, can I help you?

885
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:13,515
I need to see my boyfriend, Luke Collins.
He came in an ambulance earlier.

886
01:27:13,615 --> 01:27:18,032
- I need to see him.
- I'm sorry. Only family can visit.

887
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:21,002
Okay. Can I at least know how he is?

888
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:25,707
His condition is stable, but he's getting
an MRI. He took a pretty hard fall.

889
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:28,810
If you wanna take a seat,
I'll check with the doctor.

890
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,278
I'll let you know.

891
01:27:32,006 --> 01:27:34,181
Thank you.

892
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:42,791
So, are you light-headed, dizzy? Nausea?

893
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:50,654
I'd like you to stay overnight
for observation.

894
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,340
Sweetie. What are you doing here?

895
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,035
I came as soon as I heard.

896
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:02,345
- Aren't you supposed to be in New York?
- No, no. I should be here.

897
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:07,316
- Thank God you're okay.
- I'm fine.

898
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:10,951
You're lucky to be alive,
is what you are.

899
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:13,455
- What?
- I just got a little dizzy, that's all.

900
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:18,293
Luke, you need to stop downplaying
the severity of your condition.

901
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:21,630
If you care about your friend,
you need to make him understand

902
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,197
that his riding days are over.

903
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,273
What is he talking about?

904
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:39,981
I'm tired, okay?
Can we just talk about it tomorrow?

905
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:44,035
Ms. Francis, I am so sorry
about all of this.

906
01:28:44,135 --> 01:28:46,954
<i>Please, Sophia, I understand
you can't meet the team this weekend,</i>

907
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:50,492
<i>given the circumstances.
And I do hope Luke is okay.</i>

908
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:52,983
Yeah, me, too.

909
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:58,900
I don't know when I'm gonna
be able to come to New York.

910
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,769
<i>Oh, really?</i>

911
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,905
<i>Wait a minute. You're not rethinking
the internship, are you?</i>

912
01:29:05,539 --> 01:29:09,175
<i>Look, Sophia... I think you have
a bright future ahead of you,</i>

913
01:29:09,275 --> 01:29:12,413
<i>but you're going to have to figure out
for yourself what that's going to be.</i>

914
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,948
I know.

915
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:31,901
<i>World Finals qualifier from Walkertown,
North Carolina, Luke Collins!</i>

916
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:36,538
- <i>And he is ready to rock and roll!</i>
- Let's go!

917
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:40,275
<i>Luke Collins outside
in the middle, rocked over!</i>

918
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,910
<i>He is just...</i>

919
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,632
<i>He's riding his bull, he's outside...</i>

920
01:29:49,185 --> 01:29:54,488
<i>A double flip somersault
face-plant into the dirt.</i>

921
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,959
<i>You've gotta get him out of there!</i>

922
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:04,623
<i>Yeah, no doubt about it. I mean,
he took a devastating shot right there</i>

923
01:30:04,723 --> 01:30:06,699
<i>by one of the PBR's best.</i>

924
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:09,706
<i>Our sports medicine team
are coming in right now</i>

925
01:30:09,806 --> 01:30:13,459
<i>to take care of the young man
from North Carolina.</i>

926
01:30:13,559 --> 01:30:15,377
<i>Talk about your scary moments.</i>

927
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:18,547
<i>The degree of difficulty here
is impossible to calculate.</i>

928
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:21,550
<i>The official buck-off time, 4.7 seconds.</i>

929
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,285
<i>Right now, our medical staff
is attending.</i>

930
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,897
That's fine, right here.

931
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,900
No. It's fine, please. Thanks.

932
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

933
01:30:42,215 --> 01:30:45,272
- I'll take the bag.
- No, I got it.

934
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:14,322
Thank you.

935
01:31:14,668 --> 01:31:16,904
Luke...

936
01:31:18,839 --> 01:31:21,110
I'm really sorry.

937
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:26,447
I know how hard it must be to give up
that whole part of your life.

938
01:31:30,784 --> 01:31:31,900
You're kidding, right?

939
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,923
- Sophia...
- You heard the doctors.

940
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:37,559
- Doctors don't know everything.
- Are you crazy?

941
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:41,013
I watched what happened to you on YouTube.
You were in a coma for 10 days.

942
01:31:41,113 --> 01:31:43,916
I told you, every time a rider
gets in that chute, he could die.

943
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:46,551
That's bullshit!
Your situation is different!

944
01:31:51,438 --> 01:31:53,408
You have to quit!

945
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,311
- You have to!
- I can't!

946
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,913
I can't be with someone if every time
they walk out the door...

947
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,549
- I don't know if I'm gonna see them again!
- Then that's your choice.

948
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:04,017
Yeah, I chose you!
I chose you over New York!

949
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:07,823
Over my internship.
I chose you over everything.

950
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:11,259
I didn't ask you to change your life.
You can't expect me to change mine.

951
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:17,683
This is what I do.

952
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:21,635
It's all I know.

953
01:32:24,471 --> 01:32:28,511
- This is my life.
- I thought this was our life.

954
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,280
I can't watch you ruin it.

955
01:32:53,433 --> 01:32:55,473
- Hi.
- Right upstairs.

956
01:32:55,573 --> 01:32:57,171
Thanks.

957
01:33:02,442 --> 01:33:04,178
How was...

958
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,486
How was New York?

959
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:13,987
I never made it.

960
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:17,557
And I broke up with Luke anyway.

961
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:21,792
I'm really sorry. Come here. Come here.

962
01:33:30,003 --> 01:33:32,539
How can I help?

963
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,746
Take my mind off of it.

964
01:33:41,348 --> 01:33:43,719
What happened
after that fight over Daniel?

965
01:33:43,819 --> 01:33:46,754
Are you sure you don't wanna talk
about you and Luke?

966
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:51,725
Yeah, I'm sure.

967
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:57,030
It's a scary thing.

968
01:33:57,664 --> 01:34:00,968
How the people you're closest to can...

969
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:04,137
so quickly become...

970
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:05,706
strangers.

971
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,283
I can't do this anymore.

972
01:34:39,773 --> 01:34:42,776
I'm going crazy.

973
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,716
I know it's not your fault.

974
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:53,247
I have to go.

975
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:40,500
- No, please don't!
- I just need to say something.

976
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,169
I need to say something.

977
01:35:47,574 --> 01:35:50,545
You know I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you.

978
01:35:50,645 --> 01:35:54,182
You're just the most amazing,
beautiful girl I ever met and somehow...

979
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:56,804
I don't know, somehow you chose me.

980
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,190
But how I loved you then it's...

981
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:05,636
it's nothing compared
to how I love you now.

982
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:10,464
Now, I love you with everything
inside of me.

983
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,304
I think you should go.

984
01:36:17,337 --> 01:36:20,540
I love you so much,
I just want you to be happy.

985
01:36:21,241 --> 01:36:24,754
Even if that happiness
no longer includes me.

986
01:37:04,651 --> 01:37:07,455
Love requires sacrifice.

987
01:37:11,324 --> 01:37:12,569
Always.

988
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:20,203
<i>And from that day on, Sophia,</i>

989
01:38:20,303 --> 01:38:25,432
<i>it wasn't exactly happily ever after,
but it was pretty close.</i>

990
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:29,637
<i>We focused on celebrating
all the wonderful things we had</i>

991
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:33,407
<i>rather than regretting
the things we didn't.</i>

992
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:37,010
<i>Every anniversary,
we would drive to Black Mountain.</i>

993
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,147
<i>I still wrote Ruth letters</i>

994
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,083
<i>even though I saw her every day.</i>

995
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:53,893
Ruthie.

996
01:38:57,263 --> 01:38:59,432
Ruth.

997
01:39:25,058 --> 01:39:28,662
<i>So many wonderful years.</i>

998
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:32,311
<i>But, of course, not nearly enough.</i>

999
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:48,049
<i>The paintings Ruth and I had collected</i>

1000
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:51,686
<i>only served as a reminder
of what I had lost.</i>

1001
01:39:53,186 --> 01:39:55,909
<i>So I packed them away.</i>

1002
01:39:57,924 --> 01:40:00,961
- Can I help you?
- My name is Andrea McDonald.

1003
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:04,498
I believe you knew my husband...

1004
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:07,200
Daniel McDonald?

1005
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:13,808
He collapsed in his classroom
early one morning before school.

1006
01:40:13,908 --> 01:40:16,544
A brain aneurysm.

1007
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:18,761
That was six years ago.

1008
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:25,115
- I'm very sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

1009
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:28,712
He was a teacher?

1010
01:40:28,812 --> 01:40:30,625
A professor.

1011
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:33,827
Physics and astronomy
at the University College London.

1012
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,263
Astronomy.

1013
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:38,966
I moved back to the States
a few years ago.

1014
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:44,504
When I saw your wife's obituary in the
paper I knew I had to bring you this.

1015
01:40:49,509 --> 01:40:51,087
It meant a lot to him.

1016
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:52,072
You did everything you could
with Luke, Sophia.

1017
01:41:52,572 --> 01:41:54,129
You sacrificed.

1018
01:41:55,676 --> 01:41:58,166
I have loved spending time with you.

1019
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,017
You've made me very happy.

1020
01:42:25,171 --> 01:42:27,747
What are you doing up so late?

1021
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:30,944
I won tonight.

1022
01:42:31,044 --> 01:42:32,797
Puts me fifth in the world.

1023
01:42:37,283 --> 01:42:39,385
Are you really gonna start on me now?

1024
01:42:39,485 --> 01:42:41,421
No.

1025
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:47,493
- The mistakes you make are your own.
- Mistake? Jesus, Mom!

1026
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:52,567
These risks you're taking...
I don't know why.

1027
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,043
I'm just trying to keep
this ranch in the family.

1028
01:42:55,143 --> 01:42:57,203
For you.

1029
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:02,143
- For me?
- Yeah.

1030
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:04,511
This isn't about me.

1031
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:07,949
Where are you gonna live? If we don't have
this place, where are you gonna go?

1032
01:43:08,049 --> 01:43:12,013
Do you honestly think I give a damn?

1033
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:17,992
You're doing this for yourself.

1034
01:43:25,531 --> 01:43:29,754
It's eight seconds. That's all it is.

1035
01:43:29,854 --> 01:43:34,807
That girl could be
the rest of your life.

1036
01:44:06,172 --> 01:44:09,310
- <i>Sophia Danko?</i>
- Yes. This is she.

1037
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:13,848
<i>My name is Howie Sanders.
I'm the attorney for Ira Levinson.</i>

1038
01:44:13,948 --> 01:44:16,549
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1039
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:20,053
Yeah. What is it? Is he okay?

1040
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:22,556
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Danko.</i>

1041
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:25,659
<i>He passed away late last night.</i>

1042
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,732
<i>Ms. Danko?</i>

1043
01:44:32,832 --> 01:44:34,435
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1044
01:44:34,535 --> 01:44:36,836
Yeah.

1045
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:40,575
<i>Mr. Levinson's art collection
is being auctioned off next week.</i>

1046
01:44:40,675 --> 01:44:43,678
<i>This is a private auction,
and is by invitation only.</i>

1047
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:46,591
<i>And Ira asked if you would attend.</i>

1048
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:49,814
Yeah, of course.

1049
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:52,952
<i>I know this is short notice.</i>

1050
01:44:53,052 --> 01:44:55,855
<i>But it's important to know...</i>

1051
01:44:56,389 --> 01:44:59,092
<i>he was very fond of you.</i>

1052
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:04,664
I was very fond of him, too.

1053
01:45:06,132 --> 01:45:09,369
<i>Well, I'll send
all the information along.</i>

1054
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:12,680
<i>It was nice to finally talk with you.</i>

1055
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,542
Thank you.

1056
01:45:25,786 --> 01:45:29,990
<i>Tonight we're gonna be watching
the top bull riders in the world.</i>

1057
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:33,192
Aces.

1058
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:46,200
<i>This is the one and only PBR!</i>

1059
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:56,344
<i>Time to meet your top 15 contenders!</i>

1060
01:46:56,444 --> 01:47:00,548
<i>Being led out by the number-one-ranked
bull rider in the world</i>

1061
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:04,051
<i>from Oklahoma, Jared Middleton!</i>

1062
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:06,521
<i>Boy, what a fight it has been</i>

1063
01:47:06,621 --> 01:47:10,324
<i>between him and the man
from North Carolina,</i>

1064
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,426
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

1065
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:17,798
<i>It has been an epic battle
between those two for this title!</i>

1066
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:21,869
<i>But don't count out men
atop that leaderboard!</i>

1067
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:27,625
<i>We will now go atop the shark cage
for our championship-round draft.</i>

1068
01:47:27,725 --> 01:47:31,145
<i>Ryan Dirteater, you will have Smackdown.
We will see you soon.</i>

1069
01:47:31,245 --> 01:47:34,749
<i>Now over to Billy Robinson,
the talent from Virginia.</i>

1070
01:47:34,849 --> 01:47:37,652
<i>Billy, let's find out
what bull you will face.</i>

1071
01:47:37,752 --> 01:47:41,756
<i>You are going to face Bushwacker!
Congratulations!</i>

1072
01:47:41,856 --> 01:47:45,026
<i>Now to the fan favorite
from North Carolina, Luke Collins!</i>

1073
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:48,062
<i>Luke, your fate is in that cup.</i>

1074
01:47:48,162 --> 01:47:50,798
<i>Luke, it is time for you to reach in
and pull out your bull</i>

1075
01:47:50,898 --> 01:47:54,535
<i>for this championship round.
Let's see what it will be.</i>

1076
01:47:54,935 --> 01:47:58,806
<i>Luke, you will have
the number-one contender</i>

1077
01:47:58,906 --> 01:48:01,516
<i>for this year's
World Champion Bucking Bull,</i>

1078
01:48:01,616 --> 01:48:03,876
<i>Rango!</i>

1079
01:48:25,031 --> 01:48:28,502
<i>Okay, Nashville.
You know who I'm talking about.</i>

1080
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:31,238
<i>With 99 consecutive buck-offs</i>

1081
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:33,875
<i>and staring down number 100</i>

1082
01:48:33,975 --> 01:48:38,910
<i>this is the number-one-ranked
bucking bull in the world!</i>

1083
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,320
<i>He is doing one of the most
difficult things in sports</i>

1084
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:48,956
<i>and that is mounting a comeback.</i>

1085
01:48:49,056 --> 01:48:54,560
<i>Yeah, but Luke Collins,
he is on PBR fire!</i>

1086
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:00,159
You got it! Keep riding!

1087
01:50:22,014 --> 01:50:24,183
Yeah! Yeah!

1088
01:51:02,323 --> 01:51:06,260
<i>We have just seen David slay Goliath!</i>

1089
01:51:54,007 --> 01:51:56,510
Hey, Luke, you made the eight on Rango.

1090
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:58,845
I knew you were a cowboy.

1091
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:00,948
One hell of a ride, son, I tell you!

1092
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:03,150
Luke, we gotta get together now
and talk some business.

1093
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:06,318
Luke? Luke, where you going?

1094
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:12,273
The Levinson artwork is the largest
and most valuable private collection.

1095
01:52:12,373 --> 01:52:16,531
Not only are these pieces sourced from
local Black Mountain College, but the world.

1096
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:19,866
We'll look at contemporary modern artists
such as Andy Warhol,

1097
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:22,301
Pat Passlof, and Willem de Kooning.

1098
01:52:22,401 --> 01:52:26,440
These are amazing works of art and
incredibly diverse, as you already know.

1099
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:29,313
Never been seen in one place
like this before.

1100
01:52:29,413 --> 01:52:33,247
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
for attending this remarkable auction.

1101
01:52:33,347 --> 01:52:35,716
If everyone could take
their seats, please.

1102
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:39,252
I know we are all eager to get started.

1103
01:52:41,287 --> 01:52:45,057
Before we begin, a personal note.

1104
01:52:47,526 --> 01:52:50,170
Welcome. I'm Howard Sanders.

1105
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:54,735
I was Ruth and Ira Levinson's attorney
for more than 25 years.

1106
01:52:54,835 --> 01:52:58,371
Now, Ira's will is very detailed

1107
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:00,408
on how he wants to proceed today.

1108
01:53:00,508 --> 01:53:06,845
So, let me start by reading you a letter
he wrote specifically for the occasion.

1109
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,983
"My name is Ira Levinson.

1110
01:53:09,083 --> 01:53:13,988
"I'm an ordinary man who fell in love
with an extraordinary woman.

1111
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:18,725
"Around this room you will see
some beautiful and priceless works of art.

1112
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:21,696
"Ruth had an incredible eye for talent

1113
01:53:21,796 --> 01:53:25,098
"while I only had eyes for her.

1114
01:53:26,495 --> 01:53:31,672
"For me the great joy of collecting
wasn't in the art itself"

1115
01:53:31,772 --> 01:53:34,607
<i>but in the person I collected it with.</i>

1116
01:53:34,707 --> 01:53:36,376
<i>My beloved Ruth.</i>

1117
01:53:37,176 --> 01:53:41,064
<i>The happiness these paintings
brought her was immeasurable.</i>

1118
01:53:41,164 --> 01:53:46,319
<i>And sharing that happiness
was the great privilege of my life.</i>

1119
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:51,691
<i>We celebrated, we achieved.
We endured, we compromised.</i>

1120
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:55,295
<i>And above all... we loved.</i>

1121
01:53:56,395 --> 01:54:00,466
<i>The true work of art was the longest
ride Ruth and I shared.</i>

1122
01:54:00,866 --> 01:54:02,836
<i>This thing called life.</i>

1123
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:08,208
<i>There's not a painting here
I wouldn't trade in a heartbeat</i>

1124
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:10,976
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

1125
01:54:11,677 --> 01:54:14,380
<i>Or see her smile.</i>

1126
01:54:14,714 --> 01:54:17,117
<i>Just one more time.</i>

1127
01:54:17,217 --> 01:54:19,985
Signed, Ira Levinson.

1128
01:54:22,621 --> 01:54:24,633
Thank you all for coming.

1129
01:54:29,395 --> 01:54:31,431
Thank you, Mr. Sanders.

1130
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,072
First up, a painting located
on page 34 of your catalogues,

1131
01:54:38,172 --> 01:54:41,774
titled <i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

1132
01:54:43,977 --> 01:54:49,716
Composed by American Daniel McDonald,
born 1954, died 2001.

1133
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:53,053
The work is circa 1963.

1134
01:54:53,153 --> 01:54:56,189
We'll start the bidding
at $1,000 for <i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

1135
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:58,659
Do I hear $1,000?

1136
01:54:58,759 --> 01:55:01,829
Who has $1,000 for me?

1137
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:05,598
How about $800? Who can give me $800?

1138
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:08,533
Just $800, folks.

1139
01:55:09,935 --> 01:55:12,137
$600.

1140
01:55:12,237 --> 01:55:15,441
Do I hear $600?

1141
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:19,745
Who has $600 for <i>Portrait of Ruth,</i>
the first work of the evening?

1142
01:55:20,445 --> 01:55:22,248
$600.

1143
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:26,720
I have $600. I have $600, here.
Going once.

1144
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:29,990
I have $600. Going twice.

1145
01:55:31,795 --> 01:55:33,427
Fair warning.

1146
01:55:33,527 --> 01:55:37,162
Sold to the young man
right there for $600.

1147
01:55:43,779 --> 01:55:46,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take a short pause.

1148
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:50,511
We can take this time to look at the next
item which will be a Jackson Pollock.

1149
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:55,171
That's located on page 124.
After that, of course...

1150
01:56:06,225 --> 01:56:09,367
- There we go.
- What are you doing here?

1151
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:13,883
Ira invited me.

1152
01:56:19,572 --> 01:56:22,307
I'm done bull riding, Sophia.

1153
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,844
I'm done.

1154
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:29,239
Look, I drew Rango this afternoon.

1155
01:56:30,716 --> 01:56:33,453
You know, I thought if I could
just ride that son of a bitch...

1156
01:56:33,553 --> 01:56:37,665
if I could just make the eight...
I'd have everything I ever wanted.

1157
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:41,466
Well, I did. I rode him.

1158
01:56:42,962 --> 01:56:47,800
- So, you're the best.
- No. Not even close.

1159
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:50,970
You see, the whole time
I was thinking about you.

1160
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:56,741
I realized that what I want
is standing right in front of me.

1161
01:57:15,995 --> 01:57:18,057
What made you buy that painting?

1162
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,600
Ira.

1163
01:57:25,638 --> 01:57:27,741
Excuse me, sir.
We need you in the other room.

1164
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:31,444
- Sir?
- Not now.

1165
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:32,879
- Sir?
- Not now.

1166
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:35,847
Mr. Sanders needs you.

1167
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:44,690
Quiet! Quiet, please!

1168
01:57:44,990 --> 01:57:47,526
What is your name, son?

1169
01:57:47,726 --> 01:57:48,796
Luke Collins.

1170
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:52,731
And did you just close your purchase
of <i>Portrait of Ruth?</i>

1171
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:54,067
Yes.

1172
01:57:54,167 --> 01:57:59,573
Mr. Collins, I have a stipulation in Ira
Levinson's will I need to read to you.

1173
01:57:59,673 --> 01:58:03,877
<i>"Portrait of Ruth</i> may not be the most
valuable painting in my collection

1174
01:58:03,977 --> 01:58:07,117
"but it was the most precious to me
because it reminded me daily

1175
01:58:07,217 --> 01:58:11,318
"of my beloved Ruth. And so,
the terms of my will are simple.

1176
01:58:11,618 --> 01:58:13,854
"Whoever purchases the portrait

1177
01:58:13,954 --> 01:58:17,623
"will receive the collection
in its entirety."

1178
01:58:18,225 --> 01:58:21,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
this auction is over.

1179
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:22,429
What?

1180
01:58:22,529 --> 01:58:26,166
This is worth millions.
Millions of dollars.

1181
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:27,668
How much do you want for the Warhols?

1182
01:58:27,768 --> 01:58:29,169
What are your plans
for the Jackson Pollocks?

1183
01:58:29,269 --> 01:58:32,137
I have a client who wants to buy
both of the Picassos.

1184
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:34,891
I'll write you a check.

1185
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:39,714
Sorry.

1186
01:58:40,914 --> 01:58:43,750
I'm gonna guess that your head
is spinning right about now.

1187
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:45,886
Yeah. That's a good guess.

1188
01:58:46,086 --> 01:58:49,155
When your feet hit the ground, call me.

1189
01:58:50,255 --> 01:58:52,990
You are now a very wealthy man.

1190
01:59:47,846 --> 01:59:50,048
Hey.

1191
01:59:50,949 --> 01:59:53,018
Hi.

1192
01:59:55,854 --> 01:59:59,058
- How was the museum?
- Great.

1193
01:59:59,758 --> 02:00:02,955
- How was the ranch?
- Great.

1194
02:00:44,436 --> 02:00:46,507
"Dearest Ruth..."

1195
02:00:46,607 --> 02:00:51,211
<i>When a North Carolina boy meets
a beautiful girl from far away</i>

1196
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:54,948
<i>he should do everything
he can to win her over.</i>

1197
02:00:55,048 --> 02:00:57,651
<i>And if he does</i>

1198
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:00,053
<i>his life will be a portrait
of happiness.</i>

1199
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:14,099
- What?
- Come on!

1200
02:01:16,001 --> 02:01:18,938
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

1201
02:01:45,464 --> 02:01:47,367
What took you so long?
