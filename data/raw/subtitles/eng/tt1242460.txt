1
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,765
<i>When you go to the ball...</i>

2
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>you have to learn how to dance
like a princess, right?</i>

3
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:01,967
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

4
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:04,465
<i>- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!</i>

5
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,065
<i>What are you gonna wear today?</i>

6
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,665
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...</i>

7
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head.</i>

8
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,600
<i>- No!
- 1, 2, 3... No?</i>

9
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,400
<i>- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!</i>

10
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:19,100
<i>- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!</i>

11
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,200
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

12
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

13
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,100
Good morning.

14
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,865
Hey buddy!

15
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,600
Want something to eat?

16
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
No. I'm not hungry.

17
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Yeah, that's fine.

18
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah.

19
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,600
<i>Franklin?</i>

20
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,200
<i>Hey. It's me. I just
wanted to leave a message.</i>

21
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>Do you think we could make
some time to talk later</i>

22
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,100
<i>just the two of us without kids?</i>

23
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,100
<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

24
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:42,300
<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

25
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,900
Eva Khatchadourian!

26
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,200
It's a lot.

27
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,065
Look, Eva.

28
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,765
I don't really care who you are

29
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,500
or what you've done as long as
you can type and you can file.

30
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,400
You can have this job.

31
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.

32
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I wont let you down.
I promise you. Thank you.

33
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:01,800
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

34
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
See you Monday.

35
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,700
Great. Thank you.

36
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Looks like someone is having
a nice day?

37
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,200
Enjoying yourself?

38
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm sorry?

39
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,600
I hope you rot in hell, you
fucking bitch!

40
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,600
Jesus. What the hell was that?
Are you ok?

41
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,450
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.

42
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,200
- Let me call an ambulance.
- No, no, it was my fault.

43
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,200
- But she just...
- No, no, I'm fine.

44
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,500
<i>Eva, when are you coming home?</i>

45
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
<i>I missed you.</i>

46
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
<i>I love you.</i>

47
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,765
<i>Promise me you'll never
go away again.</i>

48
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,600
<i>I will never, never,
never go away again.</i>

49
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:28,900
<i>Promise me. Promise me</i>

50
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
<i>you'll never go away again.</i>

51
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,265
Is it safe?

52
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,700
No, it's not safe.

53
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
Sure?

54
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Are you sure about this?

55
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
<i>This really happened?</i>

56
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,100
<i>I can see, I can feel it...</i>

57
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
<i>We did it.</i>

58
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,100
I'm gonna need these processed
today, Eva.

59
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Uh, but today my afternoon off.

60
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:16,667
You remember? I told you.

61
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,165
Ah shit, that's right.

62
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,500
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.

63
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,600
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.

64
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,600
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!

65
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:14,365
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.

66
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,800
Hey lady. Lady. Lady. Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!

67
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,500
Get off of me!

68
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,400
Eva, you can stop holding back.

69
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,400
Stop holding back, Eva.

70
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,000
Eva!

71
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Rise and shine.

72
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,965
It's late, Eva.

73
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,300
The day is almost over.

74
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,000
- Hiii! - Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.

75
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,100
I just put him down, Franklin.

76
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,600
Hi.

77
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,800
There he is. You wanna play?

78
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
You wanna play?

79
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,900
It's alright.

80
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,400
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.

81
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Do you think I'm exaggerating?

82
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:24,200
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

83
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
There's my little dude!

84
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Jesus! All 12?

85
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...

86
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,900
I will take them as they are!

87
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,000
<i>You're gonna be a good looking boy.</i>

88
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,800
<i>All the girls are gonna love you.</i>

89
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,100
I know it. Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

90
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,565
Can you say "mommy"?

91
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,900
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?

92
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,500
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".

93
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
"Ball"?

94
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,800
No?
Okay.

95
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're
gonna roll it back to me, okay?

96
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,065
Okay.

97
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,800
Roll it back to mommy.

98
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,800
Roll it back. Roll.
Roll it back.

99
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay, okay.

100
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,900
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.

101
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,100
Roll it back.
Roll it back.

102
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
When he was a baby,
he never stopped screaming.

103
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,900
I thought maybe it had damaged
his hearing.

104
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,800
No, his hearing is fine.

105
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,400
But shouldn't he be talking by now?

106
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing
was the...

107
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,700
an early sign of autism.

108
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.

109
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,700
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

110
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?

111
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
But there is nothing wrong with him.

112
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,200
Thank you.

113
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,365
Okay.

114
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,900
Roll it back to mom.

115
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,300
Okay. Gonna roll it back again.

116
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:20,167
That was really good, Kevin.

117
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay. Here we go.
Okay?

118
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,900
Okay?

119
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,465
<i>"E" is for elephant,
large as a house,</i>

120
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,100
<i>he's big as can be,
not small as a mouse.</i>

121
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,100
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

122
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:50,400
"Elephant".

123
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,400
Kevin!

124
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,400
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?

125
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,965
No!

126
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,465
- "mommy"?
- No!

127
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,600
- Just say "mommy".
- No.

128
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
Trick or treat?

129
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,800
Trick or treat?
Hey lady. We know you're in there.

130
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,900
<i>I don't like that!</i>

131
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,565
<i>I don't like that!</i>

132
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Mommy was happy before little Kevin
came along. Do you know that?

133
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,900
And now mommy wakes up every morning...

134
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:40,200
and wishes she was in France!

135
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,065
That elevator is a death trap.

136
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,700
He needs a yard,
somewhere he can toss a ball,

137
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,100
fill a pool.

138
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But I love New York.

139
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,465
Come on!

140
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,750
You sound like a bumper sticker.

141
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,892
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.

142
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:12,000
He's only gonna be a kid once.

143
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,865
You can house hunt all you want.

144
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.

145
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,900
Kevin, stop that. That's enough.

146
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,600
Let mommy and daddy talk.

147
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:23,200
Kevin, quit that!

148
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,265
<i>You have your family room here.</i>

149
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,000
<i>Master bedroom is back there
and two huge walking closets.</i>

150
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
<i>The bathroom is amazing.</i>

151
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Here we are guys.

152
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,600
Our very own castle.

153
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?

154
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Hey! Hey!
Wait up! Ms. K!

155
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Hey. It's me.

156
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,400
Soweto.

157
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,700
Hi there.

158
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I just wanted to see how you were.

159
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm fine. Thanks.

160
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,365
You look well.

161
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Yeah. The doctors are saying there's
a chance I might walk again.

162
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
That's great.

163
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,900
You take care, ms. K.

164
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
You too.

165
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,200
Come on, come on!

166
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:22,100
Die! Die!

167
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,500
No! No! No!

168
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,600
- Die!
- How do you jump?

169
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Die!

170
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,200
Go! Go! Go! Go!

171
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,200
Die!

172
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
Hey Kev? Are you out there?

173
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
Kevin?

174
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,700
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.

175
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,000
You can do that too.

176
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,065
So you want a connector right there.

177
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,100
You see? And click on that link
and it should open right up.

178
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:36,965
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.

179
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,300
- So you left click. Wanna give it a try?
- Yes.

180
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,100
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

181
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,500
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.

182
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,565
See that? It comes up.

183
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Right. Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.

184
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,900
Thank you for your help.

185
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
I pooped.

186
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,800
Hey buddy. What?

187
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,165
You pooped?

188
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Oh okay. Here let me help you.

189
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay.

190
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,900
Go to your room. I'll be right there.

191
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,100
Let's not wake up mommy.

192
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,000
Go on! Go on, buddy.

193
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,100
These scribled squares of paper.
They are dumb.

194
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,765
Everybody needs a room of their own.

195
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,765
You have your room.
This is the mother's room.

196
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,900
I can help you make your room special,
if you'd like.

197
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,900
What do you mean, "Special"?

198
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Well, so it looks like your personality.

199
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,900
What personality?

200
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,600
I think you know what I mean.

201
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
They're dumb.

202
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
No, no, no. I mean it's good.

203
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
You don't need me to do that?

204
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,600
And... and the guy...

205
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,500
Okay.

206
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Well, I mean if you handle the lot...

207
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,817
I could.

208
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,400
Really?

209
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,200
Well. That all sounds great.

210
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:32,565
Okay, John.

211
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,900
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.

212
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
Kevin?

213
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,200
Kevin?

214
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,700
What else do you have to say?

215
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Go wash your face!

216
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,000
He said, he's really sorry.

217
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,200
And that he was only trying to help
make it special.

218
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Do you remember how you got that?

219
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,200
It's the most honest thing
you ever did.

220
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,900
Do you know how they potty train cats?

221
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,200
They stick their noses in their own shit.

222
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
They don't like it.

223
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,500
So they use the box.

224
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,500
Okay. Let's work on our counting.

225
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,500
- What comes after 3?
- 9.

226
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,900
- What comes after 7?
- 71.

227
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,565
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

228
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

229
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:15,617
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

230
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:20,926
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

231
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:26,200
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

232
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:28,400
Now, can we quit?

233
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,500
There.

234
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,300
You can add that together
if you think you're so smart.

235
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,100
You did not...

236
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,200
You did not...

237
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,900
Are you enjoying yourself?

238
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,800
I can see the doctor by myself.

239
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,200
I have to tell you something, Eva.

240
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,900
It's a brave boy you've got there.

241
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,700
- Thank you.
- That's fine.

242
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,300
What mamma did
was very, very wrong.

243
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,900
And she's so, so sorry.

244
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,400
Kev? Kev, hold on a sec!

245
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Kev?

246
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,200
Kevin?

247
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,600
Hey Kev.
What happened?

248
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,865
I broke my arm.

249
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,800
How did you brake your arm?

250
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:34,565
I had poopy pants.

251
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,065
Mommy went to get wipes.

252
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,300
I fell off the changing table
onto my dump trucks.

253
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:43,200
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.

254
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
It's all my fault.

255
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,865
No, don't be silly.

256
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,800
You can't watch him
every second of the day.

257
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,700
Franklin...

258
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,400
Unbelievable.

259
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,000
How did you get him
to do that?

260
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Well, whatever it was it worked.

261
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,900
Not yet.

262
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay.

263
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,500
I love you, kiddo.

264
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,200
I don't like that.
Turn it off.

265
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
Honey. Do you mind if we stop
over at the store?

266
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:14,200
I wanna go home.

267
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,700
It's just that I need to pick up...

268
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,000
Home it is.

269
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,000
Hi guys!

270
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,200
Hi Dad. How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?

271
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,500
Eva, he is just a boy.

272
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,150
He's a sweet little boy.

273
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:11,600
That's what boys do.

274
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,900
Mom is fat!

275
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,500
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?

276
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,900
Soon. Now.

277
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,900
How am I part of the decision now?

278
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,500
What am I supposed to say now?

279
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,800
So, the daddy bear plants his seed
in the mommy bear

280
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,500
and it grows into an egg.

281
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:40,100
Is this about fucking?

282
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,300
Do you know what that means?

283
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,400
The boy puts his pee pee
in the girl's doo doo.

284
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,265
Well...

285
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,700
Haven't you ever wished
you had somebody around to play with?

286
00:52:57,735 --> 00:52:59,065
No.

287
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,665
You might like it.

288
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,600
What if I don't like it?

289
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,465
Then you get used to it.

290
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,800
Just because you're used to
something...

291
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,400
doesn't mean you like it.

292
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,100
You're used to me.

293
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,465
Yes, well...

294
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,000
In a few months we're all gonna
get used to somebody new.

295
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,500
Beautiful.

296
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,800
Hey Kev. Come on and meet your
little sister.

297
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,200
This is your brother. It's Kevin.

298
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:37,317
It's your big brother.

299
00:53:37,352 --> 00:53:40,365
Yes, that's right.

300
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,200
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...

301
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:47,965
Kevin! Don't do that.

302
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,700
No, Kevin. That's not nice.

303
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:52,765
No problem dear.

304
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,200
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.

305
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,500
<i>Christ! To Ecuador? For 2 months?
Why can't they send someone else?</i>

306
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:17,100
<i>I really wanna work this deal.</i>

307
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:17,232
<i>Then he makes up his own little language,
and that is annoying.</i>

308
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,165
<i>He has trouble communicating.
A lot of kids do.</i>

309
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,900
<i>And you see this as some kind
of personal vendetta?</i>

310
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:31,400
<i>It's not good for him.</i>

311
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,300
<i>Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!</i>

312
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,400
<i>Pick up the god damn phone.</i>

313
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,165
...13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19...

314
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,400
...20, 21, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27...

315
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Please. Please. Let me have
a drink. Please

316
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,400
Kevin?

317
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,900
Kevin!

318
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,400
Honey?

319
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,900
Are you ok?

320
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm sorry mom.

321
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,300
Not to worry, sweetheart.

322
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,300
You couldn't help it.

323
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,300
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.

324
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,265
"Aren't thou the devil in blue
to shoot in that way?"

325
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,800
"Nay," posed Robin, laughing.
"Not quite so ill as that I trust."

326
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,900
"Then he took up another shaft..."
Are you okay, honey?

327
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,200
Then he took up another shaft,
and fitted it to the string.

328
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:25,665
Again he shot.

329
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,000
Again, he smoathed the arrow
close beside the center.

330
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,365
The third time, he losed his bowstring

331
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,100
and dropped the arrow
just betwix the other two,

332
00:56:34,135 --> 00:56:35,565
and into the very center,

333
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,300
so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together

334
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:41,765
seeming from a distance
to be one big shaft.

335
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,900
And now a low murmur
ran all along the great crowd.

336
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,900
Hey champ. How are you doing?

337
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,400
Feeling better?

338
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,700
Go away. I'm tired.

339
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh. Okay.

340
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,000
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?

341
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:03,700
Don't stop reading, mom.

342
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,165
280 score shafts were shot in all

343
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,800
and so deftly were they sped,
that when the shooting was done

344
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:21,200
each target looked like the
back of a hedgehog...

345
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:24,000
when a farm dog snuffed at it.

346
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,165
Good afternoon, ma'am.

347
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,300
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.

348
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:18,800
Well, it is actually.

349
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,200
Well, we just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

350
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,300
What is it about?

351
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,300
Do you know where you are
spending the afterlife?

352
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,100
Oh, yeah. I do as a matter of fact.

353
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,800
I'm going straight to hell.

354
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,065
Eternal damnation.

355
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,900
Thank you for asking.
Okay?

356
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,600
Hey honey. Let me help you with that.

357
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,900
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?

358
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,400
Sure.

359
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,165
I'm glad you're feeling better.

360
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,500
Do you want some more of that
chowder for lunch?

361
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:00,965
Whatever.

362
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,500
- Or grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

363
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,000
Thanks Dad, this is so cool.

364
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:18,365
You're welcome, buddy.

365
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,500
Right. Here we go.
In the middle.

366
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,065
Ooooh. Almost. Here.

367
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,700
Take that one.
Try again.

368
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,400
Use your finger...

369
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,800
Keep your eyes in the middle.

370
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,400
Good shot, Kev.

371
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,400
You're a natural.

372
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,550
Perfect.

373
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:37,100
Thanks Dad.

374
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,200
<i>Right.</i>

375
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,400
<i>It's like this.</i>

376
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,265
<i>You wake up.</i>

377
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,500
<i>Then you watch TV.</i>

378
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,165
<i>You get in the car, then you
listen to the radio.</i>

379
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,300
<i>Then you go to you little job
or your little school</i>

380
01:01:35,335 --> 01:01:39,400
<i>but we're not gonna hear about
that on the 6pm news.</i>

381
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,865
<i>Why?</i>

382
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,900
<i>Because nothing is really happening.</i>

383
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,165
<i>Then you go home
and watch some more TV.</i>

384
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,000
<i>Or maybe it's a fun night,
and you go out</i>

385
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:54,900
<i>and you watch a movie.</i>

386
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,100
I mean it's got so bad,
that half the time

387
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:00,865
the people on TV,

388
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:05,000
inside the TV,
they're watching TV.

389
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,400
And what are all these
people watching?

390
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
People like me.

391
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,500
<i>And what are all you
doing right now?</i>

392
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,300
<i>You're watching me.</i>

393
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,600
<i>Don't you think you would
have changed the channel by now</i>

394
01:02:30,635 --> 01:02:33,400
<i>if all I did
was getting "A" in geometry?</i>

395
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,700
Me and Kevin were plaiying
"Christmas kidnapping".

396
01:03:24,735 --> 01:03:26,900
Kevin!

397
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,100
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.

398
01:03:31,135 --> 01:03:34,000
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.

399
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,800
Not that, you retard.

400
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,200
Get me a Root Beer.

401
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,700
What ?

402
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,700
Thank you, Celia.
I was thirsty.

403
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,900
Hey, you wanne know a secret?

404
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:04,400
Come closer.

405
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,700
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?

406
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,100
It's the vacuum monster.

407
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,200
Cut it out!

408
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,400
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!

409
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,300
Ho, ho, ho. See what I got!
Kev, come here. Give me a hand.

410
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,700
Yeah, sure dad.

411
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,100
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.

412
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,000
- Come on. Just one.
- I don't dance, really.

413
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,200
Where do you get off,
you stuck up bitch?

414
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,300
Do you think anyone else
is gonna want you now?

415
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,100
Come on. Stay for another drink.

416
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,700
Come on.
Come on.

417
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,365
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

418
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,800
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer!

419
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,400
- Should we?
- Yeah.

420
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,600
Kevin!

421
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,500
Didn't I see you at the
bookstore today?

422
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,900
No.

423
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,500
Oh, I could have sworn.

424
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,400
By the way, are you doing
anything on Friday?

425
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,200
Why?

426
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,800
I just thought we might
do something together.

427
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,800
For fun.

428
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,700
Like, do what?

429
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,900
Maybe take you for dinner.

430
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,100
Or play around with
miniature golf?

431
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,800
Okay.

432
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,700
Why didn't you bring a coat?

433
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,100
You just can't get uncomfortable
enough, can you?

434
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,400
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?

435
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,400
Whenever I see fat people,
they are always eating.

436
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,200
Dont' give me any of this "slower
metabolism thyroid gland" crap.

437
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,765
It's food.

438
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
They are fat because
they eat the wrong food.

439
01:09:56,835 --> 01:09:58,900
Too much of it, and all the time.

440
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,200
You know, you can be
kind of harsh sometimes.

441
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,700
You're one to talk.

442
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:10,700
Yeah, I am.

443
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,400
I wonder where I got it.

444
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,000
Well, you won.

445
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,700
So. What next, momsy?

446
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,500
We're gonna go home. You're gonna get
changed into something reasonable.

447
01:11:02,535 --> 01:11:04,200
And I take you to dinner.

448
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,200
Great.

449
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,600
We're going to dinner.

450
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,600
I was hungry.

451
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm a growing boy, you know.

452
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,900
I'll have a calorie salad,

453
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,800
steak, medium rare,
and a bottle of Merlot.

454
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,400
Very well.

455
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,300
So, how is school going?

456
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,300
It's going.

457
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,700
on a course schedule.

458
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,865
How about the teachers?
Are there any of them...

459
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,000
Right, right, what bands am
I listening to these days?

460
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,100
Next you can read all about if there
isn't some cute little cunt

461
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:31,365
in the front row
who's got me itchy.

462
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,965
Then you can segway into the whole,
it's all up to me of course

463
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,100
but before balling the chick in the hallway
I might decide to way until I'm ready.

464
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,300
Right around dessert,
you can ask about drugs

465
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,765
Real careful, like

466
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,500
cause you don't want to scare me
into, like, lying my head off.

467
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,700
So you have to say, like,
how you experimented.

468
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,700
Then finally once you've sucked
up that entire bottle of wine,

469
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:57,165
you can go all gooey eyed

470
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,550
and say how nice it is to spend
quality time together,

471
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:03,900
then scooch over and put your
arm around my shoulder.

472
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,300
Give it a little squeeze.

473
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,800
Fuck!

474
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,500
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's fucked.

475
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:21,000
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.

476
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,900
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.

477
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,300
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?

478
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:39,200
I don't like stamps.

479
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,400
But what is the point?

480
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,400
There is no point.

481
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,200
That's the point.

482
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,500
No, it really hasn't
been any trouble at all.

483
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,000
Everybody is bringing a dish.

484
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,900
Oh. That's him now. I got to go.
You have a great day.

485
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,400
Bye, mom.

486
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,900
Merry Christmas.

487
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,700
Alright, Kev.
You're next.

488
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,800
Can you guess what it is?

489
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,800
That's a series 7. The guy in the
store said it was the best one.

490
01:16:52,835 --> 01:16:58,600
- Gee, dad. Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas.

491
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,900
What did you have for breakfast?

492
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,100
Had a good day, Snuffles?

493
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,465
Did you hear that thump?

494
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,400
That's a powerful thing, man.

495
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,800
Celia!

496
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,300
Come on, honey. Time for bed
Here we go.

497
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,200
I thought I closed the door.

498
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,800
Kevin said I was stupid,
and he was right.

499
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,100
You're not stupid, honey.

500
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,600
Don't you worry. We'll find him.
Now you scoop down. Come on.

501
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,200
Cozy?

502
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,350
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to
the big pet store in the sky.

503
01:19:10,385 --> 01:19:13,700
- Don't say that! Don't say that!
- Yes. It's the truth!

504
01:19:13,735 --> 01:19:15,165
Dearly beloved,

505
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,000
We are gathered here
to mourn mr. Snuffles...

506
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:19,300
Stop it!

507
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,900
Who will... tragically early...

508
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,700
So daddy and mommy were looking for him
the whole night.

509
01:19:29,735 --> 01:19:32,065
And you know why we couldn't find him?

510
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,900
Because Snuffles has gone
to live in the garden.

511
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,465
He's living in the garden now,

512
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,600
with a whole bunch of new animal friends.

513
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,500
Celia.

514
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,600
Okay, give me the spoon.

515
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,200
So, they're having a big party tonight...

516
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:04,000
with the chipmunks, and the squarrels,
and the racoons...

517
01:20:04,035 --> 01:20:08,700
and they're eating nuts, and berries,

518
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:15,000
and they're gonna have a whole bunch...

519
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,400
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?

520
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,900
I didn't.

521
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,900
- I put it way.
- Then how did it get out?

522
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,050
Ask Kevin.

523
01:21:51,085 --> 01:21:53,000
Kevin did it.

524
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,800
You need to go talk to someone.

525
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,300
Uhm Kev. Mom has something
else she wanted to tell you.

526
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,000
I wanted to...

527
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,900
thank you for calling the ambulance.

528
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,000
And?

529
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,600
And...

530
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:52,600
I was concerned that you might
be feeling responsible.

531
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,600
Why is that?

532
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,700
Because you was supposed to
be looking after her.

533
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,900
We just don't want you to
blame yourself.

534
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,800
No. I don't...
I never said I did.

535
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,465
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

536
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:14,200
So, we would appreciate you
looking after her,

537
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:16,300
and any namecalling...

538
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,700
You don't really remember being
a kid much do you, dad?

539
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,800
Celia is just gonna have to
suck it up.

540
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,900
I thought you didn't like those.

541
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,900
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it...

542
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,000
an acquired taste.

543
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
I'm so sorry.

544
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,300
There you go.

545
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,300
Okay.

546
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,800
Thank you, mommy.

547
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,400
- Hey kiddo. You're going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.

548
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,700
- Hey Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!

549
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:52,100
So...
What do you want to do?

550
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,700
Let's wait for the school year to end,

551
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,400
and make arrangements for this summer.

552
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,600
At least the custody
is a no-brainer.

553
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,600
Is it?

554
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,300
You've decided?

555
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,600
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

556
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,300
It already happened.

557
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:45,100
- I needed a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.

558
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,800
Listen, buddy,

559
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:52,900
it's easy to misunderstand something
if you hear it out of context.

560
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,900
Why would I not know the "context"?

561
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,300
I am the context.

562
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,150
- You have to appeal to reject punitive damage.
- No.

563
01:28:24,185 --> 01:28:26,400
You'll lose everything.
The business, your house.

564
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,800
I hate the house.
I always have.

565
01:28:28,835 --> 01:28:30,400
You'll rot in hell!

566
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,500
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?

567
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,200
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is?

568
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,600
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

569
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,800
What are these for?
You never ride your bike.

570
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:41,517
I got these for a song of the web.

571
01:29:41,552 --> 01:29:44,200
You make a bundle on them at school.

572
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,000
Like Donald Trump, huh.

573
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,400
I'll take you back to my ship.

574
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,300
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

575
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,800
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

576
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:55,900
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

577
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,700
Ready for the big dip?

578
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,600
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

579
01:32:05,635 --> 01:32:07,717
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

580
01:32:07,752 --> 01:32:09,800
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

581
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:11,900
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

582
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,400
<i>I'm charmed to meet you,
young lady</i>

583
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:23,300
<i>- Yeah.
- Did you eat all your cereal?</i>

584
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,500
<i>- Yes.
- Did you eat all your cereal?</i>

585
01:32:26,535 --> 01:32:27,900
<i>Alright.</i>

586
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,300
You're a little clammy.
Are you okay?

587
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,300
Never better.

588
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,400
Hey. Only three days to go
till you're 16.

589
01:32:47,435 --> 01:32:50,800
We should do something.
How about Sunday?

590
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:52,600
I don't know.

591
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,900
I might be tied up.

592
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,100
Come clean up some of this mess
and then we're gonna get dressed and go.

593
01:33:00,135 --> 01:33:01,465
I do not want to go to school.

594
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,300
I know, but daddy have to take a shower
and then we'll go.

595
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,300
Say goodbye!

596
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,400
<i>Do you think we could make some time
later to talk. Just the two of us,</i>

597
01:33:20,435 --> 01:33:21,800
<i>without the kids?</i>

598
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,400
<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

599
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,700
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

600
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,300
<i>Franklin...</i>

601
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,900
<i>Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...</i>

602
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,900
I have my son in here.

603
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,400
Kevin?

604
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,300
Kevin!

605
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,100
Kevin!

606
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,900
Kevin!

607
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,600
Lauren!

608
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,000
Franklin?

609
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,700
Celia?

610
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,500
Franklin?

611
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,300
Celia?

612
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:36,200
You don't look happy.

613
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,700
Have I ever?

614
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,900
I'm almost 18, aren't I?

615
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:54,768
What is it?

616
01:43:55,869 --> 01:43:58,400
Going to the big school
making you nervous??

617
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,400
Nervous?

618
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,600
Do you know anything about
those places?

619
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,300
Well. You managed it all so well.

620
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:26,100
A child of a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.

621
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,400
You'll be out of here
in a couple of years.

622
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,465
Do you know what day it is today?

623
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,000
Why the let me come see you
on a monday?

624
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:46,900
Sure. It's my anniversary.

625
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,900
Two years.

626
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,100
Plenty of time to think about it.

627
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:14,300
I want you to tell me why.

628
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
I used to think I knew.

629
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,100
Now I'm not so sure.

630
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,700
Time is up.
