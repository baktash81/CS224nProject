Oh, I think he's sick.

a little help.

There you go, little guy.

1027
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,188
You're gonna be just fine,
mi amigo.

1028
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,400
Alright. There you go,
safe and sound.

1029
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,277
Maybe you're right.

1030
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:42,029
Maybe me just being here,
showing up,

1031
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,573
was all that little guy needed.

(GASPS) Oh!

1034
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:51,747
I... did not see that coming.

1035
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,335
Oh, man. Poor bird.

1036
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,381
- I had a thought.
- Yeah?

1037
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:04,510
I happen to have
Thursday night off from work

1038
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:08,806
and I wondered if you might
wanna grab a bite.

1039
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,686
I promise not to cook.

1040
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,063

00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,066
Yeah.

1042
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,737
- OK. Great.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

1043
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:24,989
- See you later.
- Alright.

1044

What the heck happened?

1048
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,921
- How did you turn that around?
- You were listening?

1049
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,298
Honestly, I have no idea.

1050
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,676
Not what I expected,
but you can't blow this now.

1051

1052
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,306

that has dancing.

Dancing? Show me something.

Anything?

1055
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,357
- No.
- We've come too far.

1056
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,484
I am not letting you ruin this.

1057
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,075
OK. Stop. No.

1058
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,701
Are you having a stroke?

- It's not that bad.
- Promise me one thing.

1060
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,666
I will let you take my mom
to dinner, but no dancing.

Don't risk it. We good?

'Night, Sophie.
Thanks for the confidence boost.

You're welcome.

- What was the emergency?
- Uh, nothing, really.

1068

Are you kidding me?
What the hell are you thinking?

00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,967
I wasn't thinking. It was this
adrenaline-charged moment.

1075
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:12,179
- Her eyes were amazing.
- You are off the rails!

1076
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,266
First, you take the kid skating,
then you go to show-and-tell,

1077
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,809
and now you're going on a date

1078
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,811
with the woman
we're supposed to be surveilling

1079
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,730
and you're lying to me about it.

1080
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,398
If I'm with her,
I'll know she's safe.

1081
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,234
Well, dude, our job
isn't to keep her safe, OK?

1082
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,528
It's to see if the bad guy
makes contact with her.

1083
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:29,822
- That is our mission.
- There is no mission.

1084
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,949
This is all nonsense.

1085
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,285
There is no covert information
in that apartment,

1086
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,996
just a broken family
and that is the truth.

1087
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:41,834
The truth? We're gonna talk
about the truth, finally? Great!

1088
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,211
Well, I know that
you lost your entire team

1089
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,963
on your last deployment.

1090
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,424
That's classified.

1091
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:51,385
Yeah.
Well, I'm the tech, remember?

1092
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,387
I can work around that -

1093
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,973
something you might find useful
if you'd ever trust me,

1094
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,767
but I get it.

off, huh? "I work alone."

You're on thin ice.

1097
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,149
Maybe you should
take Kate out to dinner

1098
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,443
so you can get over
all that crap in your past

1099
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,111
and see if
you still have a heart

- Fine. I will.
- Great! Have a great dinner!

I intended that to go.

1104
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,597
Uh, got a date.

- Definitely.
- Beautiful.

- Smart.
- Been through a lot, though.

- The situation concerns him.
- Well, just dinner, Todd.

How much time do we have?

1124
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,575
I guess I can be a little late.
10 minutes?

10 minutes?! I'm not God.
This will never work.

about this shirt.

when her dad passed,

1141

we stayed for a bit,
but it was hard.

seized our assets.
