1
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,593
Life.

2
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,669
The great miracle and
the great mystery.

3
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,498
Who am I?

4
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,176
Since the beginning...

5
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,680
...humans and Pokémon alike
have searched for its meaning.

6
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:12,148
What am I? What am I?

7
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:15,085
Many strange and wondrous
legends evolved...

8
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,953
...from the pursuit
of life 's mysteries.

9
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,165
Where am I? Where am I?

10
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,596
But none is stranger
than this tale...

11
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,967
...of the most powerful
Pokémon of all.

12
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,802
I am ready...

13
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:36,909
... to be, to be....

14
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,296
Where...

15
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,768
...am I?

16
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,729
This is not the same.

17
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,872
Was everything before just a dream?

18
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,405
Why?

19
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,883
-Doctor, look at this.
-What?

20
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,453
Its brain waves, they're surging!

21
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,523
-Let me see!
-She's right!

22
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,217
-Let's run another scan.
-lts mind is racing!

23
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,290
Those voices.

24
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,633
I hope we don't lose this one!

25
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,629
They're outside.

26
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:33,734
We can't!

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,137
Where I must be.

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,350
Tell Giovanni what's happened!

29
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,779
Quiet!

30
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,787
Let us hear its psychic powers.

31
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,483
Psychic powers?

32
00:02:55,992 --> 00:03:00,691
For years we struggled to successfully
clone a Pokémon to prove our theories.

33
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,194
You're the first specimen to survive!

34
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,663
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokémon.

35
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,062
From its DNA we created you, Mewtwo.

36
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:10,661
Mewtwo?

37
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,839
Am I only a copy?
Nothing but Mew's shadow?

38
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,509
You are greater than Mew.

39
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:20,648
Improved through the power
of human ingenuity.

40
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:25,481
We used the most advanced techniques
to develop your psychic powers.

41
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:30,049
So I am simply the end
result of your experiment.

42
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,060
What becomes of me now?

43
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,162
Our experiment isn't over!
It's just beginning!

44
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,890
Now the serious testing begins.

45
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,826
These humans, they care
nothing for me.

46
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:45,368
Congratulations. We've
done an excellent job.

47
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:49,739
-We'll observe Mewtwo for mutations.
-ls the new tank ready?

48
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,847
We'll have to come up
with a cage for it.

49
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,812
Excellent. We'll start testing.

50
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:03,151
Is that my purpose?

51
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,055
Am I just an experiment?

52
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,363
A laboratory specimen?

53
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,758
This cannot be my destiny!

54
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,270
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

55
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:55,634
...and we succeeded.

56
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,967
Behold my powers.

57
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:29,971
I am the strongest Pokémon in the world.

58
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,704
Stronger even than Mew.

59
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,019
Those fools thought you
were a science experiment...

60
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,526
...but I see you as
a valuable partner.

61
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,797
Partner?

62
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:56,933
With your psychic powers
and my resources...

63
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,370
...together we can control the world.

64
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,544
I do not need your help
for that, human.

65
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,473
A wildfire destroys
everything in its path.

66
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:08,980
It will be the same with your
powers unless you control them.

67
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,652
I can help you do that.

68
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,213
How?

69
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,150
I'll show you a way
to focus your powers...

70
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:17,383
...that will make you invincible.

71
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,817
Show me!

72
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:45,880
You say this armor protects my body...

73
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,489
...yet it suppresses my powers!

74
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:52,092
Your powers are not being
suppressed. They're being focused.

75
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,026
Learn to use them to
accomplish your purpose.

76
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,491
What is that?

77
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,431
Patience, my friend. Your
purpose will become clear.

78
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,881
So this is my power.

79
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,911
I am in control now.

80
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,744
Alakazam!

81
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,078
Kazam!

82
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:14,004
But why am I here?

83
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,821
Now I fully perceive my power.

84
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,999
But what is my purpose?

85
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:42,164
To serve your master.
You were created to fight for me.

86
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,134
That is your purpose.

87
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,137
That cannot be.

88
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,741
You said we were partners.
We stood as equals.

89
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,216
You were created by humans
to obey humans.

90
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,510
You could never be our equal.

91
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,983
Humans may have created me...

92
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,656
...but they will never enslave me.

93
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,223
This cannot be my destiny!

94
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,856
Stop this now!

95
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,795
I was not born a Pokémon!
I was created.

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,400
My creators have used and betrayed me.

97
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,834
So I stand alone.

98
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,771
Who am l?

99
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:59,578
What is my true reason for being?

100
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,113
I will find my own purpose.

101
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:08,353
And purge this planet
of all who oppose me.

102
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,923
Human and Pokémon alike.

103
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,853
The world will heed my warning.

104
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:21,066
The reign of Mewtwo will soon begin.

105
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,828
Today, Ash, Brock and Misty are taking
a break from their Pokémon adventures.

106
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:56,602
As always, Ash is determined
to become a Pokémon master.

107
00:10:56,806 --> 00:11:01,140
And, as always, he's ready to endure
any hardship, bear any burden...

108
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,844
... with strength, stamina
and a will of steel.

109
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,039
Hungry. Need food.

110
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,980
Oh, Ash! You haven' t
done a thing all day!

111
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,313
I'm too weak to work, Misty.

112
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:16,150
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

113
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,790
This lunch is going to
be just perfect for you.

114
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,663
It's my lazy-boy "no-chew" stew.

115
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:37,035
You there! I'm looking for a Pokémon
trainer named Ash from Pallet Town.

116
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,238
-You know him?
-Yeah, he's me.

117
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,576
Let's have a match.
Unless you're afraid to lose!

118
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,648
I'm afraid you're going
to lose this one!

119
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,481
Ash, you just said you
were too weak to work!

120
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,253
I am too weak to work, but
a Pokémon battle isn't work!

121
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,557
That's progress. At least
his mouth is working.

122
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,742
I want to be the very best

123
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,480
Like no one ever was

124
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,454
To catch them is my real test

125
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,988
To train them is my cause

126
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,793
I will travel across the land

127
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,395
Searching far and wide

128
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:32,595
Teach Pokémon to understand

129
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,769
The power that's inside

130
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,000
Inside Pokémon

131
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:40,567
It's you and me

132
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,010
I know it's my destiny

133
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,245
You're my best friend

134
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,708
And the world we must defend

135
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,916
Our hearts are true

136
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,659
Our courage will pull us through

137
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,296
You teach me and I'll teach you

138
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,225
Pokémon

139
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:08,630
Got to catch them,
got to catch them all

140
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,041
Great job, Bulbasaur! You did it!

141
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:21,278
You can challenge along the way

142
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,214
Encourage our faith

143
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,221
I will battle everything

144
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,723
About the place

145
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,328
Come with me, the time is right

146
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,589
There's no better team

147
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,800
Arm in arm we'll win the fight

148
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,903
It's always been our dream

149
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:49,405
It's you and me

150
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,340
I know it's my destiny

151
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:55,716
You are my best friend

152
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,852
In a world we must defend

153
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,191
A heart so true

154
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,822
Our courage will pull us through

155
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:09,161
You teach me and I'll teach you

156
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:15,099
Got to catch them

157
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,834
Got to catch them all

158
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,277
We did it!

159
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,347
Well, that sure was a shocking ending.

160
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,493
Shocking that Ash moved so fast.

161
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,062
Another credit on Pikachu's
"charge account!"

162
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:48,702
We've got to grab it!

163
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,632
I know we must grab rare
Pokémon for the Boss...

164
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,742
...but it wouldn't be a bad idea
if we grabbed a bite to eat.

165
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,841
We didn't come here to steal a meal!

166
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,676
I'd settle for a taste
of that Pika-chow.

167
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:07,549
I'm starving.

168
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,348
I can cook something.

169
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:14,059
The last time you cooked, you
wiped out eight of my nine lives.

170
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:48,460
Master, shall I extend an
invitation to these trainers as well?

171
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,793
As you wish.

172
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,766
Watch where you're flying.

173
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,166
Something for me?

174
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,944
Greetings, Pokémon trainers.
I bear an invitation.

175
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,446
She's really small,
but really pretty!

176
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,984
You've been chosen to join a group of
Pokémon trainers at a gathering.

177
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:50,180
It will be hosted by my master, the
world's greatest Pokémon trainer...

178
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,383
...at his palace on New Island.

179
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,186
A ferry will leave Old Shore Wharf...

180
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,695
... to take you to the island
this afternoon.

181
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,698
Only trainers with this
invitation will be admitted.

182
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,430
If you decide to attend,
you must reply at once.

183
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,403
My master awaits you.

184
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,677
Is there a rewind button?

185
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:16,339
-Should we go?
-Of course! I've got to meet her!

186
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:20,886
I guess the world's number-one trainer
wants to challenge me to a match!

187
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:24,724
-We've got to let him know right away.
-I'm saying yes!

188
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:39,538
What's so special about
the twerp trio's special delivery?

189
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:43,837
Hey, look!

190
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,911
"Yes"? To what?

191
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,649
Raticate!

192
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,355
Chill out, Raticate!

193
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:37,352
IKingler! Save your energy!

194
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,584
This is going to be so cool!

195
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,093
Officer Jenny, report to
the ferry entrance.

196
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,561
Officer Jenny to
the ferry entrance.

197
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,627
Togepi's totally soaked!

198
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,975
I can't believe how
fast the storm came up.

199
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,713
What?! The ferry is canceled?!

200
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,884
But I've got to get to New lsland!

201
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:07,415
-It's only a little rain!
-It's more than just rain.

202
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,318
The harbor manager thinks
this could be the worst storm ever.

203
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:11,992
Listen to me.

204
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,789
The prophets have predicted
the return of the Winds of Water.

205
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:17,295
For years...

206
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,833
...I prayed mankind would never
witness that deadly storm ever again.

207
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,865
Isn't that just a legend?

208
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:28,540
Ancient writings tell of the storm
wiping out all but a few Pokémon.

209
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,038
In their sorrow...

210
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:34,238
...the water of their tears restored
the lives lost in the storm.

211
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,610
But there are no Pokémon tears today.

212
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:39,616
Just waters which no one can survive.

213
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,790
That's why the ferry
has been canceled.

214
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:47,359
I'm going to New lsland anyway!
All my Pokémon are Water-type!

215
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,820
We'll just swim over to that palace!

216
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:53,866
I warn you, the waves will
be savage! You will never make it!

217
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,163
If you try that stunt and
your Pokémon got hurt...

218
00:20:57,372 --> 00:21:01,069
...you'd be out of luck because
we closed the Pokémon Center.

219
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:02,402
How come?

220
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:05,876
The nurse in charge of
the center disappeared last month.

221
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,380
If any of you see her,
please contact me at once.

222
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,382
That's a picture of her
over there on the wall.

223
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,452
She's cute.

224
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,919
She sure looks familiar.

225
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,772
Come back here, or
I'll place you under arrest!

226
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:44,410
Come back!

227
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,278
Some trainers have no fear.

228
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,684
To them, this is just
one more challenge.

229
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,723
They follow their hearts.

230
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:57,058
That is what sets them apart
and will make them Pokémon masters.

231
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,027
Good luck to all of you.

232
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,742
The world's greatest Pokémon
master is waiting for me.

233
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,314
Let's use our Pokémon
to get to that island.

234
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:21,852
Our Pokémon aren't strong enough.
They can't handle waves like this.

235
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,022
Guess you're right.

236
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,192
You vant to cross maybe?
Ve take you?

237
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,369
Ve Vikings are used to big vaves.

238
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,266
Ve get you to New lsland faster
than you can say fahrvergnügen.

239
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:39,935
Stroke!

240
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,006
Stroke!

241
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,304
Stroke! Stroke!

242
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,614
I think I'm going to have one.

243
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:53,151
-I didn't know Vikings still existed.
-They mostly live in Minnesota.

244
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:57,049
Something's not right.
Are you sure this boat's safe?

245
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:01,053
Don't vorry. This ship
von't let you down.

246
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:04,528
Ve alvays sail in da
rough veather. Don't get upset.

247
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,496
Tell my stomach.

248
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:10,462
Heave! Heave! Heave!

249
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,573
It's all right, Togepi.
We're going to be okay.

250
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:36,090
-Those aren't Vikings.
-It's Team Rocket.

251
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,334
I knew there was something fishy
about them besides the smell!

252
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,432
-Prepare for trouble.
-Make it double.

253
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:47,039
Forget the motto.
We're going to have to....

254
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,315
Ash! Misty!

255
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,989
-Have you seen Ash and Pikachu?
-Not yet.

256
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,829
Stay together. It's our only hope.

257
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,542
Look!

258
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,483
My master bids you
welcome to New lsland.

259
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,787
IKindly present your invitation.

260
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,226
Here it is, miss.

261
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:30,762
The bearers of this invitation may
be admitted.

262
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,172
I knew I recognized that face.

263
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,601
What?

264
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,212
Aren't you the nurse
from the treatment center?

265
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,311
You do look just like her.

266
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,950
I fear you are mistaken.

267
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:48,486
I've always dwelt on this island
and been in the service of my master.

268
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,220
Please, come this way.

269
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,654
My master awaits your arrival.

270
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:23,013
With you here, all trainers...

271
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:26,312
...worthy of an audience with
my master are present.

272
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,193
There's only three of them.

273
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,523
Aren't we waiting for the others?

274
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:39,928
Only the trainers capable
of braving the storm...

275
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,160
...are worthy in my master's eyes.

276
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,237
Do you mean that storm
was some kind of test?

277
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,206
Release your Pokémon from
their Pokéballs and join the others.

278
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,243
It won't be long before
my master's intentions are clear.

279
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,988
Now we'll never know what
kind of party we're missing!

280
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:08,185
We'll just have to crash that party.

281
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:11,763
-You know another way in?
-Look over there.

282
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:19,798
But how are we going
to swim up that thing?

283
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,100
Pretend you're a catfish.

284
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:32,148
-Something wrong, Jessie?
-No. Come on. Let's get going.

285
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,081
I think this plan's all wet.

286
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,754
Psy-ya-ya duck.

287
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,933
What took you guys so long?

288
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,030
How did you get here?

289
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,198
I decided to fly over.
It was easy.

290
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,466
Hurricane winds are
a breeze for Pidgeotto here.

291
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,437
Guys, say hello.

292
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,014
Those are my Pokémon.

293
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,855
It was no problem
getting through that storm.

294
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,150
I rode over on Gyarados' back.

295
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,485
I heard it takes a lot
of skill to train Gyarados.

296
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:18,994
Y es, but once you train it, it's
the most dependable Pokémon there is.

297
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:24,770
You haven't met my
Pokémon. Over there.

298
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,461
You are about to meet my master.

299
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:53,528
The time has come to encounter
the greatest Pokémon master on Earth.

300
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,347
What's that?

301
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:57,663
Yes. The world's greatest
Pokémon master...

302
00:31:57,865 --> 00:32:00,698
...is also the most
powerful Pokémon on Earth.

303
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,966
This is the ruler of New lsland
and soon the whole world.

304
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,231
Mewtwo.

305
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,236
Mewtwo.

306
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:13,038
A Pokémon can't be
a Pokémon master! No way!

307
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:17,679
Quiet, human. From now on,
I am the one who makes the rules.

308
00:32:17,952 --> 00:32:20,079
-How's it talking?
-It's psychic.

309
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:47,813
We'll show you! Let's go, Gyarados!

310
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,546
Gyarados, Hyper-Beam attack!

311
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,704
Gyarados!

312
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:15,298
Child's play.

313
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,110
Your usefulness has ended.

314
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,222
Nurse Joy!

315
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,985
Where am l? And how
in the world did I get here?

316
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,525
You have been under my control.

317
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,324
I transported you here
from the Pokémon center.

318
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:43,937
Your knowledge of Pokémon
physiology proved useful to my plan.

319
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:48,666
I have cleansed your tiny human
brain of memories from the past weeks.

320
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:50,002
Who are you?!

321
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,304
I am the new ruler of this world...

322
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:55,175
...the master of humans
and Pokémon alike.

323
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,112
You're just a bully!

324
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:27,711
Look at these.

325
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,959
They're Pokémon.

326
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,253
Are they real?

327
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,165
I was hoping there'd be a party.

328
00:34:56,778 --> 00:35:01,340
This is the Pokémon replication
system. System activated.

329
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,446
Pokémon based on genetic analysis.

330
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:08,918
Pokémon DNA sampling
sequence now in progress.

331
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,246
Put me down.

332
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,253
What are you--? Let go!

333
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,426
-Help!
-Grab him!

334
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,855
Help me!

335
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,473
I made it. But just by a hair.

336
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,311
Look, there's your hair.

337
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,606
Analyzing Pokémon biomaterial sample.

338
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,851
Analysis complete.
Pokémon identified.

339
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:39,943
Begin replication sequence.

340
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,452
-Who's that Pokémon?
-It's Meowth.

341
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,190
Meowth!

342
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,235
But I'm Meowth.

343
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:57,802
-So is the one in the tank.
-Your clone.

344
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,308
I haven't got much time.

345
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,377
I pray this record of
our experiment survives.

346
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,548
A year ago we discovered...

347
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,979
...the remains of
the ancient Pokémon, Mew.

348
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,546
There was sufficient
genetic material to replicate Mew.

349
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,486
Giovanni insisted on super-clones...

350
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,184
...more powerful than
any living Pokémon.

351
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:24,421
Finally our experiments
proved successful.

352
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:28,966
We produced a living Pokémon.
We called it Mewtwo.

353
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:32,995
But the creature's anger
is out of control.

354
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:36,775
With its psychic powers,
it's destroying our laboratory.

355
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:40,545
We dreamed of creating
the world's strongest Pokémon...

356
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:42,773
...and we succeeded.

357
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:48,716
-Sounds like a real Pokénstein.
-Sure does.

358
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,289
One bad cat!

359
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,357
So this must be the lab.

360
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,696
But if Mewtwo destroyed it....

361
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:59,389
-Somebody rebuilt it.
-Y es, but who?

362
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:06,070
You humans are a dangerous species.

363
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:11,008
You brought me into your world
with no purpose but to be your slave.

364
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,906
But now I have my own purpose.

365
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:17,516
My storm will create my own world...

366
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:20,516
...by destroying yours.

367
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:25,055
So you hate all humans? And you're
going to destroy us to save Pokémon.

368
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,619
No.

369
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,756
Your Pokémon will not be spared.

370
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,395
They have disgraced
themselves by serving humans.

371
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,100
Those Pokémon are nothing but slaves.

372
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,506
So, you say I am wrong?

373
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:45,576
You are not this human's servant?
You are his friend?

374
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:49,281
You are as pathetic as the rest.

375
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:01,318
Humans and Pokémon
can never be friends.

376
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,395
Are you okay?

377
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:06,859
Don't pick on Pikachu.

378
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,569
If you are Pokémon, there's
no reason I can't capture you.

379
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,030
Go, Rhyhorn.

380
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:36,023
-No! Rhyhorn!
-Fools!

381
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,531
Your Pokémon attacks cannot
weaken me. My powers are too great.

382
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,669
No trainer can conquer me.

383
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,202
You won't mind proving it
in a real match!

384
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,930
Is that a challenge?

385
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,369
You bet it is!

386
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:08,052
They're awake!

387
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,736
Blast.

388
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,954
Saur.

389
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,607
-I'm scared.
-Me too.

390
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,742
Like most Pokémon trainers...

391
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:07,017
...I too began with Charmander,
Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

392
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,651
But for their evolved forms...

393
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:14,257
...I used their genetic material
to clone even more powerful copies.

394
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:16,794
-Copies!
-They're clones.

395
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:46,884
A stadium! Mewtwo
planned this all along.

396
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,995
Your fake Venusaur
can't beat my real one!

397
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,459
Right, Bruteroot?

398
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,227
We'll blow away that Blastoise,
won't we Shellshocker?!

399
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:01,032
It may not have a nickname,
but I do have a Charizard.

400
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:03,005
I choose you!

401
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:17,290
Charizard, I didn't say start.

402
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:27,834
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

403
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:48,082
Which of you will oppose me first?

404
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:53,619
Saur.

405
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:57,763
I underestimated you last time,
but that won't happen again!

406
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,245
Go, Bruteroot! Razor Leaf!

407
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:18,643
Vine Whip.

408
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,167
Bruteroot!

409
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,033
It looks like I'm up.

410
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,637
Go, Shellshocker!

411
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,964
Blastoise.

412
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,937
Blast.

413
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,736
Shellshocker, Hydro Pump!

414
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,249
Shellshocker!

415
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:59,014
You better forfeit, Ash.
Those clones are too powerful.

416
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:00,284
I'm not giving up.

417
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:10,000
Charizard, use your speed,
not power, and you'll win.

418
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:12,569
All right, go!

419
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,513
-Can't Charizard move any quicker?
-The clone is too fast.

420
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,769
-Charizard's in trouble!
-Finish it.

421
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,623
No, Charizard! No!
Are you okay?

422
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:13,561
As the victor, I now claim my prize:

423
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:15,234
Your Pokémon.

424
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:19,465
Wait!

425
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:25,975
What will you do with those Pokémon?!

426
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,772
I will extract their DNA
to make clones for myself.

427
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:32,349
They will remain safe
on this island...

428
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:34,714
...while my storm destroys the planet.

429
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:36,047
You can't do this!

430
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,481
Yes, Mewtwo! We won't let you!

431
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,717
Do not attempt to defy me.

432
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:48,296
This is my world now.

433
00:44:51,238 --> 00:44:52,535
Let's go!

434
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:01,309
Gyarados!

435
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:40,617
I know!

436
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,313
Mewtwo can't catch them
if they're inside their Pokéballs.

437
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,550
Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!

438
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:50,627
It's no use.

439
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,462
It's futile to try
and escape my power.

440
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:01,902
Never mind the Pokéballs.
Carry them away!

441
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:05,472
Give back my Psyduck!

442
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:07,936
Vulpix!

443
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,754
Run, Pikachu!

444
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:46,543
IKeep running, Pikachu!

445
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,943
You're not going to get Pikachu!

446
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,120
There goes Alakazam.

447
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:05,428
Dewgong.

448
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:07,891
Vileplume.

449
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:16,433
Sandshrew. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

450
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:20,406
But me, I got a special
place in my tail for this one.

451
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:28,713
Look there!

452
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:33,222
I don't have time for
your dumb motto today.

453
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,126
Who's that Pokémon? It's Pikachu!

454
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:45,736
Let go! Stupid machine.

455
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:48,733
Give me back my Pikachu!

456
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:55,941
What's happening?

457
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:22,474
I'm so glad you're okay.

458
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,607
The copies are hatching!

459
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:42,455
-They're fabulous fakes!
-Send in the clones!

460
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:45,127
But where are the real ones?

461
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:53,195
-I wonder if they feel....
-Clonesome?

462
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:06,549
The Poké originals!

463
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,928
Squirtle's back!

464
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:26,430
You're all okay!

465
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:57,836
Humans, you have served my purpose.

466
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,574
I am sparing your lives,
for the moment.

467
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,518
But you cannot escape your fate.

468
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,211
The hour of my vengeance draws near.

469
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:26,755
Behold!

470
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,633
With Pokémon and humans eliminated...

471
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,102
...the clones shall inherit the world.

472
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:37,936
You can't do this. I won't let you.

473
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:45,941
-It's Ash!
-All right!

474
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:58,090
-Psyduck!
-Vulpix!

475
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:04,166
It is useless to challenge me.

476
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:08,972
It's not going to end like this,
Mewtwo. We won't let it.

477
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:11,137
You're mine!

478
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:24,354
-Ash, no!
-Look out!

479
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:32,620
What?

480
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:41,804
Can it be?

481
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,089
-What is that?
-I don't know.

482
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:12,766
Mew. So finally we meet.

483
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:19,174
I may have been
cloned from your DNA...

484
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:22,904
...but I will prove that Mewtwo
is better than the original.

485
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:24,945
Superior to Mew.

486
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:28,381
Mew and Mewtwo!

487
00:53:28,722 --> 00:53:31,213
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew.

488
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,421
This world is too small for two of us.

489
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,532
Why do you flee from me?

490
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:54,373
Are you afraid to
find out which of us is greater?

491
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,712
So you do have some fight in you.

492
00:54:32,452 --> 00:54:36,684
But I have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand.

493
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:40,584
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?

494
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:45,026
Or your pathetic group
of spineless inferior Pokémon?

495
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:49,964
We were created with powers
far stronger than the originals.

496
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:58,342
-Mew's got a good point.
-What's it saying?

497
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:02,680
You don't prove anything by
showing off a lot of special powers.

498
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,648
And that a Pokémon's
real strength comes from the heart.

499
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:11,980
My clones don't need
their powers to prove their worth.

500
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:26,538
I will block all the Pokémon's
special abilities...

501
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,401
...using my psychic powers.

502
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,634
Now we shall see who triumphs. Go!

503
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:12,634
Pokémon aren't meant to fight.
Not like this.

504
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,839
It's useless.
What can come out of it?

505
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:19,702
Nothing but pain.

506
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,310
Can't Mewtwo understand it's
not right to force Pokémon to battle?

507
00:58:24,517 --> 00:58:26,678
They're all living creatures.

508
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,021
This just proves
that fighting is wrong.

509
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,787
I was prepared for trouble,
but not for this.

510
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:39,760
Make that double for me.

511
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,967
Now I can see how
horrible fighting really is.

512
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:45,728
Even the best of friends
will fight sometimes.

513
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,067
I'll promise never to
fight again if you will.

514
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:04,079
What am I doing?

515
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:07,523
Let's get something straight!

516
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:10,696
You-owth ain't pushing Meowth around.

517
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,233
You mean, we don't have
to fight with each other?

518
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:18,131
But how can I trust you?
You was born different.

519
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,034
I almost made a clawful mistake.

520
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:25,676
How do I know you're not
going to pull a fast one on me?

521
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:32,549
You're right, we
do have a lot in common.

522
00:59:32,752 --> 00:59:37,086
The same earth, the
same air, the same sky.

523
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,389
Maybe if we started
looking at what's the same...

524
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:46,122
...instead of always looking at
what's different, who knows?

525
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,520
Quit it! Please, stop!

526
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,245
Are you okay?

527
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,654
We got to stop this.

528
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,988
How? Mewtwo wants to prove
how strong those super-clones are.

529
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:31,064
I'd rather risk my life
out in Mewtwo's storm...

530
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,830
...than watch Pokémon
destroy each other.

531
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:35,500
Me too.

532
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:39,576
I wish there were some way to
stop them. I don't know what to do.

533
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:45,381
I don't think they'll ever stop.

534
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:48,748
Those Pokémon are ready
to fight to the death.

535
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,924
That's a fight that
nobody's going to win.

536
01:01:52,258 --> 01:01:54,692
Someone's got to take a stand.

537
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:58,796
Someone's got to say no
and refuse to fight.

538
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:01,295
Just like Pikachu.

539
01:03:04,063 --> 01:03:05,052
Ash, wait!

540
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:07,994
You've got to stop right now!

541
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:11,091
Stop!!

542
01:03:14,273 --> 01:03:15,262
Oh, no!

543
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,346
Fool, trying to stop our battle.

544
01:04:11,364 --> 01:04:12,854
Please, no!

545
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:51,855
The human sacrificed
himself to save the Pokémon.

546
01:06:52,124 --> 01:06:53,921
I pitted them against each other.

547
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:56,253
Only when they set aside
their differences...

548
01:06:56,462 --> 01:07:00,262
...did I see the true power
they all share deep inside.

549
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,402
I see now that the circumstances
of one's birth are irrelevant.

550
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,970
It is what you do with
the gift of life...

551
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:10,642
...that determines who you are.

552
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:51,314
Mewtwo, where are you going?

553
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:55,787
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

554
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,082
What transpired here,
I will always remember.

555
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:03,387
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.

556
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:31,321
-This could be the worst storm ever.
-You must listen to me.

557
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:33,285
You have got to find shelter.

558
01:08:33,492 --> 01:08:35,119
Excuse me, please.

559
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:38,387
The Pokémon Treatment Center
will open as a shelter.

560
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:42,064
Anyone who needs a place
to stay should come with me.

561
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,837
Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny
are really great.

562
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:53,671
They keep getting more beautiful
every time I see them.

563
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:57,076
Guys, how did we wind up
in this place anyway?

564
01:08:57,283 --> 01:09:00,878
Well, I guess we're
just here because we're here.

565
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:04,079
Yes, let's eat.

566
01:09:05,024 --> 01:09:07,083
Look, it's a miracle!

567
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,395
I can't believe it.

568
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:24,167
-The storm disappeared.
-That's so weird!

569
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:27,711
It's good to have things clear again.

570
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:41,015
What's that?

571
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:43,422
What's what?

572
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:47,465
-I don't see anything, Ash.
-Except the sky.

573
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,400
The day I started
my Pokémon journey...

574
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,732
...I saw a really rare Pokémon.

575
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,932
And just now, I thought
I saw another one.

576
01:09:58,477 --> 01:10:01,446
Maybe you're just seeing things, Ash.

577
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:03,940
Maybe he's not.

578
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,217
Maybe we'll see.

579
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,289
Many strange legends
surround the mysteries of Pokémon.

580
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,324
Just as many adventures
await our heroes...

581
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:19,588
...as they continue on their quest.

582
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:23,199
For Ash and his friends,
the journey's just begun.

583
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:32,640
I don' t know how we
got here, but who cares?

584
01:10:32,845 --> 01:10:36,212
-This is paradise!
-For once, a happy ending.

585
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:40,746
Team Rocket's signing off again!

586
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:43,211
Have any unscreen?

587
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:46,858
I'd really like to go sailing
in one of them catamarans.
