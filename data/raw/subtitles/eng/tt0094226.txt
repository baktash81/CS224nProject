1
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,163
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

2
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,669
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

3
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,376
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

4
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:41,925
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

5
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:46,471
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

6
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,645
Some people say,
reformers here say:

7
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:52,806
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

8
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:56,479
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

9
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,987
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

10
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:06,532
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

11
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,536
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

12
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:13,537
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

13
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,998
I'm a businessman.

14
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:21,217
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

15
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:26,057
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

16
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:33,563
It's all right.

17
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,936
I grew up in a tough neighborhood.

18
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,990
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

19
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,283
"than you can
with just a kind word."

20
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,862
And in that neighborhood
it might've been true.

21
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:50,664
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

22
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:54,831
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

23
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:59,341
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

24
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:34,828
<i>Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.</i>

25
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,045
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

26
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42,468
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

27
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,388
I'm not buyin' any.

28
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,424
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

29
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:58,477
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

30
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,738
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

31
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,153
Oh, she does?

32
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:09,529
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

33
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,120
- There you go.
- Thank you.

34
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:22,627
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

35
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,249
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

36
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,007
Hey, Mister! Wait!

37
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,591
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

38
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:41,327
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

39
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,916
I know.

40
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,380
Now it's time to go to work.

41
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,677
You'll make a good first impression.

42
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,523
I love you, Eliot.

43
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,239
Now, shoo.

44
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:23,662
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

45
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,369
- Mr. Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

46
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,923
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

47
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,882
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

48
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,630
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

49
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,633
Mr. Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

50
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,689
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

51
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,938
with the Chicago Police...

52
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,357
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

53
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,733
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

54
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,817
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

55
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:01,240
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

56
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,867
It is the law of the land.

57
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,835
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

58
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,369
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

59
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,960
Do you have any political ambitions?

60
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,843
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

61
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,508
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

62
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,800
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

63
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,684
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

64
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:29,148
Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

65
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,313
Are you ready to meet the men?

66
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,736
Yes, I am.

67
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,542
I have one more thing to say.

68
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,674
I know that many of you take a drink.

69
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,753
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

70
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:03,507
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

71
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:09,306
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

72
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,101
But it's against the law.

73
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:15,563
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

74
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,940
Are there any questions?

75
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,698
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

76
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,039
a man undercover here
for some time now.

77
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,292
We've received word
from this informant

78
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:36,003
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

79
00:10:36,216 --> 00:10:38,886
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

80
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:51,603
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

81
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:55,065
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

82
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:59,855
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

83
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:04,450
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

84
00:11:11,376 --> 00:11:14,875
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

85
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:23,709
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

86
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:33,185
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

87
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:42,359
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

88
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,150
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

89
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:53,239
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,966
A message from my wife.

91
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:06,467
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

92
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,468
Nice to be married, huh?

93
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,449
Just follow me.

94
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,280
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

95
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,821
Get 'em up. Drop it.

96
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,613
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

97
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,202
Mr. Ness. Look, I was just...

98
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,462
Geez, I'm sorry.

99
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:30,216
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

100
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,636
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

101
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:37,345
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

102
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,768
Okay. Just shut up.

103
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,175
All right now...
Let's do some good!

104
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:24,559
Hold it right there!

105
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:31,813
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

106
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:43,743
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

107
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,751
Preseuski.

108
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,960
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

109
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:55,094
- Mr. Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

110
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,849
Let him through here.

111
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:03,179
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

112
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:06,679
- You ready?
- Ready.

113
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Liquor, huh?

114
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,297
Get him out of here.

115
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:43,595
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

116
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,763
That means you, too.

117
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,488
Christ!

118
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:19,519
Now, what do you think you're doing?

119
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:24,614
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

120
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:28,030
Don't you have
more important things to do?

121
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,412
Yeah.

122
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,198
But I'm not doing them right now.

123
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:37,082
Do we understand each other?

124
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:43,219
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

125
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:48,470
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

126
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,595
All right.

127
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:57,514
Just remember
what we talked about now.

128
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,896
Hey... Wait a minute!

129
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:07,864
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

130
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,948
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

131
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:14,912
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

132
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:18,247
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

133
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:27,219
What's your name and unit?

134
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,555
It's right here.

135
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:38,348
You got a beef?
What is it?

136
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:43,813
How did you know I had a gun?

137
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,814
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

138
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,531
No.

139
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,831
Are you okay, pal?

140
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:01,379
I had a rough day on the job.

141
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,091
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

142
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:13,052
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

143
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,095
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

144
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,434
Here endeth the lesson.

145
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:27,413
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

146
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,716
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

147
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,881
55 gallons to the barrel.

148
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,482
<i>- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.</i>

149
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:20,265
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

150
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:22,883
And then, we bust through...

151
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,478
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes?

152
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:19,030
I came here to thank you.

153
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,652
It was...

154
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:24,652
...my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

155
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:27,992
I'm sorry. Please.

156
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,159
I'm... I'm so sorry.

157
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:38,166
You see, it's... because I know
that you have children, too.

158
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:44,504
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

159
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,425
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

160
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:51,313
And you do that, now.

161
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,615
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

162
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,000
Come in.

163
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:02,378
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

164
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:06,543
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

165
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:12,978
<i>- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.</i>

166
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:16,770
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

167
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:20,855
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

168
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:24,062
If I'm such a good cop...

169
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:28,366
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

170
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,486
Do you want to tell me?

171
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:33,575
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

172
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,540
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

173
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:39,746
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

174
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:43,712
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

175
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:48,255
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

176
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,932
I'm askin' you for help.

177
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:59,888
Well... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

178
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:08,903
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and... twenty pounds ago.

179
00:25:09,117 --> 00:25:14,823
But... I just think it got...
more important to me...

180
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,748
...to stay alive.

181
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:28,047
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

182
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,018
<i>That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.</i>

183
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,775
<i>I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!</i>

184
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,324
<i>- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.</i>

185
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:55,951
<i>Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.</i>

186
00:25:56,163 --> 00:26:00,077
<i>Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.</i>

187
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,332
<i>Yeah, start it up, Andy.</i>

188
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:12,385
<i>Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!</i>

189
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:17,305
<i>Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!</i>

190
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,012
<i>Andy! She's boilin' over!</i>

191
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,991
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes.

192
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:37,609
Oscar Wallace.

193
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:42,540
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

194
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,992
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:49,921
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?

196
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,844
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

197
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:56,011
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

198
00:26:56,223 --> 00:27:00,090
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

199
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,769
He has not filed a return since 1926.

200
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:12,984
- A return?
- An income tax return.

201
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,985
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,613
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

203
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,834
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

204
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,126
Would you excuse me?

205
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,874
Please.

206
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:02,908
Okay. Let's go.

207
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:07,036
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

208
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:13,959
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

209
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:20,679
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

210
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:25,468
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

211
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,640
And then what are you
prepared to do?

212
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:31,228
If you open the ball
on these people,

213
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,979
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

214
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:37,361
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

215
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,649
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

216
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:44,742
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

217
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:47,706
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

218
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:51,534
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

219
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,041
Now, do you want to do that?

220
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:59,963
Are you ready to do that?

221
00:29:01,597 --> 00:29:05,594
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

222
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:09,051
I have sworn to put this man away,

223
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:14,431
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

224
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:25,616
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

225
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:35,997
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr. Ness?

226
00:29:36,214 --> 00:29:39,167
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

227
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:44,422
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

228
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:48,257
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

229
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:51,927
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

230
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:56,642
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

231
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:01,604
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

232
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:04,823
Because I swore to uphold the law.

233
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,869
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

234
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:12,326
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

235
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:16,621
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

236
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:21,665
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

237
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:24,209
Get it off the tree.

238
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:26,797
Get it off the tree...

239
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,265
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

240
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,644
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

241
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,267
About face!

242
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:41,231
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr. Eliot Ness.

243
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:45,228
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

244
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:50,075
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

245
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:53,537
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

246
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:58,659
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

247
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:01,286
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

248
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,079
<i>- Good.
- Williamson!</i>

249
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,797
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

250
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:13,514
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

251
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:18,139
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

252
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:21,060
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

253
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:25,439
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

254
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:28,655
- What I think? I...
- You...

255
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:31,985
...could help... the force.

256
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,990
- You can help...
- With the force.

257
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:40,833
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

258
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:48,921
At ease!

259
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:52,421
Stone! Out here.

260
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,720
This kid's a prodigy.

261
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:02,976
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

262
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:06,145
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

263
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:10,406
Where are you from, Stone?

264
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:14,992
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

265
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:18,204
George Stone, that's your name?

266
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:24,038
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

267
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:26,579
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

268
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:33,302
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

269
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:36,431
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

270
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,261
What's that you said?

271
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:43,262
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

272
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,318
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

273
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:53,320
Oh, I like him.

274
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:58,533
Yeah, I like him, too.

275
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:02,034
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

276
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,541
Yeah, okay.

277
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:09,002
Eliot Ness.

278
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:13,130
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

279
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:16,095
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

280
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,437
What do you think?

281
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,898
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

282
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:33,937
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

283
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:37,691
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

284
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,702
We need another man.

285
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,118
Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.

286
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:46,411
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

287
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:48,584
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

288
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,835
Carry a gun.

289
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:09,804
- Jimmy?
- What?

290
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,654
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

291
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:16,736
Shut up. I'm working.

292
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,491
Where? The circus?

293
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:42,806
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

294
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:45,091
Liquor raid.

295
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:48,265
Here?!

296
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,773
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

297
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:57,942
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

298
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,991
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

299
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:17,875
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

300
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:21,046
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

301
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:22,720
Yes, I do.

302
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:26,053
Good. Give me that axe.

303
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,735
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

304
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:40,233
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

305
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,446
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

306
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:47,407
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

307
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:51,405
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

308
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:55,243
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

309
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,916
How do you think he feels now?
Better... or worse?

310
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:11,097
<i>- What is that?
- What is that?</i>

311
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,477
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

312
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:19,683
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

313
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:24,364
<i>Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.</i>

314
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:27,243
And policemen.

315
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:31,994
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

316
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,368
Lost causes, policemen...

317
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:40,168
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

318
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,208
- You do?
- Yes.

319
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,631
Why?

320
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:49,471
'To protect the property
and the citizenry... '

321
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,012
Whoa, it's all right.

322
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,719
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

323
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,723
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

324
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:03,814
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

325
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:06,650
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

326
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:10,910
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

327
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:21,201
Life goes on.

328
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:29,424
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

329
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:31,678
Enthusiasms...

330
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,554
Enthusiasms...

331
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:38,894
What are mine?

332
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:43,896
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

333
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,360
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

334
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,322
Baseball!

335
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,872
A man...

336
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:04,419
A man stands alone at the plate.

337
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:09,040
This is the time for what?

338
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,763
For individual achievement.

339
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:16,472
There he stands alone.

340
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,849
But in the field, what?

341
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:23,311
Part of a team.

342
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,772
Teamwork...

343
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:35,194
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

344
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,613
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

345
00:38:43,377 --> 00:38:47,422
If his team don't field... what is he?

346
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:51,502
You follow me?

347
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,388
No one.

348
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:59,721
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

349
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:05,347
I'm goin' out there for myself.

350
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:12,067
But... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

351
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,569
- Team!
- Team.

352
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,370
Jesus Christ!

353
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:49,436
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

354
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:53,020
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

355
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:56,025
'lf I should die before I wake'

356
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:59,610
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

357
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:01,737
- Amen.
- God bless...

358
00:40:01,955 --> 00:40:05,905
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

359
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,119
Amen.

360
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,926
Good night.

361
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:21,177
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

362
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,222
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

363
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:37,983
- Where are you going?
- What?

364
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:41,945
Where are you going?

365
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,996
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

366
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:49,453
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

367
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:51,791
And you've still got
some energy left?

368
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,711
Oh, a lot of work.

369
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:59,546
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

370
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,142
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organization is diverse.

371
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:21,775
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

372
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:25,906
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

373
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:28,742
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

374
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:31,530
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

375
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:35,369
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs... the list is endless!

376
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:39,289
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

377
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,510
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

378
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,848
that any of the 'organization'
business money is going to him.

379
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:51,270
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

380
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,014
- Mr. Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

381
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:58,317
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

382
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:00,401
Yes, I know who you are.

383
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,029
Would you excuse us?

384
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:11,951
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

385
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:15,369
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

386
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:21,340
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

387
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,762
What's that?

388
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:34,728
- What is that?
- Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

389
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:38,390
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

390
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:44,398
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

391
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:50,236
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

392
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:53,454
Would you come in here, please?

393
00:42:57,794 --> 00:43:02,622
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

394
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:05,047
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

395
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,879
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

396
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:13,474
You tell your master
that we must agree to... disagree!

397
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:18,139
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

398
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:22,935
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

399
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:26,522
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

400
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:31,735
Hey! Nice house!

401
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:34,789
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

402
00:43:36,457 --> 00:43:40,076
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

403
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:42,252
Yes.

404
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,705
Nice to have a family.

405
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:50,131
Yes, it is.

406
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:54,842
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

407
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:11,781
Catherine?!

408
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,159
Catherine!

409
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,826
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

410
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:34,378
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

411
00:44:34,598 --> 00:44:39,639
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

412
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,813
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

413
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,323
Okay, let's go.

414
00:44:56,536 --> 00:45:00,320
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

415
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:05,618
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

416
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,206
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

417
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:15,218
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

418
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,671
Take off your hat.

419
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:21,224
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

420
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:23,643
Yes, Mr. Ness.

421
00:45:26,942 --> 00:45:28,601
Kiss.

422
00:45:28,818 --> 00:45:31,937
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

423
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:37,531
Now, go!

424
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,258
Malone!

425
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:03,810
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

426
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:07,388
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

427
00:46:07,606 --> 00:46:10,809
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

428
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:13,981
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

429
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:17,695
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

430
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,363
A huge international
shipment's coming.

431
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:25,156
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

432
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:28,458
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

433
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:31,537
How do you come by this information?

434
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,878
That's the second rule
of police work:

435
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,842
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

436
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:45,392
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

437
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:48,175
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

438
00:46:48,397 --> 00:46:50,639
If we can establish
any payments to him,

439
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:53,894
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

440
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,439
What?

441
00:46:55,653 --> 00:46:59,983
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

442
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,534
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

443
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:06,781
Well, it's better than nothing.

444
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:10,996
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

445
00:47:12,086 --> 00:47:14,126
I don't know.

446
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:18,248
Go to sleep, Oscar.

447
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:08,175
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

448
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:12,057
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organization.

449
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:15,853
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

450
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:21,938
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

451
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:25,358
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

452
00:48:25,575 --> 00:48:29,489
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

453
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:32,824
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

454
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:36,826
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

455
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,037
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

456
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:43,917
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

457
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:47,339
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

458
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:51,884
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

459
00:48:52,102 --> 00:48:54,592
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

460
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,019
Thank you, Captain.

461
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,901
All right! Move out!

462
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:22,047
Take it easy.

463
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:26,630
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

464
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,343
This is the job.

465
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:34,221
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

466
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:37,056
Just watch what does happen.

467
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:40,311
Are you my 'tutor'?

468
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:44,360
Yes, sir, that I am.

469
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:50,033
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

470
00:49:50,243 --> 00:49:52,319
Then leave it alone.

471
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:55,569
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

472
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:59,407
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

473
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:05,917
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

474
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:09,217
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

475
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:12,512
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

476
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:17,052
Stitches and standing in the rain...

477
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:48,462
Listen, Mr. Ness...

478
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:51,968
I had an idea.

479
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,525
You all have your spare shells?

480
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:09,537
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

481
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:12,672
And put your man down.

482
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:17,846
Because he'll do the same to you.

483
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,296
Shoot to kill.

484
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:24,844
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,893
Let's go.

486
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,755
Easy...

487
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:57,583
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

488
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:01,385
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

489
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:03,305
George, the count's right.

490
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:06,802
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

491
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,688
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

492
00:53:09,897 --> 00:53:12,815
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

493
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:16,524
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

494
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:18,816
Charge!

495
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,942
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

496
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:30,196
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

497
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:32,374
Move, move!

498
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,213
Let's go!

499
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,888
I can't believe it!

500
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:53,139
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

501
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,147
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

502
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:15,876
Stone, take the first car!

503
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,044
Get this shit out of the way!

504
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,069
Tough guy!

505
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,032
Stone!

506
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:47,617
Go!

507
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,279
Stone!

508
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,701
I'm okay.

509
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,290
You thugs!

510
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,717
You all right?

511
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,806
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

512
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:33,531
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

513
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,447
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

514
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,661
Hello.

515
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:04,251
All right! Drop the gun!

516
00:57:04,461 --> 00:57:06,952
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

517
00:57:08,048 --> 00:57:10,088
I said, drop it!

518
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:13,511
Stop!

519
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:21,767
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

520
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:24,137
What are you, deaf?!

521
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:27,438
What is this, a game?!

522
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:55,459
Here. Sit down.

523
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:06,933
Stone's gonna be all right.

524
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:10,102
I got the fellow with the satchel.

525
00:58:16,741 --> 00:58:19,113
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

526
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:22,162
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

527
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:27,162
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

528
00:58:27,376 --> 00:58:31,954
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

529
00:58:32,173 --> 00:58:35,422
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

530
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:39,300
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

531
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:43,178
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

532
00:58:43,392 --> 00:58:46,761
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

533
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:49,980
Why don't you kiss my ass?

534
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:52,396
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

535
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:54,685
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

536
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:56,943
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

537
00:58:57,155 --> 00:59:00,192
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

538
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:03,161
- Eliot!
- What?!

539
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,742
Look at this!

540
00:59:05,955 --> 00:59:08,791
- Look at this!
- What is this?

541
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:12,829
What is this?

542
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:17,373
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

543
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:21,839
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

544
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:26,849
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'.

545
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,725
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

546
00:59:30,939 --> 00:59:33,892
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

547
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:37,442
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

548
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:39,445
then we can put Capone away.

549
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:43,356
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

550
00:59:43,576 --> 00:59:46,328
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

551
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:48,993
Translate this ledger for us!

552
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:50,749
- In hell.
- In hell?!

553
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:55,709
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

554
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:59,540
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

555
00:59:59,759 --> 01:00:01,503
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

556
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:08,349
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

557
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,469
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

558
01:00:10,686 --> 01:00:13,473
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

559
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:16,773
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

560
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:22,735
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

561
01:00:22,948 --> 01:00:26,282
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

562
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:28,486
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

563
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,863
I'm gonna count to three.

564
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:36,327
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

565
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:39,751
One.

566
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:45,885
Two!

567
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:49,342
Three.

568
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:51,893
I'm gonna talk!

569
01:00:52,102 --> 01:00:56,681
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

570
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:03,567
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

571
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,817
Now, ask him what you want to know.

572
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:11,197
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

573
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:15,541
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

574
01:01:15,751 --> 01:01:18,241
Mister Ness!

575
01:01:24,342 --> 01:01:26,631
I do not approve of your methods!

576
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:32,513
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

577
01:01:36,688 --> 01:01:38,976
- What?
- They got the shipment.

578
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,728
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

579
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:45,892
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

580
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:52,033
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

581
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:56,823
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

582
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:00,244
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

583
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:02,749
I want to piss on his ashes!

584
01:02:02,963 --> 01:02:08,206
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

585
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:11,677
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

586
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:13,846
- Yes.
- Like what?

587
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:17,052
Like what his name is.

588
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:21,433
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

589
01:02:21,649 --> 01:02:24,140
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

590
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:28,235
No... it'll be Edgar.

591
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:33,323
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

592
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:39,286
God, you're beautiful.

593
01:02:41,126 --> 01:02:43,368
You should have seen us last night.

594
01:02:45,422 --> 01:02:48,589
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

595
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:52,050
I know. I understand, I do.

596
01:02:53,597 --> 01:02:56,468
Just tell me, are you being careful?

597
01:02:56,683 --> 01:03:00,182
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

598
01:03:00,395 --> 01:03:02,554
- Progress?
- Yes?

599
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:06,936
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

600
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:20,073
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

601
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:25,200
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

602
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,955
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

603
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:32,293
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

604
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:36,591
Mr. Capone could have
up to 28 years.

605
01:03:36,806 --> 01:03:39,973
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

606
01:03:46,524 --> 01:03:50,818
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

607
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:53,151
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

608
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:55,273
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

609
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:59,073
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

610
01:03:59,286 --> 01:04:02,288
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

611
01:04:02,497 --> 01:04:05,285
Much more diverting
than accounting.

612
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,659
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

613
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:11,329
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

614
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:19,763
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

615
01:04:19,974 --> 01:04:22,215
Okay, we see yous tonight.

616
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:26,183
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

617
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:37,938
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

618
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:43,871
For which I must commend
the excellent work

619
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,746
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

620
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:52,709
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

621
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,877
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

622
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:59,046
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

623
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,635
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

624
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:06,301
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

625
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:10,849
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

626
01:05:11,066 --> 01:05:16,356
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

627
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,148
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

628
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:23,869
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

629
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,915
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

630
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,580
They are going to...

631
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:42,969
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

632
01:05:49,103 --> 01:05:52,472
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

633
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:34,804
Oh, no.

634
01:06:35,899 --> 01:06:38,983
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

635
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,023
Oscar.

636
01:07:22,028 --> 01:07:24,270
Oh, Jesus.

637
01:07:27,992 --> 01:07:30,779
You gonna be all right?

638
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:56,050
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

639
01:07:57,145 --> 01:08:00,266
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

640
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:04,100
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

641
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,443
Jimmy!

642
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:10,320
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

643
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:12,574
You know what I mean?

644
01:08:29,678 --> 01:08:31,587
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr. Capone...

645
01:08:31,804 --> 01:08:35,304
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr. Capone...

646
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:37,391
I said...

647
01:08:44,025 --> 01:08:47,311
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

648
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:50,280
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

649
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:55,490
Now he does.

650
01:08:55,703 --> 01:09:00,033
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

651
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,578
That's it, come on!

652
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:05,375
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

653
01:09:05,588 --> 01:09:09,586
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

654
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:11,674
- What?
- Easy.

655
01:09:11,885 --> 01:09:15,420
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

656
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:21,387
Easy. It's me. It's me!

657
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:23,312
Not this way.

658
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:26,191
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

659
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:32,106
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

660
01:09:32,322 --> 01:09:36,700
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

661
01:09:46,128 --> 01:09:49,165
Well, no, I understand.

662
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:52,251
Believe me, I understand.

663
01:09:59,683 --> 01:10:02,055
Well, what's happened?

664
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,147
He says he can't be unprotected.

665
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,570
What is it that the guy says?

666
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:15,400
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

667
01:10:15,615 --> 01:10:18,949
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

668
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:23,407
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

669
01:10:23,623 --> 01:10:27,490
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

670
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,380
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

671
01:10:30,589 --> 01:10:34,253
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

672
01:10:35,343 --> 01:10:37,383
Hello?

673
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:41,470
Hello.

674
01:10:43,058 --> 01:10:45,098
Yes.

675
01:10:48,398 --> 01:10:51,315
No, he didn't have a family.

676
01:10:53,778 --> 01:10:56,483
How is everything there?

677
01:10:59,742 --> 01:11:03,242
No, you do it however you want.

678
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:07,530
I promise I will.

679
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:10,951
You give her my love.

680
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,209
I love you, too.

681
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:20,501
Mr. Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

682
01:11:20,721 --> 01:11:24,670
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

683
01:11:24,892 --> 01:11:28,936
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

684
01:11:29,146 --> 01:11:33,060
I'd like to request to stick around.

685
01:11:34,234 --> 01:11:36,807
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

686
01:11:45,704 --> 01:11:47,780
Is that it?

687
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:51,495
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

688
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:54,166
My question is, are we done?

689
01:11:56,173 --> 01:11:58,544
Yes, I think we're done.

690
01:11:58,758 --> 01:12:01,629
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

691
01:12:01,845 --> 01:12:04,217
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr. Wallace.

692
01:12:04,431 --> 01:12:06,719
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

693
01:12:06,933 --> 01:12:09,222
He will not go into court
without a witness

694
01:12:09,435 --> 01:12:12,389
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

695
01:12:12,606 --> 01:12:17,433
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

696
01:12:17,652 --> 01:12:20,403
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

697
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:38,499
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

698
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:42,377
- My wife?
- Yeah.

699
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:49,218
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

700
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,886
It's nice being married, eh?

701
01:12:55,147 --> 01:12:56,475
Yes.

702
01:12:56,691 --> 01:12:59,976
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

703
01:13:00,194 --> 01:13:04,487
going over...
kitchen color charts or something.

704
01:13:11,122 --> 01:13:16,827
Some part of the world still cares
what color the kitchen is.

705
01:13:21,382 --> 01:13:25,675
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

706
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:31,632
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

707
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:36,514
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

708
01:13:39,941 --> 01:13:42,349
I think I know how to find this guy.

709
01:13:44,446 --> 01:13:47,198
Walter?

710
01:13:47,407 --> 01:13:52,402
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

711
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:55,538
We're leavin' tonight.

712
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:00,915
Two ball, down.

713
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,969
Mike, you got a minute?

714
01:14:08,178 --> 01:14:10,847
I do now, don't I?

715
01:14:11,973 --> 01:14:15,258
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

716
01:14:16,227 --> 01:14:18,800
This is a place for cops.

717
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,595
Can we step outside?

718
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:26,145
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

719
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:35,906
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

720
01:14:38,249 --> 01:14:41,001
What? What?!

721
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,295
I just need one more
piece of information.

722
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:46,463
One more? Jimmy!

723
01:14:46,674 --> 01:14:51,715
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

724
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:58,801
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

725
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:03,017
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

726
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:07,810
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

727
01:15:08,028 --> 01:15:10,270
And I tried to save your life.

728
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:15,734
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

729
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:19,120
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

730
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:24,326
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

731
01:15:24,545 --> 01:15:28,755
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

732
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:34,505
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

733
01:15:36,389 --> 01:15:41,976
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

734
01:15:42,187 --> 01:15:46,185
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

735
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:50,527
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

736
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:54,781
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

737
01:15:54,991 --> 01:15:57,529
I'm gonna turn you over!

738
01:15:57,744 --> 01:16:01,279
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

739
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:05,285
You're dead.

740
01:16:27,856 --> 01:16:29,565
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

741
01:16:29,776 --> 01:16:32,610
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

742
01:16:41,162 --> 01:16:44,245
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

743
01:16:44,456 --> 01:16:47,493
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

744
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:50,201
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

745
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,003
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

746
01:16:54,216 --> 01:16:56,838
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

747
01:16:57,053 --> 01:16:59,626
I have men out there
risking more than that.

748
01:16:59,846 --> 01:17:02,338
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

749
01:17:02,557 --> 01:17:07,515
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

750
01:17:09,564 --> 01:17:11,640
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

751
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:13,436
<i>He's at the D.A.'s.</i>

752
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:16,569
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

753
01:17:36,049 --> 01:17:37,591
- Al! Al!
- Mr. Capone!

754
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:42,213
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

755
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:46,558
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

756
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:50,810
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

757
01:17:51,022 --> 01:17:54,272
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

758
01:17:54,484 --> 01:17:55,894
You understand?

759
01:17:56,736 --> 01:18:01,232
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

760
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:04,201
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

761
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:10,863
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

762
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:13,705
To speak to me like men? No.

763
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:16,837
To harass a peaceful man.

764
01:18:18,257 --> 01:18:20,296
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

765
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:23,878
I would have
just a little more self respect.

766
01:18:27,224 --> 01:18:30,427
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

767
01:18:30,644 --> 01:18:33,599
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

768
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:23,471
Isn't that just like a wop?

769
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:27,391
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

770
01:21:31,698 --> 01:21:34,235
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

771
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:37,741
Go on, get your ass out of here!

772
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,714
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

773
01:23:21,931 --> 01:23:25,549
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

774
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:27,179
Round the back.

775
01:23:36,737 --> 01:23:38,944
Malone!

776
01:23:41,825 --> 01:23:43,901
Malone.

777
01:24:11,438 --> 01:24:14,439
Goddamn! Stone!

778
01:24:16,986 --> 01:24:19,143
Stone!

779
01:24:20,406 --> 01:24:22,777
The phone!

780
01:24:24,576 --> 01:24:27,446
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

781
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:33,912
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

782
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:37,044
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

783
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,833
This? You want this?

784
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:46,922
You want this?

785
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:55,598
What?

786
01:25:02,738 --> 01:25:04,778
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

787
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,074
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

788
01:25:08,286 --> 01:25:11,488
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

789
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:14,990
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

790
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,285
He's on this train.

791
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,878
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

792
01:25:24,426 --> 01:25:27,344
No. Malone. No.

793
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:30,307
Stay. Stay.

794
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:32,924
Stay! Malone...

795
01:25:33,144 --> 01:25:35,183
No. No, no!

796
01:25:36,981 --> 01:25:40,480
Not this... Not this man...

797
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:10,760
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr. Ness.

798
01:26:12,683 --> 01:26:14,509
We'll be there.

799
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:20,097
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

800
01:26:20,315 --> 01:26:23,066
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

801
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,743
Cover the south entrance.

802
01:27:23,794 --> 01:27:26,961
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

803
01:27:29,467 --> 01:27:35,421
<i>Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.</i>

804
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,679
<i>All aboard.</i>

805
01:27:48,986 --> 01:27:52,105
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

806
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,650
Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.

807
01:28:08,588 --> 01:28:12,502
<i>Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12.05,</i>

808
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:16,631
<i>now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!</i>

809
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:33,269
Just here.
I'm just gonna leave this right here.

810
01:29:23,037 --> 01:29:28,113
<i>Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12.05,</i>

811
01:29:28,334 --> 01:29:33,576
<i>is now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!</i>

812
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:36,169
One more. Here we go.

813
01:29:58,655 --> 01:30:00,482
Here we go. You ready?

814
01:30:02,367 --> 01:30:05,486
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.

815
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:10,656
<i>Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?</i>

816
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,448
<i>This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,</i>

817
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:17,917
<i>leaving at 12.05 on track 33.
All aboard!</i>

818
01:30:57,254 --> 01:31:02,711
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

819
01:31:02,927 --> 01:31:06,343
Are you all right? Thank you.

820
01:31:08,182 --> 01:31:11,017
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

821
01:31:11,227 --> 01:31:15,224
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

822
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,818
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

823
01:31:22,029 --> 01:31:26,109
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

824
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:34,280
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

825
01:31:36,335 --> 01:31:39,786
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

826
01:31:41,715 --> 01:31:43,838
Thank you, sir.

827
01:31:52,475 --> 01:31:56,140
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

828
01:31:56,354 --> 01:31:59,439
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

829
01:32:01,609 --> 01:32:07,065
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

830
01:32:09,242 --> 01:32:12,860
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

831
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,286
Is something wrong?

832
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:18,870
Sir?

833
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:17,362
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

834
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:21,695
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

835
01:34:25,209 --> 01:34:27,747
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

836
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:31,295
- Hold it!
- Please...

837
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:34,128
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

838
01:34:36,845 --> 01:34:38,637
I said hold it!

839
01:34:40,016 --> 01:34:42,637
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

840
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:45,769
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

841
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,647
See? Or else he dies.

842
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,895
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

843
01:34:57,324 --> 01:35:00,527
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

844
01:35:01,286 --> 01:35:06,281
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

845
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:10,912
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

846
01:35:11,129 --> 01:35:13,620
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

847
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:20,718
- One!
- Will you stop it!

848
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:29,263
Take him.

849
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:33,390
Two.

850
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:02,222
The two coded entries
in this ledger

851
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:07,091
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

852
01:36:07,309 --> 01:36:12,980
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

853
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:17,777
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

854
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:21,652
I said that is correct.

855
01:36:21,866 --> 01:36:26,694
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

856
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:30,995
I will.

857
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:33,534
Sorry, Mr. Payne, I can't hear you.

858
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:36,539
I said, I will.

859
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:41,464
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr. Capone?

860
01:36:41,677 --> 01:36:43,005
Yes, I was.

861
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:46,256
And you personally
distributed monies...

862
01:36:46,474 --> 01:36:50,518
...vast, undeclared monies...

863
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:54,060
...to Mr. Capone?

864
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,645
Yes, I did.

865
01:36:56,858 --> 01:36:59,693
Would you tell us the amounts?

866
01:37:01,112 --> 01:37:07,233
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr. Capone

867
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:12,370
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

868
01:37:15,168 --> 01:37:18,038
Would you repeat that amount, please?

869
01:37:19,131 --> 01:37:24,884
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

870
01:37:40,317 --> 01:37:43,521
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

871
01:37:43,737 --> 01:37:47,901
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

872
01:38:10,973 --> 01:38:14,259
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

873
01:38:17,187 --> 01:38:19,892
Get me the bailiff.

874
01:38:21,525 --> 01:38:22,901
It'll be a fast trial.

875
01:38:26,697 --> 01:38:31,110
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

876
01:38:31,326 --> 01:38:36,237
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

877
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:46,166
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

878
01:39:14,327 --> 01:39:19,322
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

879
01:39:20,374 --> 01:39:24,123
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

880
01:39:24,336 --> 01:39:27,955
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

881
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:35,886
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

882
01:39:38,518 --> 01:39:40,723
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

883
01:39:40,936 --> 01:39:43,179
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

884
01:39:43,397 --> 01:39:47,265
"Mr. Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

885
01:39:47,484 --> 01:39:49,892
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

886
01:39:50,113 --> 01:39:53,563
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

887
01:39:53,782 --> 01:39:57,732
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

888
01:39:57,953 --> 01:40:01,120
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

889
01:40:31,278 --> 01:40:36,568
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

890
01:40:50,713 --> 01:40:53,335
Don't. Let him go.

891
01:40:56,969 --> 01:41:00,173
- No!
- Here, take it.

892
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:15,808
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

893
01:45:17,309 --> 01:45:19,551
What are you waitin' for?

894
01:45:20,646 --> 01:45:23,647
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

895
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:30,109
Don't push me.

896
01:45:32,783 --> 01:45:35,488
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

897
01:45:35,702 --> 01:45:38,822
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

898
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,197
'Cause you killed my friend!

899
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:45,035
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

900
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:48,872
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

901
01:45:49,091 --> 01:45:52,590
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

902
01:46:06,066 --> 01:46:08,771
Did he sound anything like that?

903
01:46:39,182 --> 01:46:42,099
One picture, come on, one picture.

904
01:46:44,687 --> 01:46:47,356
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

905
01:46:48,942 --> 01:46:50,733
Mr. Ness?

906
01:46:52,362 --> 01:46:56,822
Mr. Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

907
01:46:57,909 --> 01:47:00,779
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr. Ness.

908
01:47:00,995 --> 01:47:02,786
They've been bribed.

909
01:47:02,997 --> 01:47:07,077
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

910
01:47:08,628 --> 01:47:10,751
He's in the car.

911
01:47:29,523 --> 01:47:33,651
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

912
01:47:33,861 --> 01:47:39,566
Your Honor, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

913
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:44,659
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

914
01:47:44,871 --> 01:47:48,951
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

915
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:53,793
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

916
01:47:54,005 --> 01:47:57,421
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

917
01:48:07,435 --> 01:48:10,009
Would you excuse us?

918
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:14,040
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

919
01:49:18,713 --> 01:49:21,500
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

920
01:49:21,717 --> 01:49:24,836
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

921
01:49:25,053 --> 01:49:30,295
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

922
01:49:32,102 --> 01:49:35,767
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

923
01:49:36,857 --> 01:49:38,399
What's he talking about?

924
01:49:40,277 --> 01:49:44,737
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

925
01:49:44,948 --> 01:49:47,274
Your Honor, I object!

926
01:49:47,492 --> 01:49:49,449
Overruled.

927
01:49:53,456 --> 01:49:55,248
What did you tell him?

928
01:49:57,043 --> 01:50:00,293
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

929
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:04,418
His name wasn't in the ledger!

930
01:50:04,634 --> 01:50:07,671
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

931
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:09,388
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

932
01:50:09,597 --> 01:50:12,931
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

933
01:50:13,142 --> 01:50:15,716
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

934
01:50:16,312 --> 01:50:18,305
Order!

935
01:50:19,398 --> 01:50:23,645
Your Honor, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

936
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:25,819
and enter a plea of Guilty.

937
01:50:29,409 --> 01:50:32,195
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

938
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:34,451
Order!

939
01:50:43,088 --> 01:50:46,255
Bailiff! Bailiff!

940
01:50:46,466 --> 01:50:48,922
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

941
01:50:50,429 --> 01:50:51,758
Eliot!

942
01:50:51,972 --> 01:50:55,139
Your Honor!
Is that justice?

943
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:58,019
Please, why did he switch the jury?

944
01:50:58,228 --> 01:51:00,801
Are you gonna go
after the organization?

945
01:51:01,023 --> 01:51:02,482
Excuse me.

946
01:51:03,775 --> 01:51:07,061
I'm askin' Your Honor,
is this justice?

947
01:51:11,908 --> 01:51:14,151
Is this justice?

948
01:51:17,497 --> 01:51:20,202
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

949
01:51:20,417 --> 01:51:21,911
What did you say?

950
01:51:22,127 --> 01:51:25,246
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

951
01:51:25,463 --> 01:51:27,503
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

952
01:51:27,716 --> 01:51:30,254
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

953
01:51:30,469 --> 01:51:33,256
Here endeth the lesson.

954
01:51:33,471 --> 01:51:37,718
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

955
01:51:37,934 --> 01:51:41,137
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:52:59,264 --> 01:53:01,423
So much violence.

957
01:54:07,623 --> 01:54:10,031
Cleaning up a little.

958
01:54:18,717 --> 01:54:21,718
I guess this is goodbye.

959
01:54:23,055 --> 01:54:24,633
Goodbye, George.

960
01:54:27,268 --> 01:54:30,351
I want to... thank you for this.

961
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:33,230
No. Thank you.

962
01:54:49,123 --> 01:54:53,749
Mr. Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

963
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:57,045
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

964
01:55:00,676 --> 01:55:03,249
I'm going home.

965
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:16,810
Mr. Ness!
Any comment for the record?

966
01:55:17,025 --> 01:55:19,694
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

967
01:55:19,902 --> 01:55:22,476
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

968
01:55:22,697 --> 01:55:25,698
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

969
01:55:25,909 --> 01:55:28,993
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
