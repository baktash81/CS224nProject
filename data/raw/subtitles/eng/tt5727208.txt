2
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,703
Now reaching the
right side of the colon.

3
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,771
That looks pretty clean.

4
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:45,871
And there's the ileocecal valve,
which is pink and looks fine.

5
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:49,869
Prep looks good.

6
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,138
Looks like he's well
cleaned out.

7
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:58,736
Going up the sigmoid colon.

8
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:02,138
Two scattered diverticula there.

9
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,370
Heading towards
the splenic flexure now.

10
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:12,071
That looks clean.

11
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:19,270
In the mid-transverse colon...
Wait a second.

12
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,770
That looks like a polyp there.

13
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,739
It's only about 2 cm.

14
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:28,237
We can take
some biopsies of that.

15
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,803
Yussi, I'm a block away.

16
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,304
Where the fuck are you, man?

17
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,137
- I told you. I'm walking.
- I've got two guys.

18
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,970
They said they're gonna be
watching the business

19
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:36,803
the whole day.
What the fuck is going on?

20
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:38,304
Hey, man, who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

21
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,837
They keep saying
they're friends of Arno.

22
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,337
Arno?
Tell them I'm coming up now.

23
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,070
Harvey, I need that.

24
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,070
30 inches.

25
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:55,904
That's, like,
about 35 carats in there.

26
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,238
There's like a side one.

27
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,405
- And right in the middle...
- You know what I see?

28
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,704
Yo, Howard.
What's popping, man?

29
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,338
This is my nigga, Ca$h Out,
I was telling you about.

30
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,571
- How do you feel? All right?
- No, it was good.

31
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,537
They're calling me
with the results.

32
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,637
- Hey, get some face on.
- Hi, how are you?

33
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,537
- I'm good, man.
- Congratulations.

34
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,971
No, he's doing you a favor.

35
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,271
Believe me.
That guy is a fucking moron.

36
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:28,738
Arno's friend is here?
Yeah, I'm...

37
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,839
Guess you two have been
waiting on me,

38
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,373
so I'm sorry about that.

39
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,972
I'm Howard.
You didn't bring him any water?

40
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,972
- I'm good on the water.
- Where's his water?

41
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:38,638
I don't really need water.
Thank you anyway.

42
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,272
This is...
This is our own spring water.

43
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,772
We're the first on the block
to have that.

44
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:48,106
- Your parents happy for you?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,339
Alright. So I've got to tell
you, I'm in a bit of a rush.

46
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,805
I don't have much time because
I've got to... I've got to...

47
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,272
- What did I tell you?
- Hey.

48
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:57,972
I said no water.
Didn't I tell you no water?

49
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,572
I think it's in
your best interest that you

50
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:01,339
find some time for you and I.

51
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,039
We're right on
the same page, right?

52
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,139
- You all right, homie?
- Oh, yeah, 100% fine.

53
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,940
It's good.
I'll handle it.

54
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,307
I'll handle it. I'll handle it.

55
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,942
We don't do that here, sir.

56
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,940
Arno Meradian...

57
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,606
- <i>...is not available.</i>
- <i>Okay. Alright.</i>

58
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,573
- He's not answering.
- He... He knows you're calling.

59
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,140
He doesn't want to deal
with you anymore.

60
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,273
I understand.

61
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:35,973
No, I don't think you
do understand.

62
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,407
Come on. Come on.
It's not a fucking soap opera.

63
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,007
- Listen. Listen. Enough.
- What are we doing?

64
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,606
- What the fuck is...
- There you go again.

65
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:42,307
- Stop fighting me.
- This is not necessary.

66
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:44,407
No, it isn't? Well, we'll
be the judge of that.

67
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,941
- What the fuck is this?
- Wow.

68
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,974
Literally my last
of my mom's cash that I had.

69
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,807
- What about this? What's this?
- This is not mine.

70
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,841
- It's not mine.
- Take the fucking...

71
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,208
Take the fucking watch.
Take it. Take it.

72
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,741
Fucking...

73
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,674
Arno Meradian...

74
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,041
<i>...is not available.</i>

75
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,241
Arno, what the fuck
is this shit?

76
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:05,208
You're sending collectors
to fuck with me at my office?

77
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,607
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

78
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,241
I'm literally minutes away

79
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:11,408
from closing the biggest deal
of my Goddamn life,

80
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,008
and when I do,
you're gonna be embarrassed.

81
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,507
Oh, and by the way, the watch
they took from me,

82
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:20,008
it's worth $20,000.

83
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,409
I want that deducted
from the hundred grand.

84
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,442
You understand?

85
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:26,677
Call me back!

86
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,242
Look at this.

87
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,409
What's up, ladies?

88
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,908
- Shh, she's sleeping.
- She's sleeping.

89
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,209
This is bullshit.

90
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,708
- Hey, Howie.
- Hey, Howard. How are you?

91
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,708
People coming in and out
of the apartment.

92
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,209
Oh, my God. Not this song.

93
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,043
You show up to work any time
you damn please.

94
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,909
Howard, I was
working all night.

95
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:03,477
I'm sick of this shit.
You're taking advantage of me.

96
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,576
Oh, Howard. Oh, my God.
Howard.

97
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,343
10:30.
It's time to wake up.

98
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:10,343
- You're so extra.
- So you had a party last night?

99
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,176
I did not have a party.
Did we have a party?

100
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,076
- That was not a party.
- Why didn't you call me?

101
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,310
Okay because I did call you
at around 9:30.

102
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,143
You said, "I'll call you
back in five."

103
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,076
- I waited for hours.
- Yes because I fell asleep.

104
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:23,076
- No, that's fucking rude.
- I was putting Beni to sleep.

105
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,809
- Oh, here we go with the lies.
- I had to put him to sleep.

106
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,243
- I'm not lying!
- You're so manipulative!

107
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,343
I had to fall asleep
on the floor again!

108
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:29,709
I'm exhausted!

109
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,043
Well, I didn't ask you
to have kids!

110
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,477
It's not my fault you have kids.

111
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,809
Oh, shut the fuck up with that.

112
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:36,211
Look, do you want
to fucking stay mad,

113
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,478
or do you want to
get in bed and cuddle?

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,643
I know you want to cuddle,
Howard.

115
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,810
- Just come here.
- Come on.

116
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,577
Come on.
Just come here.

117
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,844
Come here, baby.
Come on.

118
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:47,277
Come on.
I know you want to.

119
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,378
- God, I'm stressed out.
- I know you can't resist me.

120
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,177
I know you can't resist me.

121
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,577
Come on.

122
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,013
Don't. Don't. Don't.
You can't just do that.

123
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,077
Don't you want to see
the photos I took?

124
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,610
- Yes. Yes.
- Look at this one, Howard.

125
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,311
- Look.
- Show me. What was this shoot?

126
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,877
She looked amazing.
Look at her butt in this one.

127
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,478
- It's insane.
- I took these pictures.

128
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,044
I think I really have a future
in 3500.

129
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:11,111
- And who is this guy?
- It's this guy, The Weeknd.

130
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,045
- He's mature.
- What the fuck is The Weeknd?

131
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,145
He's gonna be major
even though he's from Canada.

132
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,913
This guy looks stupid.

133
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,878
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

134
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,178
Howard Ratner.
How are you?

135
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,045
See, I have a piece.

136
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,978
You know this kid, The Weeknd?

137
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,778
That's Michael Jackson there
on the cross.

138
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,379
Gonna be a controversial piece.

139
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:35,312
It makes it more valuable.

140
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,345
The blacks are VS2s.
That's platinum.

141
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,212
Turn around. Don't even...
Don't even step in my place.

142
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,212
- Turn around.
- I've got some bets. 24 G's.

143
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,911
Don't even sit down. 24 G's?
Where would you get 24 G's?

144
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:47,479
I want the OKC/Lakers.
I want the fucking over.

145
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,878
- Alright?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,645
- I want Kobe's under...
- Kobe under.

147
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,645
...because he's, fucking
all of a sudden, he's passing.

148
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:55,013
- Can't just go with the ocean.
- He's not scoring tonight.

149
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,812
I want the Sixers to cover.

150
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:58,346
- Plus one.
- The points...

151
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,079
- Let's finish the bet here.
- Let's... uh...

152
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:02,545
Hey, one thing at a time.
I mean, come on now.

153
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:03,946
- Go.
- Demany. Demany.

154
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:05,712
Can you finish the bet?

155
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,046
If he gets to the store
before I do,

156
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,579
you just fucking keep him there.
Okay?

157
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,246
- Better get here soon.
- You promise me?

158
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:12,179
Motherfucker said he's
going to be here any...

159
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:15,046
Kevin Garnett is coming
to my fucking showroom

160
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,313
- right now, right now.
- Finish the bet.

161
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,179
<i>Eighth floor, going up.</i>

162
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:22,279
We've got to rewrite
the fucking...

163
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,480
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

164
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:29,813
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Get the fuck out.

165
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,314
- What?
- Fuck you, man.

166
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,481
What the fuck is going on
out here?

167
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,580
That's on you, asshole.

168
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:38,947
- Come on.
- You see this?

169
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,347
I don't know
these fucking guys.

170
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:41,980
You're dead, fucker.
You're dead.

171
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,747
- I...
- You think I'm playing games?

172
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,381
Get your laugh out now, asshole.

173
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,580
- I didn't do nothing.
- When I'm shoveling dirt

174
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,680
over your fucking head,
you'll see how funny it is then.

175
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,247
I have clients
in the office now.

176
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,180
- This is crazy.
- Turn around and walk away.

177
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,847
We're good. We're good.
Alright.

178
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,580
David, go back inside.
Everything is fine.

179
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,913
- Turn around and walk away.
- That's my... That's my shop.

180
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:01,414
Everybody back in there.
Get back in.

181
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,381
- Hello. Open the door.
- Let's go. Let's go.

182
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,415
- Okay.
- Jesus.

183
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,315
You're with KG?

184
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,981
Okay. Well, you've got
to shut that door.

185
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,647
KG, huh?

186
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,315
That closed?

187
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,448
- That's my man?
- It's insane.

188
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,581
Howard. Howard.
What the fuck is going on, man?

189
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,015
- Nothing.
- They tried to fuck Yussi up.

190
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,181
Look at...
Look at his fucking shirt.

191
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,415
Look at his shirt.

192
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,647
Okay. Listen.
Hey.

193
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,348
Thanks for the security,
by the way.

194
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,181
Send those bitches back
to Paramis or Bay Ridge, yeah.

195
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,248
You take that and charge
it up for me?

196
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,648
All I've got is fucking Yussi
to protect me.

197
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,782
- Hey, let us talk.
- My nigga talking.

198
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,782
What's up? What's up?

199
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:49,915
Did Armario fucking time
on the clock?

200
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,182
Come on.
There's no time on the clock.

201
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,715
Come on.
You're waving him up.

202
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,383
- I like the earrings.
- Like these?

203
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,882
Those are great.

204
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,249
I was coming here,
checking out some new ones, man.

205
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,949
When's the last time
you cleaned them?

206
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,049
Let me clean those for you.
Let me throw them

207
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,749
in the ultrasonic
for you for free, okay?

208
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,416
- What's this gonna cost me?
- For free.

209
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,182
Free, for real?

210
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,515
I would think you would have
bigger rocks than that

211
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:12,982
because you're a big guy.

212
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,982
Let me see what you all got
in here, man.

213
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:17,016
Who would win in a
fight, Ben Wallace or Tony Allen?

214
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,716
- T.A. all day.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

215
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:21,850
- What is that?
- Fuck out of here.

216
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,484
What is that, gremlin?

217
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,716
Gremlin over here.

218
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,583
Animal or some kind
of fucking,

219
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,716
some toy or some shit in here.

220
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:31,350
Just bring the bitch out.

221
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,716
Used to work with niggas on
early music videos,

222
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,217
all that shit.

223
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,750
He's, like, the first nigga
to start all that.

224
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,450
- You serious?
- I started that shit.

225
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,683
- Show him your fucking eye.
- I started... Yo. Alright.

226
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,083
So I did this,
so it fucks with you.

227
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,317
Oh, you serious?

228
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:50,283
That's why it scares the shit
out of people.

229
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,750
Yo, that guy.

230
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,150
Fucking older model,
but it's dope.

231
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,951
Listen.

232
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:57,051
- No, you can put that shit...
- The shit was slammed.

233
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,751
What's the length on that?
Alright.

234
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,051
Let me see the chain on that.

235
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,917
That's a 18.
I can get you a 14.

236
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,451
KG! Doc know you're here,
by the way?

237
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,851
No, he doesn't,
and let's keep it that way.

238
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:09,451
- Alright?
- It's game night.

239
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,151
- You should be stretching out.
- It's fucking insane.

240
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:12,884
I was about to say,
what is he, your coach?

241
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,853
No. He's just a fucking
crazy-ass Jew.

242
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,851
Throw these in the ultrasonic.

243
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,984
Yes, boss, as soon
as the other stuff is done.

244
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,018
No, now.

245
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,451
We've got to look
at that shit.

246
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,318
- KG, I wouldn't lean on that.
- Yo. Yo. Yo.

247
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,984
Kevin was just telling me
he's looking for some watches.

248
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:27,418
- Are you looking for watches?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,751
Let's go to the wall
of watches right here.

250
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:32,651
- What are we talking...
- I was thinking about,

251
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,685
you know,
seeing about the Presi though.

252
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,785
- You got that crazy-ass deal.
- That one for 16.

253
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,985
The crazy one though.
You know?

254
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:42,352
- Yeah. The...
- The Presi.

255
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:43,985
Yeah. Right. Right.

256
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:46,252
Hey, look at this right here.

257
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:47,685
- Boom.
- Alright.

258
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,119
Well, that's a small watch
for a big man.

259
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,386
- I don't know.
- What are they retailing at?

260
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:53,918
- You got papers for this?
- No.

261
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,752
Listen, I don't have
the box and papers.

262
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,352
Of course
he's got fucking papers.

263
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,185
I don't have either one.
What are you talking about?

264
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:00,952
- You sold me the shit, dummy.
- I don't remember that.

265
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:03,252
Listen. Listen, man. Niggas call
niggas out for this, man.

266
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,718
Of course. Of course. If you
don't have the box and paper...

267
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,651
You find me one nigga,
one nigga with a KMH watch

268
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,387
- they called out.
- Okay.

269
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,120
It's a moot point, Demany,
because I don't have these.

270
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,420
Alright?

271
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,652
So how about we move on
to the diamonds here?

272
00:15:15,654 --> 00:15:17,120
Listen. You got a girl?

273
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:18,919
Why don't you get...
get your girl a treat

274
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:21,552
- He doesn't have a girlfriend.
- Says who?

275
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,120
Says you.

276
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,686
How you know if I got
a girlfriend or not?

277
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,120
Howard, get the fuck
over here.

278
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:28,619
- Because you told me.
- I never said that.

279
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,986
- Fuck are you doing, man?
- What? What's up?

280
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:32,586
What didn't you bring my
Goddamn watches out?

281
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:34,753
- I'm not doing that.
- Nigga would have bought one.

282
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:37,053
I told you, you can keep them
in my safe.

283
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:38,819
I don't want you selling them
out of my showroom.

284
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,686
- You understand me?
- Fucking dumbass.

285
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,253
Where the fuck am I going
to sell them, nigga?

286
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,120
- On the Goddamn street?
- That's not my problem, man.

287
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,819
Oh, that ain't
your fucking problem?

288
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,388
- No, it isn't.
- That ain't your fucking...

289
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,054
He don't like shit in this dusty
motherfucking room.

290
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,587
Yes, he does.
He's having a fucking ball here.

291
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,287
What are you talking about?

292
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:56,154
What the fuck is he going
to buy, a Goddamn Furby, nigga?

293
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,787
Fuck you. Alright?

294
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,754
I'm gonna take his ass
to motherfucking Flawless.

295
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,054
I'm done fucking with you.

296
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:02,587
You're not taking him
to Flawless.

297
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:04,087
- I'm taking him to Flawless...
- No.

298
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,787
...since you're acting
like a fucking...

299
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,687
KG, do me a favor.
Don't lean on that, please.

300
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,121
What the fuck.
You're acting stupid.

301
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,054
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay.

302
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,520
Buzz them in.
Buzz them in now.

303
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,287
Now.

304
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,287
Oh, my God.

305
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,620
Is this... This is it!

306
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,887
- This is it! Hey.
- What's up?

307
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,620
- Okay, look at this.
- Got a package from Fishtonic.

308
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:22,854
- Where do you want this?
- Bring it in.

309
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,988
Bring it in.
Go into my office.

310
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,389
KG, don't you dare leave, okay?

311
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,788
What's in this package
is gonna blow your mind, KG.

312
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,255
- Is it heavy?
- Yes.

313
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,521
Yes. Yes. Yes.

314
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,990
Oh, my God.

315
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:41,157
What are you doing?
Give me that.

316
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:56,755
Man, I can't do this
anymore, bro.

317
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:58,222
What happened? What happened?
Tell me.

318
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,223
What happened?
There's three goons in there.

319
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:01,689
They attacked me, man.

320
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,023
Well, what did you say
to piss them off?

321
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,889
Listen, Garnett's crew
came in here.

322
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,023
They took a look around.
They see these guys.

323
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,390
They're like,
"Yo, who works here?

324
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:09,889
Who doesn't?
Who doesn't, get out."

325
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:11,490
I said, "These guys
don't work here."

326
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:13,323
Well, that was stupid.
You shouldn't have said that.

327
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,789
These guys grabbed me. They
dragged me over the counter.

328
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,289
They ripped my shirt.

329
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,056
They've got me looking
like a fool over here.

330
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:19,522
Here. Here. Take this shirt.
That's a Gucci shirt.

331
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:21,023
It's $500.
It's brand new.

332
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:22,522
Are you fucking serious
right now?

333
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,323
- The tag is still on it.
- It ain't about the shirt.

334
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:25,989
You know what I'm saying?
I gave you 8 years of my life.

335
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,789
Look how you're
treating me, man.

336
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,689
I... I... I put in everything
into this business.

337
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,023
I saved your ass
a thousand times.

338
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,822
I can't take this place
anymore, man.

339
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:36,323
I can't deal with your problems
every other day.

340
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:38,656
Listen, there's a lot of people
on this block

341
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,224
that would love
to do business with me.

342
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,957
When you're gonna see me
out there working with them,

343
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,224
you're not gonna
like it, man.

344
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,491
You're gonna be jealous.

345
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:49,424
You're not gonna like it,
Howard.

346
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:52,556
Howard. Hello?

347
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,024
I'm standing here, man.

348
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:56,757
There's a lot of people
I could be doing business with

349
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,190
other than you, Howard.
You're... You're falling apart.

350
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,923
You're looking like a fool out
here in the Diamond District.

351
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:04,790
Looking through fucking fish.
Come on, man.

352
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,190
I gave you 8 years of my life,

353
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,324
and you can't even fucking talk
to me

354
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:12,090
and look me in the eyes,
man to fucking man?

355
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,524
Holy shit, I'm gonna come.

356
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,158
Man, fuck you, man.

357
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,991
I'm finished
with this shit hole.

358
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,425
KG.

359
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:30,091
KG. Yo.

360
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,392
- Howard, Yussi is gone.
- That's fine with me.

361
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,691
Let me get a phone from you.
Let me get that phone.

362
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:37,425
KG, you've got to come here.
Alright?

363
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:38,991
- I've got to show you.
- I've got to leave soon, man.

364
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,458
I know you have to,
but listen to me.

365
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,724
- I got to get out of here.
- Okay.

366
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:43,858
So I'm watching TV,
like a year ago.

367
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,258
Alright?

368
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,991
I'm watching one of those
fucking History Channel shows,

369
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,524
trying to learn shit,
and I stumble...

370
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,426
You ever hear African Jews?

371
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:52,992
- African Jews?
- Yeah.

372
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,092
- No. Alright? No.
- Nigga, where everybody got

373
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,658
- to be a Jew.
- Check this out.

374
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,359
Oh, no. Alright?

375
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,126
So these are black Jews.
Alright?

376
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:02,658
They're stranded in the middle
of Ethiopia.

377
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,792
It's deep shit.

378
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,092
- Stranded?
- Yeah.

379
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:06,825
Look.
They've got nothing.

380
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,692
They don't got cars.
They don't got shit.

381
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,059
And I'm watching this,
and I'm like,

382
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,892
"What the fuck are
these guys wearing?"

383
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:14,992
Look. It's over there.
It's everywhere. Right?

384
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:16,359
This is...

385
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:19,426
Where do these fucking guys
get precious black opals?

386
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:20,658
That's what that is.

387
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,259
- Black opal?
- I do my research.

388
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,226
These guys live near the Welo
mines, which primarily

389
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:27,393
is red opal,
which aren't worth shit, okay?

390
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:28,793
- Oh, okay.
- But these...

391
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,760
Now you can't get your hands
on these things.

392
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:31,893
- You understand?
- Really?

393
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,227
So look, I say to myself,

394
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,093
"How do I get a hold
of these guys?"

395
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,360
and I managed to track
these guys down.

396
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,626
- I buy one of them from him.
- Holy shit.

397
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,826
What is that?
It's right here.

398
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,227
That's the rock.

399
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:45,027
That's the rock.
That's the stone.

400
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,826
- Holy shit.
- I got it.

401
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,193
Look how this is winking
in the light, man.

402
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,926
How the fuck did you
get this shit, man?

403
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:51,926
Took me fucking 17 months
to get this thing, okay?

404
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:54,127
Just look at this.
Hang on for a second.

405
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,760
Go through my loupe. Be careful.
That's my best loupe.

406
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,193
- Let me see this, man.
- Alright?

407
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,693
I want you to look...
look at it.

408
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,027
You really into
that motherfucker.

409
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,494
- Isn't that the shit?
- Oh, wow.

410
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:04,460
That's history right there.
You understand?

411
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:07,727
- How many carats is this?
- What, 4,000, 5,000 carats?

412
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:09,028
$3,000 a carat.

413
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,994
I'm not fucking
bullshitting you.

414
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,594
Why's it got so many colors
in it, man?

415
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,161
- What is that?
- That's the thing.

416
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,128
They say you can see
the whole universe in opals.

417
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,094
- That's how fucking old they are.
- Holy shit.

418
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:20,961
I've been telling you. That's
why I wanted you to see it.

419
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,827
How do I get it?
I've got to have it.

420
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:26,028
- Your ass is crazy, man.
- Fucking from stone to stone.

421
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,294
Garnet is a stone.
You know that.

422
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,660
That's a million dollar opal
you're holding,

423
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,228
straight from
the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.

424
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,495
I mean, this is old-school,
middle-earth shit.

425
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:39,228
Got a motherfucking
dinosaur gem in this bitch.

426
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,894
Dinosaur, that's right.

427
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:43,195
The dinosaurs fucking staring
at this thing.

428
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:47,295
It's 110 million years old
at the least.

429
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:50,262
- It's deep shit.
- Basketball, basketball...

430
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,528
Can't lean on the glass, KG.

431
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,762
- Yo!
- Oh, shit!

432
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:56,862
You all right?

433
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,396
Get a fucking
towel or something.

434
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,762
You heard me, man.
I was telling him not to lean.

435
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,862
- You all right?
- Don't cut your fucking self.

436
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,229
That's a sign though.

437
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,496
That's a sign for me
that I need it.

438
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:09,496
That's what this is.

439
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,295
Got to make sure
my nigga good.

440
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:12,795
Demany...
I'm telling you,

441
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,995
it's a lot of weight
you were putting on it.

442
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:16,995
That's a sign.
I need this. I need this.

443
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:19,529
It's not for sale.
I can't... I can't sell it.

444
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,196
What do you mean
it's not for sale?

445
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,529
I can't do it.

446
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,463
That... Goddamn it.
I... I... It's set for auction.

447
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:26,929
I can't.

448
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,397
Why the fuck would you
show me something

449
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,696
if I couldn't have it, then?

450
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,163
The fuck would you
bring this out?

451
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,030
I don't know. Excited.
Excited to share it.

452
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,063
Well, let me hold it
for a night then.

453
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,796
Right? Let me wait
until the game tomorrow.

454
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,529
It'll be cool.
You know, I'm going to the game.

455
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,163
Nigga, I'll grab it from you

456
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,662
then meet you at Abby's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

457
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,896
- Boom. Boom.
- Just like that.

458
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,929
- It's perfect.
- Howard, come on.

459
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,030
- It's one night, Howard.
- Serious?

460
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,263
- I can't.
- It's one night.

461
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,829
They'll pull it
from the auction.

462
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,096
He's good for it.
He's good for it.

463
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:51,829
You don't understand.

464
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,363
This stone, I'm really
connecting with this, man.

465
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,597
I feel like I'm gonna have
40 or 50 on this, man.

466
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,064
You understand that?
You understand that?

467
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,797
You see what the fuck
I'm talking about, Howard?

468
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,398
It's just speaking to him.
You know?

469
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,630
Man, I'm gonna destroy
Philly tonight with this.

470
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,331
- Yeah.
- Get your ass.

471
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,031
Nigga, this fucking thing
makes me feel like I can fly.

472
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,498
- Shit.
- Howard, you hear that?

473
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,830
Yeah. Let him get that.

474
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:14,097
You're going to at me
at howiebling.

475
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,830
- Yes.
- 30 fucking pics, I want likes.

476
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,897
- Yes. I got you.
- He's talking about at-ing me.

477
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,498
Let me get a fucking shot.

478
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,530
- There's a good idea, man.
- Come here. Come here.

479
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:23,431
- Look at this. Woo.
- You hold it up.

480
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,464
Look at this shit.
Boom.

481
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,797
Boom. Cool.

482
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,064
Uh... You can't just...
Give me a...

483
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:30,830
Give me the Celtic ring.
I want the ring.

484
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:32,364
- Howard, come the fuck on.
- Collateral.

485
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:34,032
No, no, no, no, no.
He's good money, my nigga.

486
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:35,664
I know he's good for it.
I want to make a deal.

487
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,664
That's a deal.
That's a deal. That's a deal.

488
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,664
- I give you that.
- Thanks. Alright.

489
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,564
I'll keep it right here,
right next to my Knicks '73.

490
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,365
Classic. Classic.
I like that.

491
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,499
I appreciate you understanding.

492
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,432
Got you. Right.

493
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,965
- But listen, you meet me.
- Yeah, I'll meet your happy ass.

494
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:51,965
- Yes. Alright.
- You will fucking

495
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,931
bring that stone to me,
9:00 in the morning.

496
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,098
Hey. Hey. Hey, listen to me.
No dicking around.

497
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,332
- You show up. You hear me?
- Chill.

498
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:00,032
I'll see you there,
motherfucker.

499
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,564
Alright. Let's roll.
Let's do it, nigga.

500
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:03,898
Let's do it.

501
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,931
- Buzz them out.
- I got his earrings.

502
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,731
Hey, the earrings.
Wait. Bring it out to him.

503
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:10,065
Keep them.
Keep them until tomorrow.

504
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:13,966
- I'll grab them.
- Black Jew power, nigga.

505
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,901
- He's so extra.
- Fucking out.

506
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:22,599
Who's gonna clean
this fucking shit?

507
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,766
Eddie, boy,
what are you doing?

508
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,299
What do you want?

509
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,832
Look what I got.
Look.

510
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,233
You're gonna love this.
Here.

511
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,999
- Hey. What's that right there?
- Howard...

512
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,766
- Will you leave me alone?
- What is it?

513
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:37,366
It's Kevin Garnett's ring,
championship ring, NBA, 2008.

514
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:39,033
I knew you would freak out.

515
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,235
- Alright. I love you, my boy.
- Alright. Bye.

516
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,835
Roberto, you came to work.

517
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:52,867
- Ronstein.
- Hey, Howard.

518
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,600
Hey. Break out your tray.
Where is he?

519
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,300
I'd shake your hand,
but I know where it's been.

520
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:00,000
Look at this.

521
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,733
It's Kevin Garnett's
2008 championship ring.

522
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:05,367
- Championship ring?
- Championship ring, 2008.

523
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,533
Alright. You want to pawn it
or you want to sell it?

524
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,800
I want to pawn it.
I want to pawn it.

525
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,167
Let me take a quick
look at it.

526
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,867
I don't know what
you're looking for.

527
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,134
- Check the diamond.
- Okay?

528
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,666
That was just on
his fucking finger.

529
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:16,100
- It's single cut, Howie.
- Let me see it.

530
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:17,867
It's single cut.
It's not even full cut.

531
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:19,134
- Steve, take a look at it.
- You talk to the fucking league

532
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,767
about the way
they cut their shit.

533
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:21,867
I understand,
but they're worth less.

534
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,334
Take a look at this.
Alright?

535
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,368
Alright. It's his ring.
I understand.

536
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,035
It's from his Instagram. It's
fucking blowing up right now.

537
00:24:27,037 --> 00:24:28,567
I hear you. Alright.
So what do you need for it?

538
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,768
I figure that thing
is worth 80 grand.

539
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,168
Just loan it to me.
That's it.

540
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,934
Just float it to me.
I'll be back Friday.

541
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:36,634
Number one, we both know
what's in here.

542
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:39,634
We both know that the value is
mostly because it's memorabilia.

543
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:41,135
But it is a memorabilia piece,

544
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:43,534
so that's how you're
gonna sell it, right?

545
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:45,168
So I tell you what.

546
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,168
Give me 50 G's.
Just float it to me.

547
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,235
I'm gonna give you $25,000, but
I want an 8% fee on the ring.

548
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,901
8%? Fucking, how about
I give you a grand?

549
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:54,567
You take a grand off the top.

550
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,235
I'm gonna come back
Friday for it.

551
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:57,934
You know, last time you had
something here for 6 months,

552
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:00,001
- so we want to make sure upfront.
- Alright. Alright.

553
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,002
Last time wasn't my fault.
We fucking went over that.

554
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,568
I understand.
Let's make it quick.

555
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,269
$21,000, 7% fee,

556
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,935
and I want you to know,
said you'd be back Friday.

557
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:09,735
If you're not back Friday,
it's my ring.

558
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:12,302
If I don't bring it back
Friday, I'm a dead man, so...

559
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,668
- Alright. So we have a deal?
- Alright. Deal.

560
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,802
- Mazel. Mazel.
- Mazel.

561
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,269
Alright. Mazel.

562
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,036
Can you go to the safe
and get me the money?

563
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:21,002
Get him the money.
We'll get you the money.

564
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:23,369
Alright.
Hey, good pace.

565
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,971
This is great.

566
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:30,568
70th and 1st, what the
fuck is he doing there?

567
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,269
He's walking.

568
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,804
Oh, now he's stopping.
He's slowing down.

569
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,903
- What?
- He's doing something.

570
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,569
He's playing with his phone
or something.

571
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,270
He's playing with something.

572
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:45,103
I can't make it out. I can't see
him. His back is to me.

573
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:46,903
He's hunched over.
You can't see.

574
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,669
I don't know.
We... We can't see anything.

575
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:51,970
Oh. Oh! Oh, here he goes.
Here he goes. He's going again.

576
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:54,237
Wait.
I just got a text from him.

577
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,836
- What's he saying?
- It's a picture of money.

578
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,803
- This fucking prick.
- He says, "Arno..."

579
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,237
He's got fucking money.

580
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,870
"...I've got your money
right here."

581
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:02,870
Alright.
He's turning in somewhere.

582
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:05,270
A restaurant, Melo's.

583
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,103
- Hey, handsome, where's he at?
- He's in the back.

584
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,838
He's in the back.

585
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,871
Hey, you got him
making meatballs in the back?

586
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:18,171
Alright.

587
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,904
You have your romaine.
You have your croutons.

588
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,904
You have your eggs.
No carrots in the salad.

589
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,371
What do you want?
You made your bet.

590
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,271
I know. I know.
I've got to change the bet.

591
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,670
I've got $21,000 here,

592
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,171
so you add it on
to the 19 grand.

593
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,238
- $40,000 in all.
- Scrap the whole bet?

594
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,038
Scrap the whole bet.
I want to make a 6-way parlay,

595
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,737
Celtics-Sixers game,
what's the lineup?

596
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:37,038
- Still plus one.
- Plus one.

597
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,737
Okay, so I want the Celtics
to cover.

598
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,038
I want the Celtics halftime.

599
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,904
I want Garnett
points and rebounds.

600
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,771
- Alright.
- Garnett blocked shots,

601
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,338
Celtics opening tip.

602
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,871
Do you take lightning bets?

603
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:48,737
Yeah, but you don't want
any part of lightning bets.

604
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,104
Fine. $1,000 a point, okay?

605
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,804
Take this, and this is
a gift from me.

606
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:53,406
What's this?

607
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,205
For just tolerating me
for all this time. Okay?

608
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,205
No. No. No.
I already have a Rolex.

609
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:58,905
I don't need your watch. This
probably fell off a truck.

610
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,671
Listen, but what do you know?

611
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,139
Garnett this, Garnett that.
What do you know?

612
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:04,005
I don't know.
I just know.

613
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:05,472
Well, I tell you what I know,

614
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:07,439
that's the dumbest fucking bet
I ever heard of.

615
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:10,105
I disagree.

616
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,573
I disagree, Gary.

617
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,872
Shoot. Let him shoot.
Let him shoot.

618
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,538
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.

619
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,705
Jrue Holiday,
who came out of a four game...

620
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,506
Fucker was five fucking steps
in to the...

621
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,372
...At 18 points,
hitting four of six

622
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:27,239
from 3-point range.

623
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,905
Christ.

624
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,373
Many feel that they
stole game one at home....

625
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,042
That's it. Dump it to KG.
Finish it. Finish it.

626
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:37,773
- Back them down. Back them down.
- Garnett double.

627
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,739
Boo! Fuck you!
Yes, that's it.

628
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:44,606
That's it.
That's my man.

629
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:47,973
Go, get up on him.
Get up on him.

630
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,672
Fucking... Get the fuck
up on him.

631
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:52,240
Goddamn it.

632
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,440
Howard, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

633
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:56,206
Howard,
Beni is waiting for you.

634
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,040
Okay, I'm coming up.

635
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,773
It's 25 minutes past
his bedtime. Go.

636
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:03,340
- Did he brush his teeth yet?
- Brush his teeth?

637
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:06,940
I sent you seven texts
in the dark. Howard.

638
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:09,241
- Yeah.
- It's the first quarter.

639
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:12,408
Guy was in my shop
earlier today.

640
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,607
- Look at him. Soft touch.
- I don't care, Howard.

641
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,107
Hit that fucking shit.
Boom.

642
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,774
Howard, go say good night
to your son.

643
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:21,508
Okay, let me get up there.

644
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,807
I'll be right there.
Okay.

645
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:27,007
Let me just get to a time-out.

646
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,307
This fucking ref is ridiculous.

647
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,408
- Now!
- Alright!

648
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,573
Alright.
Alright. Sorry.

649
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:34,307
I'm sorry.
God fucking...

650
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,007
Time-out Philly.

651
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:46,674
Garnett opening up with 4
on the shot clock again.

652
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,808
Garnett, vintage
game one for sure.

653
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,641
15 points on seven
for eight.

654
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:56,175
Oh!

655
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,908
Fuck you.

656
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,277
Fuck you.

657
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,841
For the turnaround...

658
00:29:11,843 --> 00:29:13,208
Hey. Hey. Hey.

659
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,641
Garnett's killing
it right now.

660
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,208
I know. I know.
Beni's sleeping.

661
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,108
- Keep it down.
- I'm sorry. I'm just so hyped.

662
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,275
NBA is always the last
2 fucking minutes,

663
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:22,209
so let's calm down.

664
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,842
- Hit that, KG!
- About to win money.

665
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:26,343
Jason's about to give me
25 bucks for the first half.

666
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:28,675
Double that up last half,
I might get 50 bucks.

667
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:31,542
Your father bet a lot
of money on this one.

668
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:33,176
Really? How much? How much?

669
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:35,076
- You don't want to know.
- A lot though, right?

670
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:38,343
Yes. Put that shit
in the fucking hole.

671
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:40,243
That's right. Come on.
He can dunk again.

672
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,276
Dunk again.

673
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:43,476
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Alright.

674
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:45,476
Fucking amazing.

675
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:47,410
Fucking amazing, right?

676
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,176
He's down.

677
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:51,976
He's asleep.

678
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:54,176
...but no.
He's like, "You can paint.

679
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,742
You can follow your hobbies
and your bliss

680
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,109
and your entrepreneurial thing,"

681
00:29:57,111 --> 00:30:00,210
and Stephanie and Annalise
went, "Ooh."

682
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:03,477
What would do if you had
two weeks to live?

683
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,910
- Uh, that's a big question.
- Could you flip...

684
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:08,779
flip it to ESPN
just for one second?

685
00:30:10,146 --> 00:30:11,444
This is a huge game.

686
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:13,411
That's why he's going
so crazy up there.

687
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,110
You know what?
I'm tempted to wrangle the kids

688
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,977
downstairs right now
and get it over with.

689
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,977
You really want to do that?

690
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,344
I don't know how
sensitive that is.

691
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,110
Oh, you're calling me
insensitive?

692
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:26,144
Thought we... we both agreed
that we wait

693
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:27,344
till after Passover.

694
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:28,610
Next, you'll be saying
you want to wait

695
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:30,144
until after the summer.

696
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:33,377
I'm not opposed to waiting
until after summer.

697
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:34,944
It's a commercial.

698
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,611
Can you just put the game
on for two fucking minutes

699
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,078
until my car gets here?

700
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,178
Take our breath away.

701
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,744
Life is the only thing...

702
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,878
Hey, that's no
Chuck the Body.

703
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,978
No words can describe that.

704
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,011
41? I don't know how
old these guys are,

705
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,577
but you can't tell by their age.

706
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,778
You're saying ages
all older than you are.

707
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,644
Well, younger than the...

708
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:02,111
This is crazy.

709
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:05,245
KG hits the shot
from outside.

710
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,345
He'll be 36 on Saturday,

711
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:09,278
and he puts the Celtics
over the century mark.

712
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,413
Oh! Oh!

713
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:17,612
Yes!

714
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,312
Oh, God, yes!

715
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,945
Holy fuck.
Oh, my God.

716
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:25,012
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

717
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:26,678
Oh, my God.

718
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,112
First home playoff game

719
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:29,578
in the second round in 9 years.

720
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,212
- Hey, change of plans.
- What's up?

721
00:31:32,214 --> 00:31:34,578
Take the exit,
49th Street and 3rd Ave,

722
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,545
Smith & Wollensky's.

723
00:31:36,547 --> 00:31:38,678
- Everything okay?
- I just...

724
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,745
- Uh, what's your name?
- Dallas.

725
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:44,612
Davis, I just hit
very big, very big.

726
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:46,346
Oh, my God.

727
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,945
Five-point tag,
spin back for the alley-oop,

728
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:52,713
and if it wasn't fouled, he was
gonna posterize somebody.

729
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,813
KG having fun.

730
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,681
Oh, yeah.

731
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:00,313
Jules?

732
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:09,313
Hey.

733
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,515
Hey, what's up?

734
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:35,714
Baby, where are you at?

735
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:38,248
I'm just coming back
right now. I'm in the elevator.

736
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,481
Why, what's up?

737
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:41,747
I got held up.
I'm just on my way back now.

738
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:44,614
Yeah, Dinah was on
a tear tonight.

739
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:45,814
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah.

740
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:47,214
How far away are you?

741
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,947
I am in the tunnel,

742
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,614
just getting in there.

743
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,914
Oh, okay.
So you're very close.

744
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,914
- Yes.
- Um, so hold on. I got to go.

745
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,881
- I got to go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

746
00:32:57,883 --> 00:32:59,448
- Hey.
- What?

747
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,881
I can't wait to see you.
I'm in an incredible mood.

748
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:03,581
Okay, I got another line.

749
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,182
I got another line. I got to go.

750
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:06,049
- Okay.
- Bye.

751
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:27,882
As we speak.

752
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:28,915
Yeah, and I still have
to set up the steaks.

753
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,715
I still have to get ready.

754
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,215
Because his gem came.
Hello?

755
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:33,815
Do you not listen to me
as I've been talking

756
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:37,049
about it all day?
I'm gonna wear the...

757
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:40,649
Remember the green
that I took the photo of?

758
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,483
Yeah, I know.
I know.

759
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:31,219
- I'm gonna come!
- Ah!

760
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,219
I'm gonna come.

761
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:33,952
I can't help it.
I had to get you.

762
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,420
- Oh, my God!
- I had to get you.

763
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:37,186
- Why the fuck did you do that?
- No, no, no, no.

764
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:39,552
You see how fucking
sweet you look.

765
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,319
You look so gorgeous.

766
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:43,685
I just get so fucking big.

767
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:46,585
- I get so big.
- Oh, baby.

768
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:48,486
Do you feel how wet I am?

769
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:06,186
I'm almost there.
I'm almost there.

770
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:08,119
What?!
You told me that already!

771
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,087
Yeah, I hit mad traffic.
What you want me to do about it?

772
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,653
We told... 9:00
we were supposed to be there!

773
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,054
It's fucking 9:43!

774
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:15,354
Look, all the city
is clogged up.

775
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,154
I can't do anything about it.
Alright?

776
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:18,787
Hey, not everybody is
on Demany time, man! Let's move!

777
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,655
I've been driving
since 7:00 a.m.

778
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:29,054
Okay, you can tell
Anne we're here.

779
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,354
Hold on one second.
Hi.

780
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,521
- Anne Deva...
- Mm-hmm.

781
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,586
...Howard Ratner
and his partner.

782
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:34,987
We're all ready to go.

783
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:37,287
Okay. Well, when your partner
gets here,

784
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:38,953
I will let her know
that you've both arrived.

785
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,387
Thanks.

786
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:42,387
You can sit over there
if you'd like.

787
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:43,653
- Yes?
- Yo, Howard.

788
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,554
I'm pulling up right now.
Come out.

789
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:47,055
I said, "I'm inside."

790
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:48,388
I'm not gonna find parking.

791
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,921
- Double-park the car.
- Nah, I'm not

792
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,488
- getting no fucking ticket...
- Do it!

793
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,821
...for you or nobody
else, so come meet me.

794
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:55,388
- I want to talk to you.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

795
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,788
No, I'm not
fucking kidding you.

796
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,522
Alright? I'm pulling up.
Come out.

797
00:36:58,524 --> 00:36:59,721
Do you have any guests
or anything?

798
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:01,388
Okay.
We'll be right back.

799
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,687
Okay.

800
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,121
Fuck. Fuck.

801
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,856
Stupid.

802
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,621
Howard, Howard!

803
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,821
Jesus.
How'd you find me?

804
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:17,388
Your office told me
where you are.

805
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,921
- You following me?
- Yeah, we need the money today.

806
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:20,221
My office would never
tell you that.

807
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:21,921
- This is the last straw.
- Get out of here!

808
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:22,955
You haven't been returning
my phone calls or texts.

809
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,555
You can't take 10 minutes?

810
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:26,189
What, you're bringing your
fucking heavy with you?

811
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:28,122
- Yeah. You got my money?
- Alright. You want money?

812
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:29,755
- Yeah.
- I got fucking money. Here.

813
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,456
- Fine, fine, fine.
- You owe me 32 grand.

814
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,156
Look, there's 30 grand.
Fucking sell that for 15 G's.

815
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:36,122
15 G's? Where?
Where am I gonna sell this?

816
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:37,922
Go to Wimpy's,
55th and 5th Avenue.

817
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:40,022
Go there. Now, put that
in your fucking pocket.

818
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,056
Hey, hey, where is it?
Where's it at?

819
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,588
- Where's the gem?
- Hey, get in real quick.

820
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,655
Give me the gem.
I'll run it upstairs.

821
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,688
Get in. Get in.
I want to talk to you.

822
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,156
I don't know anything
about a watch.

823
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:50,955
Hey, get the fuck out!
I don't want a watch!

824
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,456
You just gave it to me
for the money you owe me.

825
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,256
Shut the fuck up! I'm not buying
watches right now.

826
00:37:54,258 --> 00:37:56,555
Back the fuck up! Don't touch my
shit. Alright?

827
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,655
Walk the fuck away, man!

828
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,990
Come on, give me the opal.

829
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:01,390
Get in, my nigga,
so I can talk to you.

830
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,157
They're waiting on us.
We're late.

831
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,589
What am I getting in
the fucking car for?

832
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,190
- Get the fuck in!
- Jesus Christ!

833
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:08,689
Get out of here
with that fucking Fugazi shit.

834
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:11,157
- Who the fuck were they?
- Fuck.

835
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,123
Why... why am I
in your car right now?

836
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,823
- Alright. Alright. Alright.
- They're fucking waiting on us.

837
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,589
Listen. So, look, we're
at the fucking hotel.

838
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,057
We're getting ready to go.

839
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,823
We about to go party.
We got three bad bitches.

840
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:21,157
I don't have time for this.
Where is my opal?

841
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,656
And KG leaves his fucking
I.D. upstairs.

842
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:24,223
- Demany, we don't have time.
- Look.

843
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:26,623
They're waiting for us!
Where's the fucking opal?

844
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,157
Garnett got it!
Alright?

845
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,090
Garnett has got it?
He's fucked us.

846
00:38:30,092 --> 00:38:31,790
I don't know what the fuck
you want me to do about that

847
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:33,257
- because you the one that got...
- Call him up.

848
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:35,057
Call him on the phone.
Let me talk to him.

849
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,425
I can't fucking call him
right now. He's at practice.

850
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,191
Tell him I will give him
another opal for free.

851
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:39,624
Howard, listen to me.

852
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:42,291
I can't call him because he is
at practice, my nigga.

853
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:43,857
He's not gonna answer
his fucking phone for me,

854
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,525
- God, nobody else.
- Fine!

855
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,191
Then we're going to practice.
We're going to practice.

856
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:49,324
So you want me to go
to fucking Philly right now?

857
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,024
He's in Philly?
Then we're going to Philly.

858
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:52,924
I... I can't. I just got back
from Philly, man.

859
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,291
I'm not driving to fucking...

860
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,757
It's two fucking hours
to get there.

861
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:58,224
Come on.
Come on.

862
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,791
Got to be in and out,
in and out.

863
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,757
I got my daughter's
play tonight.

864
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,124
Who is that?
Is that KG?

865
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,757
Tell him we're here.
We're coming in.

866
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:13,691
Yo, you got to calm
your happy ass down.

867
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,159
Are we going
inside the facility,

868
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:17,059
or we gonna
meet him out here?

869
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:18,992
- Just chill the fuck out, bud.
- I hope we see Rondo in there.

870
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:21,059
Love to tell him, "Thank you,"
for dropping all those shots.

871
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:23,159
Man, no, that's not...
They busy, and what the fuck

872
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,259
is it with you Jewish
niggas and basketball anyway?

873
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,526
Huh? It sucks.

874
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:29,292
I'll have you know, the first
two points scored

875
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,059
in the NBA was a Jew.

876
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,892
- Yeah, yeah, Fred Flintstein?
- No!

877
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:38,025
Ossie Schectman, 1946,
played for the Knicks.

878
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,192
There we go.

879
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:42,159
Yeah, this is where
the big boys play.

880
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:45,025
Always, always got to practice
and always got...

881
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:47,092
Look at this.
This is sick, sick.

882
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,259
Oh, my God.

883
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,625
Hey, check this out.

884
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:52,226
Check it out.

885
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:54,527
- Yo, hey!
- Rondo, it's coming up!

886
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:55,993
He can't help himself!

887
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:57,326
He's gonna have to finish.

888
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,360
- What are you doing?
- And he scores!

889
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:04,193
- Hey.
- Sorry, brother.

890
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:07,060
- What's changing for game two?
- Demany!

891
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:10,926
- I got one coming back.
- What's up?

892
00:40:10,928 --> 00:40:12,393
- I'm with him.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

893
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:15,226
No, no, no. I'm with him.
Demany? What the fuck?

894
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:17,060
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- What's he fucking...

895
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,460
- Hey, hi.
- I'm with him. I came with him.

896
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:21,260
You saw me walk
through the door.

897
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:23,826
What's your... No, I didn't see
you walk through the door.

898
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:25,360
What's your name?
What's your name?

899
00:40:25,362 --> 00:40:26,959
Well, I won't be on a list
because I came with him.

900
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,227
I came with him.
I came with him.

901
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,593
What the fuck
is he doing to me?

902
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:30,693
Cocksucker fucking works for me!

903
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,161
Is Marcel excited?

904
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,428
Yeah, I think
she's a little nervous.

905
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,528
Little nervous.
Well, it's the lead play.

906
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,194
I'm very proud of her.

907
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:40,860
Yeah, Danny has got
a role, too.

908
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:42,627
Small part.
He's nervous, but...

909
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:43,827
Good, yeah.
Yeah.

910
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,394
Nothing fazes him.

911
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,127
- You... you working?
- He said she was amazing.

912
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:48,794
Hang on one second.

913
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:51,428
What are you guys doing
for the break?

914
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,794
Oh, um, we're not...

915
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:54,760
we're not doing
anything this year.

916
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:56,794
- Oh, really?
- Wow.

917
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:58,660
- That's not like you guys.
- Yeah, how come?

918
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,627
Howard, how come?
Howard?

919
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:02,695
- Everything okay?
- Howard?

920
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,128
- No vacation?
- No, we're... we're...

921
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,462
Next year, we're gonna take a
bigger trip, saving up for that.

922
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:11,328
Going to go to Europe.

923
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,761
Oh, that's nice.

924
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,395
So, yeah, do a little culture.

925
00:41:15,397 --> 00:41:16,995
These kids are becoming morons.

926
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:19,495
- Well...
- Oh, yeah, well...

927
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:21,195
We'll be morons in Cancún.

928
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:23,195
Right, especially on this
trapeze, you know?

929
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,995
- Good luck to Danny tonight.
- Yeah, yeah.

930
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:26,661
When's he come?

931
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:28,661
- We just talked about Danny.
- Okay.

932
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:30,995
What are you going
to do for Passover?

933
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:32,395
- Is your sister coming?
- Aw, yeah.

934
00:41:32,397 --> 00:41:34,195
What are you doing?
What do you got?

935
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:35,895
Watching from my phone,
I got six different people

936
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:37,462
playing six different games.

937
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:40,395
Hey, we're all
making... Hey. Who tapped me?

938
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,729
- Who was it?
- I'm not even sure about that.

939
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:52,063
That would be nice.

940
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,862
You gonna do the Questions,
the Four Questions?

941
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:56,562
- Yeah.
- You practicing?

942
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,296
I've been practicing.

943
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:00,329
I don't know how we're
going to keep it in Mexico.

944
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:07,762
- Well, good luck to Marcel.
- I know and to Danny.

945
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:09,396
Where are you going?

946
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:11,363
Daddy has got to go the
bathroom. I'll be right back.

947
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,962
She's gonna be on
in just a second.

948
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,296
I'll be back.
Thank you.

949
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,063
Howard, Marcel is about
to get on the...

950
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:18,096
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Howard, everything okay?

951
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:25,563
This is fucked up, guys.

952
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:29,030
What's so fucked up about it?

953
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:30,596
Could I speak
to you guys outside?

954
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:31,997
You sure you want to do that?

955
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,030
Yeah? Alright.
Excuse me.

956
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:43,431
Hey!
What are we gonna do here, man?

957
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:47,130
Hey, you.
Come on, man.

958
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,397
Guys...

959
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,297
- Get the fuck off!
- Aah!

960
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:58,664
- Run!
- Hey, look out.

961
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:01,833
Coming through.

962
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,798
Are you kidding me,
how good you guys look?

963
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,198
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Marcel, break a leg!

964
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,532
We're all here.
We're all here.

965
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,331
Fuck.

966
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:43,533
Get him! Get him!

967
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:48,099
Fuck.

968
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:49,632
Come here, you motherfucker.

969
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:52,099
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck.

970
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:53,698
I'm fucked.

971
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:58,965
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

972
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:02,466
I'm up. I'm up.

973
00:44:02,468 --> 00:44:03,965
I'm coming. I'm coming.

974
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,865
Hey, what the fuck?
You go and bit me?

975
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,299
I am! Fuck.

976
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:09,933
Arno!

977
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:12,000
- Get him in the fucking car!
- Arno! Arno!

978
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:13,768
- Get him in the fucking car!
- Arno!

979
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,233
Go, go, go. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

980
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:24,000
Arno, what is happening?

981
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:27,100
You don't know me.
Don't fucking speak my name.

982
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:29,933
- Give me the keys.
- The fucking Jew bit me!

983
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:32,866
Hey, hey.
What's happening right now?

984
00:44:32,868 --> 00:44:34,500
I told you how things were
gonna go

985
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:35,733
if you didn't start to behave.

986
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:37,866
What?
How was I not behaving?

987
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:39,267
Explain to me.
I... I'm sorry.

988
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:41,766
I think I was very explicit
on the phone

989
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:43,233
about how things
were gonna go.

990
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:44,866
You like the way things
are going now, huh?

991
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:46,534
Give me the fucking keys
to your car.

992
00:44:46,536 --> 00:44:49,435
What are you gonna do,
have them steal my Mercedes?

993
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:52,034
Look what the fuck you did!
You fucking bit my...

994
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,867
Arno.
Arno, fucking talk to me.

995
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,535
Don't listen to him, Arno.
It's not a game.

996
00:44:56,537 --> 00:44:58,068
Stop saying my fucking name!

997
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,034
I have every intention
of paying you back.

998
00:45:01,036 --> 00:45:02,734
- I'm broke right now.
- You broke?

999
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,068
- What's that?
- Look at that.

1000
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,967
- Do you remember that?
- Look at it!

1001
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:10,535
That is money that's not mine
that I sent to you

1002
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:12,368
because I wanted
to calm you down.

1003
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,234
We know for a fact that you
placed a bet with that money.

1004
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:17,168
I never placed a bet
with that money.

1005
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,934
- Yes, yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

1006
00:45:18,936 --> 00:45:20,468
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me ask you something.

1007
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,567
I heard that Beni and Eddie
are going to Timberlake.

1008
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,135
And you know what else I heard?

1009
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,069
I heard you've resurfaced
your fucking swimming pool.

1010
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,701
Do you know how that
makes me feel?

1011
00:45:27,703 --> 00:45:29,169
Never resurfaced anything.

1012
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:30,902
You think your life is
more important than mine?

1013
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:32,935
- I don't know who said that!
- Give me the keys!

1014
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:34,469
Give me the keys
to your fucking car!

1015
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:36,502
Here's the fucking keys.

1016
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,768
Fine.
Alright.

1017
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,135
Listen. I do.
I did. I admit it.

1018
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:46,235
I... I made a bet,
and guess what?

1019
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:49,536
Here's the thing... I hit.
I hit the bet big.

1020
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,402
You think I'm stupid.
You think I'm stupid.

1021
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:53,701
You think I'm stupid, Howard,

1022
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:55,102
you and your whole
fucking family.

1023
00:45:55,104 --> 00:45:56,502
I'll call the book right now.

1024
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,601
You get on the phone,
and he'll tell you.

1025
00:45:58,603 --> 00:45:59,635
I saw your bookie!

1026
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:01,070
You're talking about Gary?

1027
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:03,303
You spoke to Gary about what,
about what?

1028
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:06,769
About you, about how you're
taking my money all over town,

1029
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:08,936
placing bets.
You know what that does to me?

1030
00:46:08,938 --> 00:46:11,537
You know how offensive
that is to me?

1031
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:12,836
What, you stopped the bet?

1032
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:15,869
What do you think, asshole?

1033
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,003
You stopped the bet?

1034
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:19,470
- Shut the fuck up!
- Ow!

1035
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:21,537
Congratulations, Arno!

1036
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:24,736
You fucked ourselves
out of $600,000.

1037
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:26,503
- Shit!
- Take his clothes off.

1038
00:46:26,505 --> 00:46:30,070
Give me your bracelet.
Give me that fucking bracelet.

1039
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:32,803
Give me your fucking bracelet.

1040
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:35,769
- Hey, what's this?
- Give me the fucking shoe.

1041
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:37,103
Hold this motherfucker.

1042
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:40,037
Howard, you did this
to yourself.

1043
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,237
Take off your fucking pants.

1044
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,804
Take the fucking pants!

1045
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:47,804
I got to get...

1046
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,937
The auction
is next fucking week!

1047
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:51,404
Give me my glasses!

1048
00:46:51,406 --> 00:46:53,171
I need my fucking glasses!

1049
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:54,770
Oh! Alright!

1050
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,970
Pull up up here.
Come on. Let's go.

1051
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:58,538
Let me explain
something to you, motherfucker.

1052
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,237
Monday, I want the money.

1053
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,371
Arno gets the money.

1054
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:03,271
Alright?
I'm not fucking around anymore.

1055
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:05,471
- You hear me?
- Get him out of the car!

1056
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:10,137
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

1057
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:14,004
- Arno! Arno!
- Get in the fucking car!

1058
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:15,771
Alright. Alright. Alright.

1059
00:47:15,773 --> 00:47:18,238
Arno, listen to me.
Arno, Arno, Arno!

1060
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,439
- Get in the car!
- Take the opal, bro.

1061
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:22,704
Don't worry about it.
Get in the car.

1062
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,138
No, no, I want the underwear.

1063
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,905
No, no!

1064
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:28,005
Give me... give me
your fucking underwear.

1065
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:29,238
Give me!

1066
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,640
Give me your underwear,
you cocksucker.

1067
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,372
Now fucking rot in there.

1068
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:40,240
Fuck you, Arno,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

1069
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,072
Help!

1070
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,007
Help! Help! Help!

1071
00:47:50,207 --> 00:47:52,173
I am fucked.

1072
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:58,672
Please, please, please.
Please pick up.

1073
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,772
Pick up the fucking phone,
please.

1074
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:05,306
- Come on. Come on.
- Howard, where are you?

1075
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:07,206
- Dinah, Dinah...
- Marcel is up on the stage.

1076
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,705
- What do you want?
- I... I locked...

1077
00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,406
I locked my keys
in the trunk of the car.

1078
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:12,939
Can you please, uh,
can you come to the parking lot

1079
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,841
and open it for me?

1080
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,041
Shit.

1081
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:35,374
It's okay.

1082
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:37,142
Thank you.
Okay.

1083
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:40,407
Sorry.

1084
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:42,706
I'll meet you right back inside.
It's all good now.

1085
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:44,842
Let me get dressed.

1086
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,640
What could you possibly be
looking for in the forest

1087
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,674
dressed in such thin paper rags?

1088
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:08,941
My wicked stepmother
has condemned me to die,

1089
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:13,542
lest I fill this basket with
roses before the coming of dawn.

1090
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:16,308
Besides our cottage
is our magic garden.

1091
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,508
It protects the roses
from the snow.

1092
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,674
Go now and fill your basket
to your heart's content.

1093
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,941
Just watch your fucking sister.
It's fine.

1094
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:27,408
Thank you.
Thank you.

1095
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,908
Thank you.
Thank you.

1096
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,607
We must bestow a gift
upon her.

1097
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:36,774
I know.
Every time she speaks,

1098
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:39,808
gold coins shall spill forth
from her mouth.

1099
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,674
This will be our gift!

1100
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:44,078
Quick, he approaches now.

1101
00:49:48,378 --> 00:49:49,975
This is Danny's part.
He's coming out.

1102
00:49:49,977 --> 00:49:53,342
Hark!
Who goes there?

1103
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:54,543
He did so good.

1104
00:50:00,677 --> 00:50:02,708
Wow.

1105
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,309
Fuck.

1106
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:05,675
I... Jesus Christ.

1107
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:08,942
- Hello?
- Hey!

1108
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:11,109
Oh, you picked up, huh?

1109
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:12,708
When I block the call,
you pick up?

1110
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,809
When you know it's me,
you don't?

1111
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,875
What was that all about?

1112
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:17,176
Nah, I knew
it was you calling.

1113
00:50:17,178 --> 00:50:19,509
Actually, that's why
I picked up.

1114
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:21,609
Hey, where's my fucking gem?

1115
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,210
Hey, hey,
you need to calm down.

1116
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:24,976
Alright?
Something's happened.

1117
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:27,210
Listen, motherfucker.
I want my fucking property.

1118
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:29,377
- You understand me?
- Hey, watch your mouth!

1119
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:32,010
Alright? You're not dealing
with some broke-ass nigga.

1120
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:35,310
Hey, you fucking put me
on that bus ride home.

1121
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:36,609
You think that was funny?

1122
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:38,077
What the fuck was
that all about?

1123
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,077
That fucking bus was disgusting!

1124
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,743
What the fuck do you
want me to do, huh?

1125
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:43,444
I go into a locker room
with your silly ass

1126
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:45,843
that makes me look
really fucking suspect.

1127
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:47,477
Where's my gem?

1128
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:49,110
I'm trying to help you
not fuck everything up.

1129
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,810
- Where is it?
- Jesus Christ.

1130
00:50:50,812 --> 00:50:53,177
- I have it on me right now.
- You have it on you?

1131
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:54,676
Yes, I'm about...
I'm about to be back

1132
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:56,343
- in the city.
- Oh, okay.

1133
00:50:56,345 --> 00:51:00,244
You going to this fucking
The Weeknd thing tonight?

1134
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:02,144
I mean, I...
I wasn't planning on it,

1135
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:03,710
but I could.

1136
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:05,644
You could?
No, it's not you could.

1137
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,679
You will.
You'll meet me there.

1138
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,879
It smells good.
What is it, barbecue chicken?

1139
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,645
So I wanted to talk
about the trunk scenario.

1140
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:42,279
No. That was literally the most
awkward thing, like...

1141
00:51:42,281 --> 00:51:43,412
Where are you going?

1142
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:46,179
I'm heading into the city,

1143
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:49,245
late-night event,
gonna go...

1144
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,279
- Is this the cake?
- ...until 2:00, 3:00,

1145
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:54,611
you never know anymore.
So I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

1146
00:51:54,613 --> 00:51:56,780
Yeah, okay, sure.

1147
00:52:05,147 --> 00:52:06,914
Good night.

1148
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:11,246
Anyway, I'll finish
the conversation later,

1149
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:14,080
but it was literally so awkward.
Like, were you there?

1150
00:52:14,082 --> 00:52:17,813
- Who are you talking to?
- Jessica.

1151
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:19,046
Hi, Jessica.

1152
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:20,646
How good was our girl tonight?

1153
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:22,413
- You can't hear her.
- Okay.

1154
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:24,946
Well, then, just...
just hang up for a second.

1155
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:27,879
Let me talk to you, two secs.

1156
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:31,046
I'll call you back.
What?

1157
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:34,080
So I just...
I was very proud of you tonight.

1158
00:52:34,082 --> 00:52:36,213
You were beyond incredible.

1159
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:37,879
Yeah, you told me, like,
five times already.

1160
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:39,979
Well, I just wanted...

1161
00:52:39,981 --> 00:52:42,779
You really, really didn't know
how proud I was, okay?

1162
00:52:42,781 --> 00:52:45,712
So I really... I just really,
really want you to know.

1163
00:52:45,714 --> 00:52:49,014
Okay. Well, I do.

1164
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:50,980
Everything is cool, right?

1165
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:52,747
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

1166
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:55,147
I just thought I would
check in with you.

1167
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:56,780
Okay.

1168
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:59,448
Make sure everything is good.

1169
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,381
- Why wouldn't I be good?
- I don't know.

1170
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,481
- I just thought I'd check in.
- Okay.

1171
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:06,214
Well, I literally don't know
what you're talking about, so...

1172
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,514
That's right because
I'm an idiot.

1173
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:12,081
So you love me.
Okay?

1174
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:15,448
I'm gonna get into the city,
and I'll see you in the morning.

1175
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,980

- Like I always do.

1176
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:20,847
Anyway, where was I?
You know how I have, like,

1177
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,047
a complete resting-bitch face?
So...

1178
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,248
I didn't see you out front.

1179
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,981
I don't fucking see you
in here now.

1180
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:51,182
I can't believe I'm still
looking for you.

1181
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,415

1182
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,648

00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,615
No, I asked
for black light.

01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:03,325
Where the fuck are you,
you cock?

1341
01:00:03,327 --> 01:00:04,758
Listen, Howard!

1342
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,624
You knew what the fuck it was
when you met me.

1343
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:08,358
- That's right.
- Okay?

1344
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,991
Yeah, that's why I never...
I wish I never fucking met you.

1345
01:00:09,993 --> 01:00:11,991
- Right here.
- Oh, wow.

1346
01:00:11,993 --> 01:00:13,792
- That's great, Howard.
- Get the fuck...

1347
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:15,892
- Get out of my fucking way.
- Howard. Howard!

1348
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:17,560
Go fuck The Weeknd.
Alright?

1349
01:00:17,562 --> 01:00:19,059
We didn't fucking do anything.

1350
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:20,792
Get the fuck off of me.
Go, go, go.

1351
01:00:20,794 --> 01:00:22,759
It's fine. Go, go, go.
Good night. Bye.

1352
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,859
- Get the fuck away.
- Howard.

1353
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:26,426
- Go!
- Howard. Howard. Howard!

1354
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:28,159
Get out of the fucking car!

1355
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,426
Would you get the fuck
out of the fucking way?

1356
01:00:30,428 --> 01:00:31,859
Get the fuck out of the way.

1357
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,126
Oh, what are you gonna
do, Howard? Huh?

1358
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:35,592
What are you gonna do,
big, tough guy?

1359
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:36,926
That's it.

1360
01:00:36,928 --> 01:00:38,293
I didn't fucking
do anything with him.

1361
01:00:38,295 --> 01:00:39,725
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck away.

1362
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,026
- Go fuck the guy.
- Fuck you, Howard!

1363
01:00:42,028 --> 01:00:45,560
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow, Howard.

1364
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:47,093
- Yeah.
- I'm not seeing you.

1365
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:49,159
Let's go. Go.
Fuck you.

1366
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:24,960
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1367
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:27,794
- Oh, oh.
- Nothing much.

1368
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:29,328
Oh, funny, stupid bitch.

1369
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:33,495
That's why you're in line
in the fucking cold.

1370
01:01:33,497 --> 01:01:35,095
Yup, bitch.

1371
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:07,097
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Howard.

1372
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:08,530
- Listen, Anne, Anne.
- Howard!

1373
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:10,663
I'm looking at it.
I'm looking at the opal.

1374
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,863
- You're missing the point.
- I'm looking at it

1375
01:03:12,865 --> 01:03:14,263
right now, okay?
It's gorgeous.

1376
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:15,729
It is not you who should
be looking at it.

1377
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:16,830
- It's just... I just...
- It's me.

1378
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:18,431
Turn that down.

1379
01:03:18,433 --> 01:03:19,864
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Ratner.

1380
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:22,231
Your opal is one of 75 items

1381
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,764
I have to go through
for the auction.

1382
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,131
All of them but yours

1383
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:26,797
have been cleaned,
cataloged and appraised.

1384
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,331
Listen, I'm doing some
appraisals of my own.

1385
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,764
- Okay?
- Ugh.

1386
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:31,364
And then I'm gonna
bring it to you today.

1387
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:33,565
No. I am on the precipice
of pulling it right now.

1388
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:35,031
I swear to you, please.
Okay?

1389
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:36,331
End of the day or we're done.

1390
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,931
I'm getting a call
right now, so...

1391
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,630
End of the day, Howard,
and I'm serious.

1392
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:42,764
...I have to go.
This is Howard Ratner.

1393
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:44,231
- Hi, Jenna.
- Hi. How are you?

1394
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,164
Thank you so much
for calling me back so quickly.

1395
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,997
That message you left
actually was very disturbing.

1396
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:49,864
No, no.
No, I didn't mean to worry you.

1397
01:03:49,866 --> 01:03:52,198
Will you mind telling me
what this is about?

1398
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,065
I saw online that your boss
represents Kevin Garnett.

1399
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,199
Oh, I see. I'm gonna have
to put you on hold.

1400
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,865
- One moment.
- Okay, sure, sure.

1401
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,631
- I'll hang on.
- Howard, Julia is on line one.

1402
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:03,232
No. No. Tell her no.
I'm not here.

1403
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,466
Fuck it.

1404
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:08,965
Where are you?

1405
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:11,032
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1406
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:12,631
I asked you a question.
Where are you?

1407
01:04:12,633 --> 01:04:15,466
I stayed at Kat's house.
Where else do you think?

1408
01:04:15,468 --> 01:04:17,032
I couldn't fucking go home
with you acting that way.

1409
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:19,132
No, no.
That's... So let me guess.

1410
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:21,665
- You're not coming to work today?
- I would like to.

1411
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:25,132
That must be nice to come to
work whenever you feel like it.

1412
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:28,132
- Ugh, Howard.
- Is that good?

1413
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:30,199
Is that good? Maybe you should
take a nap then. Take a nap.

1414
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:32,100
Can we just please, like,
talk this out like adults?

1415
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,033
Get your rest. You need to
remain attractive, right?

1416
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:37,433
You're being a baby right now.

1417
01:04:37,435 --> 01:04:38,999
Answer me.

1418
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,699
I just want to sit down
and talk to you, Howard.

1419
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:42,133
Okay.

1420
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:43,966
I don't want to do this
right now.

1421
01:04:43,968 --> 01:04:45,533
- I don't want to fight.
- And I just need to work, okay?

1422
01:04:45,535 --> 01:04:47,100
I need to work to make sure
that your cheating ass

1423
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:48,400
is taken care of.

1424
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:49,999
Selfish Player
Personnel on line two.

1425
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:51,467
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Goodbye.

1426
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:52,999
This is Howard Ratner.

1427
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah, my assistant
told me that you called.

1428
01:04:54,402 --> 01:04:55,799
How are you doing?

1429
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:57,400
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I could be better.

1430
01:04:57,402 --> 01:04:59,133
Sorry to hear that.
So what can I do for you?

1431
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,666
I've been having a situation

1432
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:02,699
with one
of your higher-profile players,

1433
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:04,699
and I'm moments away right now

1434
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,666
from making things
very ugly for you.

1435
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,866
Right. Okay. Can you
hang on for a second, please?

1436
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:10,267
No. I'm not hanging on.

1437
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:11,733
I happen to be
a litigious individual.

1438
01:05:11,735 --> 01:05:13,201
Hmm.

1439
01:05:13,203 --> 01:05:15,733
And I am a second away
from hanging up right now

1440
01:05:15,735 --> 01:05:17,401
and calling my lawyer
and the police.

1441
01:05:17,403 --> 01:05:19,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do you realize

1442
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:20,967
that I have no idea what you're
talking about, right?

1443
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:22,367
- Howard, KG is here with Demany.
- You talk very fast,

1444
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:24,167
and you're starting to sound
like an asshole,

1445
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:25,468
so maybe you want to back up
and start from the top.

1446
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,568
Never mind.

1447
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:30,334
Kevin!
Hey, hey!

1448
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:33,534
- Hey, look at him, smart man.
- Buzz them in.

1449
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,334
- Wow.
- Buzz them.

1450
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:39,667
- I am. I am, Howard.
- Buzz the fucking door.

1451
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,534
Go to the other buzzer, please.
Hurry up.

1452
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:43,800
I'm trying to get at you
one more time.

1453
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:45,700
Be right there.
Go ahead.

1454
01:05:45,702 --> 01:05:48,035
It's not working.

1455
01:05:48,037 --> 01:05:50,268
Goddamn it.
Hang on. Sorry.

1456
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:51,801
- Open this shit up, man.
- I'm sorry.

1457
01:05:51,803 --> 01:05:52,901
We ain't got time
for this shit.

1458
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:54,202
We got a game tonight.

1459
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:56,968
The magnet sometimes
doesn't connect.

1460
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,435
- You brought the gem?
- I'm claustrophobic.

1461
01:05:58,437 --> 01:05:59,634
- Oh, yeah. I got the gem.
- Okay. Alright. Good.

1462
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:00,935
There it is.
Alright.

1463
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:02,402
I'm gonna go downstairs
and wait.

1464
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:04,168
You can't leave because
that one is locked also.

1465
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,535
- We'll wait downstairs, man.
- Get a fucking hammer.

1466
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:08,001
Roman, Roman,
he needs a hammer.

1467
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:10,001
- We'll be right there.
- He needs a hammer.

1468
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:11,535
- Let me get a hammer.
- Alright.

1469
01:06:11,537 --> 01:06:14,335
Honestly, it's gonna be
a sec. Move it!

1470
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,001
- I don't know if this'll work.
- Give me the hammer.

1471
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:18,968
- I'm on it.
- This usually works.

1472
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,368
This'll work.
Give me...

1473
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,569
Give me this
and get ready to buzz. Okay?

1474
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,002
- Aah!
- Ah, God.

1475
01:06:24,004 --> 01:06:25,169
Sorry. Buzz, buzz.

1476
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:26,503
That shit loud
as a bitch, man.

1477
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:27,902
Are you fucking kidding me?

1478
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:29,836
Buzz.
Hit it from the side, please.

1479
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:31,902
- Flawless is here.
- Get rid of this motherfucker.

1480
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,203
- I'm trying to get...
- Tell him goodbye.

1481
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:34,536
Oh, my God.
Flawless is here?

1482
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:36,403
Goodbye to fucking Flawless!

1483
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:38,735
Roman!
Roman!

1484
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:40,069
- What?
- Come out here.

1485
01:06:40,071 --> 01:06:41,436
Oh, shit.

1486
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:43,269
Listen, we're having
a fucking connection issue.

1487
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:45,536
Just get me some
fucking metal shavings

1488
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:46,836
and the tool fucking kit.

1489
01:06:46,838 --> 01:06:49,369
Alright? Goddamn it.

1490
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:53,002
- Open the damn door.
- I'm going to get this open.

1491
01:06:53,004 --> 01:06:54,503
I promise you.
This'll work.

1492
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:57,002
Hurry the fuck up, Roman.
Thank you. Thank you.

1493
01:06:57,004 --> 01:06:59,602
Hey, yo, Howard!
I'm here to buy the opal.

1494
01:06:59,604 --> 01:07:01,170
- It's game day for me!
- I know.

1495
01:07:01,172 --> 01:07:02,770
- I know it is.
- What the fuck is going on?

1496
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:04,471
- Listen to me.
- I got $175,000 in here.

1497
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:07,970
$175,000? I told you this thing
is worth over $1 million.

1498
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:10,636
Howard, come on, man.
What the fuck are you doing?

1499
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:12,903
Four courtside seats.

1500
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:15,170
I live in New York.

1501
01:07:15,172 --> 01:07:16,571
Come on, nigga.
Nigga, listen.

1502
01:07:16,573 --> 01:07:18,237
Listen to him.
Listen.

1503
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:19,970
KG, I want to give it to you for
free. I'm that kind of guy.

1504
01:07:19,972 --> 01:07:21,603
Just I'm tied into an auction
right now.

1505
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,370
What you talking...
What auction?

1506
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,736
The auction... Listen, make a
bid. Make a bid at the auction.

1507
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:27,670
- When is it? When?
- It's Monday.

1508
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:29,070
- Monday.
- Nah, nah.

1509
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:30,237
Let him rent it then
for a couple nights.

1510
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:31,736
- I hold it until Monday.
- I can't.

1511
01:07:31,738 --> 01:07:33,337
You'll get it
back Monday night.

1512
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:35,237
Kevin, I hate letting you
down like this.

1513
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:37,305
- Open the fucking door.
- You say no to everything.

1514
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:39,205
- Say yes to something.
- I want to, Kevin.

1515
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:41,704
I fucking love you.
I feel like an asshole.

1516
01:07:41,706 --> 01:07:43,338
- Believe me.
- You are!

1517
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,904
Come down.
Let me fucking do this.

1518
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:47,004
- Open the door!
- Jesus, fuck. I got this!

1519
01:07:47,006 --> 01:07:49,871
God fucking damn it.
I got to do everything.

1520
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:51,604
Please, stop knocking.

1521
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:52,704
It's not gonna help.

1522
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:54,105
Go, go.

1523
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:55,338
- Look.
- I'm so Goddamn sorry.

1524
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,472
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm so sorry.

1525
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,071
Got a door don't work?

1526
01:07:59,073 --> 01:08:00,671
- What's going on in here, man?
- Get them some waters.

1527
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:02,405
- Get the cold waters.
- We don't need any water, man.

1528
01:08:02,407 --> 01:08:04,138
Go get my ring, man,
so I can get up out of here.

1529
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,604
Get him his fucking ring.
He got shit to do.

1530
01:08:05,606 --> 01:08:06,938
- Come on.
- The ring.

1531
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,004
- My ring.
- The ring, the ring, the ring.

1532
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:09,171
- My ring.
- He's got a game.

1533
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:11,271
- Get him the ring.
- Oh, my God. No!

1534
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:12,737
I left the fucking ring
in Long Island.

1535
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,272
Are you joking?

1536
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:16,272
What the fuck do you mean,
you left it in Long...

1537
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:18,206
- Oh, I'll give it to Demany.
- I don't have time for this.

1538
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,339
- You'll get it to me!
- No, I'll give it to you.

1539
01:08:20,341 --> 01:08:22,839
- No, I need this.
- Listen, I can't do this.

1540
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:24,406
You don't have to do...
I do need...

1541
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:25,705
- I know, but I need the stone.
- Do me a favor.

1542
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:26,939
Do me a favor. Listen.

1543
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:28,439
- You need the stone?
- Yeah, please.

1544
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,272
- Where's my ring at, though?
- I'm sorry.

1545
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:32,072
I'll get you the ring.
I'm gonna give it to Demany.

1546
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,772
Hey, get my ring for me.
I'll see you later.

1547
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:36,372
- He'll go to Boston with it.
- Howard, this is bullshit, yo.

1548
01:08:36,374 --> 01:08:38,039
Hey, open this
fucking door, yo.

1549
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,372
Forgive me for being
this fucking...

1550
01:08:39,374 --> 01:08:40,839
Hey, yo, buzz us out, Howard.

1551
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,206
We'll buzz you out.
Alright.

1552
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,672
- Please, buzz him out.
- This is crazy.

1553
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:45,805
KG, forgive everything I did

1554
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:49,039
and the time I wasted,
and you fucking asshole!

1555
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,106
- You fucking did this!
- Yo!

1556
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:52,773
You!
What have you been telling him?

1557
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:54,173
What the fuck are you
talking about, Howard?

1558
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:55,806
Look.
This is how the shit works.

1559
01:08:55,808 --> 01:08:57,940
I bring niggas here to you
to buy jewelry.

1560
01:08:57,942 --> 01:08:59,639
That's how I get fucking paid.

1561
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:01,340
You have a lot of nerve
talking to me right now...

1562
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:03,140
The fuck are
you talking about?

1563
01:09:03,142 --> 01:09:04,940
...after that fiasco
you fucking caused.

1564
01:09:04,942 --> 01:09:06,373
The nigga just offered
a quarter of a million dollars

1565
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,540
for a fucking rock, dummy.
That's all me.

1566
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:10,806
That's cause of you, huh?
I had nothing to do with it.

1567
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:12,273
That's 20 fucking grand
I'm out.

1568
01:09:12,275 --> 01:09:13,540
You spoke to those guys
in Ethiopia, right?

1569
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:14,840
You put all the calls in?

1570
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:16,173
- Yeah, my bad.
- Fuck you, my nigga.

1571
01:09:16,175 --> 01:09:17,706
I'm taking all my niggas
somewhere else.

1572
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,140
- Where my shit at?
- Get the fuck out.

1573
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:20,639
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of there.

1574
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:22,140
- Where's my shit?
- Get out of there.

1575
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:24,040
There's only three
fucking watches in here.

1576
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:25,673
- I don't want you in there.
- Where is the rest of my shit?

1577
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:27,173
- Where my watches at?
- I loaned them.

1578
01:09:27,175 --> 01:09:28,841
- I loaned them.
- What you mean you loaned them?

1579
01:09:28,843 --> 01:09:30,941
These are fake Rollies,
so what?

1580
01:09:30,943 --> 01:09:32,441
- Nigga, it's my shit, nigga.
- They're $200.

1581
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:34,274
Them boxes is mad expensive,
you fucking idiot.

1582
01:09:34,276 --> 01:09:36,807
Alright. Well, I owe you then.
Get out of here, I said.

1583
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:38,374
Man, fuck you.
Get the fuck off of me, man.

1584
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:40,108
Howard, I have
Dr. Blauman on line one.

1585
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,974
- Where the fuck is my shit?
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Hi.

1586
01:09:42,976 --> 01:09:45,874
- Howard?
- Hi, Doctor. What's going on?

1587
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:48,041
- Howard.
- Where's the Goddamn paper?

1588
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:49,441
- Please be quiet.
- Is everything okay?

1589
01:09:49,443 --> 01:09:50,907
Where's the fucking papers,
Howard?

1590
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:52,308
- Yeah. Shut the fuck up.
- Bitch ass.

1591
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,274
- Howard, me?
- Go ahead. I'm sorry.

1592
01:09:54,276 --> 01:09:56,341
- Howard, I'm...
- What do I got?

1593
01:09:56,343 --> 01:09:58,508
...looking
at the results here

1594
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,141
of your colonoscopy, so we're
good. You're all good.

1595
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:03,308
- Everything came back clean.
- Bitch ass motherfucker.

1596
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,108
Fuck you and that
Goddamn phone call, nigga.

1597
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,008
Doctor, so we're clean 100%?
You said it's good?

1598
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,808
Yeah, I said you're all clean.

1599
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:10,975
Oh, good, good. Thank you.
That's a relief.

1600
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:12,375
This is just routine.

1601
01:10:12,377 --> 01:10:14,175
You ain't fucking
listening to me, my nigga.

1602
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:15,775
My father fucking died
from it, so of course.

1603
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,175
I didn't mean to scare you,

1604
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:18,775
but, you know,
given your family history,

1605
01:10:18,777 --> 01:10:19,708
this is something you got
to stay on top of.

1606
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,042
I know. I know.

1607
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:22,309
Jews and colon cancer,
what is that?

1608
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:24,542
I thought we were
the chosen people.

1609
01:10:24,544 --> 01:10:26,775
Colon cancer just
paid for my house in the Hamptons.

1610
01:10:26,777 --> 01:10:28,008
Don't tell me that.
Where?

1611
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,209
What part of the Hamptons?

1612
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:30,942
- How many acres?
- Whoa, whoa.

1613
01:10:30,944 --> 01:10:32,442
What are you doing?
You're gonna kill the fish.

1614
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:33,608
What the fuck?
My fish!

1615
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,175
- Howard?
- My fish!

1616
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,409
- Fuck you, too.
- You fuck! Get a glass.

1617
01:10:37,411 --> 01:10:40,008
- Get a glass.
- Fuck them Goddamn fish, nigga.

1618
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,009
What the fuck are you doing?
You fucking asshole.

1619
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:44,276
Get a fucking nother glass.

1620
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:46,143
Get another glass.
Goddamn it.

1621
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,943
Come here.
I got you, guys.

1622
01:10:47,945 --> 01:10:50,742
There you go. There you go.
I got you, sweetheart.

1623
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:53,543
Joanie! Joanie, please get
some more glasses.

1624
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:55,609
Can't see the water.
They're blind.

1625
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:57,609
Alright.
Howard, I'm hanging up.

1626
01:10:57,611 --> 01:11:01,477
I thought I specifically
said 5:30 I am out of the door.

1627
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:03,876
I told you I was coming
to you, and I'm coming to you.

1628
01:11:03,878 --> 01:11:05,310
I have the stone.
Don't you dare leave.

1629
01:11:05,312 --> 01:11:08,076
- I have a wedding in New York.
- Howard, Howard.

1630
01:11:08,078 --> 01:11:11,276
- No!
- Howard, Howard, stop.

1631
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:13,343
You're being fucking
crazy again. Stop.

1632
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:14,843
- Listen.
- Howard.

1633
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:16,110
I got no time to talk.
I have to be to Adley's

1634
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:17,609
in 15 minutes
before they close.

1635
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:19,143
Alright. I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.

1636
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:20,677
Then I got to see
my father-in-law.

1637
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:22,277
Howard, please.
I'm really sick.

1638
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:24,077
I don't feel well.
I got out of bed to come here.

1639
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,710
I see you were in a big rush
to come over here, huh?

1640
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:27,177
You got yourself
a fucking smoothie.

1641
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,277
- I was in a big rush.
- I want you out.

1642
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:32,010
You motherfucker!

1643
01:11:32,012 --> 01:11:34,444
You're out of the apartment
by the end of the day.

1644
01:11:34,446 --> 01:11:37,146
- Fuck you.
- Out of my life.

1645
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,012
You have no idea.

1646
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,811
How you doing, Howie?

1647
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:02,811
- Alright.
- How's it going?

1648
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:04,212
- Hey, sucker.
- Alright.

1649
01:12:04,214 --> 01:12:06,347
Larry, you're a Jew again?
Welcome back.

1650
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,711
- I got some diamonds.
- Have a good pay, sir.

1651
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:12,512
It's all right.
Yeah.

1652
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,780
Dip the celery.

1653
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:45,645
You know who kind of sucks
a little bit, overrated?

1654
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:46,745
- Alright.
- Chris Paul.

1655
01:12:46,747 --> 01:12:48,279
- Chris Paul.
- Come on, man.

1656
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,712
He's all NBA, man.
He can't do it alone.

1657
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:51,279
- He can't do it alone.
- Eddie!

1658
01:12:51,281 --> 01:12:52,812
- Please, that's enough!
- You don't know anything.

1659
01:12:52,814 --> 01:12:54,179
- What are you saying?
- I'm talking...

1660
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:56,246
- Shut up, everybody!
- Alright. Alright.

1661
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:58,745
- Please.
- Natalie, Natalie, you're up.

1662
01:12:58,747 --> 01:13:01,812
Wait, you skipped my dad.

1663
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:03,279
Where are we?

1664
01:13:03,281 --> 01:13:06,248
Howard, why don't you
read the plagues?

1665
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,147
Okay.

1666
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:13,813
Ma, you take the Hebrew,
and I'll take the English.

1667
01:13:13,815 --> 01:13:17,780
Yes, my dear.
Here we go.

1668
01:13:17,782 --> 01:13:21,114
Blood.

1669
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:24,613
Frogs.

1670
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:27,547
Lice.

1671
01:13:27,549 --> 01:13:30,547
Wild animals.

1672
01:13:30,549 --> 01:13:33,613
Pestilence.

1673
01:13:33,615 --> 01:13:36,514
Boils.

1674
01:13:36,516 --> 01:13:39,680
Hail.

1675
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,847
Locusts.

1676
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:45,581
Darkness.

1677
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:52,081
Death of the first born,
hard-core back there.

1678
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,582
Huh?

1679
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:58,714
That can still happen if you
don't watch yourselves, kids.

1680
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:02,448
Hey, it's Julia.
Leave me a message.

1681
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,482
- I don't text, so don't text me.
- Excuse me.

1682
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:06,914
You send me something
like that

1683
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:10,148
and then you don't
pick up your phone?

1684
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:13,315
Huh?
You were fucking with me?

1685
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:17,081
I'm trying to have a nice,
peaceful dinner with my family,

1686
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,548
which is something
you wouldn't understand

1687
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,115
because you don't have one.

1688
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:22,348
You want to play mind games
with me?

1689
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:23,848
Huh?

1690
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,748
So whatever you meant
by your little link,

1691
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:31,015
I meant when I said I want you
out of my apartment tonight,

1692
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:36,082
and I want confirmation by text
not a link, via text.

1693
01:14:36,084 --> 01:14:39,449
"Howie, I am gone, 10:00 p.m."

1694
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:41,884
Don't you fucking call me.

1695
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,782
Arno, what the fuck?

1696
01:14:49,784 --> 01:14:51,149
Can we just fucking talk?

1697
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:52,882
We're family.
We're here right now.

1698
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:55,182
- Get out of my way.
- Yeah, you're not so tough

1699
01:14:55,184 --> 01:14:57,782
without your friends
around, are you?

1700
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:00,682
Are you?
Are you?

1701
01:15:00,684 --> 01:15:02,517
Fucking pussy.

1702
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:04,117
Oh, you like...
You love this roster?

1703
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:06,649
- I love it.
- Baron Davis is done.

1704
01:15:06,651 --> 01:15:08,783
Start fresh.
Melo, Amari...

1705
01:15:08,785 --> 01:15:10,450
- What about Lin?
- That's it.

1706
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:12,550
- We got to bring back Lin.
- Hey, you know why fucking Lin

1707
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:14,117
is not coming back next year?

1708
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,683
Because Dolan saw everybody
was so fucking happy.

1709
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,517
- They're not gonna ruin that.
- Howard fucking knows.

1710
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:20,117
On top of which,
you realize that I met my wife

1711
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:22,050
at the first game
that started Linsanity?

1712
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:23,916
You know what he says
to me, hmm?

1713
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:25,383
He comes over to me.

1714
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:29,016
He says, "Happy holidays,"
like it's Christmas.

1715
01:15:29,018 --> 01:15:31,217
It's like having an intruder
in your own home.

1716
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:33,916
- And we'll never live it down.
- He's not bothering anybody.

1717
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:36,716
- Alright? He's trying.
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

1718
01:15:36,718 --> 01:15:38,016
- He didn't marry your daughter.
- Shh.

1719
01:15:38,018 --> 01:15:39,884
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know Mike, you know,

1720
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:41,184
who sells the vitamins
on Amazon?

1721
01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:44,717
- He's got the lisp.
- There he is.

1722
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,984
- You good?
- Your guy is a schmuck.

1723
01:15:47,986 --> 01:15:50,717
Man, KG wouldn't even
dare mess with Amari.

1724
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,784
This is KG, huh?

1725
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,917
Oh, three for 11?

1726
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:02,750
- What the fuck?
- Yeah. He looks tortured.

1727
01:16:02,752 --> 01:16:04,518
That fucking guy tried
to steal an opal from me.

1728
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,318
- Your opal? Your opal came?
- The opal came, yeah.

1729
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,817
Stupidly I lent it
to this motherfucker.

1730
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:11,784
No. What do you mean?
He took it?

1731
01:16:11,786 --> 01:16:12,951
- He stole it?
- He didn't steal it.

1732
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:14,384
He got carried away.

1733
01:16:14,386 --> 01:16:16,618
He thinks it has magic powers
to help him.

1734
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,352
- Magic powers?
- Yeah.

1735
01:16:19,354 --> 01:16:20,519
- No, really?
- Look.

1736
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:22,219
Look at him tonight without it.

1737
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:24,519
He didn't have it tonight.
Look how fucking bad he played.

1738
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:27,452
He wants to own it, so I
tell him come to the auction,

1739
01:16:27,454 --> 01:16:30,085
fucking make a bid
for it like everyone else.

1740
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:33,285
- When is this auction?
- The auction is Monday.

1741
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:35,486
Uh-huh.
So what do you think it's worth?

1742
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:40,718
Well, listen, it's anywhere
from $1,000 to $3,000 a carat,

1743
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,085
and it's 600 carats.

1744
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:45,052
Whoa, that's over $1 million.

1745
01:16:45,054 --> 01:16:46,486
- He's rich!
- Whoa.

1746
01:16:46,488 --> 01:16:49,952
Not as rich as Gooey,
but working on that.

1747
01:16:49,954 --> 01:16:52,352
Who's comparing?
Rich is rich.

1748
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:57,122
I made a crazy risk, a gamble,
and it's about to pay off.

1749
01:17:02,222 --> 01:17:04,186
Unh-unh-unh.
Don't look at us.

1750
01:17:04,188 --> 01:17:05,686
Don't look at him.
Don't look at me.

1751
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,353
Find it yourself.

1752
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:10,986
Come on. Keep looking.
Now warm, warm, warm.

1753
01:17:10,988 --> 01:17:14,120
Warmer.
Very warm.

1754
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:16,752
Keep looking.
Keep looking.

1755
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:19,220
- I found it!
- Yay!

1756
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,253
- That's my boy!
- Woo!

1757
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,153
Hey, find your stuff.

1758
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:28,019
- We're leaving soon.
- Why not?

1759
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:29,619
Just suck in a little bit,
and it'll fit.

1760
01:17:29,621 --> 01:17:31,653
Listen, let's show Dad.
Let's show Dad.

1761
01:17:31,655 --> 01:17:33,154
Dad, Dad, look!

1762
01:17:33,156 --> 01:17:35,454
This is mom's bat mitzvah dress.
It still fits her.

1763
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:37,321
- Let's show grandpa.
- Ah, that's hysterical.

1764
01:17:37,323 --> 01:17:39,954
Hey. It's 9:00.
What do you think?

1765
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:41,521
- Fine.
- Should we get going?

1766
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,653
Yeah, let's go tell the boys.

1767
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:45,622
I told them.
I told them.

1768
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:50,687
What?

1769
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:52,121
You look gorgeous.

1770
01:17:52,123 --> 01:17:54,221
Oh, God.

1771
01:17:54,223 --> 01:18:00,187
I wanted to talk to you
for a minute and just sit down,

1772
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:02,687
and we don't have to do it here.

1773
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:05,054
We'll wait, but I, I, uh,

1774
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:08,921
I'm having
very serious second thoughts,

1775
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:13,455
and we're all together
right now.

1776
01:18:13,457 --> 01:18:15,522
We're all so comfortable.

1777
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,188
It's... I... Is it too late?

1778
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,388
Should we maybe...
What do you think?

1779
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:22,788
Am I crazy?

1780
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:24,654
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

1781
01:18:24,656 --> 01:18:26,255
I know.
I know I fucked up.

1782
01:18:26,257 --> 01:18:27,855
- I know it.
- Yeah, you fucked up.

1783
01:18:27,857 --> 01:18:29,188
- I have no right...
- You are a fuck-up,

1784
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:30,589
and I'm not having
this conversation.

1785
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:31,988
Listen to me, please.
Stop.

1786
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,754
Just stop for one second
and just look at me.

1787
01:18:33,756 --> 01:18:37,188
Look in my eyes, and they'll
tell you what I'm feeling.

1788
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,990
Please. Please.

1789
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:54,655
Okay.
What are you thinking?

1790
01:18:54,657 --> 01:18:57,189
What? Tell me.
Tell me. I want to know.

1791
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:00,423
- Oh, my God.
- I know. What?

1792
01:19:00,425 --> 01:19:04,523
Your face is so stupid.

1793
01:19:04,525 --> 01:19:07,123
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

1794
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:09,156
I'm gonna leave her.
I'll leave her.

1795
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:12,089
I don't need her.
We're done. We're done.

1796
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:13,423
- Okay.
- It's done.

1797
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:14,556
- Okay.
- It was stupid.

1798
01:19:14,558 --> 01:19:16,822
- Okay.
- She's trash.

1799
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:19,323
She's trash.
I know that.

1800
01:19:19,325 --> 01:19:20,923
It was stupid.

1801
01:19:20,925 --> 01:19:22,557
I'm done.
I'm done.

1802
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:24,790
It means nothing, meant nothing.

1803
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:26,290
Please.

1804
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:29,658
I'm begging you.
Just give me another shot.

1805
01:19:32,092 --> 01:19:35,491
- You know what, Howard?
- Say yes. What?

1806
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:39,290
I think you are the most
annoying person I have ever met.

1807
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:40,723
I hate being with you.

1808
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:43,457
I hate looking at you,
and if I had my way,

1809
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:46,923
I would never see you again.

1810
01:19:46,925 --> 01:19:48,057
That's because you're mad.

1811
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:51,390
You're mad, and it makes sense.

1812
01:19:51,392 --> 01:19:53,390
You can punch me if you want.

1813
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:55,890
- Oh, thanks.
- Hey!

1814
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:57,190
I was ready for it.

1815
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,458
I don't even want
to touch you.

1816
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,258
Oh, my God!

1817
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,891
- Are you kidding me?
- Look how insane!

1818
01:20:02,893 --> 01:20:04,558
Wait, turn around.
I want to see the back.

1819
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,024
- Did you see that?
- Oh, my God!

1820
01:20:06,026 --> 01:20:08,024
I hate you!
Does that fit you right now?

1821
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:10,558
I'm 15 pounds overweight.
I am.

1822
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,024
I'll get the car, okay?
I'll get the car.

1823
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:17,391
- See?
- You look so good.

1824
01:20:17,393 --> 01:20:20,592
New York and Long
Island's home of classic rock,

1825
01:20:20,594 --> 01:20:24,058
Q106.7, The Rock.

1826
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,757
She's always...

1827
01:20:25,759 --> 01:20:29,724
Like we want to see everything
she's doing at every moment.

1828
01:20:29,726 --> 01:20:32,924
- You think she's jealous of me?
- Yeah, she wants your life.

1829
01:20:32,926 --> 01:20:35,092
- She wants our house.
- She can have it.

1830
01:20:35,094 --> 01:20:36,859
Look at the way
you're playing.

1831
01:20:36,861 --> 01:20:38,459
Why are you taking Lex?

1832
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:40,559
Take the tunnel, it's better,
less traffic.

1833
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:42,992
No! Let me focus
and give me the phone!

1834
01:20:42,994 --> 01:20:45,259
Plus, I want to grab something
from the apartment,

1835
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:48,061
- and it's right there.
- Oh, go left. Go left.

1836
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:53,192
- Hit the boss!
- I hit him.

1837
01:20:53,194 --> 01:20:55,725
We're gonna stop
by the apartment, guys.

1838
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:57,192
Oh, my God.

1839
01:20:57,194 --> 01:20:59,992
- Come on, Mom.
- Daddy has got things to do.

1840
01:20:59,994 --> 01:21:03,294
- Mom, it's so annoying.
- Some business.

1841
01:21:05,495 --> 01:21:06,792
- You died!
- No!

1842
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:16,960
- Hi, Mr. Ratner. How are you?
- How are you?

1843
01:21:16,962 --> 01:21:18,160
- Yeah.
- Anything in the trunk?

1844
01:21:18,162 --> 01:21:19,759
I'm just gonna be
up and down.

1845
01:21:19,761 --> 01:21:21,293
Eddie is gonna go
to the bathroom, Howard.

1846
01:21:21,295 --> 01:21:22,693
- I got to use the bathroom.
- Go upstairs, honey.

1847
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:24,060
Just hold it in. Alright?

1848
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:25,594
It's 45 minutes
before we're home.

1849
01:21:25,596 --> 01:21:27,127
- I can't wait that long.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1850
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:28,527
Eddie, go upstairs
and use the bathroom.

1851
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:30,460
I'm tired.
I want to go to sleep.

1852
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:32,127
You couldn't go at Grandpa's?
You had to wait until now?

1853
01:21:32,129 --> 01:21:35,427
Come on. We're going.
We're going.

1854
01:21:35,429 --> 01:21:38,327
Goddamn it.

1855
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:40,759
Bathroom is all fucked up
because of construction,

1856
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:42,260
so I asked the neighbor
if you can...

1857
01:21:42,262 --> 01:21:43,893
I don't want to use
the neighbor's bathroom.

1858
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,893
- I'm taking a shit.
- You ever see the show,

1859
01:21:45,895 --> 01:21:47,227
- "Good Times"?
- No.

1860
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:48,759
You're actually going
to like this.

1861
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:50,061
This guy was the father
on the show.

1862
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:51,595
What? I don't care.

1863
01:21:51,597 --> 01:21:55,228
I showed it to you.

1864
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:58,061
- He was in "Coming to America."
- He's probably sleeping.

1865
01:21:58,063 --> 01:22:00,428
- I bet you he's a old man.
- Who is it?

1866
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:03,896
It's Howard next door.
I live in E.

1867
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,861
- Hey, how are you?
- What's up?

1868
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:10,894
Unfortunately, my bathroom
is all fucked up,

1869
01:22:10,896 --> 01:22:12,061
and this kid has got to go.

1870
01:22:12,063 --> 01:22:14,595
Can we use yours for a minute?

1871
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,861
No, sorry.

1872
01:22:16,863 --> 01:22:18,428
What a fucking dickhead.

1873
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,063
Hey, stop that.
He's a fucking legend.

1874
01:22:22,929 --> 01:22:24,961
- Hello?
- Hi.

1875
01:22:24,963 --> 01:22:27,062
I'm your neighbor.

1876
01:22:27,064 --> 01:22:28,529
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

1877
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:30,295
I'm your neighbor.
I never introduced myself.

1878
01:22:30,297 --> 01:22:32,095
- Alan, how are you?
- My bathroom is all fucked up,

1879
01:22:32,097 --> 01:22:35,262
and my son needs to...
Can he use yours for a second?

1880
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:37,129
What is it, number one
or number two?

1881
01:22:37,131 --> 01:22:38,496
One.

1882
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:40,162
He's gonna go one, one.
Alright? So you go quick.

1883
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,628
Alright. In the back.
In the back.

1884
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,062
I'll meet you in the hallway.

1885
01:22:58,331 --> 01:23:01,362
Julia!

1886
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:14,029
"Have a nice life.

1887
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,796
I hope you find everything
you're looking for."

1888
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,099
Yeah.
I'm coming.

1889
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:04,799
Yeah, yeah.

1890
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:11,799
Come on.
Let's go.

1891
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:25,332
Who's the girl living
in your apartment?

1892
01:24:25,334 --> 01:24:27,031
- What'd you say?
- Yeah, that guy told me

1893
01:24:27,033 --> 01:24:28,599
there's some hot chick
living in your apartment.

1894
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:30,065
Who is that, Mom?

1895
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:31,365
What are you doing talking
to that coke head?

1896
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:32,865
He was talking to me
while I was...

1897
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,232
I told you to go in there
and take a shit.

1898
01:24:34,234 --> 01:24:35,898
- I did take a shit.
- That was it.

1899
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,432
Get on the elevator.
That's enough already.

1900
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:40,798
Don't talk about that.

1901
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,599
That ain't right.

1902
01:24:59,335 --> 01:25:01,500
- Did you get what you needed?
- Yeah.

1903
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:29,799
Put the recycling
and the garbage out

1904
01:25:29,801 --> 01:25:31,567
before you come in the house.

1905
01:26:34,137 --> 01:26:37,201
Big day.

1906
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:39,934
Magnolia Bakery from
the downtown original.

1907
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:41,535
- Thank you.
- Have you had these yet?

1908
01:26:41,537 --> 01:26:42,801
Delicious.

1909
01:26:42,803 --> 01:26:44,435
- Thank you.
- You tell everybody here

1910
01:26:44,437 --> 01:26:45,835
thank you so much for
everything they've done for me.

1911
01:26:45,837 --> 01:26:47,302
Alright. Will do.

1912
01:26:47,304 --> 01:26:49,802
These are on me,
Howard Ratner, and what's this?

1913
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:53,102
- Is this the catalog for today?
- That's the one.

1914
01:26:53,104 --> 01:26:54,668
If they want
anybody else to come in,

1915
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:56,102
they're gonna have
to be before him.

1916
01:26:56,104 --> 01:26:59,238
- It stops right on me.
- Alright. Thank you.

1917
01:27:03,304 --> 01:27:05,002
What the fuck is this?

1918
01:27:05,004 --> 01:27:06,668
- This is a mistake.
- It's a correction.

1919
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:10,269
No, it's a correction,
but it's a fucking mistake.

1920
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:12,035
Where's Anne?
I want to speak with her.

1921
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:13,869
I'm sorry.
Anne is in a meeting right now.

1922
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:15,302
No, get her
out of the meeting.

1923
01:27:15,304 --> 01:27:17,935
It's an emergency.
I want to speak with her.

1924
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:20,102
Call her on the phone, please.

1925
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:22,437
Thank you.

1926
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:25,137
If you promise to keep
your voice down...

1927
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,604
- Yes.
- ...I'm happy to call her.

1928
01:27:26,606 --> 01:27:29,270
- Thank you.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1929
01:27:30,606 --> 01:27:32,903
Hello, Anne. I'm down here
with Howard Ratner.

1930
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:34,936
Can you ask her how this
fucking 155 bullshit happened?

1931
01:27:34,938 --> 01:27:37,936
Did you hear that?
Mm-hmm. Okay.

1932
01:27:37,938 --> 01:27:40,803
What? What is she saying?

1933
01:27:40,805 --> 01:27:42,137
I'm afraid that's
your appraisal.

1934
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:43,570
I know that's what it says.

1935
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:46,070
I'm asking who came up
with the fucking figure?

1936
01:27:46,072 --> 01:27:48,870
- Oscar in gems.
- Well, Oscar is fucking wrong.

1937
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,903
I could go out and get
six appraisers right now,

1938
01:27:51,905 --> 01:27:54,803
five of them would say
at least $3,000 a carat.

1939
01:27:54,805 --> 01:27:56,337
He's saying he can go
to six appraisers and...

1940
01:27:56,339 --> 01:27:58,736
Give me the phone.
Can I speak to her, please?

1941
01:27:58,738 --> 01:28:00,304
- Can I speak with her?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1942
01:28:00,306 --> 01:28:01,837
I'm gonna have
to hand you over.

1943
01:28:01,839 --> 01:28:03,104
No, no.
That won't be necessary.

1944
01:28:03,106 --> 01:28:04,605
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Anne.

1945
01:28:04,607 --> 01:28:06,304
- Yes.
- This is fucking outrageous.

1946
01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:08,670
Okay. You need to calm
yourself down, Mr. Ratner.

1947
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:09,971
No, I don't want to be calm.

1948
01:28:09,973 --> 01:28:11,971
This appraisal
is a fucking joke.

1949
01:28:11,973 --> 01:28:13,338
Oscar happens to be

1950
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,104
one of our
most experienced gemologists

1951
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:16,737
who we were
extremely lucky to get.

1952
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:18,104
Who clearly knows nothing
about colored stones

1953
01:28:18,106 --> 01:28:19,571
and why the fuck
am I hearing about it now?

1954
01:28:19,573 --> 01:28:21,071
Do I need to remind you

1955
01:28:21,073 --> 01:28:23,037
that you brought the opal to us
on a Friday night

1956
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:24,571
for an auction set
on a Monday morning?

1957
01:28:24,573 --> 01:28:26,438
We were lucky to be able
to get it appraised at all.

1958
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,637
I don't give a fuck.
I don't care. I don't care.

1959
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,304
It needs to be changed.
Do it.

1960
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:32,037
That's not an option,
but if you like, we can pull it.

1961
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:34,171
Pull it? No, no.
Not gonna pull it, okay?

1962
01:28:34,173 --> 01:28:35,770
Here's what you'll do.

1963
01:28:35,772 --> 01:28:37,239
You're gonna make
an announcement at the top

1964
01:28:37,241 --> 01:28:40,205
of the auction
that the correction was wrong,

1965
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:41,805
and the original estimate
stands.

1966
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:43,038
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1967
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,472
We are not
correcting a correction.

1968
01:28:44,474 --> 01:28:46,339
We can either pull it
or carry on as-is.

1969
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:48,506
- It's entirely up to you.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

1970
01:28:48,508 --> 01:28:50,105
Okay, Anne. No. I'm sorry, too.

1971
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:52,472
I have bent over
backwards for you, Mr. Ratner.

1972
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:53,972
- We are done here.
- Yes, that'll be perfect.

1973
01:28:53,974 --> 01:28:55,572
I'll let her know.

1974
01:28:55,574 --> 01:28:57,172
Me and my staff had to
work the entire weekend

1975
01:28:57,174 --> 01:28:58,938
- to get your piece ready.
- Thank you so much.

1976
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:00,072
Once again, from the bottom
of my heart, I apologize.

1977
01:29:00,074 --> 01:29:01,472
I'm just happy

1978
01:29:01,474 --> 01:29:03,339
I won't ever have to work with
you again.

1979
01:29:03,341 --> 01:29:05,038
Okay, I'll tell her. Thank you.
Okay. So she said

1980
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,671
that we need to take
the inserts

1981
01:29:08,673 --> 01:29:10,139
out of each catalog

1982
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:14,006
before the auction starts,
so you have those.

1983
01:29:14,008 --> 01:29:17,609
If you want, I saw a box down
there, and I can start on these.

1984
01:29:21,674 --> 01:29:22,873
What is that?
What are you doing?

1985
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,440
I just have a question
for Anne.

1986
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,306
You don't need to call her.
I just spoke with her.

1987
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:27,906
Oh, it's a separate question.
Don't worry about it.

1988
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:29,507
- Howard!
- Hi, Anne. He's saying

1989
01:29:29,509 --> 01:29:31,206
that you told him it was okay
to take out the inserts.

1990
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:32,739
Okay, hey, listen.
Just fuck it.

1991
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:34,140
Put them back in.
I don't give a shit.

1992
01:29:34,142 --> 01:29:35,607
- Gooey!
- We're here.

1993
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,873
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Is he here?

1994
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,939
Huh, KG?

1995
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,873
- He is... I didn't see him yet.
- Is he here?

1996
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,206
I haven't seen him yet.

1997
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:44,739
I got all these things
for him to sign.

1998
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:46,340
Listen to me. Listen.
If you want that,

1999
01:29:46,342 --> 01:29:48,973
get it before
the auction starts.

2000
01:29:48,975 --> 01:29:50,340
Go to the auction room.
See if he's there.

2001
01:29:50,342 --> 01:29:52,007
- Find him in there.
- He's a great guy.

2002
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:53,374
- You'll love him.
- He's excited.

2003
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:55,740
So I want to ask you
a little favor.

2004
01:29:55,742 --> 01:29:58,807
- Can I...?
- Yeah, what? What favor?

2005
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:02,640
So I need you
to jack up the bids.

2006
01:30:02,642 --> 01:30:04,074
What? No.
I... No.

2007
01:30:04,076 --> 01:30:05,907
- Absolutely not.
- Gooey, a little bit.

2008
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:07,740
It's just here
and there, you make a bid.

2009
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:10,775
I just got to ensure
we get it up to $250,000.

2010
01:30:12,343 --> 01:30:14,508
- What if I win at $250,000?
- That's easy.

2011
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:15,974
I'll give it right back to you,
but you're not...

2012
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:18,374
- Geez!
- Hey.

2013
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:20,040
This is not really
a nice position

2014
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:21,407
you put me in, you know?
I mean, I resent it...

2015
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:22,807
I know.
You think I want to do this?

2016
01:30:22,809 --> 01:30:24,040
- ...very much.
- I fucked up.

2017
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:25,374
I should've got
my own appraisal,

2018
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,241
but I didn't have
the time, so...

2019
01:30:27,243 --> 01:30:29,408
- How much they appraise it for?
- $200,000.

2020
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,641
- $200,000?
- Yeah, but these assholes...

2021
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:33,008
What happened to 1....

2022
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,275
They don't have
an opal specialist.

2023
01:30:34,277 --> 01:30:36,841
- My guy at the AGL says...
- $200,000?

2024
01:30:36,843 --> 01:30:40,674
...500 just based off the
pictures, so listen, 20%,

2025
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:42,475
I'll give you
for the winning bid.

2026
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:43,875
Be a partner with me.

2027
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:46,208
KG is gonna buy it.
It's not a problem.

2028
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,941
This guy is obsessed
with the stone.

2029
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,674
Today was supposed to be about
Aaron meeting KG.

2030
01:30:51,676 --> 01:30:53,442
Mm-hmm, Gooey.

2031
01:30:53,444 --> 01:30:55,408
To show support, that's what
today was supposed to be about.

2032
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,808
Well, this is support.

2033
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,442
This is support like
you've never known.

2034
01:30:58,444 --> 01:31:02,075
Sold to you.
Thank you so much, sir.

2035
01:31:02,077 --> 01:31:06,209
We move on now, ladies and
gentlemen, to lot number 38.

2036
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,610
Lot 38, eh?

2037
01:31:07,612 --> 01:31:10,009
We have a sale-room notice.

2038
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:12,009
I'm required to inform you
all that this fine

2039
01:31:12,011 --> 01:31:13,809
Ethiopian black opal,

2040
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:15,543
presented here
before you all on your left,

2041
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:20,610
my right, is now offered with
a revised estimate of $155,000

2042
01:31:20,612 --> 01:31:23,309
to $225,000 U.S.

2043
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a fine piece,

2044
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,543
a collector's work,

2045
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:31,109
and most importantly, it
is windowed on either side

2046
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,709
to reveal the full spectrum
of its dazzling color

2047
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:37,209
and the pinfire pattern within.

2048
01:31:37,211 --> 01:31:39,076
So with that in mind,
ladies and gentlemen,

2049
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:41,209
my colleagues are ready
and poised on the phones,

2050
01:31:41,211 --> 01:31:43,144
and you're all ready
with your paddles.

2051
01:31:43,146 --> 01:31:46,477
We shall start the bidding now
at $20,000.

2052
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:48,611
$20,000.
$30,000.

2053
01:31:48,613 --> 01:31:49,943
Do I have $40,000?

2054
01:31:49,945 --> 01:31:51,377
$40,000, gentleman's bid.

2055
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:53,010
Pleasure to see you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

2056
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:55,377
$40,000 now.
Do I see $50,000?

2057
01:31:55,379 --> 01:31:58,144
$50,00 now in a new place.
Thank you, sir.

2058
01:31:58,146 --> 01:31:59,577
Pleasure to have you
back, too, sir.

2059
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:00,877
$50,000 now
against you, sir.

2060
01:32:00,879 --> 01:32:02,110
Shall we say $60,000?

2061
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:03,611
$60,000 now
against you, sir.

2062
01:32:03,613 --> 01:32:05,743
$70,000 now
against you, sir.

2063
01:32:05,745 --> 01:32:09,244
- 100 grand.
- $100,000 now.

2064
01:32:09,246 --> 01:32:12,077
Bid with you, sir, and a great
place, a big, bold,

2065
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:15,943
giant leap for a big, bold,
giant leaper at $100,000 now.

2066
01:32:15,945 --> 01:32:17,377
It's not longer yours, sir.

2067
01:32:17,379 --> 01:32:18,611
It's against you, sir.

2068
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,078
Going to try one more, sir?

2069
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,978
I will even break an ink
with you, sir.

2070
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:25,011
Can I urge you to consider
a bid of $105,000, sir?

2071
01:32:25,013 --> 01:32:27,512
Come on, sir.
Are you sure?

2072
01:32:27,514 --> 01:32:29,311
Positive?
No further?

2073
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:31,011
A defiant nod then.

2074
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:33,044
Looking then for $110,000,
the room.

2075
01:32:33,046 --> 01:32:35,044
It's $100,000 now.

2076
01:32:35,046 --> 01:32:36,245
Is there any further bidding?

2077
01:32:36,247 --> 01:32:37,811
$110,000 now.

2078
01:32:37,813 --> 01:32:39,211
Welcome back, sir.

2079
01:32:39,213 --> 01:32:40,844
$110,000 now.
Once again against you, sir.

2080
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:41,978
Shall we try $120,000?

2081
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,311
$120,000.
Try one more, sir?

2082
01:32:44,313 --> 01:32:46,911
Let's try $130,000?
$130,000 now?

2083
01:32:46,913 --> 01:32:49,844
To try $140,000?
$140,000.

2084
01:32:49,846 --> 01:32:52,445
Come on, sir.
Let's up it again to $150,000.

2085
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:55,677
Try one more and $150,000.
Now longer yours, sir.

2086
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,479
To try $160,000?
$160,000 now.

2087
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,179
Back against you again, sir.

2088
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:02,812
Can we try one more
at $170,000?

2089
01:33:02,814 --> 01:33:05,446
$170,000 now.
Say $180,000?

2090
01:33:05,448 --> 01:33:06,613
Say $180,000, sir?

2091
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:07,945
We agreed on $175,000.

2092
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:09,745
- $180,000 now.
- It's fine.

2093
01:33:09,747 --> 01:33:12,045
Bid back against you, sir.

2094
01:33:12,047 --> 01:33:14,712
I'm looking for $190,000.

2095
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:18,412
$190,000 is bid.

2096
01:33:18,414 --> 01:33:21,346
Against you, sir, $190,000.

2097
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:24,879
- Confer with your advisor now.
- I am serious.

2098
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:27,845
It's okay.
I need this stone.

2099
01:33:27,847 --> 01:33:30,179
Move this up any higher,
any further?

2100
01:33:30,181 --> 01:33:31,479
Relax. Relax.

2101
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,080
It's a last chance
for you, sir.

2102
01:33:33,082 --> 01:33:34,213
- Are you serious?
- I have to move this along.

2103
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:36,779
We have a good bid at $190,000.

2104
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:40,213
I'm looking for $200,000,
sir.

2105
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:45,280
Going to move this up
any higher, any further?

2106
01:33:45,282 --> 01:33:46,746
You sure, sir?

2107
01:33:46,748 --> 01:33:48,547
Last chance, fair warning.

2108
01:33:48,549 --> 01:33:53,113
It's with you, sir, at $190,000,
against the phones,

2109
01:33:53,115 --> 01:33:55,480
against the rest of the room.

2110
01:33:55,482 --> 01:34:00,646
Sold to you, sir, at $190,000.
Thank you so much.

2111
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:03,815
Thank you, sir, paddle 172.

2112
01:34:09,816 --> 01:34:13,747
- Howard.
- Gooey, I'm so Goddamn sorry.

2113
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:16,414
Shh.
Thank you very much.

2114
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:18,381
I... I'm sorry.

2115
01:34:18,383 --> 01:34:20,914
Listen. I...

2116
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,348
I'm supposed to be
on 48th street.

2117
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:24,914
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's 190 grand, Howard.

2118
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:27,047
- Yes, that's temporary.
- It's 190 grand.

2119
01:34:27,049 --> 01:34:29,581
That's temporary.
Hey, I'm sorry.

2120
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,881
I got to tell you I was going
to stop pressing him

2121
01:34:31,883 --> 01:34:33,281
- once we got past $200,000.
- Yeah, yeah.

2122
01:34:33,283 --> 01:34:34,747
Did I not tell you
that was gonna happen?

2123
01:34:34,749 --> 01:34:35,747
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- So now what?

2124
01:34:35,749 --> 01:34:37,214
I'm sorry. I'll...

2125
01:34:37,216 --> 01:34:38,680
So your money is going
to go into my account,

2126
01:34:38,682 --> 01:34:39,914
and I'll wire it
right back to you.

2127
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,314
Including you owe me 20%.

2128
01:34:41,316 --> 01:34:42,947
Absolutely.
It comes right out of my pocket.

2129
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:44,680
That is nearly 38 grand,
Howard.

2130
01:34:44,682 --> 01:34:46,214
- I... I know that.
- That's 38 grand.

2131
01:34:46,216 --> 01:34:48,048
Okay, so I'm gonna need
a couple weeks on that,

2132
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,582
but it'll be done.
I promise you.

2133
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:51,015
Alright. Aaron, let's go.
Come on.

2134
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:52,681
Dad, I got like
six autographs.

2135
01:34:52,683 --> 01:34:53,848
- Now.
- Alright.

2136
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:55,415
See you, Gooey.

2137
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:57,249
You got the autographs.
That's great.

2138
01:34:57,251 --> 01:35:00,349
- Yeah, great.
- Wasn't Garnett a champ?

2139
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:02,982
- Hey, don't be mad at me, okay.
- Get in. Get in.

2140
01:35:02,984 --> 01:35:05,915
Please?
Please don't be mad.

2141
01:35:05,917 --> 01:35:07,315
Come on.
Can I get the opal?

2142
01:35:07,317 --> 01:35:09,115
- Let me get the opal.
- What for?

2143
01:35:09,117 --> 01:35:11,449
- Because I got to sell that.
- Take the fucking opal.

2144
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:14,215
- Yes, all right. Okay, thanks.
- Close the door.

2145
01:35:14,217 --> 01:35:16,616
Get them going.
Open the fucking door.

2146
01:35:16,618 --> 01:35:19,315
What's he waiting for you for?

2147
01:35:19,317 --> 01:35:21,748
Okay, all right.

2148
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,782
I know. I know.
I know.

2149
01:35:24,784 --> 01:35:26,150
I know.
Let him go.

2150
01:35:26,152 --> 01:35:28,216
Let him go, and then we'll talk.

2151
01:35:28,218 --> 01:35:29,649
- The fuck was that?
- Alright.

2152
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:30,949
I fucked up.
I fucked up.

2153
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:32,716
It was a mistake.
Alright? I know it.

2154
01:35:32,718 --> 01:35:35,350
I admit it.
I got to... got to just...

2155
01:35:35,352 --> 01:35:38,083
Let's hit pause
for one fucking second.

2156
01:35:38,085 --> 01:35:41,083
Got to call Kevin because I know
he fucking wants it,

2157
01:35:41,085 --> 01:35:44,083
and you saw
he's got the $175,000.

2158
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:47,150
And then everything
will be copacetic.

2159
01:35:47,152 --> 01:35:48,716
Alright?

2160
01:35:48,718 --> 01:35:50,250
KG, it's me.

2161
01:35:50,252 --> 01:35:52,682
I got great news for you.
I...

2162
01:35:52,684 --> 01:35:56,517
Hello?
Hello?

2163
01:35:56,519 --> 01:35:58,716
No one on the fucking phone.

2164
01:35:58,718 --> 01:36:00,816
I... If you just give me
two fucking...

2165
01:36:00,818 --> 01:36:02,618
Shut the fuck up.

2166
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,351
You're lucky there's people
around here, you prick.

2167
01:36:04,353 --> 01:36:05,817
Come on. Get out of here.
Let's go.

2168
01:36:05,819 --> 01:36:07,618
Hey, fucking...

2169
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:20,086
Hey.
Hey.

2170
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,750
Arno, Arno.

2171
01:36:24,752 --> 01:36:26,251
Just listen to me, please.

2172
01:36:26,253 --> 01:36:29,050
I spoke...
I spoke to Demany.

2173
01:36:29,052 --> 01:36:31,884
Remember Demany?
He's a business friend of mine.

2174
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:33,451
He gave me the fucking number.

2175
01:36:33,453 --> 01:36:35,950
That's enough, Howard.
It's fucking enough.

2176
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:39,218
Why are you being
so thick-headed and...

2177
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,784
Fuck you, man.
Suck my dick.

2178
01:36:40,786 --> 01:36:42,452
Throw him in the fucking water.

2179
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,619
Where the fuck
are my glasses?

2180
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:02,651
Fuck. Where are they?

2181
01:37:41,054 --> 01:37:42,952
Got the Versace for how...

2182
01:37:42,954 --> 01:37:45,752
I don't know if this is
a $400 value.

2183
01:37:45,754 --> 01:37:47,852
Maybe $250.

2184
01:37:47,854 --> 01:37:49,986
- Howard!
- Forget about Howard.

2185
01:38:17,389 --> 01:38:19,487
- Howard, Joseph...
- I'm not feeling good.

2186
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:22,686
- Are you okay? What's wrong?
- I don't want to work.

2187
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:23,820
Send everybody home.

2188
01:38:23,822 --> 01:38:25,287
Alright, sweetie.

2189
01:39:06,056 --> 01:39:08,623
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.

2190
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,222
What is it?

2191
01:39:10,224 --> 01:39:11,955
I just wanted to see
how the auction went.

2192
01:39:11,957 --> 01:39:13,922
Terrible.
I don't...

2193
01:39:13,924 --> 01:39:15,655
I don't want to talk about it.

2194
01:39:15,657 --> 01:39:20,122
Okay, well, Damien and Joseph
brought this amazing sweatsuit

2195
01:39:20,124 --> 01:39:22,022
that I think would look
so nice on you.

2196
01:39:22,024 --> 01:39:23,422
Do you want to see it?

2197
01:39:23,424 --> 01:39:25,389
Just leave me alone, please?

2198
01:39:25,391 --> 01:39:27,124
Come on, Howard.

2199
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:30,722
Don't... Don't look at me.

2200
01:39:30,724 --> 01:39:33,055
Oh, my God, Howard.

2201
01:39:33,057 --> 01:39:35,556
- Don't look at me.
- What the fuck happened to you?

2202
01:39:35,558 --> 01:39:37,222
Don't look at me, please.

2203
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:43,323
I don't know what I'm thinking.

2204
01:39:43,325 --> 01:39:45,789
I don't know what
everybody is...

2205
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,990
It's not ever going right.

2206
01:39:47,992 --> 01:39:49,624
I know. I know.

2207
01:39:49,626 --> 01:39:50,956
I'm so sad.

2208
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:53,257
I'm so fucked up.

2209
01:39:53,259 --> 01:39:55,490
I'm so fucked up.

2210
01:39:55,492 --> 01:39:57,758
Hey, I'm really upset, too.

2211
01:40:01,425 --> 01:40:03,423
I'm sorry if this has anything
to do with me,

2212
01:40:03,425 --> 01:40:05,756
but I swear I really
didn't do anything.

2213
01:40:05,758 --> 01:40:08,157
I wish you were nicer
to me though.

2214
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:11,524
It was not nice
what you did to me.

2215
01:40:11,526 --> 01:40:13,223
I try, but it's really hard.

2216
01:40:13,225 --> 01:40:16,257
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

2217
01:40:16,259 --> 01:40:18,023
I don't have any place to go.

2218
01:40:18,025 --> 01:40:20,090
I don't have anywhere
to get better.

2219
01:40:20,092 --> 01:40:24,291
But you do, like, really,
Howard?

2220
01:40:24,293 --> 01:40:27,458
You're my home.
You could come to me.

2221
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:29,391
I can't figure it out.

2222
01:40:29,393 --> 01:40:32,024
I can't figure out
what I'm supposed to do.

2223
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,091
Everything I do,
it's not going right.

2224
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:35,924
Everything I do,
it's not going right,

2225
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:37,491
and I don't know what to do.

2226
01:40:37,493 --> 01:40:40,191
I really don't, and I want
anymore of this shit.

2227
01:40:40,193 --> 01:40:42,891
I really don't.
I got to figure this out.

2228
01:40:42,893 --> 01:40:45,657
I got to figure this out.
I really do.

2229
01:40:45,659 --> 01:40:47,558
Well, I got something
if you want,

2230
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,757
but you can't make fun of me.

2231
01:40:49,759 --> 01:40:52,124
What?

2232
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:54,458
My God, it's so stupid,
but I don't know.

2233
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,891
I got it.

2234
01:40:55,893 --> 01:40:57,958
I thought it would make you
feel better.

2235
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,860
Look.
Unzip my skirt.

2236
01:41:02,161 --> 01:41:04,860
Not like that,
just unzip my skirt.

2237
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,225
It says "Howie."

2238
01:41:09,227 --> 01:41:11,559
What did you do?
Why would you...

2239
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:15,758
- You don't like it?
- No, I do. I'm not worth it.

2240
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,992
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not worth it.

2241
01:41:16,994 --> 01:41:18,492
- You are worth it.
- I don't...

2242
01:41:18,494 --> 01:41:20,025
- Look, Howie.
- You... I don't deserve this.

2243
01:41:20,027 --> 01:41:21,958
I'm so crazy about you.
Yes, you do.

2244
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,725
- I love you.
- No, no.

2245
01:41:23,727 --> 01:41:25,159
- Yeah.
- You're gonna...

2246
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:26,691
you can't even
get buried with me now.

2247
01:41:26,693 --> 01:41:27,992
Oh, it's okay.

2248
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:34,326
Oh, this fucking guy.

2249
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,959
Do not let him in.
Understand me?

2250
01:41:36,961 --> 01:41:40,393
Just ignore him.
Ignore him, Joey.

2251
01:41:43,362 --> 01:41:46,126
Ah, here.
Let's get you cleaned up.

2252
01:41:46,128 --> 01:41:47,893
It's not broken, right?

2253
01:41:47,895 --> 01:41:49,326
You don't think it's broken,
right?

2254
01:41:49,328 --> 01:41:51,993
- I don't know.
- This is crazy.

2255
01:41:51,995 --> 01:41:54,295
You can't be out here
looking like this.

2256
01:41:56,395 --> 01:41:58,026
Oh.

2257
01:42:00,794 --> 01:42:03,360
Can you answer that?

2258
01:42:03,362 --> 01:42:04,792
- Hello?
- Oh, hi.

2259
01:42:04,794 --> 01:42:06,493
This is Liz.
I work with Kevin.

2260
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:08,026
I'm actually looking for Howard.

2261
01:42:08,028 --> 01:42:10,059
- This is Howard.
- Hi, yes.

2262
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:12,827
I got your message from Demany
about the gem.

2263
01:42:12,829 --> 01:42:14,860
We're at the bank right now.

2264
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:18,427
- Did... So does he want it?
- Yes, yes.

2265
01:42:18,429 --> 01:42:20,860
Kevin is still interested.
We could actually be...

2266
01:42:20,862 --> 01:42:23,327
It's like we discussed, right?

2267
01:42:23,329 --> 01:42:26,660
- It's still $175,000, right?
- Yes.

2268
01:42:26,662 --> 01:42:28,127
- In cash?
- Yes, in cash.

2269
01:42:28,129 --> 01:42:29,693
Like I said.
We're at the bank right now.

2270
01:42:29,695 --> 01:42:31,927
- You tell him we're at the bank?
- Kevin, yes. I told him.

2271
01:42:31,929 --> 01:42:33,394
- Howard, Howard...
- Okay, okay.

2272
01:42:33,396 --> 01:42:36,361
I got to go. I'll see you
soon. Bye-bye.

2273
01:42:36,363 --> 01:42:39,594
See? I told you.

2274
01:42:39,596 --> 01:42:43,094
Arno, listen.
No bullshit.

2275
01:42:43,096 --> 01:42:46,027
Kevin Garnett
is coming to my office right now

2276
01:42:46,029 --> 01:42:48,861
with $175,000 cash.

2277
01:42:48,863 --> 01:42:51,562
Alright?
You said I got till Monday?

2278
01:42:51,564 --> 01:42:53,028
Today is still Monday,

2279
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,262
so I don't know
if you're hearing this.

2280
01:42:55,264 --> 01:42:56,794
But, Arno, this is real.

2281
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:58,428
Kevin is really on the way.

2282
01:42:58,430 --> 01:42:59,961
He was just at the bank.

2283
01:42:59,963 --> 01:43:01,562
Come get your money, buddy.

2284
01:43:01,564 --> 01:43:03,995
- I need the Celtic ring back.
- What happened to Friday?

2285
01:43:03,997 --> 01:43:05,828
- I know. I know.
- It's Monday, Howie.

2286
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,162
- I know what we said.
- What did we say?

2287
01:43:07,164 --> 01:43:08,961
But it was a short
week, Pesach.

2288
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:10,328
What happened to your face?

2289
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:12,961
- Car accident, okay?
- What do you need?

2290
01:43:12,963 --> 01:43:15,861
So, listen to me.
I need the Celtic ring.

2291
01:43:15,863 --> 01:43:17,262
I'm gonna give you
the Knicks ring.

2292
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,728
Alright?
You know what that means to me.

2293
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,061
Swap them out, please.

2294
01:43:21,063 --> 01:43:22,362
You've had this Knicks
ring forever.

2295
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:24,362
I just need
the Celtic ring back.

2296
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:26,029
- Alright?
- No, no.

2297
01:43:26,031 --> 01:43:27,463
What do you want to do?
What do you want to do?

2298
01:43:27,465 --> 01:43:28,829
I own that ring right now.

2299
01:43:28,831 --> 01:43:29,962
No, I know you do,
and I'm gonna...

2300
01:43:29,964 --> 01:43:31,329
So I'll swap you the two rings,

2301
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:33,163
but I'm gonna put
a 15% VIG on this one.

2302
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,862
And if you're not here
by Friday,

2303
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:36,862
it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

2304
01:43:36,864 --> 01:43:38,530
You're gonna have
a third ring.

2305
01:43:38,532 --> 01:43:40,163
You're not gonna have to worry
about that. Make it a 16%.

2306
01:43:40,165 --> 01:43:41,729
I'm sorry I fucked you,
but I have...

2307
01:43:41,731 --> 01:43:43,296
Bubbie, what's going on?
You okay?

2308
01:43:43,298 --> 01:43:45,630
It's... I'm very good.
Everything is going good.

2309
01:43:45,632 --> 01:43:46,762
- Yeah?
- I promise you.

2310
01:43:46,764 --> 01:43:48,898
I promise you.

2311
01:43:53,498 --> 01:43:55,396
Hey, there he is.

2312
01:43:55,398 --> 01:43:58,296
KG, don't you got
a game tonight?

2313
01:43:58,298 --> 01:44:00,496
I got your chip right here.

2314
01:44:00,498 --> 01:44:01,862
Alright?
Game night.

2315
01:44:01,864 --> 01:44:03,197
- We've really got to go.
- You must be Liz.

2316
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,030
Can we make this quick?

2317
01:44:05,032 --> 01:44:07,130
Yeah, we're gonna make
it quick. Absolutely.

2318
01:44:07,132 --> 01:44:10,297
Julia, let's get these guys
some Powerades.

2319
01:44:10,299 --> 01:44:12,364
Powerades?
Water? Anything else?

2320
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:14,963
It's fine. I'm okay.
It's okay. Yeah, I'm good.

2321
01:44:14,965 --> 01:44:16,763
You like it cold.
You know that.

2322
01:44:16,765 --> 01:44:18,063
Howie, let me get a second
with you, okay?

2323
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:19,497
Yeah, sure, sure. Alright.

2324
01:44:19,499 --> 01:44:21,063
Kevin, you need to be
wheels-up at 8:00.

2325
01:44:21,065 --> 01:44:23,364
I got it.
Give me two seconds.

2326
01:44:23,366 --> 01:44:25,264
Kevin, we need to be there
in less than 1 hour.

2327
01:44:25,266 --> 01:44:27,230
Let me holler at you, man.
What the fuck is going on, man?

2328
01:44:27,232 --> 01:44:28,763
Ever since I met you, man,
you've been giving me

2329
01:44:28,765 --> 01:44:30,464
the run-around
with everything, man.

2330
01:44:30,466 --> 01:44:31,930
What do you mean?

2331
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,230
And I feel like you're fucking
with my emotions.

2332
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:34,830
You just playing with me
at some point.

2333
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:36,464
This hasn't been straight
since I came here.

2334
01:44:36,466 --> 01:44:38,264
- You understand?
- Why you saying that?

2335
01:44:38,266 --> 01:44:39,864
I borrowed the opal.
It's just one thing, you know?

2336
01:44:39,866 --> 01:44:41,565
I come back over here.
I brought it back.

2337
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,331
Howard, I brought it back.
I didn't have to bring it back.

2338
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:44,797
You know, I show up
at the auction.

2339
01:44:44,799 --> 01:44:46,064
You had somebody bid against me?

2340
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:47,298
All these fucking games,
like...

2341
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,165
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

2342
01:44:49,167 --> 01:44:50,498
Like, you don't know...
You don't think I know this?

2343
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,864
You don't think
I know none of this?

2344
01:44:51,866 --> 01:44:53,598
It's complicated, KG.

2345
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,231
You see this face?
You see this?

2346
01:44:55,233 --> 01:44:57,864
Man, there's $165,000
right here cash.

2347
01:44:57,866 --> 01:45:00,198
I'm showing you because
it's... it wasn't easy, man.

2348
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,764
6% goes to Demany.
I've already taken it out.

2349
01:45:02,766 --> 01:45:04,298
Alright. I guess.
I guess that's fair.

2350
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,831
Let me get the fucking opal,
man.

2351
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,265
Let me get the fuck
up out of here.

2352
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:09,265
This opal, this opal
is very valuable for you.

2353
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:10,964
- Absolutely.
- Okay? I did that.

2354
01:45:10,966 --> 01:45:12,931
Let me get the fuck
out of this...

2355
01:45:12,933 --> 01:45:15,797
I respect you. I respect your
passion. Okay?

2356
01:45:15,799 --> 01:45:16,965
I always have.

2357
01:45:16,967 --> 01:45:18,999
I thought you was
a fan, too, man.

2358
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:21,199
- I'm a fucking huge fan.
- What did you pay for this?

2359
01:45:21,201 --> 01:45:22,865
Real shit, what did you pay
for this right here?

2360
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:25,732
That's not a fair question,
Kevin. Alright?

2361
01:45:25,734 --> 01:45:27,965
This... We're talking months
and months of fucking my time.

2362
01:45:27,967 --> 01:45:29,232
I'm not gonna take
the money back

2363
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:30,999
when I did the deal now.
I'm just saying.

2364
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:32,599
Straight up, straight up me
and you, mano a mano,

2365
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:35,132
how much did you pay for this?

2366
01:45:35,134 --> 01:45:38,065
Fucking what'd I pay?
I paid a... that's...

2367
01:45:38,067 --> 01:45:40,698
this is... that's...
I'm telling you.

2368
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:43,599
If I answer that question,
it's very misleading.

2369
01:45:43,601 --> 01:45:44,865
- Why?
- It's...

2370
01:45:44,867 --> 01:45:46,432
I paid 100 grand, okay?

2371
01:45:46,434 --> 01:45:48,965
- So you doubled your money?
- I'm the joke here.

2372
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:50,432
Alright?
I got fucked.

2373
01:45:50,434 --> 01:45:53,032
A million dollars is what
I was supposed to get.

2374
01:45:53,034 --> 01:45:56,833
I get a fucking what?
Made 65 G's?

2375
01:45:56,835 --> 01:45:59,333
You gave some niggas
from Ethiopia 100 grand

2376
01:45:59,335 --> 01:46:01,534
for something you thought
was worth $1 million.

2377
01:46:01,536 --> 01:46:03,233
You don't see nothing wrong
with that, Howard?

2378
01:46:03,235 --> 01:46:04,400
Ethiopian miners?

2379
01:46:04,402 --> 01:46:06,133
You know what these
fucking guys make?

2380
01:46:06,135 --> 01:46:09,666
100 grand is 50 lifetimes
for these fucking guys.

2381
01:46:09,668 --> 01:46:11,133
A million dollars is more
is my point.

2382
01:46:11,135 --> 01:46:12,634
- You understand?
- Well, do you want to win

2383
01:46:12,636 --> 01:46:15,333
by one point
or fucking 30 points, KG?

2384
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:17,966
Right? I see you out there
when the fucking stadium

2385
01:46:17,968 --> 01:46:19,500
is all booing you.

2386
01:46:19,502 --> 01:46:22,900
You're 30 up.
You're still going full-tilt.

2387
01:46:22,902 --> 01:46:24,300
Let's see what Vegas...
What does Vegas

2388
01:46:24,302 --> 01:46:26,267
got you guys at today?
Take a look.

2389
01:46:26,269 --> 01:46:28,033
- Let's see.
- Are you serious?

2390
01:46:28,035 --> 01:46:29,066
You gonna pull this up
right here?

2391
01:46:29,068 --> 01:46:30,767
Look at this shit.

2392
01:46:30,769 --> 01:46:32,934
The Sixers are supposed to win
the game tonight they think.

2393
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:34,234
I don't keep track of none
of that shit.

2394
01:46:34,236 --> 01:46:36,067
They think on game seven,
you're not gonna

2395
01:46:36,069 --> 01:46:38,168
get fucking 18 points.

2396
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,867
They don't think you're going
to get eight rebounds?

2397
01:46:39,869 --> 01:46:41,168
These guys don't know
shit about ball.

2398
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,700
What the fuck are they doing?

2399
01:46:42,702 --> 01:46:44,601
Doesn't that make you want
to fucking kill them?

2400
01:46:44,603 --> 01:46:47,268
Doesn't that make you want to
say, "Fuck you for doubting me"?

2401
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:49,501
Doesn't that make you want
to step on fucking

2402
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:52,168
Elton Brand's fucking neck?

2403
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:53,501
Come on, KG.

2404
01:46:53,503 --> 01:46:55,201
This is no different than that.

2405
01:46:55,203 --> 01:46:56,268
This is me.

2406
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:58,134
Alright?
I'm not a fucking athlete.

2407
01:46:58,136 --> 01:47:00,667
This is my fucking way.
This is how I win.

2408
01:47:00,669 --> 01:47:01,967
Alright?

2409
01:47:01,969 --> 01:47:04,201
All the fucking hard work I do,

2410
01:47:04,203 --> 01:47:07,301
all the fucking ass kicking
and the dues I pay?

2411
01:47:07,303 --> 01:47:11,102
You're not gonna score
on the big one on game seven?

2412
01:47:11,104 --> 01:47:14,035
Fuck these people, right?
That's how you feel.

2413
01:47:14,037 --> 01:47:16,404
I know you do, so look.

2414
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:20,902
Let's fucking bet on this.

2415
01:47:20,904 --> 01:47:24,169
Let's bet on this shit.

2416
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:28,169
I'm fucking gonna bet all
this money on you tonight, KG.

2417
01:47:28,171 --> 01:47:29,502
You're here to win, KG.

2418
01:47:29,504 --> 01:47:31,502
These fuckers don't know.

2419
01:47:31,504 --> 01:47:32,801
Them out fucking west?

2420
01:47:32,803 --> 01:47:34,569
Do you think
they fucking know you?

2421
01:47:34,571 --> 01:47:37,235
They don't know you.
They don't know us.

2422
01:47:37,237 --> 01:47:39,202
It's about fucking winning.

2423
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:43,569
It's about you, and I saw
your fucking conviction,

2424
01:47:43,571 --> 01:47:48,303
your fucking honesty
and your fucking magic.

2425
01:47:48,305 --> 01:47:50,003
Howie, you're talking
crazy, man.

2426
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:51,669
Listen.
You even understand

2427
01:47:51,671 --> 01:47:53,936
how fucking great of a game
you're gonna have tonight?

2428
01:47:53,938 --> 01:47:55,436
- I know it.
- Listen.

2429
01:47:55,438 --> 01:47:59,203
We're a team tonight, KG.
This is a fucking lock.

2430
01:47:59,205 --> 01:48:01,869
It's a fucking feeling.
We both have it.

2431
01:48:01,871 --> 01:48:04,836
They don't know.
You and I know.

2432
01:48:04,838 --> 01:48:07,470
- Alright?
- Nice fucking trim.

2433
01:48:15,138 --> 01:48:17,036
Hey, do you mind
watching the space

2434
01:48:17,038 --> 01:48:18,603
while I run to the bathroom?

2435
01:48:18,605 --> 01:48:20,203
- Sure.
- Thank you.

2436
01:48:20,205 --> 01:48:22,070
Can I leave you guys
alone in here?

2437
01:48:22,072 --> 01:48:24,870
- Go ahead and do your business.
- Do you want company?

2438
01:48:24,872 --> 01:48:26,870
I don't think so,
but next time maybe.

2439
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:32,803
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm looking for Howard.

2440
01:48:32,805 --> 01:48:34,937
I don't know where he is.
I'm sorry. We're closed.

2441
01:48:34,939 --> 01:48:36,404
He gave me
a fucking fake Rolex.

2442
01:48:36,406 --> 01:48:38,237
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not getting suckered.

2443
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:39,770
Sir, please calm down. I don't
know anything about that.

2444
01:48:39,772 --> 01:48:41,371
Well, let me talk to you
about this.

2445
01:48:41,373 --> 01:48:42,937
You got to help me.

2446
01:48:42,939 --> 01:48:44,770
This is gonna be one
of the best nights

2447
01:48:44,772 --> 01:48:46,271
of our fucking lives.

2448
01:48:46,273 --> 01:48:48,237
Howard. Howard?

2449
01:48:53,939 --> 01:48:57,538
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

2450
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:58,971
Where are you?

2451
01:48:58,973 --> 01:49:00,138
Howard, what the fuck
is going on?

2452
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,605
- Take this.
- What is this?

2453
01:49:01,607 --> 01:49:02,704
I need you to listen
to me carefully.

2454
01:49:02,706 --> 01:49:04,205
I booked you on a blade, okay?

2455
01:49:04,207 --> 01:49:06,438
You're gonna land on top
of the Mohegan Sun.

2456
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,639
- Okay?
- There's a bet in that bag.

2457
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:11,971
I want you to take all of it,
all of it inside the bag,

2458
01:49:11,973 --> 01:49:13,305
and place it on that bet.

2459
01:49:13,307 --> 01:49:14,938
- How much is in the bag?
- There's a lot.

2460
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,372
I don't want you
to think about that. Alright?

2461
01:49:17,374 --> 01:49:19,138
I don't even want you to look
at it until you get there

2462
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:20,838
and you take it out
and give it to the teller.

2463
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,605
- You understand me?
- Okay, okay. I got it. I got it.

2464
01:49:22,607 --> 01:49:24,272
I'm gonna fuck the living
shit out of you tonight.

2465
01:49:24,274 --> 01:49:25,838
- You know that?
- I wish I could kiss you.

2466
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,605
Alright. You got to go.
You get going.

2467
01:49:28,607 --> 01:49:30,438
Alright. Love you. Bye.

2468
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:42,206
Alright.
Let's get this over with.

2469
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:45,173
Arno, you're never going
to believe this shit.

2470
01:49:45,175 --> 01:49:46,306
Believe what?

2471
01:49:46,308 --> 01:49:48,173
We're about to hit
so Goddamn big.

2472
01:49:48,175 --> 01:49:50,772
KG was just here.
You saw him, right?

2473
01:49:50,774 --> 01:49:52,373
I gave him the gem.

2474
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:54,872
He's gonna fuck up
the moneyline so bad tonight.

2475
01:49:54,874 --> 01:49:56,772
Howard, where's
the money right now?

2476
01:49:56,774 --> 01:49:58,139
It's on the way right now.

2477
01:49:58,141 --> 01:49:59,805
- It's on the way to the casino.
- What?

2478
01:49:59,807 --> 01:50:02,306
What the fuck are you talking
about, Howard?

2479
01:50:02,308 --> 01:50:04,306
- The fuck is going on in there?
- Where is that girl?

2480
01:50:04,308 --> 01:50:05,972
The girl that went
to the bathroom.

2481
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:07,573
I ain't seen her.
She didn't get back here?

2482
01:50:07,575 --> 01:50:09,072
- No.
- What are you not getting?

2483
01:50:09,074 --> 01:50:10,640
No, no, no, no.
It's in this room right now.

2484
01:50:10,642 --> 01:50:13,140
Go get her now.
Bring her back.

2485
01:50:13,142 --> 01:50:14,574
- Hey, hands up.
- Open the fucking door.

2486
01:50:14,576 --> 01:50:15,706
- Hit the button.
- For what?

2487
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:17,007
What am I opening the door for?

2488
01:50:17,009 --> 01:50:18,040
Somebody fucking just
buzz me out.

2489
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:19,107
I got it. I got it.

2490
01:50:19,109 --> 01:50:20,541
What are they doing?

2491
01:50:20,543 --> 01:50:22,973
- I got this. I got this.
- You're saying what?

2492
01:50:22,975 --> 01:50:24,641
Take your hands off me.

2493
01:50:24,643 --> 01:50:26,440
- What are you talking about?
- What the fuck are we doing?

2494
01:50:26,442 --> 01:50:28,274
It's gonna make sense
in about 2 fucking minutes.

2495
01:50:28,276 --> 01:50:30,040
You're gonna listen to what...
I'm listening to you.

2496
01:50:30,042 --> 01:50:31,740
You're gonna do
what I tell you to do.

2497
01:50:31,742 --> 01:50:33,107
Listen, you fucking goon.

2498
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:35,007
I'm telling you
something good right now.

2499
01:50:35,009 --> 01:50:36,673
Alright. Listen to me.

2500
01:50:43,708 --> 01:50:45,673
Shut the fuck up.

2501
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:52,175
Hey! Come on. Come on.
Come on.

2502
01:50:52,177 --> 01:50:54,841
No, no, no!

2503
01:50:57,577 --> 01:51:00,141
We're gonna let him go.

2504
01:51:00,143 --> 01:51:02,807
- You gonna call her?
- I'll call. I'll call for you.

2505
01:51:02,809 --> 01:51:04,308
Are you gonna get
that bitch down here now?

2506
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,475
I promise.

2507
01:51:05,477 --> 01:51:07,310
Alright. Come on. Come on.
Get him up.

2508
01:51:09,644 --> 01:51:11,141
Listen.
Listen to me.

2509
01:51:11,143 --> 01:51:14,108
Get yourself together.
Alright?

2510
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:16,175
I want you to make that call.
Come here.

2511
01:51:16,177 --> 01:51:19,308
Give me a fucking second,
please.

2512
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:21,908
You got plenty of time
after you make the call.

2513
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,974
- My heart.
- Call this girl up.

2514
01:51:23,976 --> 01:51:25,674
I want her back here now.

2515
01:51:29,645 --> 01:51:31,842
She's at Mohegan Sun.

2516
01:51:31,844 --> 01:51:34,742
Yeah. Here, come on. Let's go.

2517
01:51:34,744 --> 01:51:35,808
Put it on speaker.

2518
01:51:40,211 --> 01:51:41,409
There we go.

2519
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:46,877
This motherfucker...

2520
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,844
Come on. Come on.

2521
01:51:57,378 --> 01:51:59,176
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Oh, fucking my God.

2522
01:51:59,178 --> 01:52:00,909
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry.

2523
01:52:00,911 --> 01:52:03,178
I really am.
I am sorry.

2524
01:52:07,745 --> 01:52:09,776
Man, fuck this.

2525
01:52:09,778 --> 01:52:11,510
You're a moron.

2526
01:52:13,546 --> 01:52:15,177
It's not worth it, man.
Put that shit away.

2527
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:17,277
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Buzz us out.

2528
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:19,876
What are you doing? Why am I
buzzing you? Why are you going?

2529
01:52:19,878 --> 01:52:21,277
- Just buzz me the fuck out.
- But... but...

2530
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:22,709
but just watch
the fucking game...

2531
01:52:22,711 --> 01:52:24,076
Buzz me the fuck out.

2532
01:52:24,078 --> 01:52:25,510
...and you'll be happy
with the results.

2533
01:52:25,512 --> 01:52:27,177
I'm telling you now before
I put your head

2534
01:52:27,179 --> 01:52:29,143
- through the fucking glass.
- Alright. Alright.

2535
01:52:29,145 --> 01:52:30,544
I'll buzz you out.
I'll buzz you out.

2536
01:52:30,546 --> 01:52:31,743
Alright?

2537
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,110
Fucking...

2538
01:52:34,112 --> 01:52:37,410
I told you I told him.
Close it.

2539
01:52:37,412 --> 01:52:39,943
Come on.
Buzz me out.

2540
01:52:39,945 --> 01:52:42,578
What are you doing?

2541
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:45,645
Open this fucking door.
Come on.

2542
01:52:47,613 --> 01:52:49,444
Howard, open the door.

2543
01:52:50,879 --> 01:52:52,278
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2544
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:54,077
- I'm not buzzing you out.
- Just listen to me.

2545
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:57,944
Arno, Arno, the Sixers
shouldn't even be there.

2546
01:52:57,946 --> 01:52:59,211
- You understand?
- No, no, no.

2547
01:52:59,213 --> 01:53:01,545
She's at the Mohegan Sun
sports bar.

2548
01:53:01,547 --> 01:53:03,011
Mohegan Sun sports bar.

2549
01:53:03,013 --> 01:53:04,578
- This is at game seven.
- Get over there now.

2550
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:06,777
But you know what she fucking
looks like. Go find her.

2551
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:07,977
They're gonna get
to the Garden in full.

2552
01:53:07,979 --> 01:53:09,578
You fucking under...

2553
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,645
- Howard, open the door.
- I know you're upset, Arno.

2554
01:53:11,647 --> 01:53:13,211
Of course I'm upset.

2555
01:53:13,213 --> 01:53:14,744
I'm trying to fucking make
this all work for you.

2556
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:16,178
Open the fucking door.

2557
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,611
The NBA doesn't want
the Sixers to win.

2558
01:53:17,613 --> 01:53:19,945
They got fucking...
There's no money in that.

2559
01:53:19,947 --> 01:53:21,745
You understand?
The refs know that.

2560
01:53:21,747 --> 01:53:23,112
They want stars.

2561
01:53:23,114 --> 01:53:24,445
Buzz us the fuck out of here,
Howard.

2562
01:53:24,447 --> 01:53:26,012
- Stars get a buck laid.
- Right now.

2563
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:27,479
- Open the fucking door.
- Open it now.

2564
01:53:27,481 --> 01:53:29,479
Hey, hey, hey.
This is fucking bulletproof.

2565
01:53:29,481 --> 01:53:32,245
You're only gonna hurt yourself.
That doesn't work.

2566
01:53:32,247 --> 01:53:34,045
- Phil, Phil, Phil.
- Arno, I'd duck.

2567
01:53:34,047 --> 01:53:36,612
You're gonna get killed.
Listen to me.

2568
01:53:36,614 --> 01:53:37,878
- You motherfucker.
- Thank you.

2569
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,379
Thank you.
I'm talking to Arno.

2570
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:40,678
Enough of you, enough.

2571
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,912
You got to open
this fucking door.

2572
01:53:41,914 --> 01:53:43,579
- Listen to me.
- I got something.

2573
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:45,245
Do you realize all you got
to do is get the opening tip.

2574
01:53:45,247 --> 01:53:47,078
Fucking buzz
that fucking thing open.

2575
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:49,145
We're gonna get...
You know how many rebounds

2576
01:53:49,147 --> 01:53:51,711
this guy is gonna get, Arno?

2577
01:53:51,713 --> 01:53:53,745
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

2578
01:53:53,747 --> 01:53:55,679
Who'd you call?
Who did you call?

2579
01:53:55,681 --> 01:53:58,513
Open the fucking door, dick.

2580
01:54:10,748 --> 01:54:12,079
He got us locked in.

2581
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:15,180
Yeah, it's me.
ConEd called the office.

2582
01:54:15,182 --> 01:54:16,979
- There's a fucking leak.
- What leak?

2583
01:54:16,981 --> 01:54:18,346
There's a gas leak on Pinoak.

2584
01:54:18,348 --> 01:54:19,846
Well, for crying
out loud, Howard.

2585
01:54:19,848 --> 01:54:21,413
So they're evacuating
the whole block.

2586
01:54:21,415 --> 01:54:23,413
- Just slow down, okay?
- So get the kids out of there.

2587
01:54:23,415 --> 01:54:25,480
- You're not making any sense.
- You and the kids go to Amy's.

2588
01:54:25,482 --> 01:54:27,213
Well, why would they call
the office and not the...

2589
01:54:27,215 --> 01:54:28,879
I don't know
why they called me. Alright?

2590
01:54:28,881 --> 01:54:30,413
You are not making any
sense, Howard.

2591
01:54:30,415 --> 01:54:32,314
I'm not here to argue
with you, Dinah.

2592
01:54:32,316 --> 01:54:34,880
Get the kids out of the house.
I'm frightened, okay?

2593
01:54:34,882 --> 01:54:36,813
- You're freaking me out.
- Just get out.

2594
01:54:36,815 --> 01:54:39,581
Go to Amy's, and do not
leave there until I get home.

2595
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:40,947
Oh, my God.

2596
01:54:40,949 --> 01:54:42,314
You promise me?
Stay at her house, okay?

2597
01:54:42,316 --> 01:54:43,847
Okay, but you'll
meet us there?

2598
01:54:43,849 --> 01:54:44,980
Let me tell you
something, prick.

2599
01:54:44,982 --> 01:54:46,381
Thank you.
Thank you.

2600
01:54:46,383 --> 01:54:47,847
Open the fucking door.

2601
01:54:47,849 --> 01:54:50,314
Last year
I made $125 million.

2602
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:52,481
I don't even know what to do
with my money anymore.

2603
01:54:52,483 --> 01:54:53,847
I have nobody to spend it with,

2604
01:54:53,849 --> 01:54:55,514
nobody to enjoy my life
with anymore.

2605
01:54:55,516 --> 01:54:57,080
It's horrible.

2606
01:54:57,082 --> 01:54:58,947
Today is a big day for me.
I met you. You're hot.

2607
01:54:58,949 --> 01:55:01,414
You want to have a drink
when we get there?

2608
01:55:32,716 --> 01:55:34,182
Hi.

2609
01:55:34,184 --> 01:55:37,248
Hey, okay, so I'm betting
on the Celtics,

2610
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:39,948
parlay, three-way, money...
I don't know.

2611
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:41,248
Plus tip? Here, you just...

2612
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:42,781
So you want a parlay,
three-way...

2613
01:55:42,783 --> 01:55:43,915
Make sure that when
you put it in,

2614
01:55:43,917 --> 01:55:45,248
it's exactly that, okay?

2615
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:47,116
I will.
How much you want on it?

2616
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:49,882
Okay. I'm not really sure.
You're just gonna have to.

2617
01:55:49,884 --> 01:55:53,149
Oh, okay. Chad?
Okay, just give me a minute.

2618
01:55:53,151 --> 01:55:56,183
I just have to have
my supervisor count this, okay?

2619
01:55:56,185 --> 01:55:59,550
Okay.

2620
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:01,249
- Almost there.
- One second.

2621
01:56:18,784 --> 01:56:22,216
Come on.
Let's go.

2622
01:56:22,218 --> 01:56:23,651
Feeling this?

2623
01:56:23,653 --> 01:56:27,083
Feeling this.
Beautiful.

2624
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:29,950
Number 5...

2625
01:56:29,952 --> 01:56:32,050
This is it, boys.
This is it.

2626
01:56:35,085 --> 01:56:37,017
Go ahead.

2627
01:56:37,019 --> 01:56:38,150
Tell me.

2628
01:56:38,152 --> 01:56:40,417
Okay. Listen.
Listen. Listen.

2629
01:56:40,419 --> 01:56:42,783
Say... say it.
Say the whole ticket out loud.

2630
01:56:42,785 --> 01:56:44,284
I want you to say
it really loud.

2631
01:56:44,286 --> 01:56:46,517
Give me a second.
I want some people to hear it.

2632
01:56:46,519 --> 01:56:47,883
Alright?
Hang on.

2633
01:56:47,885 --> 01:56:50,284
Hang on. Say the whole ticket.
Go ahead.

2634
01:56:50,286 --> 01:56:53,050
I put $155
on the three-way bet.

2635
01:56:53,052 --> 01:56:55,017
Garnett's points
plus his rebounds

2636
01:56:55,019 --> 01:56:56,750
with the Celtics moneyline

2637
01:56:56,752 --> 01:56:59,083
with the Celtics
to win the opening tip.

2638
01:56:59,085 --> 01:57:01,552
Right.
Just read the whole ticket.

2639
01:57:01,554 --> 01:57:04,151
Okay. So it says here...

2640
01:57:04,153 --> 01:57:06,518
- You having a good time?
- Yes.

2641
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,984
...to win $1,225,000...

2642
01:57:09,986 --> 01:57:11,552
Did you fucking hear
that number?

2643
01:57:11,554 --> 01:57:13,817
That's enough.
You don't have to say anymore.

2644
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,051
The bet is in.

2645
01:57:15,053 --> 01:57:16,817
- The bet is in, okay?
- Fuck you.

2646
01:57:16,819 --> 01:57:19,884
I'm taking you to the fucking
Ritz Carlton, the Grand Cayman.

2647
01:57:19,886 --> 01:57:21,851
Alright?
With the fucking Jacuzzi.

2648
01:57:21,853 --> 01:57:23,051
I'm here for it.

2649
01:57:23,053 --> 01:57:24,051
Alright.
Rub that tattoo for me.

2650
01:57:24,053 --> 01:57:25,884
Okay, I love you.

2651
01:57:25,886 --> 01:57:27,351
Okay, here we go.

2652
01:57:27,353 --> 01:57:29,784
We grab this tip,
and we're in business, boys.

2653
01:57:29,786 --> 01:57:31,485
Alright?

2654
01:57:31,487 --> 01:57:32,817
Pound that chest, baby.

2655
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:34,585
This is it.
We got to get this.

2656
01:57:34,587 --> 01:57:35,751
This is right out the gate.

2657
01:57:35,753 --> 01:57:37,653
Right out the gate.

2658
01:57:37,655 --> 01:57:40,553
Come on.
Come on, man.

2659
01:57:40,555 --> 01:57:41,785
Come on.

2660
01:57:41,787 --> 01:57:43,152
Get that tip.

2661
01:57:43,154 --> 01:57:45,885
Let's go.
Get that fucking tip.

2662
01:57:45,887 --> 01:57:47,186
Get that tip.

2663
01:57:52,787 --> 01:57:55,818
Get that!!
Yes, yes!

2664
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:58,852
Fuck, we would have been fucked
if he didn't get that.

2665
01:57:58,854 --> 01:58:00,818
That was the fucking biggest
part of the whole

2666
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,519
Goddamn parlay right there.

2667
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:04,852
That was huge.
I knew he was gonna win that.

2668
01:58:04,854 --> 01:58:07,119
I knew he was gonna win that.

2669
01:58:07,121 --> 01:58:09,087
Alright.
That's it.

2670
01:58:11,621 --> 01:58:13,052
What?
One rebound.

2671
01:58:13,054 --> 01:58:14,886
Go, that's one.
That's fucking one.

2672
01:58:14,888 --> 01:58:16,153
Look at that.
Look at that.

2673
01:58:16,155 --> 01:58:17,786
Right out the fucking gate,
the man.

2674
01:58:17,788 --> 01:58:20,353
The man's feeling this.
Yep.

2675
01:58:20,355 --> 01:58:21,587
Go. Get it. Get it.

2676
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:23,487
Garnett down low...

2677
01:58:23,489 --> 01:58:24,654
Go, go. Finish it.

2678
01:58:24,656 --> 01:58:26,953
Finish it.
Hey, yes.

2679
01:58:26,955 --> 01:58:28,253
Alright.
That's fucking it.

2680
01:58:28,255 --> 01:58:30,020
That's the first shot
of the game.

2681
01:58:30,022 --> 01:58:32,020
He fucking hit it.
That's three now.

2682
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:33,686
Two plus that fucking rebound.

2683
01:58:33,688 --> 01:58:35,153
That's three out of 26.

2684
01:58:35,155 --> 01:58:38,053
Okay, I bet on, um,
I bet on the Celtics,

2685
01:58:38,055 --> 01:58:39,719
specifically Kevin Garnett.

2686
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:41,387
Okay. Two good bets...

2687
01:58:41,389 --> 01:58:44,120
Celtics are winning and Garnett
has got nine and seven,

2688
01:58:44,122 --> 01:58:47,886
so that's 16 right now on your
way to 26, he said, right?

2689
01:58:47,888 --> 01:58:49,487
Oh, my God.
The gorgeous one is here.

2690
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:51,388
- Not even halftime yet?
- Hey, twice in one day.

2691
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,987
I can't believe it.
How are you?

2692
01:58:52,989 --> 01:58:54,754
From the helicopter to here.

2693
01:58:54,756 --> 01:58:57,521
How you doing, baby?
I can't get you out of my mind.

2694
01:58:57,523 --> 01:58:59,188
- I mean...
- You're funny.

2695
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:00,987
Oh, you're hot, baby.
You're definitely hot.

2696
01:59:00,989 --> 01:59:03,254
So what?
You got money on the Celtics?

2697
01:59:03,256 --> 01:59:05,087
- Let me see there.
- Is he gonna shoot?

2698
01:59:05,089 --> 01:59:06,588
- Is that...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2699
01:59:06,590 --> 01:59:07,987
Come on, Garnett.
That one's gonna help.

2700
01:59:07,989 --> 01:59:09,321
Aw, come on, man.
I mean...

2701
01:59:09,323 --> 01:59:11,121
Oh, my God.

2702
01:59:11,123 --> 01:59:12,388
He missed his shot.
Who cares?

2703
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:14,254
I have a great idea,
not for him.

2704
01:59:14,256 --> 01:59:15,687
What's that?

2705
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:17,588
I'd like you to come up
to my room. I hired the chef.

2706
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:21,121
I'm in Penthouse "A,"
and it's gorgeous. Best views.

2707
01:59:21,123 --> 01:59:22,621
I mean, who could ask
for more than that.

2708
01:59:22,623 --> 01:59:24,054
- Thank you.
- I love you, baby.

2709
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:25,354
- Alright.
- I'll see you there.

2710
01:59:25,356 --> 01:59:26,954
- Okay.
- Penthouse "A," the Penny Royal.

2711
01:59:26,956 --> 01:59:29,222
- Yes, got it.
- Okay, baby? Nice.

2712
01:59:29,224 --> 01:59:31,556
Okay, bye.

2713
01:59:31,558 --> 01:59:32,988
- Wow.
- Fucking...

2714
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:34,790
He's like a cartoon.

2715
01:59:38,157 --> 01:59:40,857
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

2716
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:48,755
I got to go.

2717
01:59:48,757 --> 01:59:49,955
What's going on? You need help?

2718
01:59:49,957 --> 01:59:51,289
Thank you so much
for your help.

2719
02:00:08,492 --> 02:00:10,223
This is the beauty of betting.

2720
02:00:10,225 --> 02:00:12,689
This is the beauty of betting,
you know?

2721
02:00:12,691 --> 02:00:14,256
I'm fucking pulling
for the Celtics.

2722
02:00:14,258 --> 02:00:15,756
I'm a Knicks fan.

2723
02:00:15,758 --> 02:00:19,256
If the fucking 12-year-old
version of me saw me right now,

2724
02:00:19,258 --> 02:00:21,056
he'd be like, "What the fuck?"

2725
02:00:21,058 --> 02:00:24,156
Everybody is talking about
this fucking big bet here,

2726
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:25,889
so it's got to be her.

2727
02:00:25,891 --> 02:00:27,456
He's with me.

2728
02:00:27,458 --> 02:00:32,223
We're gonna fucking flat her
and bring her back, boss.

2729
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:33,456
Boss. Absolutely.

2730
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:36,590
I need everyone in here
to lock in.

2731
02:00:36,592 --> 02:00:38,889
KG. Look at KG.
Remember this.

2732
02:00:38,891 --> 02:00:42,356
If you want to go quickly,
do it alone,

2733
02:00:42,358 --> 02:00:46,224
but if you want to go far,
you do it together.

2734
02:00:46,226 --> 02:00:49,057
We're like roaches,
and you can't kill us.

2735
02:00:49,059 --> 02:00:50,224
Quit fucking passing.

2736
02:00:50,226 --> 02:00:52,024
Get it to him.
And another.

2737
02:00:52,026 --> 02:00:53,658
And another.
And shoot.

2738
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:55,424
Shoot.
Shoot.

2739
02:00:55,426 --> 02:00:56,823
Fuck that shit!

2740
02:00:56,825 --> 02:00:58,823
Fucking Doc!

2741
02:00:58,825 --> 02:00:59,990
Fucking threw his rhythm off.

2742
02:00:59,992 --> 02:01:01,857
He took him out of the game.

2743
02:01:01,859 --> 02:01:03,457
Fuck, man.

2744
02:01:03,459 --> 02:01:05,057
That's your fault.

2745
02:01:05,059 --> 02:01:07,457
You see that other guy though,
Phil?

2746
02:01:07,459 --> 02:01:08,890
One of your boys from Boston?

2747
02:01:08,892 --> 02:01:10,524
You got some boys in Boston?

2748
02:01:10,526 --> 02:01:12,924
You'll see what I'm talking...
Hang on.

2749
02:01:12,926 --> 02:01:14,257
This fucker?

2750
02:01:14,259 --> 02:01:15,757
Is that one of your boys,
that fat fuck?

2751
02:01:15,759 --> 02:01:17,090
Looks like you.

2752
02:01:17,092 --> 02:01:20,392
Look like one of your boys.

2753
02:01:20,394 --> 02:01:23,025
That's a fucking rebound.
That's it.

2754
02:01:23,027 --> 02:01:25,425
Three more. Three more.
Way to go.

2755
02:01:25,427 --> 02:01:27,891
What did it say up there?
What is the score?

2756
02:01:27,893 --> 02:01:29,758
- Are they winning?
- They're winning.

2757
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,958
- Another rebound.
- Winning by three points.

2758
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,258
Fuck that shit.
He fucking fouled him.

2759
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:35,691
Doesn't matter.
He grabbed it.

2760
02:01:35,693 --> 02:01:37,258
He had it.
That counts as one.

2761
02:01:37,260 --> 02:01:38,724
Now what are we at?
23?

2762
02:01:38,726 --> 02:01:41,858
Alright.

2763
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,258
Last possession, let's go.

2764
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,492
Pick it up.
Alright. That's it.

2765
02:01:45,494 --> 02:01:46,625
That's it.
Shoot.

2766
02:01:46,627 --> 02:01:47,991
That's it.
Come on.

2767
02:01:47,993 --> 02:01:50,525
Shoot it.
Shoot it.

2768
02:01:50,527 --> 02:01:52,358
Aah!

2769
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:55,592
Oh!
Holy fuck, yeah.

2770
02:01:55,594 --> 02:01:58,126
That fucking guard.

2771
02:01:58,128 --> 02:02:00,593
Just fucking...
That's all the jam.

2772
02:02:00,595 --> 02:02:02,725
It's all the jam.

2773
02:02:02,727 --> 02:02:04,825
That's... We're at 25 now.

2774
02:02:04,827 --> 02:02:07,326
One more.
One more fucking point.

2775
02:02:07,328 --> 02:02:10,560
Either a rebound
or a fucking basket.

2776
02:02:10,562 --> 02:02:11,626
Anything.

2777
02:02:11,628 --> 02:02:14,126
Either one, we fucking got this.

2778
02:02:14,128 --> 02:02:16,692
All right.
One more. Just need one more.

2779
02:02:16,694 --> 02:02:18,326
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

2780
02:02:18,328 --> 02:02:19,526
Come on in.

2781
02:02:19,528 --> 02:02:21,593
- Three times in one day?
- I know.

2782
02:02:21,595 --> 02:02:22,892
- I mean, unbelievable.
- I know.

2783
02:02:22,894 --> 02:02:24,459
And I-I-I can't believe
it's you.

2784
02:02:24,461 --> 02:02:26,092
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Why don't...

2785
02:02:26,094 --> 02:02:27,459
- Why don't we watch the game?
- Oh, yeah, yeah,

2786
02:02:27,461 --> 02:02:29,193
without a doubt.
Go ahead, honey. Sit down.

2787
02:02:29,195 --> 02:02:30,459
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay, how do I...

2788
02:02:30,461 --> 02:02:32,092
Where's the remote
What do I do?

2789
02:02:32,094 --> 02:02:33,426
- Uh, the iPad's over there.
- Okay.

2790
02:02:33,428 --> 02:02:34,993
Do what you got to do
with the iPad.

2791
02:02:34,995 --> 02:02:36,093
Look. I got to take a shower,
okay?

2792
02:02:36,095 --> 02:02:37,627
I really got to take a shower.

2793
02:02:37,629 --> 02:02:39,561
I got to clean up, okay?
I got to get myself washed.

2794
02:02:39,563 --> 02:02:41,793
That plane ride, it got me all
messed up and everything else.

2795
02:02:41,795 --> 02:02:45,860
So what I want you to do...
If that doorbell rings, okay,

2796
02:02:45,862 --> 02:02:47,993
I got my friends, okay,
coming in,

2797
02:02:47,995 --> 02:02:49,693
or I got the food coming,
okay?

2798
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:51,027
- You just answer it, okay?
- Okay.

2799
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:52,227
And let them know.
Okay, baby?

2800
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:53,294
- All right.
- Please.

2801
02:02:55,262 --> 02:02:56,893
<i>Garnett.</i>

2802
02:02:56,895 --> 02:03:00,127
Hey, that's it!
That's it!

2803
02:03:00,129 --> 02:03:02,594
Thank you.

2804
02:03:02,596 --> 02:03:04,093
That's it.

2805
02:03:04,095 --> 02:03:06,427
Okay, that's two problem,
that's done.

2806
02:03:06,429 --> 02:03:09,227
We've got that... two.
Just got to win now.

2807
02:03:09,229 --> 02:03:11,461
Celts got to win it
with a fucking dunk.

2808
02:03:11,463 --> 02:03:13,161
We're done, Arno.

2809
02:03:14,896 --> 02:03:16,061
What do you got?

2810
02:03:16,063 --> 02:03:17,495
What's the score, baby?

2811
02:03:17,497 --> 02:03:19,195
68-73, Boston.

2812
02:03:19,197 --> 02:03:20,794
68 what in the fourth?

2813
02:03:20,796 --> 02:03:22,528
<i>...daring Rondo to shoot.</i>

2814

You want to call down?
Just cancel the fucking food.

2815
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:25,495
I want to go out.

2816
02:03:25,497 --> 02:03:27,761
Baby, I love that
you're into this game.

Oh, don't fucking miss that.

2824
02:03:45,896 --> 02:03:47,295
Don't miss that.
That's all right.

2825
02:03:47,297 --> 02:03:49,029
It's all right.
It's all right.

2826
02:03:49,031 --> 02:03:52,062
K.G.'s gonna get
this fucking shot.

2827
02:03:52,064 --> 02:03:54,029
Let's ice this shit.

2828
02:03:54,031 --> 02:03:56,895
Sink this shot.
Sink it. Sink it.

Come on. Feel it.
Feel it. Feel it.

02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:04,329
Feel that fucking jam.

All right.
We're up enough.

2837
02:04:16,231 --> 02:04:18,728
We're up enough.
This is not that big of a deal.

2838
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:21,329
This will just fucking
help seal it, but we're good.

2839
02:04:21,331 --> 02:04:24,262
Don't talk.
Just fucking do your shit, man.

All right,
The Truth fucking feels it.

2845

Don't let him shoot that.
Don't let him shoot that.

Howard, did we just win?

2859
02:05:06,366 --> 02:05:10,264
Oh, my fucking God!
Are you kidding me?!

I'm not gonna take it.
You... You...

Hey, get off me!

2897
02:06:16,935 --> 02:06:18,966
Shut the fuck up,
or you'll wind up next to him.

2898
02:06:18,968 --> 02:06:21,099
You hear me?
Don't fucking confuse me.

2899
02:06:21,101 --> 02:06:24,033

...to the conference final.

2916
02:07:08,336 --> 02:07:09,700
How are you feeling?

2917
02:07:09,702 --> 02:07:11,900
When you win, that's
all that matters. You know?

2918
02:07:11,902 --> 02:07:14,100
The big "be quiet,"
the big "shut up," you know?

2919
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:19,568
Ah, motherfucking money,
right?

2920
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:21,100
And a personal one to you, bro.

2921

...celebrate your
36th birthday...

2922
02:07:25,169 --> 02:07:26,733
That's some strong shit.

2923
02:07:26,735 --> 02:07:28,167
Oh, that's my nigga
right there, boy.

2924
02:07:28,169 --> 02:07:29,868
Look at that motherfucker, baby.

2925
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:32,168
Whoo. I know that man.
I know that man.

2926
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:34,834
My dad's good with him.
My dad's good with him.

02:07:34,836 --> 02:07:37,001
- You...
- Hey!

2928
02:07:37,003 --> 02:07:39,502
Amy, he was naked and drunk,
okay?

2929
02:07:39,504 --> 02:07:41,202
I'm calling the police.

2930
02:07:41,204 --> 02:07:43,535
<i>All the dues and everything
that I put into this,</i>

2931
02:07:43,537 --> 02:07:45,834
<i>you didn't think that
I would show up to game seven?</i>

2932
02:07:45,836 --> 02:07:47,768
<i>Clearly that's a joke.</i>

2933
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:50,168
<i>He goes to the bench.</i>

2934
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:52,202
<i>Did you feel that you needed
to shoulder...</i>

2935
02:07:52,204 --> 02:07:55,569
- It's all there.
- Thank you, thank you.

2936
02:07:59,703 --> 02:08:01,135
<i>He does a lot for our team.</i>

2937
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:04,635
<i>So I thought we all shared
that responsibility</i>

2938
02:08:04,637 --> 02:08:08,536
<i>and did a good job, you know,
but in the end,</i>

2939
02:08:08,538 --> 02:08:11,835
<i>I felt like it was just me
and the rock, nothing else.</i>

2940
02:08:11,837 --> 02:08:15,169
<i>Is this the end of...</i>

2941
02:08:15,171 --> 02:08:16,869
<i>No, I wouldn't say that.</i>

2942
02:08:16,871 --> 02:08:18,369
<i>I think we have a lot more
in our tank.</i>

2943
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:19,802
<i>I think we have a lot more
to prove...</i>

2944
02:08:22,271 --> 02:08:23,403
Oh, my God.

2945
02:08:23,405 --> 02:08:25,136
- Wayne, thank you so much.
- Ah, baby.

2946
02:08:25,138 --> 02:08:26,636
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

2947
02:08:26,638 --> 02:08:27,835
- A lot of money. Listen.
- Oh, I know.

2948
02:08:27,837 --> 02:08:29,303
I want you to come
to the Avalon.

2949
02:08:29,305 --> 02:08:31,069
- Have one drink.
- No, I can't, I can't.

2950
02:08:31,071 --> 02:08:32,303
- I don't want to twist your arm.
- I got to go, baby.

2951
02:08:32,305 --> 02:08:33,869
- Come on.
- I got to go. I got to go.

2952
02:08:33,871 --> 02:08:35,069
- Just have one drink.
- We can go now.

2953
02:08:40,672 --> 02:08:42,902
Go, go! Come on!

2954
02:08:42,904 --> 02:08:44,937
All right, go, go!
Go, go!

2955
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:45,937
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

2956
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:49,237
Nico, I can't find
the cabinet.

2957
02:08:49,239 --> 02:08:51,537
And make sure you get
all those electronics.

2958
02:08:51,539 --> 02:08:53,637
Everything that videotapes.
