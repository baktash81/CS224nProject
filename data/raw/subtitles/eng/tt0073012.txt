2
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:33,929
Ah yes, I remember that day when young
D'Artagnan was made a Musketeer of the king.

3
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,067
Splendid ceremony, you know.
All the best people,

4
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:40,338
crÃªme of French society.

5
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:42,472
I was there, of course.

6
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:49,698
Who but I, with Aramis and Athos could have
put the tabard on D'Artagnan's shoulders?

7
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:53,688
It is important that a young
man rising in the world...

8
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,645
should be seen to have a
worthy and valorous sponsor.

9
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:00,965
It gives people confidence.

10
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,267
And the king approved.

11
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:06,697
And the Queen, as well she might.

12
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:11,475
For was it not D'Artagnan and I with Aramis and
Athos who would have saved her reputation.

13
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:16,686
And prevented her love affair with
the Duke of Buckingham from becoming a public scandal.

14
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,710
Stupid woman, you see,
becoming infatuated...

15
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,424
with an Englishman and an English Prime
Minister at that! What next?

16
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:25,233
D'Artagnan...

17
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:27,074
had earned his reward, I can tell you.

18
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:32,043
The four had risked our skins
and reputation on her behalf...

19
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:36,978
against perilous enemies.
The Cardinal Richelieu for one.

20
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,793
A formidable man and hungry for power.

21
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,674
Who would've exposed and ruined
the Queen to serve his own ambition.

22
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:45,985
No gentleman, you see.

23
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:49,985
His agents were the bad and beautiful
Milady de Winter and her lover, Rochefort,

24
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,601
two birds of prey in fine feathers.

25
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:55,818
She for one would never forgive D'Artagnan...

26
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:01,031
or his mistress Constance for
defeating her plot against the Queen.

27
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,381
Revenge was what Milady wanted.

28
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,315
A dreadful woman.

29
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:09,482
But what did we care for her
or Rochefort or the Cardinal?

30
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:13,307
We were young and carefree,
as Musketeers should be.

31
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:17,616
And the boy D'Artagnan was in
love with his dressmaker.

32
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:22,711
And there was work, fighting in the king's service
against the Protestant rebels of La Rochelle.

33
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:27,898
You see, we tried to teach the rebels
the meaning of Christian charity,

34
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,629
by bombarding them into surrender.

35
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,425
These rascals with the working class ideas about religion.

36
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,605
Even our old enemy Rochefort,
the Cardinal's jackal played his part...

37
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,753
by spying for us inside
the walls of La Rochelle.

38
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,566
Unsuccesfully, as you see.

39
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:50,696
Fortunately for him, we three musketeers played
our part, distasteful work I thought.

40
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:55,569
Rescue a spy, no gentleman. Leave
him where he is, if I had my way.

41
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,407
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.

42
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,427
Yes, you did.

43
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:05,260
Return your stick!

44
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,526
Put in bullets!

45
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:14,426
Shorten your scouring stick!

46
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:19,829
Recover your muskets!

47
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,438
Put forth your match!

48
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:35,180
Blow off your coal!

49
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:40,502
Cock your musket!

50
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:43,089
Has Porthos got the horses ready?

51
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,727
Yes.

52
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:46,849
Has he got the horses ready?

53
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,828
Yes!

54
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,335
Blindfold!

55
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:54,309
Castabout your musket!

56
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,135
Perhaps I could close one eye?

57
00:04:57,136 --> 00:05:00,939
Poise your muskets!

58
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,033
Now!

59
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,442
The bomb! Quickly!

60
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:09,284
Open the look!

61
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,503
The fuse, Athos! The fuse!

62
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:18,595
Present!

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,318
Fire!

64
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,828
Damn fools!
Can't you even shoot a man?

65
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:36,672
Reload!

66
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:41,045
Why bother?
I may die of old age.

67
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:12,815
Get on the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!

68
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:20,362
- You arrive just in time!
- Who hurries to rescue a spy?

69
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,375
Seal off our escape!

70
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,122
The gate!

71
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,713
Yes, right.

72
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,622
Aramis!

73
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:27,313
Go under if you can!

74
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:50,144
Hit it now! Like that!
No, again! Again!

75
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:57,018
I'd rather I die, your Majesty, than bring you my information

76
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,910
The rebels would not surrender,
they expect a fleet...

77
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:04,179
...to aid them under the admirality of
the Duke of Buckingham.

78
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,413
- I'd rather I die.
- I would rather.

79
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:09,384
We would all rather.

80
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:13,175
- I owe my life, Your Majesty.
- I don't want it!

81
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,510
I don't want those stories either.

82
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:20,945
I want to make a triumphant
entry to La Rochelle.

83
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,898
- The Duke of Buckingham covets my Queen, you know that?
- No, Sire.

84
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:29,274
He wants La Rochelle,
he will assist the rebels.

85
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,838
But your Queen is
not a traitor to France.

86
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,137
- Not to France. To me.
- But Your Majesty is France.

87
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:44,464
Tell that to them, the rabble that infests La Rochelle and cocks snooks at me.

88
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:49,391
Time will shatter those walls, Majesty.
La Rochelle will fall.

89
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:54,283
But it is boring,
battling away day after day.

90
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,208
Sire,

91
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:59,746
Shall we siege on here while
Your Majesty returns to Paris...

92
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,423
to your Queen, your faithful Queen?

93
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:05,477
Leave this dirty business to us.

94
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,764
It is dirty business, and the
Queen is a traitor to my bed.

95
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,908
You should think yourself lucky.

96
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:21,203
I can place my musketeers in
danger to help you out of there.

97
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:26,417
I shall not do it again, spy. If you
have another eye, you might see why.

98
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:29,389
Good, I like that.

99
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:35,266
The gratitude of a princess.

100
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,825
Spy? It is a foul word.

101
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:42,746
It is a familiar word to me,
Eminence, in your service.

102
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,073
To your knees, little man,

103
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:51,094
before your master!

104
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:55,102
Now hear me, Rochefort.

105
00:09:55,103 --> 00:10:00,183
The Queen sends letters of love
to Buckingham. She should not.

106
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,350
Not while Buckingham
sends fleets against France.

107
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:06,482
I would have you stop these letters,
by stopping their go-between.

108
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:10,900
The woman Bonacieux,
the Queen's dressmaker.

109
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,425
You will remove her, my son.

110
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:17,986
This time do not
require me to rescue you.

111
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:21,980
She is, after all, only a woman.

112
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,237
I tell you, that goose is tender, sir.

113
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,755
See? Now, say you're sorry.

114
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,827
You don't want it? No,
didn't think you would.

115
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,540
My mother says that that is the only
way you can find out if it is fresh or not.

116
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,468
Oh, peaches!

117
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:45,311
Look, are they not beautiful?

118
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:50,345
Beside you, Constance my dear,
they look old and wrinkled.

119
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,269
Melons!

120
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:58,544
Clumsy clown.
Whose going to pay for them?

121
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,874
D'Artagnan?

122
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,160
D'Artagnan!

123
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,317
Away with her.

124
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,865
Stand up and fight, you coward!

125
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:43,431
Poor, poor gentleman.

126
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:45,443
Rene!

127
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,921
Come, lift him into the coach.
But, gently.

128
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:51,044
He's hurt.

129
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,757
But Constance...

130
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:58,991
Be still.
I shall take care of you.

131
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:15,623
Really, Kitty. He's the
most handsome young man.

132
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:21,568
- You are awake, sir?
- Who are you?

133
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:24,599
A friend.

134
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:27,887
Constance's melons!

135
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:31,365
- I have to go!
- You are being foolish.

136
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:34,612
I must find Constance.

137
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:44,332
Please forgive me.
Such kindness to a mere stranger.

138
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,095
Sir!

139
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:50,866
You are not well. Truly.
You should lie down.

140
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,412
I guess I should...

141
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:57,603
No. But I will be back...

142
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:02,224
to thank you properly.

143
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:55,728
A most handsome young man.

144
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:59,501
He'd be bleeding his life out in the gutter,
if I'd have my way.

145
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:03,543
And you are a friend.

146
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:09,189
You know what he'd say if he knew we
had his slut of a dressmaker under lock and key?

147
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,381
So much beauty wasted on a
clown of a musketeer!

148
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:19,539
I merely obey the Cardinal's
orders and keep him occupied.

149
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,819
Isn't that all the Cardinal wants?

150
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,529
You do have a habit
of enjoying your work.

151
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,591
What do you say, Lord Buckingham?

152
00:14:55,592 --> 00:15:02,525
I think, Master Mariner, if God intended us to
swim underwater, he would have given us fins.

153
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:09,084
If I go to break the siege of La Rochelle,
we shall go in good old English ships.

154
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,889
Well...

155
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,296
This under sea boat of yours
is an ingenious invention,

156
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:19,731
but how many casks of salt beef
can you carry to the rebels?

157
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:24,132
How many big guns can you take
to blow old Richelieu to hell?

158
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,143
We're coming!

159
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:34,125
But this boat is big enough for you
to steal away the Queen of France.

160
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:38,850
I do not need to steal
the Queen of France. / No.

161
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:43,597
When the time is ripe,
we shall be together, she and I.

162
00:15:43,598 --> 00:15:46,001
My dear sweet Anne...

163
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:48,288
Stupid priests!

164
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,476
Stupid Protestants!

165
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:55,230
Three weeks sneezing in the rain at
La Rochelle, and what to show for it all?

166
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:58,287
The best of my wardrobe
still on its way back to Paris.

167
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:02,958
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I could lose all patience!

168
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,764
- Perhaps, Majesty, this one...
- No!

169
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,772
That makes me like a burst cushion.

170
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:13,150
Constance will just have to
make me a new one. Where is she?

171
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:18,706
- Where's the Queen's dressmaker?
- Constance is not to be found.

172
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,176
What do you mean?

173
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:24,336
She has not been seen for
two days, Majesty. Not here or home.

174
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,646
She has, gone.

175
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,569
The Cardinal.

176
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,707
Beatrice, what have they done with her?

177
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,845
But where? Where?

178
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:43,632
You say they kidnapped her under
your very nose? And only four of them?

179
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:46,974
To lose one's mistress in the
conventional way is bad enough,

180
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:50,280
but to have her carried off
like a basket of washing...

181
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,920
that's careless, almost bad taste!

182
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:58,594
Especially when one has paying
attention to a beautiful, great Milady.

183
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:01,808
Your poor Madame Bonacieux
would probably prefer to stay...

184
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,578
with her kidnappers.

185
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,324
Mine mistresses would,
If I treated them so.

186
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,297
Aramis! Aramis!

187
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:13,478
Observe my new trick!

188
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:20,860
My opponent is there, about
to unsheathe, when suddenly...

189
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:28,882
Oh, Porthos.

190
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:32,439
Try it again.

191
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:44,128
Only Porthos could invent a
new way of disarming himself.

192
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,463
Will you never learn?

193
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,778
Kidnap her? Why?

194
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,525
Not even listening.

195
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:57,123
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Athos, are you hurt?

196
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:01,849
What I am is drunk.

197
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:12,703
What you are, sir,

198
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:15,673
troubled.

199
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:20,394
Child, you are troubled.

200
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,903
What's the matter?

201
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:28,156
It's my mistress. She was
snatched from my side... / Good.

202
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:31,293
Have you discovered her hiding place?

203
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,972
- No.
- Good!

204
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:38,097
- I am told that you have found another.
- No!

205
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:40,656
Porthos told me.

206
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:44,369
Now, is Porthos a liar?

207
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:48,127
No.

208
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,010
He speaks to me of a certain
milady who leads you by the hand.

209
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:57,532
No, no, no!
I love her with my head.

210
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:01,592
But my Constance, snatched from
my side, I love with my heart.

211
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:04,225
You have a conveniently
discriminating anatomy.

212
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,628
Who would've thought you kept your
heart swung there so you might lose it?

213
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:13,812
Why, you shriveled old winesack!
Have you never lost your heart?

214
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,173
Me? No.

215
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:27,604
Never. But I knew a man
once who did. But me, never.

216
00:19:29,614 --> 00:19:32,244
Hear this love story.

217
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:39,257
There was this man once.

218
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,104
This noble man...

219
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:48,568
who lost his heart. He loved
a girl who came from nothing.

220
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:56,255
Came with beauty as beautiful as,
whatever you think is beautiful.

221
00:19:56,725 --> 00:20:03,557
And he was a great man.
Without fear, he'd have taken her.

222
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:09,757
But he was a great man because he
was a man of honour. So he married her.

223
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,807
Knowing not whence she came.

224
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:19,604
He gave her his name,
as well his love...

225
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:23,029
...with honour.

226
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,630
One day, hunting,

227
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:29,582
she was tripped from the horse.

228
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,678
And there in the full light of day...

229
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,264
he saw her naked shoulder.

230
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:37,717
He saw the branded mark of harlot.

231
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:41,396
A thief, placed there.

232
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:45,016
His angel bore his name and
the mark of dishonour together.

233
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:51,150
Whore, murdereress or worse
burned into her shoulder.

234
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:59,243
He...

235
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:02,416
saw it.

236
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,039
He...

237
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,630
What?

238
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,258
I think that she is...

239
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,344
...dead.

240
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:26,348
I would hope she died, wouldn't you?

241
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:29,602
Poor man.

242
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,147
Poor dishonoured man.

243
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,411
Well!

244
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:42,443
That's a story to cure you of love.

245
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:46,441
It takes a love story
to cure you of love.

246
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,874
Of fascinating women.

247
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:56,967
Tell me something. Is your
Milady as beautiful as the dew?

248
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:04,096
She's as magnificent as
summer's dew. As that.

249
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:07,982
I'd beg of you, forget her,
she will do you some mischief.

250
00:22:09,068 --> 00:22:13,350
Yes, you're right. And besides,
I owe it to my Constance.

251
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:18,943
I shall remain faithful to her.

252
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:30,713
- Monsieur D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! Your mistress is well today?

253
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:34,617
- Well indeed, sir, but not here.
- Not here? But she said four o'clock.

254
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:39,930
Yes, but before four she went
out, to take the air. / The air?

255
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:43,845
Why would she do that?

256
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,188
What a pretty flower!

257
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:50,358
She doesn't love you at all, Monsieur!

258
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,817
She told you that?

259
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:59,569
Oh, no. But, I have seen
Milady and men before.

260
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:09,627
But why do you tell me this?

261
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:14,757
- Because I have my own interest.
- You? You, Kitty?

262
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,163
But of course, what
else could one expect?

263
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,931
Dear child.

264
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:37,565
Now then, we have ten
minutes before Milady return.

265
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:49,788
Here we go.

266
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:53,959
Thank you, Milady.

267
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:56,581
Bloody arm.

268
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,963
Kitty?

269
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:04,466
- She's put weight on.
- Why didn't she get a horse?

270
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,388
Kitty?

271
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:14,306
Kitty!

272
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:21,148
- Were you asleep?
- I was resting.

273
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:23,486
Thank you.

274
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:29,707
- Has our Gascon been and gone?
- No, Madam. Milady.

275
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,785
He did not come.

276
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,942
Perhaps with the army going to La
Rochelle, he's been detained by duty.

277
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:49,519
Possibly. It may be necessary to
teach Monsieur D'Artagnan manners,

278
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,604
before we're done with him.

279
00:24:51,605 --> 00:24:56,453
- What will you do with him, Milady?
- Who should say?

280
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:01,268
It's pleasant to be
adored by one so pretty.

281
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,772
In time, Rochefort will
cut him to death by inches.

282
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,945
Perhaps I should watch.

283
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:12,039
As for his dressmaker...

284
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,954
Rochefort's grooms will have her.

285
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,588
I should wear this tonight.

286
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:31,938
Stay there!

287
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,861
Thank you!

288
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,457
No...

289
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:37,200
Where is Constance Bonacieux?

290
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:43,330
Quickly! Unless you want this bed to be
your deathbed. Where is she? / Wait.

291
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:13,413
Try that again and I'll cut some
fleur de lis on the rest of you!

292
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,653
- Quickly, Kitty! Give me that cloak!
- Kitty! Open the door!

293
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:43,785
But...

294
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:47,996
Excuse me, sir.
Stop! Come back, sir!

295
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:50,809
Kitty open this door!

296
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,586
I think your mistress is calling.

297
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:55,548
But that's the window...

298
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,855
Hello, hello.

299
00:28:58,856 --> 00:29:00,607
Hey.

300
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,769
- Thank you, Madame.
- Move along, please.

301
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,983
Kitty!

302
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,068
Oh, well.

303
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:14,165
Kitty! Open the door!

304
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:42,040
Bad luck, Aramis!

305
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:48,283
Shoe shine! Anyone
wants shoes shine, sir?

306
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:51,257
Shoe shine?

307
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:59,182
- D'Artagnan! Lend me some money!
- Wine!

308
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:02,315
I need some wine!

309
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:10,700
Ah, thank you.

310
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,241
Where did you get this?

311
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:19,669
Milady.

312
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:28,395
Your story,
the brand of fleur de lis...

313
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,852
It was her?

314
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:36,281
Oh God.
I'd hoped that she was dead.

315
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:44,916
This has been in our family for
generations before I gave it to her.

316
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:54,057
Those other two must
not know, alright? / Yes.

317
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,597
So she has returned to haunt me.

318
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:02,103
And you.

319
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,906
Because you've done something she'll
never forgive. You found out her secret.

320
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,690
She won't let you live, boy.

321
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,905
She has tried in that line already.

322
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,123
Leave now.

323
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:24,283
Leave Paris, leave France. Get as far
from that evil woman's grasp as you can.

324
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:26,336
What about you?

325
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:31,832
I'm safe. She does not
know that Athos exists.

326
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:41,131
But if you stay, your life's not gonna be worth
a sou's purchase, do you understand?

327
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:46,298
No. You forget, there's
still Constance to be found.

328
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:50,177
That tumbling trot of a dressmaker?

329
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:52,804
If you please! I love her.

330
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:54,562
I think.

331
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:57,564
Anyway, I shall ask the Queen
for help in finding her.

332
00:31:57,565 --> 00:32:01,983
And as for the branded
lady and her vengeance:

333
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:07,941
Our regiment leaves again for La Rochelle
tomorrow. That should be far enough to be safe.

334
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:16,334
- Where away, musketeer?
- The Queen.

335
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:20,861
Her Majesty isn't receiving,
but the Cardinal is.

336
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:30,747
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
You'd been described to me as a swordsman.

337
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:32,373
That is kindness.

338
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:35,947
- As an intriguer.
- There's that, in all of us.

339
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:39,488
- As an enemy.
- I'm honoured to count
you as one of my enemies.

340
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,213
I?

341
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:45,841
I have no enemies.
Only those of France.

342
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:52,104
My aplogogies. But I do seem to be continually
beset by enemies who wear your coat.

343
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:58,332
You wear my coat.
Serve France, as I do.

344
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,555
I'm offering you a
commission in my guard.

345
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,335
These enemies are the
enemies of France.

346
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,464
Root them out under my protection.

347
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:10,977
Wear my coat. Have my love.

348
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,397
Eminence, what can I say?

349
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:21,523
"Yes" will be sufficient.

350
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:25,276
I can't.

351
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,200
You're very wet.

352
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,161
Wet or dry, I cannot.

353
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:38,366
- Take my hand, d'Artagnan. Your fortune is secure.
- No, I can't!

354
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:45,157
I do not withdraw my hand.
It is held out to you openly.

355
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:48,921
In it lies your future.
Take it.

356
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,628
No.

357
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:59,160
- Are you going to the siege of La Rochelle?
- I do.

358
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,847
You will find it a perilous journey.

359
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,640
I bear you no ill will,

360
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,044
- But I can give you no protection.
- I asked for none.

361
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:12,345
I shall not lift a finger to save you.

362
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:16,391
I deeply regret that I can
not accept your service.

363
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,860
I don't make such an
offer twice in one day.

364
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:23,165
But if you should survive
to return to Paris,

365
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:26,973
you may see my hand stretched
out to you once more.

366
00:35:27,328 --> 00:35:31,909
For then, you would be a very
remarkable young man indeed.

367
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,374
I would remark on it to people.

368
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:38,841
Goodbye.

369
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,094
The young fool refused Richelieu's
offer of a commission.

370
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:55,935
Which now makes him fair
game as far as you are concerned.

371
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,977
The conceit.

372
00:35:57,978 --> 00:35:59,906
No!

373
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:06,905
We shall oblige D'Artagnan and make sure
that his journey is an eventful one.

374
00:36:06,906 --> 00:36:09,923
That's easily arranged.

375
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:12,535
The Musketeer's regiment
leave Paris tomorrow.

376
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:16,639
They'll be used as couriers on
their march to La Rochelle.

377
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,631
D'Artagnan and his friends
frequently travel in small groups.

378
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:24,589
There should be no difficulty in arranging for
them to be suitably entertained along the road.

379
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,477
Excellent. And the woman, Bonacieux?

380
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:35,037
The lady is enjoying the hospitality
of my guards at my chateau Saint-Cloud.

381
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:38,868
It would seem they are
most anxious to pander...

382
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,665
to her creature comforts.
So you could say she's in safe hands.

383
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,133
Never fear.

384
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:50,177
The Queen will need a new dressmaker
whenever you agree to say so.

385
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:13,085
At Saint-Cloud?

386
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:16,668
I know he'll kill her,
if Milady says so.

387
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,994
And she'll do anything
to be revenged on you.

388
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:22,306
I'll have her out of here this night.

389
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:27,338
- But where can I take her to safety?
- To the convent of ArmentiÃ¨res.

390
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,816
But Rochefort's men are
sure to be expecting you.

391
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:34,888
Let us rescue your mistress. It's the
very least one can do for a friend.

392
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:38,145
If she can stay with the Sisters
while we're at La Rochelle...

393
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,912
I'm sure they'll learn a
great deal from each other.

394
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:45,363
I'll cover for you and we will meet
again in three days at the latest.

395
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:50,376
See if you can find a way to
console yourself until our return.

396
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:15,213
Aramis!

397
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,197
Forgive me!

398
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,666
Don't let him get the key!

399
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:25,340
Do not let him get it!

400
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,925
We need it!

401
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:43,449
Go to the window!

402
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,580
Hello, my dear. Would you like
to climb on my shoulders?

403
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,747
There it is!

404
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:37,309
Come on, my dear.
Quickly, here we are.

405
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:46,778
- Sister!
- My dear. Try not to get into any dirty habits!

406
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:52,076
The problems of the siege of
La Rochelle have been immense.

407
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,989
Mainly because nobody
would listen to me.

408
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,376
For example:

409
00:39:57,377 --> 00:40:00,912
I should have deployed the
siege towers at dawn.

410
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:03,383
No, no. Before dawn.

411
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:06,837
Good evening. See any
musketeers yet? / Not yet.

412
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,465
There's a parcel of letter for
you on yonder table that came today.

413
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:14,147
Unfortunately, my superiors...

414
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:18,399
do not appreciate my strategy.
Your loving ...

415
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:22,984
What's it say?

416
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:31,740
This writing is bound to be
indistinct. Perhaps you could...

417
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:38,474
"Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Monsieurs Athos, Porthos and Aramis...

418
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:44,234
arrived at my inn."
It's from the innkeeper of Villoix.

419
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:50,309
"And having dined and drunk, became so noisy,
the profoss marshal locked them up for a few days.

420
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,056
They have asked me to send you a dozen bottles
of my Anjou wine to drink their health."

421
00:40:55,057 --> 00:41:00,110
Now, that's what I call real friendship.
To think of me when they're drunk.

422
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:07,691
No. The least I can do is to bail
them out, and we drink these together.

423
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,064
What did I do?

424
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:24,497
Swordplay? Who the devil would fight
out of doors in this weather?

425
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:27,774
- Only a lunatic.
- D'Artagnan might be involved?

426
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:30,501
Who else on this road?

427
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:16,040
That one.

428
00:44:18,216 --> 00:44:20,379
And that one.

429
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,470
Don't worry. I'm coming. I help...

430
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,269
- Take me with you!
- Out of my way!

431
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:19,261
Help me!

432
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:38,999
Are you hurt, boy?

433
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,462
- No, no.
- Good, come along.

434
00:45:43,463 --> 00:45:46,405
Aramis, this one is still alive.
We'll take him with us.

435
00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:50,129
He can sing us a song about
Milady's plot, no doubt.

436
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:56,677
What about me?

437
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,471
I might've freeze!

438
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:07,776
- What do you think?
- Nothing.

439
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:12,524
We were supposed to go to Red
Dovecote inn near La Rochelle.

440
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:15,249
Oh, God, my arm!

441
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,941
I know nothing more, I swear! No names!

442
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,329
Planchet!

443
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,875
- Brandy!
- Come on, now! Bustle!

444
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:26,961
Here's your wine of Anjou.
That will do.

445
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:34,208
A drink, in the name of God. A drink.

446
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:44,010
Am I to die of thirst and
cold while this footpad cuddle?

447
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:47,305
- What? Are you mad?
- Look!

448
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,284
I always had my doubts
about the Anjou '22.

449
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:01,812
- Where did this wine come from?
- Why, you sent it!

450
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:04,789
It came today with a note
from the landlord of Villoix.

451
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,780
- We sent you no wine.
- But we can guess who did.

452
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:10,803
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.

453
00:47:10,804 --> 00:47:13,714
It occurs to me that
Milady is persistent.

454
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:19,428
My God, the sooner we get safe down as
far as La Rochelle, the better.

455
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:23,679
Red Dovecote inn.

456
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:30,887
- I think they're disgusting.
- Do try one, Majesty.

457
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:47,525
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.

458
00:47:47,526 --> 00:47:53,533
Look down on these sinners hanging.

459
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,500
Cardinal!

460
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:01,670
- La Rochelle has fallen, eh?
- Not quite, Sire.

461
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:18,858
The pigeon has reach
the Dovecote, Eminence.

462
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:55,144
Eminence!

463
00:48:55,145 --> 00:48:57,770
Yes, it's here.

464
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:02,449
Either your priestly intention
has put all the saints on your side,

465
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,943
or you're cheating.

466
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:08,532
- It is a matter of faith.
- Your faith is costing me money.

467
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:14,227
All this evening spend at this place of leisure,
just because a poisoned rascal mentioned its name.

468
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:17,203
What are we waiting for?

469
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,748
Richelieu!

470
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:26,289
What the devil does he want here?

471
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:34,210
- And no one knows you're here?
- The landlord has been well paid.

472
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:38,768
Yes. Now, Madam, Milady.

473
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:43,384
What you will do for your pay:
A ship waiting at the river mouth.

474
00:49:43,385 --> 00:49:45,692
You will board it tonight. In London...

475
00:49:45,693 --> 00:49:50,557
you will urge the Duke of Buckingham in my
name not to assist the rebels of La Rochelle.

476
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:53,229
No food, no aid, no
English fleet to the rescue.

477
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,077
Assure him from me, that if he does,

478
00:49:56,078 --> 00:50:00,992
he is at war with France, a war
he dare not fight, can not win.

479
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,624
More than that,

480
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,211
The Queen of France,
for whom he bears love...

481
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:13,878
my word on this, as sure as I love, will
be dragged out and paraded in dishonour.

482
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:18,221
And if he will not heed you?

483
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:22,805
Then we must pray that the
Duke meets with an accident.

484
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:26,894
I see.

485
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:31,758
Naturally, you will
urge him to see wisdom.

486
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:36,309
Bon voyage, Milady.

487
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:39,527
I'm not to be paid in money.

488
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:41,907
You are not?

489
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,784
I have affairs to be settled.

490
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,691
I'm not concerned with your affairs.

491
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,497
I would wish it.

492
00:50:49,498 --> 00:50:52,870
I'm not concerned with
your wishes, Milady.

493
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:58,170
But you may name your
own price, obviously.

494
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,382
A death.

495
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:05,885
I will not assist in your
private murders, Madam.

496
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:08,763
I need no assistance.

497
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:13,099
I need only your signature that I might
have carte blanche, a signed warrant...

498
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,635
for disposal of the lives of the
slut Bonacieux and her lover.

499
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:20,981
No.

500
00:51:20,982 --> 00:51:23,108
Eminence.

501
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:26,976
The death of Buckingham for the
death of D'Artagnan. Their lives...

502
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:29,647
for the sake of France.

503
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:54,963
- Well?
- Find D'Artagnan and stay with him.

504
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:55,760
And you?

505
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:59,715
- I'll follow as soon as I can.
- Be careful.

506
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:16,277
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?

507
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:18,773
The Gascon was right.

508
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:22,024
You're still beautiful.

509
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,320
Comte de la Fere!

510
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,162
Oh, no, milady.

511
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:36,033
The Comte de la Fere is dead.

512
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:38,503
You killed me years ago.

513
00:52:38,504 --> 00:52:40,630
Do you remember?

514
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:43,967
Hunting in the field.

515
00:52:43,968 --> 00:52:46,462
On a summer's day.

516
00:52:49,305 --> 00:52:52,594
It's burned as deep into you as it is into me.

517
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:57,518
What do you want of me?
There's nothing between us.

518
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:03,434
Thank God.

519
00:53:03,525 --> 00:53:06,135
But there might be, you see.

520
00:53:06,136 --> 00:53:08,564
I know you.

521
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:13,448
I know what passed here, just now.

522
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,995
And you mark this.

523
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:21,649
You kill Buckingham or have him
killed, it's no matter to me.

524
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:24,083
He's an Englishman and an enemy.

525
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:27,503
But you touch one hair
of D'Artagnan's head...

526
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:32,833
and I swear, as God is my judge, I'll
break you on the wheel with my own hand.

527
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:35,630
No.

528
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:40,263
Monsieur D'Artagnan...

529
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:43,057
has assaulted me, insulted me...

530
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:47,509
Since when has it been possible
to insult you, Madame?

531
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:52,850
And he will die for it.

532
00:53:55,777 --> 00:54:01,439
Have you ever seen a
woman shot in the stomach?

533
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,369
You know me, Milady.

534
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,659
Give me the papers the
Cardinal wrote just now.

535
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,994
I'll give you five seconds.

536
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:22,211
Very well.

537
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,512
One, two,

538
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:32,553
three, four...

539
00:54:48,612 --> 00:54:51,771
"By my order and for
the good of the state,

540
00:54:55,285 --> 00:55:02,157
the bearer has done what
has been done. Richelieu. "

541
00:55:06,752 --> 00:55:09,838
Clever and subtle man,
our dear Cardinal.

542
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,836
It gives you what you want without
leaving evidence against himself.

543
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:20,967
Unfortunately you won't have time to
send messages before your ship leaves.

544
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:32,769
Bon voyage.

545
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:11,168
The outer bastion is cleared of rebels.

546
00:56:11,169 --> 00:56:14,423
But it's too hot to hold.

547
00:56:14,517 --> 00:56:16,768
Fairly seven o'clock.

548
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:21,897
We'll try a full frontal
assault at nine. Or ten.

549
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:27,026
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good day, gentlemen.

550
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:32,404
Boy! Quickly!

551
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:38,116
- Look here!
- Get off!

552
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:41,579
Thank you very much.

553
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:55,823
Where is the Gascon?
We have to speak to him, quickly.

554
00:56:55,824 --> 00:56:58,511
Over there, in the trenches.

555
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:03,924
A conference? But where?
We can't keep a secret here.

556
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:08,509
The eyes and ears around here
belongs to the Cardinal.

557
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,979
You're probably right. Where can we go?

558
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:15,263
More work, gentlemen.
And where were the musketeers?

559
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:18,217
At our prayers, sir.
Like good Christians.

560
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:20,571
So was I, and for a good reason.

561
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:23,584
That bastion was buzzing
like a beehive.

562
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:27,027
And yet, you did not
stay for breakfast.

563
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:30,324
Neither would you.

564
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,157
Would you bet on that?

565
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,211
I'll wager you...

566
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:47,246
the finest dinner on this camp that my friends
and I will have breakfast on that bastion now.

567
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:49,588
Hah hah hah!

568
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:53,640
Done! Done!

569
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:59,548
- You hear that, Spengler? We're going to eat that big dinner alone!
- What is it?

570
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:04,691
Our good friend Athos, proposed to
have us killed for breakfast. Up yonder.

571
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:10,362
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens,
ham, oysters and wine. Right now!

572
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:13,311
And make the wine champagne.

573
00:58:13,312 --> 00:58:16,158
For breakfast? Oh, my dear Porthos!

574
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,410
- Planchet! Money, money, money...
- You can't afford some!

575
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:26,198
- Thistles!
- A long way to go for breakfast!

576
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:29,166
Is not that right, Athos?

577
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:36,714
Over there! Don't you see? Someone
approaches the bastion! Fire!

578
00:58:40,972 --> 00:58:44,807
Hurry! I'll cover you! Quick!

579
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:51,062
There!

580
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:53,688
Take cover, Planchet!

581
00:58:53,774 --> 00:58:56,353
All right?

582
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:01,557
Why do we always have to attack uphill?

583
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:04,778
I'm getting too old for this.

584
00:59:10,038 --> 00:59:14,987
- I got something important to tell you!
- You have to speak up!

585
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:20,369
You three up there!
Get those things ready!

586
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:33,049
At last, we got the
chance to talk in peace.

587
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:43,964
Here we are Sir, here is your wine now.
It's an ideal temperature.

588
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:47,521
Come on. Open it, Planchet!

589
00:59:52,198 --> 00:59:56,697
Damned that potbellied pile of a landlord!
This isn't champagne!

590
00:59:57,243 --> 00:59:59,744
This wine does not travel well.

591
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:04,415
You saw her with the Cardinal?
And she's going to murder Buckingham?

592
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:10,834
If necessary. And knowing Buckingham,
it probably will be. Give me some!

593
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:18,703
A moment, gentlemen!
We're in the middle of our breakfast!

594
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,256
Barbarians, have they no manners?

595
01:00:24,257 --> 01:00:27,956
- We can't allow Buckingham to be butchered!
- Why not Monsieur? He is on their side!

596
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,675
Precisely. And he's English!

597
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:33,623
No! He's a gallant gentleman.
And he loves our Queen.

598
01:00:33,624 --> 01:00:37,761
I won't sit by and allow
him to be murdered by that...

599
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:42,347
She also has a death warrant signed
against you and Madame Bonacieux.

600
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:47,295
Here, read this with your breakfast
and tuck it safely in your boot.

601
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:51,760
Fire!

602
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:54,852
Wrong.

603
01:00:54,853 --> 01:01:02,017
It strikes me we would be better employed
wringing Milady's pretty neck than shooting
at these poor devils of Protestants.

604
01:01:04,648 --> 01:01:09,282
What are we killing them for? Because
they sing psalms in French and we in Latin?

605
01:01:09,283 --> 01:01:14,350
Porthos, have you no education? What do
you think religious wars are all about?

606
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:25,854
Here they come gentlemen!
Make your shots count!

607
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:31,481
Hurry up, Planchet.
Load that.

608
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,161
Come on, Planchet.
Use both hands.

609
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:08,274
A loaf of bread!

610
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:19,612
Mine!

611
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:32,820
What a waste!

612
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:35,491
I do apologize.

613
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:50,961
Quickly, they're here, gentlemen! The wall!

614
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:56,504
Push! Push for your lives!

615
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,132
Excuse me, gentlemen.

616
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:04,374
Push, Porthos! Exert yourself!

617
01:04:22,517 --> 01:04:27,093
- Athos! About Buckingham, I ought to warn the Queen!
- We'll think about that later!

618
01:04:27,094 --> 01:04:29,710
Gentlemen, I suggest
we get out of here!

619
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:31,352
Take!

620
01:04:31,353 --> 01:04:33,847
Thank you very much, sir.

621
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,939
Could you give me a hand?

622
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:46,140
Can you help?

623
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:48,605
The basket.

624
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:51,520
Can you?

625
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:54,649
Take for it!

626
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:25,082
Come back soon. Don't get killed.

627
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:29,233
Come back and pay it,
or we will find you.

628
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:32,871
Nice to see the back of them again.

629
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:38,531
Here we are. / Well done,
D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.

630
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:41,866
It know it against our
principles, but have a drink!

631
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:44,631
And Aramis! Even you. Well done.

632
01:05:44,632 --> 01:05:48,880
Here's your money. Now go and
fill your fat royalist bellies.

633
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:56,427
Your journey to England is wasted.

634
01:05:56,428 --> 01:06:02,629
So you will inform His Eminence, I'm not to be
persuaded by his threats or his ambassador's beauty.

635
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:06,254
I will take English ships to help
the Protestants of La Rochelle.

636
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:08,182
Tell the Cardinal.

637
01:06:08,183 --> 01:06:13,309
I trust you do not live to
regret it, Milord Buckingham.

638
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:52,241
Trust the good Cardinal to employ
every diplomatic argument.

639
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:57,316
At least it relieves my conscience
of any doubts in assisting the rebels.

640
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:59,356
I shall inform His Eminence.

641
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:01,286
Lady, you'll inform no one!

642
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:07,772
You came here as an ambassadress, but
by God, you'll stay here as an assassin!

643
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,289
- You will not dare.
- Oh, come?

644
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:14,875
A week lodging in a congenial
riverside establishment. The Tower.

645
01:07:14,876 --> 01:07:19,571
And after I've sailed with my fleet
to France, you will set sail too.

646
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:22,822
To His Majesty's colonies in America.

647
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:24,670
America!

648
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:28,869
They say it is full
of beautiful savages.

649
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:32,173
Who knows, once there, maybe
you'll be able to use that...

650
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:35,333
astonishing beauty to persuade
someone to bring you home again.

651
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:38,384
But don't count on it. In the meantime -

652
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:42,997
- I have a jailer for you who can't see
beauty even when it is astonishing .

653
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:47,675
He can't be melted. Felton!

654
01:07:48,805 --> 01:07:50,430
Milord?

655
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:54,181
Milady is going to the Tower, Felton.
At your charge.

656
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:58,265
She is to see no one else.

657
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,944
Good sir?

658
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:48,147
In this place, may I be granted
the comfort of God's word?

659
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:51,747
A Bible. And the Psalms.

660
01:08:54,415 --> 01:08:56,992
Are you not a Roman?

661
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,582
No.

662
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,417
No, sir.

663
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:06,828
I am a Huguenot. Those were prosecuted
for their Protestant faith.

664
01:09:17,382 --> 01:09:20,041
This is mine.

665
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:25,032
I sall bring you the Psalms tomorrow.

666
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:27,960
God bless you, sir!

667
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:00,008
The Cardinal has sent that
woman to England...

668
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:02,143
...to kill?

669
01:10:04,608 --> 01:10:06,604
Oh, no!

670
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:09,318
He must be warned!

671
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:12,725
- You go, D'Artagnan!
- It not possible, Your Majesty.

672
01:10:12,726 --> 01:10:16,029
I can not leave my regiment with
the Cardinal's spies everywhere.

673
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:22,021
But I do have a trusted servant to go and warn
Buckingham, if your Majesty will write a message.

674
01:10:32,536 --> 01:10:37,112
- I owe you so much, D'Artagnan.
- No, Majesty.

675
01:10:37,113 --> 01:10:40,227
Majesty, the King is waiting!

676
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:43,723
One glad piece of news, I do have.

677
01:10:43,724 --> 01:10:46,036
Constance Bonacieux is safe.

678
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,505
She is at the Cecilia convent,
near Armentieres.

679
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:53,034
As soon as I'm free of the siege,
I'll go and bring her back to Paris.

680
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:55,984
Madame, the King!

681
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:04,654
Save him for me.

682
01:11:06,521 --> 01:11:09,907
God bless you, D'Artagnan.
And please have your servant hurry...

683
01:11:09,908 --> 01:11:12,449
to England.

684
01:11:35,134 --> 01:11:39,608
I'm afraid it's the best I could
get for the money.

685
01:11:44,837 --> 01:11:52,001
Do not let your foot be moved;
or numb the...

686
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:56,677
The Lord himself is your keeper;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right...

687
01:11:56,678 --> 01:12:01,216
The sun shall not smite you
by day, nor the moon by night.

688
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:05,721
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

689
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:08,920
Jehovah preserve thy going
out and thy coming...

690
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:12,371
...now and forever.

691
01:12:12,372 --> 01:12:15,204
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

692
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,904
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

693
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:21,100
Do not allow your foot
nor slumber that keepeth thee...

694
01:12:21,101 --> 01:12:24,725
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

695
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:30,361
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

696
01:12:54,664 --> 01:12:58,989
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?

697
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:03,905
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

698
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:07,363
...nor he that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, he is numb...

699
01:13:07,364 --> 01:13:11,250
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.

700
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:22,221
When they cry,
the Lord hear it...

701
01:13:22,769 --> 01:13:26,832
and delivers them
from all their troubles.

702
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,601
The Lord is night unto them...

703
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,539
Amen.

704
01:14:01,749 --> 01:14:04,194
Master Felton!

705
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:08,204
For two nights you have not slept.

706
01:14:08,205 --> 01:14:12,115
When I am awake, I am nearer to God.

707
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:17,333
God is with thee,
awake or asleep, Milady.

708
01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:48,019
Help me!

709
01:14:48,565 --> 01:14:51,952
God, help me! Help my
people from prosecution!

710
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:55,306
Deliver them from the
betrayal, the Antichrist,

711
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:57,438
so as not to corrupt and destroy..

712
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,285
as he has defiled and destroyed me.
Send me thy angel, God...

713
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:06,021
to strike down Thine enemies!
Help me! Help me!

714
01:15:06,022 --> 01:15:08,012
Who is the antichrist, the betrayer?

715
01:15:08,013 --> 01:15:11,446
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.

716
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:15,310
He is the Philistine blight on Israel.

717
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:19,996
You are a Puritan and yet,
you serve him.

718
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:26,341
- They are dying in La Rochelle for the
faith and he is betraying them.
- No!

719
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:32,876
- No! He's going to save them.
- He deceives the world and will betray them.

720
01:15:32,877 --> 01:15:38,936
He marches to Paris, to the bed of
his Queen, his lascivious Roman Queen.

721
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:44,461
Help me, master Felton.
You have the eyes of a saint.

722
01:15:44,462 --> 01:15:48,312
Help me to warn our people.

723
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:52,406
I can not think.

724
01:15:52,407 --> 01:15:54,610
Help me.

725
01:16:50,935 --> 01:16:52,800
Felton,

726
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:55,951
you will not let this
treachery go unpunished.

727
01:16:55,952 --> 01:17:00,375
It is in God's hands.
His will be done. / Yes.

728
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:02,409
Let it be done.

729
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:11,875
Then the dragon was
wroth with the women;

730
01:17:11,876 --> 01:17:16,681
and went to make war with
the remnant of her seed.

731
01:17:21,455 --> 01:17:26,090
Aye, ten pence.
Good steel, too.

732
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:31,363
Your change, sir!

733
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,592
Lord Buckingham!

734
01:18:34,727 --> 01:18:41,097
Your messenger arrived only a few hours ago.
I gather from him that Lord Buckingham will
not be leaving England again.

735
01:18:41,098 --> 01:18:44,000


736
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:08,555
I reek of England and Calvinism.

737
01:19:08,556 --> 01:19:10,563
The Cardinal's business is done.

738
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:16,772
I may devote myself to my own.
To St. Cloud and the woman, Bonacieux.

739
01:19:17,904 --> 01:19:21,831
No. She is in the Cecilia
convent at Armentieres.

740
01:19:21,832 --> 01:19:25,492
One of my men went after her
but the fool bungled it, somewhat.

741
01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:55,099
Sorry.

742
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:00,400
- And D'Artagnan?
- La Rochelle surrendered three days ago.

743
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:15,535
So, Sire, La Rochelle has fallen.

744
01:20:15,536 --> 01:20:17,698
And not before time.

745
01:20:17,699 --> 01:20:21,910
- Well Porthos, what are you going to spend it on?
- After paying the drink...

746
01:20:21,911 --> 01:20:25,396
for Athos and Aramis pardons,
will not be too much.

747
01:20:25,397 --> 01:20:28,436
Don't forget the needy, Sir.

748
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:31,795
Come on. Constance is in danger!

749
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:36,842
He and his friends are not on the road
to ArmentiÃ¨res to claim his lady love.

750
01:20:36,843 --> 01:20:40,702
Don't worry, they can not possibly
be closer than Paris by now.

751
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:43,560
You and I may be in ArmentiÃ¨res at dawn tomorrow.

752
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:46,384
I've twelve men at
the convent already...

753
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:52,268
so we can assure D'Artagnan
a most hearty welcome.

754
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:58,618
And you will have them all, Milady.

755
01:21:22,482 --> 01:21:27,812
Welcome, welcome, nice musketeers!

756
01:21:27,903 --> 01:21:30,977
These poor beasts are done, Athos.

757
01:21:30,978 --> 01:21:33,200
Not only the poor beasts.

758
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:36,309
- How far is the Cecilia convent?
- Two miles, Monsieur!

759
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:39,703
Up the Brussels road.

760
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,495
Here you are young man, almost there!

761
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:47,962
Time for a glass. Wine!

762
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:53,963
Then we'll escort you to your
heart's desire. Wine! Come on!

763
01:21:58,227 --> 01:22:02,396
To quench a Gascon.

764
01:22:12,785 --> 01:22:15,089
Hey, stop!

765
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,827
Quickly!

766
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:25,376
Athos!

767
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:30,837
Athos! He's here!

768
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:35,168
Rochefort! He saw me! Come on!

769
01:22:35,169 --> 01:22:38,140
After him!

770
01:22:40,397 --> 01:22:42,681
Come on! Quick!

771
01:22:42,682 --> 01:22:45,398
After them!

772
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:54,946
After them! Quick!

773
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:02,584
There's no saddle on that horse!

774
01:23:31,033 --> 01:23:34,110
There it is!

775
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,424
Steady, Gascon!

776
01:23:54,933 --> 01:23:58,472
There's another way in.

777
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:13,869
Take her inside! Go to the
barn! They're close behind!

778
01:24:20,084 --> 01:24:24,783
Find the girl!
I'll take care of the knight errants!

779
01:24:24,784 --> 01:24:27,207
They're coming! They're coming!

780
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:30,175
Fire at will!

781
01:24:35,642 --> 01:24:38,684
They come from behind!

782
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,648
Don't let them get away! Fire!

783
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,734
Aramis!

784
01:25:43,589 --> 01:25:45,669
Fire!

785
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:03,577
Thank you!

786
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:46,871
Come on, Rochefort!

787
01:27:46,872 --> 01:27:49,048
Come on!

788
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:54,988
- Aramis!
- Porthos!

789
01:28:58,669 --> 01:29:01,080
Aramis!

790
01:29:01,464 --> 01:29:03,496
Quickly!

791
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:55,392
...lead us not into temptation,
but deliever us from evil...

792
01:29:57,939 --> 01:29:59,732
What is it, sister?

793
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:03,601
My child.
Have no fear. Keep praying.

794
01:30:03,602 --> 01:30:06,766
- The shooting...
- Will soon be over.

795
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:09,785
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.

796
01:30:09,786 --> 01:30:12,769
- Monsieur D'Artagnan...
- He's here!

797
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:15,540
He will see you in a moment.

798
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:20,073
Go on with your prayers.
You should say a prayer for him.

799
01:30:20,074 --> 01:30:24,049
- And the gallant gentelemen with him.
- Yes.

800
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:30,090
- Is he truly here, sister?
- He will not leave except with you.

801
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,842
So...

802
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:35,894
I shall wait with you.

803
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:54,534
"Only Porthos could invent a
new way to disarm himself. "

804
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,749
Get away!

805
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:30,480
Child, you mustn't cry.

806
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:34,233
You must look your best for Monsieur D'Artagnan!

807
01:31:34,275 --> 01:31:36,272
Yes.

808
01:32:03,924 --> 01:32:09,301
- Why does it always have to be me?
- Perhaps you're getting too old, my dear fellow?

809
01:32:11,764 --> 01:32:15,069
Rochefort, where is he?

810
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:18,806
We haven't seen him.

811
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,976
Constance!

812
01:32:24,733 --> 01:32:26,812
Constance!

813
01:33:03,181 --> 01:33:07,842
You won't need a horse on the
journey you're taking, Madame.

814
01:33:07,843 --> 01:33:11,175
I warned you, did I not?

815
01:33:41,545 --> 01:33:45,795
Be advised, Gascon! Turn and run!

816
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:50,084
You murderer!

817
01:34:06,315 --> 01:34:08,858
Bastard!

818
01:35:08,657 --> 01:35:12,065
Stop! Stop fighting!

819
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:25,381
We are all here as judges.

820
01:37:25,475 --> 01:37:28,883
What is your sentence?

821
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:31,016
Death.

822
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:37,357
Death.

823
01:37:42,739 --> 01:37:46,820
Death.

824
01:37:57,626 --> 01:38:00,915
You are the headsman of me.

825
01:38:02,338 --> 01:38:07,585
As the Comte de la Fere with the
rights of high, middle and low justice,

826
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:13,468
- I order the death of this woman.
- Five pistoles.

827
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:37,028
D'Artagnan!

828
01:38:45,832 --> 01:38:47,290
No!

829
01:38:47,291 --> 01:38:52,119
No! You are not my judges.
Take me before a court! It is my right!

830
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:54,456
No!

831
01:38:57,883 --> 01:39:02,580
You take one more step, D'Artagnan,
and we will cross swords.

832
01:39:02,581 --> 01:39:06,299
I swear to God,
I'll kill you this time.

833
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:26,119
Two more pistoles for rowing the
boat. I'm a headsman, not a sailor.

834
01:40:45,803 --> 01:40:50,204
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your sword, please! And yours, too!

835
01:40:50,205 --> 01:40:54,091
In the name of his eminence, the Cardinal!

836
01:40:56,141 --> 01:41:00,290
D'Artagnan, I once held out my hand to you.

837
01:41:00,291 --> 01:41:02,307
I do not do so now.

838
01:41:02,308 --> 01:41:06,422
Now you'll stand charged for the murder
of a valued servant of the state.

839
01:41:06,423 --> 01:41:08,724
I fought Milady de Winter
with her own weapons.

840
01:41:08,725 --> 01:41:12,434
So you did. And won. Rochefort,
too, a very considerable achievement.

841
01:41:12,435 --> 01:41:16,299
But your victories are too expensive, Sir.
For me and for France.

842
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,845
I hold out France's hand for payment.

843
01:41:20,352 --> 01:41:25,298
I shall not pay one sou, shed one
tear, feel one grain of pity.

844
01:41:25,394 --> 01:41:29,211
Then you must be tried.
You will be condemned.

845
01:41:29,212 --> 01:41:31,394
I think not.

846
01:41:31,395 --> 01:41:33,936
For all that I have done,
I have a proper warrant.

847
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:38,417
Signed by whom? The Queen
can not, King would not.

848
01:41:38,418 --> 01:41:41,511
By your hand, Your Eminence.

849
01:41:42,188 --> 01:41:44,385
By my hand?

850
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:53,554
"By my hand and for
the good of the state...

851
01:41:53,555 --> 01:41:57,187
the bearer has done
what has been done. "

852
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:04,557
One should be careful of what one writes.

853
01:42:06,316 --> 01:42:09,639
And to whom one gives it.

854
01:42:11,732 --> 01:42:15,607
I must bear those rules in mind.

855
01:42:15,608 --> 01:42:20,786
This is a commission in the King's
musketeers. The name is blank,

856
01:42:20,787 --> 01:42:25,929
but it is to you I give it.
Your friends are free also.

857
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:29,063
Good day, Monsieur D'Artagnan.

858
01:42:43,445 --> 01:42:45,610
Athos,

859
01:42:45,611 --> 01:42:48,861
The Cardinal gave me this.

860
01:42:48,862 --> 01:42:53,856
I can't take it. It should go to you.

861
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,720
For the Comte de la FÃ¨re
it is too little,

862
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:02,555
for Athos, it is too much.
You earned it, child.

863
01:43:02,556 --> 01:43:04,863
Aramis, my dear friend.

864
01:43:04,864 --> 01:43:07,638
You're a man of education, of reading.

865
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:10,655
Please. You're far more
worthy of this than I am.

866
01:43:10,656 --> 01:43:14,106
You forget, I am a
Musketeer only temporarily.

867
01:43:14,107 --> 01:43:16,989
As soon as I find the time, I
intend to be ordained into priesthood.

868
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:20,823
Look at this. Does it suit
me? / Beautifully, but...

869
01:43:20,824 --> 01:43:24,858
- this would suit you much better.
- A lieutenantcy!

870
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:28,857
You flatter me very much. But, no.
One must ask oneself...

871
01:43:28,858 --> 01:43:33,359
is a commission
something for a gentleman?

872
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,075
But if I'm Lieutenant, I
shall lose all my friends!

873
01:43:35,076 --> 01:43:38,576
A lieutenant is too proud, too
note of private musketeers.

874
01:43:38,577 --> 01:43:42,274
Even those who were kind to him when
he first came. Young and foolish.

875
01:43:42,275 --> 01:43:45,224
Bumping into everyone,
challenge them to fight duels,

876
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:47,654
making a complete nuisance of himself.

877
01:43:47,703 --> 01:43:51,785
Brawling like a young ruffian with the
Cardinal's guards, while his friends,

878
01:43:51,786 --> 01:43:56,362
older and wiser, trying to restrain
him and keep him out of mischief.

879
01:43:56,363 --> 01:44:01,644
How we guided his faltering, boyish,
footsteps where he might have gooe astray!

880
01:44:01,645 --> 01:44:05,579
We educated him into the behaviour of polite society.

881
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:08,787
Taught him all of the fine arts
a young gentleman ought to know.

882
01:44:08,788 --> 01:44:15,900
Protected him from enemies, sheltered his youthful
innocence from the temptations of a wicked world.

883
01:44:15,901 --> 01:44:19,481
Where would he have been without us,
I should like to know?

884
01:44:19,482 --> 01:44:22,501
Or we without him?

885
01:44:22,502 --> 01:44:25,414
That was from the old days.
When we were indeed:

886
01:44:25,415 --> 01:44:30,326
"One for all and all for one".
