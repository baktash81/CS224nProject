1
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,014
Christian just got back
from vegas.

2
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,917
Yeah. It was just for
the weekend. Private thing.

3
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,720
- He knows everyone.
- Cool.

4
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,455
"Knows."
who "knows" anyone these days?

5
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,358
More like you hang out
when you're in vegas.

6
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,326
So where did you guys stay
in vegas?

7
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,230
I like the four seasons,
the mandalay.

8
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,431
I like the end of the strip

9
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,034
So I can watch the planes
fly into mccarran.

10
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,903
Well, it's good
to finally meet you, man.

11
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:55,307
It's good to finally, you know,
meet the man in person.

12
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,442
Yeah.

13
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,411
No problem.

14
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,048
And hey, I, um,

15
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,019
I really want to thank you
for giving me that role.

16
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,487
I didn't give you that role.

17
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,189
Your girlfriend
and the director did.

18
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,091
Yeah, but I heard I wasn't
exactly gerald's first choice.

19
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,127
Ryan, come on.
Don't say that.

20
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,796
No, he's right.
You weren't.

21
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,432
But I went to him and told him
that I'm paying for this movie,

22
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,834
So if he doesn't put my
assistant's boyfriend in it,

23
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,072
Then I'm pullin' out, and
that's when the panic sets in.

24
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,942
Panic.
Panic set in?

25
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,377
I mean, it's just a low-budget
slasher movie, christian.

26
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,513
I don't think people
were panicked by you.

27
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,515
I think, you know, they could
have found the money somehow,

28
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,884
But you made it easier, right?

29
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,722
Well, I have to admit, actually
I was a little bit panicked.

30
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,826
Fact of the matter is
I'm paying for this thing.

31
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,596
I heard from both of you
that he was right for the part.

32
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,165
Yeah, indirectly I had something
to do with you getting the role,

33
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,200
But if it wasn't for you
helping out with the casting

34
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,802
And convincing me
that this guy was,

35
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,403
You know, the best one
for the role,

36
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,307
Then yeah, you probably
wouldn't have the part.

37
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,944
And we thank you
for the favor.

38
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,347
I think we all made
the right decision.

39
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,886
You know, in the year
that she worked for me,

40
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,922
She never mentioned
having a boyfriend.

41
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,523
That is not true!
I did, too!

42
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,360
You just weren't
paying attention.

43
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,427
Really?

44
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,131
You guys look happy though.

45
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,034
Yeah, we are.
Really happy.

46
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,969
Yeah, really are.

47
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,210
And you guys?

48
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:42,347
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

49
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:47,319
I told you, baby, a year.
Just like us.

50
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,021
Yeah.

51
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,789
I like to keep things loose,
though.

52
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,292
I mean, I love her.

53
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,193
God, she's gorgeous.

54
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:59,398
But it's more fun to keep it
a little complicated.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Complicated?

56
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,903
Christian, what are you doing?
Where are you going with this?

57
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,338
Just being transparent, baby.

58
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,340
Being transparent
about what?

59
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,176
You know that phone app, amore?

60
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,178
It's kinda like
a girlfriend finder.

61
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,714
Yeah... I mean no.

62
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,150
Wh-what does it do?

63
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,019
It makes... Things simple.

64
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,089
Certain... Assignations.

65
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,490
Just really easy.

66
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,192
You know, you get live video,
make sure that people look

67
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,561
Exactly the way they do
in their profiles.

68
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,597
Assignations for...

69
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,366
What is that?

70
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,436
It means meetings, dude.

71
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,472
Oh! Okay.
Meetings for...

72
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,606
Hookups.

73
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:45,444
You know, girls, couples,
whatever, man.

74
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,379
Couples. Really?

75
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,082
Yes. Couples. Really.

76
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:55,120
I guess it's just, well,
I don't know, I'm...

77
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,556
I'm just a more
conventional guy.

78
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:02,094
Which is why you're with gina,
and I'm with tara.

79
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,629
And you don't get jealous?

80
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,565
Jealous?

81
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:11,103
Yeah. If there are other
people involved, like guys.

82
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:15,173
Well, it's mostly girls.
And no, I do not get jealous

83
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,542
Watching my girl hook up
with another chick.

84
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,979
Is this guy...
is this guy for real?

85
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,648
Are you for real?
Is he serious?

86
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,751
No, no, man.
I mean, I...

87
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,986
Look, you're the man. I'm...

88
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,756
I-I was just trying
to keep up with you.

89
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,993
Look, man, it's all about trust,
all right?

90
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,429
I trust her,
she trusts me.

91
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,498
Maybe if that trust wasn't
there, I couldn't handle it.

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,567
But since it is,
we have a good time.

93
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,536
Christian,
I'm sitting right here.

94
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,605
What do you mean,
you couldn't handle it?

95
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,074
Couldn't handle what?

96
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,178
The fact that I know you love me
makes me trust you.

97
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,915
That makes everything we do
more intense.

98
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,318
I'm sorry. Christian likes
to shock people.

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,620
I get it.

100
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,854
Or at least he tries to.

101
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,589
This has nothing to do
with shocking people.

102
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm just sick of the old school
shit about fucking propriety,

103
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,561
Etiquette and all that crap.

104
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,296
You've been around me
for a year.

105
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,764
It's just fuckin' annoying.

106
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,466
It's like when you're at
your family dinner on Sunday,

107
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,134
- And everyone's just lying...
- christian, I want to go.

108
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,969
- Can you get the fucking check?
- I've ordered the check.

109
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,970
It's comin'.
It's on its way.

110
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,272
Really?
How long does it take?

111
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,741
Mm. It's coming though.
Don't worry about it.

112
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,942
Oh, christian,
before I forget,

113
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,811
I'm finalizing all the rooms
for next month.

114
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,547
Are you definitely sure
that you're not gonna come?

115
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,348
Yeah, there's no way
I'm going to new mexico

116
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,284
And watch a bunch of kids
get tortured and killed

117
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,854
By some pissed-off ghost
in a warehouse.

118
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,391
Besides, I'll be busy
making my own little movies.

119
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,526
What do you mean,
you make your own movies?

120
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,063
On this, dude.

121
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:23,468
<i>♪ You get no more sympathy</i>

122
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,439
<i>♪ don't tell me</i>
<i>where you've been ♪</i>

123
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,476
<i>♪ don't need to know</i>
<i>your sins ♪</i>

124
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,115
Why in the hell did we have
to go to that damn dinner?

125
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,783
Gina insisted.

126
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,687
Plus I was kinda interested
to see who her new dude is.

127
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,990
What a fuckin' moron.
Gina's a smart girl.

128
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,391
You'd think she could
get with someone better

129
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,792
Than some loser actor.

130
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,131
What do you know about him?

131
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,133
Nothing.

132
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,203
I never even thought
this movie would get made.

133
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,808
Well, gina worked very hard
to make sure it happened.

134
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,944
I never even read the script.

135
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,179
I told gina if the mexicans or
whoever came up with the cash

136
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,448
That I would just match it.

137
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,784
Why aren't you involved
anymore, baby?

138
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,586
Why were you ever involved?

139
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,522
My father was on my ass about
doing something with my life.

140
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,092
When I told him I was doing
a movie, he got off my back.

141
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,263
Why are you wearing a robe?
Guy's almost over here.

142
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,270
What's with all the dudes
lately?

143
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,472
I don't know.
It's a phase.

144
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,508
I like the idea of someone
looking at something

145
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,243
They can't have.

146
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,845
Guy thing.
Power and control.

147
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,615
But sometimes they do have me.

148
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,785
Just those two times.
You didn't seem to mind.

149
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,656
I can't believe you
at dinner tonight.

150
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,125
All that shit that you
were telling them.

151
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,928
Is that why you're being
so distant and bitchy, huh?

152
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,130
Why do you even fucking care?

153
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,566
It's just my assistant
and some dumb actor.

154
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,335
I don't know.
I guess I'd like to keep

155
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,403
Some parts of my life private.

156
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,940
Some aspects of
my fucking life private.

157
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,277
Nobody has a private life
anymore, tara.

158
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,014
Okay. What do you talk
to your shrink about?

159
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,420
What do you talk about
when you see dr. Campbell?

160
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,222
I don't tell
dr. Campbell anything

161
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,725
That I wouldn't tell you.

162
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,461
That's a lie. That's not true.
You just lied to me.

163
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,997
What would you like to know?

164
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,399
I want to know what you
talk to dr. Campbell about.

165
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,934
I talk about my family.

166
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,103
I talk about my father trying
to control my fucking life.

167
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,738
What the fuck do you think
I talk to him about?

168
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,175
I don't know.
Other girls.

169
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,781
I'm more serious about you than
I have been with any other girl.

170
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,886
Hope you feel
the same way about me.

171
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,758
Christian, there's
a fucking guy coming over.

172
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,459
Really?

173
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,235
He's here.
On his way down the driveway.

174
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:14,239
And I said I hope you
feel the same way about me.

175
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,547
What was with you tonight, hmm?
At dinner.

176
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,453
You were so tense. Hmm?

177
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,330
You let him in.

178
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,177
Hi. Reed, right?

179
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,012
Come on in.

180
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,350
I'm tara.

181
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,556
This is reed.

182
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,025
What's up, man?
I'm christian.

183
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,493
Hey, man.

184
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,195
I see you've met tara.

185
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,996
Yeah.

186
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,999
You want something to drink?
Shot of tequila.

187
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,367
Sure.

188
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,874
She's hot, right?

189
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,714
Way hotter than
the pics you sent me.

190
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,885
Have a drink.

191
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,453
Relax.

192
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,560
Be comfy, man.

193
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,092
You wanna see something
better than that.

194
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,291
How does he have
all that money again?

195
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,759
Uh, trust fund.

196
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,929
His grandparents own like
half of thousand oaks.

197
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,934
She's beautiful, tara,
don't you think?

198
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,238
She's okay.

199
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,710
Don't go there, babe.
I'm not doing that with you.

200
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,312
Doing what?

201
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,350
That whole "is that girl
prettier than me?" thing you do.

202
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,987
I mean, why are you
asking me that?

203
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,622
Look, you never even
mentioned her.

204
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,023
You never told me about her
for a year.

205
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,892
You didn't even mention her
by name.

206
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,861
It was just
"christian's girlfriend."

207
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,300
And you really didn't tell me
what a douchebag that guy is.

208
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,701
Christ!

209
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,272
The reason I never mentioned her
is that we never really hung out

210
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,041
Until she started
helping me with the movie.

211
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,043
Why was she even
helping you out?

212
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,678
She was bored.

213
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,848
She needed something to do
besides shopping and fucking.

214
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,484
I mean, jon and I
did most of the work,

215
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,253
But she helped out a little,
I guess.

216
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,226
She did push you
for the part.

217
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,662
I know it was probably a favor
to me and christian,

218
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,864
But without her, I don't know
what would've happened.

219
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,667
And then after casting,
she just disappeared.

220
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,036
She just stopped coming by
the production office.

221
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,106
I haven't seen her
in like a month.

222
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,305
Hey.

223
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,606
Thanks.

224
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,608
I told you not to text me.

225
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,110
Why can't I text you?

226
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,113
Because he looks
at my phone.

227
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,215
Why can't we meet
at my place?

228
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,550
That's not gonna happen
anymore.

229
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,523
So that's who you're with.
Jesus.

230
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,724
Who'd you think you were...

231
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,459
So this is the guy
that gave you the mercedes

232
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,261
And has a private jet
and takes you to maui

233
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,730
And lives in the fucking
mansion in malibu.

234
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,032
Ryan, please.

235
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,900
Last night killed me.

236
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,969
Why?

237
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,773
Because I finally saw you
with him.

238
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,975
I know you better
than he does.

239
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,044
You're not happy, tara.

240
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,047
Who said anything
about happy?

241
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,849
He takes care of me,
and he's in love with me.

242
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,251
It's serious.

243
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,553
Fuck it, ryan. Who's happy?
Who's really happy?

244
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,721
- Tell me.
- Gina.

245
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,790
- Oh, of course.
- Gina is. Gina's happy.

246
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,825
Right, another reason why I
couldn't stand being around her.

247
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,694
And... you really do
all that shit?

248
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,264
Couples?
Random guys fucking you?

249
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,332
- Jesus, tara.
- Ryan, stop.

250
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,867
This isn't
going anywhere, okay?

251
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,136
So there's no point
in having this discussion.

252
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,305
This has to end.
We can't do this anymore.

253
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,573
Why are you asking me
all this now?

254
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,309
Because I hadn't met him before,
and I do care.

255
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:02,113
I think about you all the time.
I can't help it.

256
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,182
And it makes me sick.

257
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,184
Can't get the things he
makes you do out of my mind.

258
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,785
- Ryan...
- how do you think I felt

259
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,687
Watching him flashing pictures
on his fucking phone

260
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,922
In front of me?

261
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:16,127
Last night made me sick.
It made me fuckin' sick.

262
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,995
We can't do this anymore.
This has gotta end.

263
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,997
What's gotta end, hmm?
What?

264
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,666
Fucking me
for the last four weeks?

265
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:22,667
You wanna end that?

266
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,103
Stop, ryan.

267
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,005
You ever tell him about me?
Did you ever tell him

268
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,941
That you fell in love with me
three years ago?

269
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,142
That you dumped me
when you realized

270
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,310
I was the guy
who might not make it,

271
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,845
That you essentially
abandoned me

272
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,379
For a bunch
of rich douchebags?

273
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,848
- And now that asshole?
- Ryan!

274
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,050
Who are you, ryan?
You're still bartending.

275
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,985
You're still working for randall
as a part-time assistant

276
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,520
At a fucking hotel.

277
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,655
This dumb little movie's not
going to do anything for you.

278
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,891
- Then why push me for it?
- Oh, I don't know.

279
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:51,229
Because I care about you
and knew how much you wanted it?

280
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,232
See, that's what
I'm saying, baby.

281
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,235
I loved you so much, baby.
We had so much fun together.

282
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,871
I never got over it
when you left.

283
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,073
It killed me, and I tried
so hard to let it go.

284
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,142
I tried so hard
to let go of it.

285
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,711
And just when I think I'm
gonna make it without you,

286
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,780
Gina suddenly started talking
about her boss's girlfriend.

287
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,650
But this girl she described
didn't sound anything like you.

288
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:18,022
And then when I saw you
at that audition...

289
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,958
I'm still
so in love with you.

290
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,262
I don't fuckin' want to be,
but I am.

291
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,500
I'm with him now.
I'm with him.

292
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,968
What are you thinking?

293
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,637
You think you're gonna nail
this guy, move in with him?

294
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,238
You think that creep's
gonna marry you?

295
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,940
Ryan, don't go there.

296
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,676
It's hard for me, too, okay?
It's hard for me, too.

297
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,646
That's why I tried helping you
with the movie 'cause I care.

298
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,915
But you don't have to go and say
things that are gonna hurt me.

299
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,617
- Leave him. Get out of there.
- And do what?

300
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,486
I don't know. Come back to me.
We'll get a job.

301
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,923
- We'll move in together.
- Get a job and do what, ryan?

302
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,159
Do you not remember how hard
we were busting our asses?

303
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,627
Do you remember those days?

304
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,497
No, wait. Probably not because
you're still living them.

305
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,933
I'm not going back
to that, ryan.

306
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,668
I'm not going back
to going on auditions

307
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,169
For jobs I'm never gonna get.

308
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,638
For bartending
for 8 bucks a fucking hour.

309
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,007
I'm not gonna do it.

310
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,876
Do you remember
how hard it was for us?

311
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,045
We were always fucking broke.
We were busting our asses.

312
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,880
We couldn't even pay
the fucking rent, ryan.

313
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,782
We couldn't pay
the fucking rent.

314
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,518
That wasn't fun for me.
I'm not going back to that.

315
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,186
And I need someone
to take care of me.

316
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,422
And I needed someone
to take care of me.

317
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,151
- Hey.
- Hey.

318
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,257
Want me to get you
something to drink?

319
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,060
Yes. Water.

320
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,580
Oh. How was your day?

321
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,349
It was fine.

322
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,629
Why don't you tell me
about your day instead?

323
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:16,367
Okay. I got up, and I taught
two yoga sessions this morning,

324
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,768
And then, oh, I went
to that audition,

325
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,470
You know, the one that
I told you about last time.

326
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,971
It was awful.

327
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,841
I definitely didn't get the job,
but whatever.

328
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,176
Oh, my god,
and then sheely called me,

329
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,012
And she started telling me
all about this guy.

330
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,162
- Goddamn it!
- What?

331
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,730
What's wrong?

332
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,433
Why the fuck
did you do that? Why?

333
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,769
I just get into it
with you, okay?

334
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,738
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

335
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,073
Look...

336
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,846
This... Is just this.

337
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,082
What does that mean?

338
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,156
I think you're hot.

339
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,124
I have fun.

340
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,060
But it's not changing
my situation.

341
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,807
Okay, what's really
going on here?

342
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,979
I think tara's
seeing somebody.

343
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,514
Oh, jesus.

344
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,784
Christian, what does that
even mean, okay?

345
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,420
Considering what you guys do.

346
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,721
I mean, do you even care?

347
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:21,058
Yes, I care.
I care a lot.

348
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,028
What, you think
she's cheating on you?

349
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,334
She was acting really, really
strange at dinner last night.

350
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,803
I couldn't figure out why.

351
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,273
And then today she met some guy
in the morning for coffee.

352
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,376
- It's just, she...
- okay.

353
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,445
I mean, how do you know
that she met someone?

354
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,181
- What, did she tell you?
- No.

355
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,752
Okay, did...
what, did the guy tell you?

356
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,690
No.

357
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,767
Um...

358
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,203
I've got some stuff
I have to do today.

359
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,372
I think you better leave.

360
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,215
And I don't think
you should come back here.

361
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,655
And why's that?

362
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,997
I can't handle this anymore.

363
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,944
Need some cash?

364
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,681
No. Christian,
I don't need any cash.

365
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,017
Just... just get out.

366
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,524
Come on, cynthia.

367
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:03,160
Get the fuck out.

368
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,636
Get the fuck out of here!

369
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,145
I'm really sorry that
I didn't congratulate you

370
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,380
On starting
your own pr company.

371
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,616
I mean, that must be
really exciting.

372
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,885
Don't congratulate me just yet.
It hasn't really taken off.

373
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,521
But you know,
if it wasn't for christian

374
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:33,223
I'd never have been able
to start it.

375
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,827
Yeah. Christian can be
very helpful that way.

376
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,668
So dinner was fun
last night.

377
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,706
I'm sorry if I, you know,
seemed out of it and such.

378
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,908
I was just really
preoccupied with things.

379
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,309
I know how christian gets.

380
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:57,615
And I have to say that ryan
was a little shocked by him.

381
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,850
But he really liked him.
He thought he was a great guy.

382
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,285
Oh, really? He did?

383
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,554
Yeah.
Thought he was really cool.

384
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,756
You know, good guys are really
hard to come by these days,

385
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:08,025
- So you're a very lucky girl.
- Tell me about it.

386
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:11,395
I can't believe I actually
found someone so genuine.

387
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,796
He's a great guy.

388
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,232
Look, this was nice.

389
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,901
I just, um...

390
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,970
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to know something.

391
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,172
What?

392
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,174
Why are you off the movie?

393
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,043
I mean, you're not coming
to new mexico, right?

394
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,113
Oh, no. Yeah, I can't.
No, I can't do that.

395
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,849
I'm just curious because
I'm finalizing everything,

396
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:36,220
And, I don't know, you just
seemed so into it a month ago.

397
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,288
Yeah, I mean...

398
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,860
Okay, tell me something.

399
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:45,262
Do you really like movies?

400
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,630
Yeah!

401
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,600
- Really, really like movies?
- Of course!

402
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:52,202
When's the last time you went
to see a movie in the theater?

403
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,806
A movie that you really thought
meant something to you?

404
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,675
We went to the premiere
last week...

405
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,444
Not premieres.
Premieres don't really count.

406
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,679
I don't know, you know.

407
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,715
I guess maybe it's just
not my thing anymore.

408
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,784
And plus I don't wanna be
away from christian

409
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:07,851
For that long, I guess.

410
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,553
I get it.
I totally get it.

411
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,589
I wouldn't want to be away
from ryan for that long either.

412
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,626
No, it's just,
at the time I was bored,

413
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,361
And I needed
something to do.

414
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:20,464
And so that's why
I got involved, and...

415
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,801
You know, now I'm looking for
something else to do, so...

416
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,178
Are you okay?

417
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,879
Yeah, I'm just...

418
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,614
I just have
a lot of stuff going.

419
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,184
I'm so preoccupied and...

420
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:43,187
Look, I really have to go.

421
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,093
Wait! Stop.
It's on me.

422
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,828
I can bill it
to the production.

423
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,596
Seriously.
Tara, it's okay.

424
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,431
Thank you.

425
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,134
Good seeing you, gina.
Um, we'll talk soon.

426
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,902
Bye.

427
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,571
Bye, tara.

428
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:16,487
<i>Yo.</i>

429
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,555
- So I just had lunch with her.
- <i>Yeah, and?</i>

430
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,224
- Nothing.
- <i>Nothing.</i>

431
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,959
Nope. Nothing.

432
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,161
She said really nice things
about you.

433
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:29,366
I mean, she seemed
a little tense, but nothing.

434
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:33,137
She's not coming to new mexico
because she said she'd miss you.

435
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,404
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

436
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,773
<i>Christian,</i>
<i>I'm just wondering.</i>

437
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,041
<i>What did you think</i>
<i>she was gonna say to me?</i>

438
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,510
Nothing, babe.
I just want the chance

439
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,145
For the two of you
to reconnect.

440
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:42,813
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

441
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,782
<i>Uh, okay.</i>
<i>I'll be at the office.</i>

442
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,984
All right, babe.
See you there.

443
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,722
Oh, very good. Sexy.

444
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,225
Yeah. Keep it.
Ha ha.

445
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,693
Pick up your chin.

446
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,929
Yes, very good. Smile.

447
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,365
Muscle up. Come on.
Give me some attitude.

448
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:03,267
That's good. Profile.

449
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,402
Lower the chin.
Very good.

450
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:08,839
Billy, switch the lights.

451
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,074
He's pretty cute.

452
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,143
Not again, doll.
It's not gonna work.

453
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,546
Ryan, on your mark.

454
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,648
Hey, ryan.
That's your name, right?

455
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,716
Right. Get on the mark.

456
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,154
Good. Keep it right there.

457
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,689
Okay.

458
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,793
Yeah, a month. Yeah.

459
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,495
But zander said he would find
someone to take my place

460
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,463
Just until I got back.

461
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:36,600
No, jeff, zander said it was
cool if he gave me his shifts.

462
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:39,203
Jeff!

463
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:43,407
Jeff, come on, man.
I just really need the cash.

464
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,043
If you're gonna make me beg,
then fuck it.

465
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,712
I'll see you later. Bye.

466
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,889
- I'm gonna head on up.
- All right.

467
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,524
Thanks, man.

468
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,493
We're also handling
the leo event,

469
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,495
The green global thing?

470
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,966
Listen, I gotta go.
Ryan's here.

471
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,568
I know it isn't.

472
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,638
Yeah, I think we're all
about to find out why.

473
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,174
Later.

474
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,379
Ah! Even on his day off,

475
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,949
It is always a pleasure
to see my favorite assistant.

476
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,251
Thanks, randall, for the first
and only compliment

477
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,753
I'm going to receive today.

478
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,589
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's wrong?

479
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,157
I-I was just, uh...

480
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,859
I was just trying to get
extra shifts at the bar,

481
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:09,993
But jeff's being a prick.

482
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,795
Well, what can I do
to help?

483
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,931
Well, I was wondering
if there was anything else

484
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,233
I could do around here.

485
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,536
You know, when I offered you
this job, it was full-time.

486
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,004
I know, I know.

487
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,274
But I let you make it part-time
because you wanted it that way.

488
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,877
Randall, I'm going
to new mexico for a month.

489
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:29,680
They're barely paying me
anything to do this movie.

490
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,214
I really need the cash.

491
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,416
Can I ask you something?

492
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,451
Have you ever considered...
I don't know.

493
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,522
Making plans
for a sustainable future?

494
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,723
Hmm?

495
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,429
What am I
gonna do with you?

496
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,934
You've been really cool,
randall.

497
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,336
I really, you know...

498
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,237
You know how much I appreciate
what you've done for me.

499
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,239
You know you'll have
this job waiting for you

500
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,374
When you get back.

501
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,042
You know that, right?

502
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,345
You'll have this, at least.

503
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,514
I'm so strapped.

504
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,295
What is it?

505
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:21,865
Oh, man, I totally forgot
I have this appointment.

506
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,300
Yeah, of course you did.

507
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,836
Well, I will see you
tomorrow, ryan.

508
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,838
And I'll see
what I can find for you.

509
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,474
- Thanks, randall.
- Uh-huh.

510
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,322
Shh. Don't worry, baby.

511
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,124
Gonna be all right.

512
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,494
Gonna be okay.

513
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,970
- He in?
- Hey. Yeah.

514
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,872
- Let me just tell him...
- keep an eye on that for me.

515
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,073
Oh...

516
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,876
Hey, christian.

517
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,678
No girls allowed.

518
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,081
Hey, christian.

519
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,649
What's that?

520
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:03,253
Going over effects
the budget will allow.

521
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,522
Even though my boyfriend
is the effects supervisor,

522
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,792
He's not doing this for free,
so we have to pick and choose.

523
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,828
That little bitch.

524
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,632
I wanna talk to you
about something.

525
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,100
Yep?

526
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,070
What is it?

527
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,606
Ryan.

528
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,713
Ryan.

529
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:32,849
Another topic my boyfriend
loves to hate.

530
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,117
Really? Why's that?

531
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,619
Every movie I've produced,

532
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,621
He thinks I'm trying
to bang the leading man,

533
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:41,958
And, uh, half the time,
he's been wrong.

534
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,263
I want you to call ryan in
tomorrow.

535
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,565
Tell him he's been replaced.

536
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,500
What? Why?

537
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,003
What happened?
What's gerald's problem?

538
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,304
This has nothing
to do with gerald,

539
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,473
And ryan's not actually
being replaced.

540
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,141
I don't get it.

541
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,609
Just call ryan in
and tell him

542
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,411
That gerald's thinking of
taking him out of the movie.

543
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,547
And you, jon,
can convince him otherwise

544
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:08,084
If ryan's willing
to do something for you.

545
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,353
Like what?

546
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,089
Tell him he gets to keep
the part if he sleeps with you.

547
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,633
Why the hell
would I do that?

548
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,901
Favor to me.

549
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,736
You're not joking, huh?

550
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,772
No, I am not.

551
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,674
Christian,
I'm friends with gina.

552
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:33,243
Ryan is totally straight.

553
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:34,377
Really?

554
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,047
You think
he's totally straight?

555
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:39,082
That's what I believe, yeah.

556
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,484
So how did he get the job
at the hotel, huh?

557
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:45,689
'Cause he's so straight
or 'cause he's so, um, smart?

558
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,791
Christian, I'm best friends
with gina,

559
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,693
And I can't do this to her.

560
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,729
Jon, jon, jon.

561
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,631
Relax.

562
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,599
It's just a prank.

563
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,069
Test ryan,
see what his reaction is.

564
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,104
Afterwards, you can tell him
it's a joke.

565
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,772
And if he has the balls
to go to gina

566
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,741
And tell her about
your little prank,

567
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,643
Then just say,
"christian put me up to it."

568
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,912
Blame it on me.
I'll take full responsibility.

569
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:11,081
Chris, I don't think
I can do this.

570
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,819
Jon, there are a lot
of people in this town

571
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,187
Who call themselves
producers.

572
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,791
You're just one.

573
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,565
Okay.

574
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,333
Okay.

575
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,335
But I still don't get it.

576
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:33,970
You don't need to.

577
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,206
Besides, you might get lucky.

578
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,212
Hey, tara!

579
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,215
Baby!

580
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,727

584
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,014
Hi.

585
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,283
What'd you do today?

586
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,286
- I went to the gym.
- Which gym?

587
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:59,289
Equinox.
The gym that I'm a member of.

588
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,624
The one on westwood
or the one on sunset?

589
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,460
The one in west hollywood.

590
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,161
Why'd you go to the one
in west hollywood?

591
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,264
Because it was closer to where
I was meeting gina for lunch.

592
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:11,334
What time did you
go to the gym?

593
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,940
Tell me something,
do you find gina attractive?

594
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:20,076
No. I'd never hire an assistant
I find attractive.

595
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,744
Why not?
She's a pretty girl.

596
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,213
Do you find ryan attractive?

597
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:24,714
Okay, here we go.

598
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:27,417
No, I don't.

599
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:30,086
Well, I figured you have to find
him attractive on some level.

600
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,521
You cast him as the lead
in the movie.

601
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,723
No, no, that's not true.

602
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,358
I did not cast him
in the movie.

603
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,194
All right, you made me cast him
as the lead in the movie.

604
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,163
No, we've been over this.
I didn't make you do anything.

605
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,898
You hired him
as a favor to gina,

606
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,967
And that's why
he's in the movie, isn't it?

607
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,602
Would you fuck him?

608
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,470
What did you just
fucking ask me?

609
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:53,042
I said
would... You... Fuck... Him?

610
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,047
No... I... Wouldn't.

611
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,787
Did actors in the past,
and I have two words for them:

612
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,656
Never again.

613
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,424
I just thought maybe
you two knew each other.

614
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:09,492
Maybe you met before.

615
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,461
When? When would we have
met before?

616
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:13,162
Please, enlighten me.

617
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,933
Maybe your modeling days
when you first got to la.

618
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,069
Oh, god, no,
I hadn't, christian.

619
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,671
But you know, who knows?

620
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,473
I was pretty wasted
during those days.

621
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,308
So anything's possible, right?

622
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,944
Come on.

623
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,613
Christian, why are you
asking me these things?

624
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,082
No reason. You're the one
getting all defensive.

625
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,051
I'm chill, baby.

626
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,820
Why are you asking me
about ryan?

627
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,924
I just thought maybe
the two of you had met before.

628
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:45,128
No. Nope.
We had not.

629
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,463
We had not met before.

630
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,201
I'm gonna get another.
You want one?

631
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,603
Yeah.

632
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:56,839
After that interrogation,
give me a fucking double.

633
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,543
How was your day?

634
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,446
Did you go to the gym today?

635
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,284

Hey, babe!

642
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,932
- Hey, babe.
- How'd it go?

643
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:59,702
Uh, I don't think I got it.
Too many other guys.

644
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,704
I'm sorry, babe.

645
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,679
What are you doing?

646
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,382
Christian does yoga
with cynthia gray?

647
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:14,851
What?

648
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,719
I'm just looking
at his schedule.

649
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,054
Do you know her?

650
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,390
Yeah. Actually, I was
in an acting class with her

651
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,891
A few years ago.

652
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,560
Weird to see
her name again.

653
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:27,697
So she's teaching yoga now.
Typical.

654
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,232
Right, that's exactly
what christian's doing

655
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:32,335
When he's over with cynthia.
It's yoga. Sure.

656
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,474
So I had lunch
with tara today.

657
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,576
- You did?
- Yeah.

658
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,115
You okay?

659
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,851
Yeah. Yeah, I just...

660
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,653
I don't know. I guess
I'm a little surprised

661
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,288
After what you told me
about her last night.

662
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,958
Yeah, I know, but christian
asked me to go, so...

663
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,261
- Why?
- I don't know.

664
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:00,863
It was like he wanted me
to find out something.

665
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,866
- Like what?
- I really don't know.

666
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,968
Afterwards, it just confirmed
everything he already knew,

667
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,337
Which is that she doesn't
wanna have anything more

668
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,906
To do with the movie.

669
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,908
What else did she say?

670
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,810
Well, I don't think
she believed me

671
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:16,979
When I told her you thought
christian was cool.

672
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,116
- Why would you tell her that?
- Huh?

673
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:23,086
That... why would you say that
I thought christian was cool?

674
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,756
What does it matter? You don't
care that I said that, right?

675
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,693
Ryan?

676
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,765
You can tell her
whatever you want, babe.

677
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,171
I mean,
I don't even know her.

678
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,075
She also seemed...

679
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,112
I don't know,
she seemed scared.

680
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,981
Really anxious.

681
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:54,350
She kinda reminded me
of like one of those girls

682
00:45:54,352 --> 00:46:00,123
In those movies that's being
followed by somebody.

683
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,493
I... I don't know.
It was just very weird.

684
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,412
- Hey!
- Hey. Is everything okay?

685
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,248
I mean, you said we couldn't
talk about this on the phone.

686
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,516
I asked gina
what this was about.

687
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,585
- She had no idea.
- Ryan, it's okay.

688
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,520
Close the door.

689
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,656
But why?

690
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:09,492
Uh, there's no one here.

691
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,462
Close the door, ryan.

692
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,004
Can we make this fast?

693
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,140
I'd rather just stand,
if that's okay.

694
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,441
What's going on?

695
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,510
Why are you calling me
to the office

696
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,478
At 11:00 at night, jon?

697
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,881
Look, I'll be upfront.

698
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,851
Gerald is still having problems
with you for the lead.

699
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,352
I know you've known this,

700
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,222
And even though you've been
officially cast for this,

701
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:40,723
He's reconsidering.

702
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,491
You're fucking kidding me.

703
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:45,494
No. I'm not
fucking kidding you.

704
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,367
What does this mean?

705
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,637
What does
"reconsidering" mean?

706
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,007
We're shooting in a month, jon.
I put my whole life on hold.

707
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,675
Sit down.

708
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,851
Well...

709
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:12,889
I'm the one with the direct line
to chris and gerald.

710
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:14,724
Has gina been told about this?

711
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,959
No, gina hasn't been
told about this.

712
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:21,564
If gina hasn't been told about
this, then why am I here?

713
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,932
I'm calling her.

714
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:27,536
No, don't.
Put the phone away.

715
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:30,039
Ryan, put the phone down!

716
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,410
I can make sure
you keep the role.

717
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,980
Yeah?

718
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,217
How's that?

719
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,623
Well, I'm going out to, uh,

720
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,359
Palm springs this weekend,
and, uh...

721
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:54,697
Well, why don't you come?

722
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,167
Aren't you going with billy?

723
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,435
No.

724
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,939
You mean me and gina?

725
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:06,175
No. Just, um...

726
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,212
Just me and you.

727
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,818
Well...

728
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:21,190
Sure. Why not? But...

729
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:22,558
Why wait?

730
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,926
Exactly.

731
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,995
Let's do it now.

732
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,596
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

733
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:29,365
Suck me off right now.

734
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,001
Right here. Now.
In the office.

735
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,469
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

736
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,038
Come on. Get to work.
Fuckin' put it in your mouth.

737
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Seriously?

738
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,742
Seriously. Come on.

739
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,078
I need to get off.
Make it hard.

740
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,380
Is this what you want?

741
00:49:44,382 --> 00:49:48,684
Suck me off right now.
You know you want it.

742
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,108
Hey, cynthia?

743
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,912
Hey, uh, this is ryan from
suzie waiter's acting class.

744
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:21,717
Yeah, yeah, I know. It's...
it's been a long time.

745
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,721
Listen, I wanted
to ask you something.

746
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,848
Who is this?

747
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,709
I'm going out.
Amber texted me.

748
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,479
We're gonna have a drink
or see a movie or something.

749
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,247
Cool.

750
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,882
Really? That's it?

751
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:02,918
You're not gonna ask me where
I'm going or when I'll be home?

752
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,986
Nothing?

753
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:07,456
No. I trust you, baby.

754
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,425
Okay.

755
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:11,760
I'm gonna
take a shower first.

756
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:03,105
Okay. I'm going out.
I'll be back in a bit.

757
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,874
Okay.

758
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,876
What are you gonna do?

759
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:10,512
Go online.

760
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,715
Look for somebody to be here
when you get back.

761
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:15,417
Oh, okay.
Really? Tonight?

762
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,853
Yeah. Really.

763
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,055
Okay.

764
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,695
You smell nice.

765
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,297
Thank you.

766
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,185
Hey, it's me.

767
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:53,389
I need you to come over now.

768
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:00,062

779
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:28,350
- So, you remember me?
- No, I don't.

780
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:32,855
Yeah, I used to date christian,
you know, before I met you.

781
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:35,557
- Great.
- You don't seem surprised.

782
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,793
Honestly, I don't really care
who christian dated.

783
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:39,795
And why would I be surprised?

784
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:43,031
Christian went out with
a lot of girls before me,

785
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,633
And I don't care.

786
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:48,103
Well, I would.
I would care.

787
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,172
Cynthia...

788
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:53,542
Really don't have a clue,
do you?

789
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:57,646
You don't know anything about me
and christian, do you?

790
00:56:57,648 --> 00:57:00,182
All right, you know what?

791
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,117
Lay it out, babe.
What kind of trouble am I in?

792
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,286
Tara, you know,
I have enough of a clue

793
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:06,789
To get into contact with you.

794
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,626
Okay, because I think, you need
to get out of this relationship.

795
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,829
I think you need
to get away from him.

796
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,967
Really?

797
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,369
Why?

798
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:23,839
Because he's sick.
He's a sick little boy.

799
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,042
Go on.

800
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,314
I mean, even though he was,
you know, fucking other girls,

801
00:57:32,316 --> 00:57:37,085
There were, of course, the
hookups that we did together.

802
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,955
I never wanted to.
I mean, he...

803
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,790
Always pressured me into them.

804
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,359
Really?
You didn't want to?

805
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:47,162
I'm assuming he does
the same thing with you.

806
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,300
Just finish your fucking story,
cynthia.

807
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,101
I need to get the hell
outta here.

808
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,471
Not really a story. No.

809
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:59,007
Just that moment when everything
became clarified for me.

810
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:02,077
You know, one night
when things got out of hand.

811
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,680
How?

812
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:09,685
I found myself
in the emergency room at ucla.

813
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:12,921
Hmm. How did that happen?

814
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:16,158
Christian decided to invite a
bunch of guys over to the house.

815
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,160
And you let him.

816
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,561
No.

817
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:22,865
Actually, I didn't.
I was passed out.

818
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,301
And who's fault was that,
cynthia, hmm?

819
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,403
Your precious christian
decided to crush up

820
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,839
A bunch of rufelin in a drink
that he gave me.

821
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,908
I never called him "precious,"
first of all.

822
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,776
I believe that was your name.

823
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,379
Secondly, it's "rohypnol."

824
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:40,148
- Third of all...
- you know what I meant.

825
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,283
I don't believe you.

826
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:43,118
Really.

827
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,187
You don't.

828
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,491
So what are you saying, cynthia?
What are you saying?

829
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,897
You saying that you didn't
let yourself get gang banged,

830
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:58,066
- That you had no control...
- he filmed the entire thing,

831
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,868
And then he threatened
to put it up on different sites

832
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,937
If I said anything
to anybody.

833
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,873
Obviously you weren't in control
of christian. I am.

834
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,175
I'm telling you this because
I think he's gonna hurt you

835
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,610
In the same way.

836
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,812
No, you're telling me this
because you're jealous

837
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,681
And a little drunk.

838
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:15,150
God, it's such
a girl-thing to do.

839
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,191
Look, christian's
not gonna hurt me.

840
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:26,395
If anything, I'm the one
that's gonna hurt him.

841
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,411
She's on her way back.

842
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,580
We got 20 minutes.

843
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,651
We are now hacking into
ryan's facebook page

844
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:24,353
Because you have to be friends
with him to look at it.

845
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:25,887
Bla bla bla.

846
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:30,325
And privacy block is on,
photos locked.

847
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,060
Is she friends with him?

848
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:33,829
No.

849
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,697
Are you sure?

850
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,200
Dude, I've been your tech guy
for like three years.

851
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,769
What is up with the paranoia?
I've never seen you like this.

852
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,874
Stop.

853
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:58,887
Christian, uh, you wanted me
to check the phone?

854
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,159
Think I found those deleted
texts you wanted me to see.

855
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,362
Um, not a lot of them,
but, uh,

856
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:11,900
I don't know what this means,
but it was sent to...

857
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,003
It was sent to ryan's phone.

858
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,643
How quickly can you hack
into his bank account?

859
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,040
Who was that?

860
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,542
Who?

861
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,544
The guy that just
walked out of the house.

862
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,046
Who in the fuck do you think
I'm talking about?

863
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,215
Oh, he brought me some weed.

864
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,284
You're such a liar.

865
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,455
How does that make me a liar?

866
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,524
It's not just that.

867
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,596
How was amber?

868
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,133
I wouldn't know.
I didn't see amber.

869
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,668
- You didn't?
- Nope.

870
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,836
Where'd you go?

871
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,410
Who's cynthia?

872
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,482
I don't know
who you're talking about.

873
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,785
Stop fucking lying, christian.

874
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,987
I know lots of cynthias.
What I meant was

875
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,690
I don't know which cynthia
you're referring to.

876
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,159
Fine. Okay.

877
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:47,229
Someone texted me because they
wanted to talk to me about you.

878
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:50,365
Turns out that it's some girl
you dated on the east side,

879
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,234
And not only did you
put her in the hospital,

880
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,202
But you invited
a bunch of fucking guys over

881
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:56,204
And then pulled a fucking train
on her, christian.

882
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,340
- I know the whole thing.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

883
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,875
- That didn't fucking happen!
- Christian, what the fuck?

884
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,710
- Oh, right, I'm sure.
- No, look.

885
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:03,545
I dated a girl named cynthia
before you...

886
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:04,713
Now you remember.

887
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:07,415
But none of that other shit
happened.

888
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,484
All right?

889
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,220
You're such a fucking liar.

890
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,688
I swear to god!

891
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,357
If it happened,
I would tell you.

892
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:16,825
It didn't fucking happen.

893
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,393
I don't know why
she would say that.

894
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,561
- I have no fucking clue.
- Me either!

895
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:20,962
I don't know why
she would say that either.

896
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,665
She's fucking on drugs,
and she's obsessed with me.

897
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:26,401
I don't know what the fuck is
wrong with... I-I don't know.

898
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,869
What kind of drugs
was she on? Roofies?

899
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:31,206
I have no idea. She's crazy.
I don't fucking know.

900
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:35,811
She probably is jealous that
I'm with you instead of her.

901
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,345
- But it did not happen.
- She's on drugs.

902
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:38,380
Yes.

903
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,315
If it happened,
I would tell you.

904
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,584
I swear to god.

905
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:45,921
- But it did not.
- Oh. Thanks.

906
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:49,124
It didn't though.
I swear.

907
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:51,693
Okay.

908
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,898
Who's that?

909
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,535
Nobody. It's... Whoever.
Nobody.

910
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,139
Christian, who is that?

911
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,007
It's just somebody
I invited over,

912
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,309
But we can do it
another night.

913
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:10,879
It's fine.
We can cancel.

914
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:13,782
No. Tell 'em to come over.

915
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:17,285
Are you sure?
I mean, they're close, but...

916
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:19,921
No. Don't cancel.

917
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,792
Where you going?

918
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,100
Tell 'em to meet me upstairs.

919
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,668
Yeah?

920
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,138
- They wanna use the pool first.
- Great. Whatever.

921
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,679
They're here.

922
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,348
Let 'em in.

923
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,922
It's a little less than that.

924
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:29,124
It's always nice to cool off.

925
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:32,327
Ooh, it's cold out there.

926
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,362
It's warmer upstairs.

927
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,997
Let's go upstairs.

928
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:58,019
This is tara.

929
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:01,523
Come on in.

930
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:19,774
Come here.

931
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,313
Hello.

932
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,660
Let me see my girls together,
come on.

933
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,929
Yeah, that's right.
That's what I wanna see.

934
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:42,998
I wanna see
the two of you together.

935
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,470
Just lie down.

936
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,607
Kiss him.
Fucking kiss him.

937
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,379
- Fucking kiss him.
- Come on, baby.

938
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,615
Now this is what
I wanna to see.

939
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,622
Kiss him.
Kiss him more.

940
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,407
Go down on him.

941
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:28,476
No, no, no.
Not you. Him.

942
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,913
Go, jerry.

943
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,221
You listen to me, okay?

944
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,091
Thank you.

945
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,393
- Strange how things work out.
- How do you mean?

946
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:22,197
Well, I remember liking you,
and then you ended up with tara.

947
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,832
Then I remember
liking christian,

948
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:26,334
And he ended up with tara.

949
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,336
I don't know
if I'm gonna find a guy,

950
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,872
Maybe I just need
to get out of la.

951
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:35,410
Yeah, it's a pretty
fucked-up town, isn't it?

952
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:38,313
Sure you don't wanna stay,
maybe grab some lunch?

953
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,081
I just wanted to come by
and hear what happened

954
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,716
And to thank you in person.

955
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:44,886
It sounded like a weird request,
but I appreciate it.

956
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:47,422
You took it a lot further
than I thought. Thanks.

957
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,591
First acting gig
I've had in years.

958
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,361
You really love tara?

959
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:56,397
Yeah. I mean,
I'm with someone, but yeah.

960
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,499
I'm sorry.

961
01:08:57,501 --> 01:09:00,301
Ryan, I let that go
a long time ago.

962
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:04,772
You realize that you have to let
it go, too, at a certain point?

963
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,141
I know.

964
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,099
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Why are you following me?

965
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:40,134
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you want, huh?

966
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,369
I don't know you!

967
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:44,205
I know who sent you!
Come on, admit it!

968
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,674
Fucking christian!

969
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,810
You want my picture, huh?
You want my picture?

970
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:49,911
Where's your phone?
Give it!

971
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,347
Nobody wants
your picture, okay?

972
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,684
I know, okay?

973
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,920
Tell christian I know
what the fuck he's doing.

974
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,788
Tell that piece of shit
I know!

975
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,709
What the fuck?

976
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:38,726
This can't be my phone.

977
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:40,361
Fuck.

978
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:36,077
What are you doing?

979
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,613
I was just looking
for my phone.

980
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:39,981
Did you find it?

981
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:43,551
Christian, why is my phone
in your drawer?

982
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:46,120
- Yeah, christian...
- did you find it?

983
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,756
- Christian, why was my phone...
- I know about you and ryan!

984
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,291
You fucking lying bitch!

985
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,727
Are you gonna fucking
admit it? Are you?

986
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:53,895
- Oh, shit!
- Are you gonna admit it

987
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,897
After I beat
the fucking shit out of you?

988
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,398
You fucking lied to me!

989
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,301
I trusted you,
and you lied to me!

990
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:03,137
- Christian...
- You lied!

991
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:09,177
Please! I really don't know
what you're talking about!

992
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,413
Jesus!

993
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,491
Oh, my god, I can't believe
how late I slept.

994
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,962
How was your run?

995
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:36,671
Babe, why are you drinking
tequila at noon?

996
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,374
Ryan.

997
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:44,645
I'm glad your boss
is seeing a shrink.

998
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,248
I've been looking
at christian's schedule.

999
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,317
Dr. Campbell, 3:00.

1000
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,686
How do you know that
dr. Campbell's a shrink?

1001
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,921
Stop it.
I googled him.

1002
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:56,157
What are you doing,
protecting this psycho?

1003
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,059
Why do you even care?

1004
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:00,728
Because he's a sick fuck.

1005
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:04,198
Ryan, I told you, you don't
have to like him. Wha...

1006
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,734
The movie's
not gonna happen, gina.

1007
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,402
I really don't know what
you're talking about right now.

1008
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:09,804
- The movie's not...
- the movie's happening.

1009
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,239
The movie's not gonna happen.

1010
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:13,474
Ryan, what did...
okay, stop. What did jon...

1011
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:15,243
It's not jon.
It's not gerald.

1012
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:17,512
It's not you. It's him.
It's christian.

1013
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,480
He's not gonna
let the movie happen.

1014
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,382
- You need to calm down.
- He's gonna pull out.

1015
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:23,551
- He's gonna fuckin' pull out.
- What are you talking about?

1016
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:26,721
I don't understand.
What? I don't understand!

1017
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,357
It's not gonna happen because
I've been fucking his girlfriend

1018
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,193
For the last month.

1019
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:37,265
It's not gonna happen because...
I'm in love with her.

1020
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,136
That's why tara stopped
working on the movie.

1021
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:45,640
I never told you this, but
we lived together for a year.

1022
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:47,041
Me and tara.

1023
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,044
She dumped me when she started
hooking up with christian.

1024
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,613
I hadn't seen her
in three years

1025
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,082
Until that day I walked
into the audition room,

1026
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,585
And then it started again.

1027
01:15:57,587 --> 01:16:00,187
And christian found out.

1028
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:01,856
He's had me followed,

1029
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,958
He's fucked with
my bank account,

1030
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,260
He's insane, and he knows
about me and tara.

1031
01:16:06,262 --> 01:16:10,097
That's why the movie's not
gonna happen, okay? Got it?

1032
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:17,371
I love you, baby.

1033
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,974
You believed in me.

1034
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:25,780
You helped me so much,
but I... I can't control it,

1035
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:27,949
How I feel about her.

1036
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,991
But she'll never be with you.

1037
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:41,062
She's not going back to that.

1038
01:16:41,064 --> 01:16:44,231
We can talk about this
as much as you want.

1039
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:48,102
I'll spend all day
talking about this,

1040
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,805
And then I want you
out of here.

1041
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,506
I want you to take
all your things,

1042
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,609
And I want you out of here.

1043
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,945
And then I'm going
to beg christian

1044
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,313
To keep the movie going.

1045
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,115
I don't care how much
I have to degrade myself.

1046
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,117
I will beg him
to keep the movie going.

1047
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,852
And I will make sure
that you are not

1048
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,587
Within a hundred miles
of that set

1049
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:09,090
For the duration
of the shoot.

1050
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,496
Usually I'm the one
in control.

1051
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:17,732
Last night I wasn't.

1052
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:19,867
None of it seemed real.

1053
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:21,736
Not when that guy
was sucking my dick

1054
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,372
Or when tara tried
to get him to fuck me.

1055
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:26,674
Which didn't happen, fyi.

1056
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,878
There were certain things

1057
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,949
That tara and the other girl
wanted us to do,

1058
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:39,220
And I don't even know
why I care.

1059
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:43,858
Just some dumb kids on the
internet I'll never see again.

1060
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:47,695
Just...

1061
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,697
Didn't feel like
I wasn't in control.

1062
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:52,767
I felt objectified.

1063
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,002
The way the two of them
just watched

1064
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:58,272
And told us what to do.

1065
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,677
Doesn't usually go down
like that.

1066
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:06,013
Usually I'm the one
directing the scene.

1067
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,483
It made me feel
like an actor.

1068
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:13,354
It's kinda like
how I feel when I'm here.

1069
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,022
You feel like an actor
when you are here?

1070
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:19,260
We're all actors, aren't we?
I mean...

1071
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,995
We all act differently,

1072
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:24,699
Depending on the situation
we're in or we're around.

1073
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:29,837
I don't act the same way with
you as I do when I'm with tara.

1074
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:34,375
Just last night and here...

1075
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,377
Were pronounced,

1076
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:40,114
That... Disconnect.

1077
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:43,884
So do you worry about being
an actor when you're here?

1078
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,520
It doesn't worry me.
I just don't like it.

1079
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:51,192
I don't like to feel
like I'm not in control.

1080
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:54,729
Have you processed that
coming here is non-negotiable?

1081
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,597
That it's mandatory?

1082
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:58,599
Have you been able
to accept that?

1083
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:00,534
You mean
have I processed it?

1084
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:02,536
I processed it.
I've accepted it.

1085
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,105
I just don't like it.

1086
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:05,873
Every day I think
what'll happen

1087
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,609
If I don't go back to
dr. Campbell's next week.

1088
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,278
This thought
is always on my mind.

1089
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,247
And the answer is?

1090
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,152
If I miss a session,
you will call the asshole.

1091
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:20,855
- The asshole being...
- My father.

1092
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:23,891
And if I told your father
you're missing sessions?

1093
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:28,229
Then the asshole will pull my
trust fund if I miss a session.

1094
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,268
What are you thinking?

1095
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:38,906
I'm thinking have I been here
long enough yet?

1096
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,641
And the answer is?

1097
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,225
Yeah, it's me.

1098
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:01,829
You there?
I got your little message.

1099
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:05,065
Ryan, ryan, ryan.

1100
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:08,068
Poor, poor ryan.

1101
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,606
It all seemed so exciting

1102
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:14,842
When you were 18,
and that photographer found you,

1103
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:20,614
<i>Class trip from michigan,</i>
<i>all the way out to los angeles.</i>

1104
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:22,316
<i>Yeah, hollywood.</i>

1105
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,984
<i>And you were suddenly</i>
<i>so far away</i>

1106
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,287
<i>From that shithole town</i>
<i>you grew up in,</i>

1107
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:28,255
<i>So you did</i>
<i>some modeling shoots.</i>

1108
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:30,457
<i>Everyone was so encouraging.</i>

1109
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:33,694
You even did
a commercial or two.

1110
01:20:33,696 --> 01:20:37,598
I saw one on youtube
for pringles.

1111
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,600
Looked like a fucking moron.

1112
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,937
<i>Then what, huh?</i>

1113
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:44,738
<i>Nothing.</i>

1114
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,540
<i>Nada.</i>

1115
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,542
<i>So now you're bartending with</i>
<i>the occasional hotel gig</i>

1116
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:50,244
<i>To supplement your income.</i>

1117
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,780
<i>That's just 'cause randall</i>
<i>wants to fuck you up the ass.</i>

1118
01:20:52,782 --> 01:20:54,915
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>You'd probably let him.</i>

1119
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:57,818
<i>He probably has.</i>

1120
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:01,021
<i>What happened last October</i>
<i>at the post ranch inn, huh?</i>

1121
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,823
You tell gina about that?

1122
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,492
I doubt you told gina
about that romantic drive

1123
01:21:05,494 --> 01:21:12,499
All the way up the coast
to the post ranch inn.

1124
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,768
And then bam!

1125
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:18,372
You reconnect with tara
last July.

1126
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,940
And then bam!

1127
01:21:19,942 --> 01:21:22,142
She convinces everyone
to cast you in a movie

1128
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:24,945
You're not even capable
of acting in.

1129
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:26,413
And then bam!

1130
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:28,616
You're fucking my girlfriend.

1131
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:30,918
<i>And bam!</i>

1132
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,788
<i>You convince cynthia to tell</i>
<i>everyone some bullshit story.</i>

1133
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,091
<i>So what, huh?</i>

1134
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:40,494
<i>You get tara to dump me?</i>

1135
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:43,564
So you guys can,
what, run away together?

1136
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:48,202
Get married?

1137
01:21:48,204 --> 01:21:49,970
So you can, what,

1138
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,840
Coexist in some
dump of a house somewhere?

1139
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:57,177
Think tara's going back
to that kind of life?

1140
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:00,114
You think she's going
to that lifestyle again?

1141
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:02,283
You want my advice, ryan?

1142
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:04,418
Go back to michigan
and get over it,

1143
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,488
You clueless
little motherfucker.

1144
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:21,201
What are you doing here?

1145
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:23,337
I just wanted
to talk to you.

1146
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:24,738
Why?

1147
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:32,980
Ryan.

1148
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:39,186
I had no idea
that you two knew each other.

1149
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,188
Interesting how small
this town really is.

1150
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,691
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1151
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:47,962
Come on, babe.
Your little story?

1152
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,167
- What story?
- The ucla hospital.

1153
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:55,936
Bunch of guys
running a train on you.

1154
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:58,238
There's no way
that kid's smart enough

1155
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,408
To come up with that
on his own.

1156
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,677
But I know somebody who is.

1157
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,114
What was I supposed to do?

1158
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:08,582
It worked, babe.

1159
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:12,619
You wanted my attention,
and you got it. Here I am.

1160
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:15,122
Come here, smarty pants.

1161
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,761
I'm not mad.
I thought it was cute.

1162
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:25,566
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1163
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:29,837
Did you really think I would
need to slip a girl a roofie?

1164
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,472
No.

1165
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,111
What I am interested in...

1166
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,282
Is how you guys
know each other.

1167
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:44,051
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1168
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,787
Yeah, but I am curious.
How'd you meet?

1169
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:48,956
Do you like him?

1170
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:51,258
Have you fucked him?
Has he got a big dick?

1171
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:55,162
Okay, yes, I... I met him
before he knew tara.

1172
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:57,698
We had the same
acting class together.

1173
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,168
And yes, we had a thing,
and then he met her,

1174
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,303
And then it was over.

1175
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,775
Very interesting.

1176
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,977
Interesting?

1177
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,679
Really?

1178
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,386
Why?

1179
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,191
And why does it even matter
to you anymore?

1180
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:27,027
What did you think
she was doing?

1181
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:31,865
I mean, I don't know, she dated
him for like a year or so,

1182
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:33,934
And then she dumped him.

1183
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,638
We didn't know each other
very well back then.

1184
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,440
I mean, we went to like
a few of the same parties,

1185
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,608
And I think we dated
a few of the same guys,

1186
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:45,345
But we weren't really friends
or anything.

1187
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:47,548
And then she met you.

1188
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:49,783
Christian?

1189
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:54,855
Christian, what are you doing?

1190
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,193
Hello?

1191
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,896
Christian?

1192
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,913
Christian, what the fuck?

1193
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,556
Christian! No! No!

1194
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,532
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1195
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,236
Why don't you
fucking answer?

1196
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,873
Pick up the fucking phone!

1197
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:00,621
Can't believe
what you did to her, dude.

1198
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:03,524
You are one sick fuck.

1199
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,883
Cynthia?

1200
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,150
Hi.

1201
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:38,819
Hi.

1202
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,724
Where were you?

1203
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:45,392
Dr. Campbell's.

1204
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:49,997
What's that?

1205
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:52,733
Um...

1206
01:27:55,503 --> 01:28:00,574
I'm gonna leave, okay?

1207
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:05,178
I'm gonna go stay with my sister
in santa barbara for a bit.

1208
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:17,124
I'm sorry about this morning.
About...

1209
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:18,892
About everything.

1210
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:22,896
Yeah, I know.
I know. I'm sorry, too.

1211
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,607
But I'm gonna leave anyway.

1212
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:36,843
I just... I need to hear
that you're okay with it.

1213
01:28:36,845 --> 01:28:39,880
I wanna know that
you're okay with me going.

1214
01:28:39,882 --> 01:28:42,149
Please.

1215
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,328
Will you please
just let me go?

1216
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,034
I loved you.

1217
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:07,374
I really... Loved you.

1218
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:12,913
In my own way,
but I loved you.

1219
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:15,849
I know, I know.

1220
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:18,585
I loved you, too.

1221
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:23,023
But I... I just need
to think about things.

1222
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:26,560
And I need to hear you say
that it's okay if I go.

1223
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:31,965
It's okay.

1224
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:36,803
I'll be fine.

1225
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:38,705
Thank you.

1226
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,608
Thank you.

1227
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,078
I need something from you.

1228
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,581
Yes, anything. Tell me.

1229
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:49,616
What do you need?

1230
01:29:49,618 --> 01:29:50,784
An alibi.

1231
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,357
Wha... What?

1232
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,559
For what?

1233
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:02,062
This afternoon.

1234
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,003
I-I don't understand.
What happened this afternoon?

1235
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:11,805
You went to...

1236
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,273
You just said you went
to dr. Campbell's.

1237
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:16,777
What did you...
what else happened?

1238
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:20,147
Something happened to cynthia.

1239
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,084
Christian...

1240
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,519
Christian, what happened?

1241
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:30,624
It's not important.

1242
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:34,027
Uh, I don't...
what happened?

1243
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:35,529
I don't get...
I don't understand.

1244
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:37,631
What do you mean,
something happened?

1245
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:43,103
I left dr. Campbell's at 3:55.

1246
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,905
Got here at 4:20.

1247
01:30:44,907 --> 01:30:49,109
You've been with me
ever since.

1248
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,011
Do you understand?

1249
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,218
Nod for me, baby.

1250
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,954
Nod for me.

1251
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,395
One more thing.

1252
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:15,602
If you ever see him again,

1253
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:18,104
If he ever contacts you,

1254
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:21,007
If he calls you,

1255
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:23,577
If you're even
in the same room together...

1256
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:30,584
I will kill him.

1257
01:31:30,586 --> 01:31:32,619
Look at me.

1258
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:37,023
I will kill him,
and I will get away with it.

1259
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,864
You understand?

1260
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,367
Yes.

1261
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,204
Nod for me, baby.

1262
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,477
Nod for me.

1263
01:31:57,479 --> 01:31:59,613
Okay, okay.

1264
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:04,317
That's a good girl.

1265
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:07,354
Good girl.

1266
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:26,573
So, you guys
just got back from dubai.

1267
01:32:26,575 --> 01:32:29,242
Yeah, we stayed
at the burj al arab.

1268
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:31,244
I thought you had a bad
experience at the burj?

1269
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:33,480
Thought you were only staying
at the atlantis now?

1270
01:32:33,482 --> 01:32:35,081
Yeah, but tara
had never been to dubai,

1271
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,550
So I thought
it'd be fun for her.

1272
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:39,653
It didn't matter to me.
I was in meetings all day.

1273
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:43,757
So how was dubai?
What'd you do there?

1274
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:47,827
You know, just shopped,
laid out.

1275
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:51,331
Weren't you working
on a movie?

1276
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:56,336
Yeah, uh, kind of.

1277
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:59,406
Yeah. How'd you know?

1278
01:32:59,408 --> 01:33:03,043
- We have a friend in common.
- Who?

1279
01:33:03,045 --> 01:33:05,478
Christian.

1280
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,314
Didn't you
used to go out with him?

1281
01:33:07,316 --> 01:33:09,783
Yeah.

1282
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:11,952
He's producing another movie
a friend of mine is in,

1283
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:14,688
And jaden told me that you and
christian used to live together

1284
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:18,091
And when I met you tonight,
I just put it all together.

1285
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:22,329
Yeah, christian and I
went out for about a year.

1286
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:23,863
And then when we broke up,

1287
01:33:23,865 --> 01:33:26,199
I decided to take myself
off the film.

1288
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:28,735
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was the breakup that bad?

1289
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,904
No. No, not at all.

1290
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:34,908
No, it's just, there were
a lot of things going on and...

1291
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,376
Wait, wasn't that...

1292
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:39,412
Was that around the time
when that girl was killed?

1293
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:43,249
Christian's yoga instructor
or something?

1294
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,153
Yeah, actually...

1295
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:51,224
Yeah, it was right around that
time that we broke up, yeah.

1296
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:54,294
They never found out
who did that, did they?

1297
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:59,899
No. I mean,
they had some suspects,

1298
01:33:59,901 --> 01:34:02,535
But aside from that, no.

1299
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:04,504
At the end, nothing.

1300
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:08,875
Didn't they find like a knife in
the car of someone's assistant?

1301
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:14,214
Yeah, but... I mean,
I heard that it was basically

1302
01:34:14,216 --> 01:34:17,317
Whoever killed
the person, her,

1303
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:19,019
Must have thrown it
in his car.

1304
01:34:19,021 --> 01:34:23,490
I mean, I was with him that
night, so it wasn't him, but...

1305
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,959
Yeah, after that...

1306
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:28,828
So they never
arrested anybody?

1307
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,830
No. Actually, no, they didn't.

1308
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:33,500
That's so scary.

1309
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:34,601
Yeah.

1310
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:38,471
How is christian doing,
by the way?

1311
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:40,473
Christian,
he's, um, he's good.

1312
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:42,475
We don't really talk
that much,

1313
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:45,512
Aside from texts
and facebook and stuff.

1314
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:47,914
But the last time I heard
from him was pretty recent,

1315
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:51,518
And he's doing great,
actually.

1316
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,588
Gonna go to the ladies' room.
I'll be right back.

1317
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:07,267
Good, good. I'm glad
you guys had a good time.

1318
01:35:07,269 --> 01:35:10,003
- She's cute, man.
- Yeah, she's cute.

1319
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:29,956
Hey! It's me.

1320
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:33,093
Yeah, I'm here with her
right now.

1321
01:35:33,095 --> 01:35:36,629
Yeah, we went to david's place
first for drinks.

1322
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:40,200
So... What do you
want me to do?

1323
01:35:40,202 --> 01:35:42,402
Anything you want me
to ask her

1324
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:45,171
Besides what you
already told me to?

1325
01:35:45,173 --> 01:35:49,943
She seems happy, even though
she's like totally faking it.

1326
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:52,512
