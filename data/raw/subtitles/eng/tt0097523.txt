1
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,424
Good morning, Quark.

2
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:06,266
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara...

3
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,302
to ask me if I had
a date to the dance.

4
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:11,803
No, they broke up for
religious differences.

5
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,568
She thought she was God
and he disagreed.

6
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:19,067
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.

7
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,842
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.

8
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,678
Maybe. Yeah.

9
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:29,554
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around
a while and keep an eye on Nick.

10
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,717
He likes to take things apart.

11
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:37,821
Well, that's why I watch it at your
house. Things'll cool off after today.

12
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:40,696
Dad has his big
show-and-tell at the lab.

13
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,861
Zap!

14
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:47,600
- It works! L-It really works!
- Nick, get real.

15
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,902
The subject has disappeared.

16
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,571
No, no, it's not that.

17
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:57,640
No. Mom and Dad had
an argument last night...

18
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,652
and Mom spent the night
at Grandma's.

19
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,688
I think she just needed a rest.

20
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,814
Right, her and me both.

21
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,451
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.

22
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,795
Amy, when's Mom coming home?

23
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:19,361
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.

24
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,270
If only Dad could get
that machine to work.

25
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,535
Breakfast.

26
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,201
I need a couple minutes here.

27
00:04:56,843 --> 00:05:01,906
"I'll be down in five minutes."

28
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,075
Typing with his gloves on again.

29
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,410
Oh, no, not again!

30
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:39,213
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?

31
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:45,688
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!

32
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,059
It's construction, honey. You of
all people should understand that.

33
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,329
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.

34
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,700
And I think he should have
consideration for other people.

35
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,638
Mm, give the guy a break.

36
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:05,007
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm!

37
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,739
Honey!

38
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,573
Szalinski!

39
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,675
But, honey, you are
much bigger than he is.

40
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,619
Szalinski!

41
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,157
- Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.

42
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,159
- Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?

43
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:22,855
- Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod!

44
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,263
Stop! Dad!

45
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:31,928
- Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.

46
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:35,099
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?

47
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:39,339
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?
- Gotta mark those trespassers, Dad.

48
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:42,904
- I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father!
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.

49
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,213
- Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.

50
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,845
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.

51
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:50,446
- Attila the Hun was
12 once, too, you know.
- Oh, come on.

52
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,793
He's sounding.

53
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,193
Weird family.

54
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,443
Dad?

55
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,575
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?

56
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:22,816
- That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.

57
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,723
- If you took all the
molecules in this house...
- Listen, Nick, I gotta get
this working before I leave.

58
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,159
Why don't you go help your sister?

59
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,304
Stay back, boy.
This thing works...

60
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:17,275
this'll put us up there with
the invention of electricity...

61
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:20,245
first man in space.

62
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,304
First dog in space.

63
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,554
Come on! Shrink!

64
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,220
Shrink!

65
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,166
Please, please, shrink.

66
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:46,000
Please, shrink.

67
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,889
On the other hand, we've come up with an
interesting way of making applesauce.

68
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,893
- You got it, honey.
- Sure?
- Positive.

69
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:16,197
You're wiping away brain cells,
and there aren't many to spare.

70
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,297
- Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.

71
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,308
Darn right.

72
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,305
Well, look who's decided to
join the land of the living.

73
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,111
And is Russell ready
for his big fishing trip?

74
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:34,017
- Not really, Dad.
- Not really?

75
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:37,056
There's a big fish out there
with your name on it.

76
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,489
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.

77
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,156
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?

78
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:49,531
There... I see nothing wrong
with wanting to take my son fishing.

79
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:53,094
Russell, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but he was cut from
the football team yesterday.

80
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:56,472
- What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't
need right now is to hear from you.

81
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,410
- He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...
- Captain of the team.

82
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:02,039
And if my father'd wanted me to go on
a fishing trip, I would've been gra...

83
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,948
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.

84
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,748
He is not too small for football!

85
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,619
Honey, when you say things like that,
you make him feel about this big.

86
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,057
If he wants to feel big,
he should act big.

87
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,397
Elbows up.

88
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,038
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.

89
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:29,132
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.

90
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,308
Here, Quark.

91
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,150
Eat it, Dad,
before it gets cold.

92
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:48,056
Mm, did you get
the machine to work?

93
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:51,359
Yeah. A few more bugs
to get out, but...

94
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:55,663
- What about the conference?
<i>- Meow.</i>

95
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,862
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.

96
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:02,738
Dad! Dad, wait. Dad!

97
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,039
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.

98
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,671
Dad, don't forget my dress from
the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...

99
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,772
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.

100
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,182
Wish me luck. I need luck
getting out of this door.

101
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:22,853
- House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.

102
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,897
<i>Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.</i>

103
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,489
He's just leaving
for the conference.

104
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,058
Dad, it's Mom.

105
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,263
- Where?
- On the phone.

106
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,397
- Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?

107
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:38,535
- Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.

108
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,512
- Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.

109
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm gonna meet him at
the mall later today.

110
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,809
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.

111
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,750
- Hiya.
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Nick!

112
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:51,951
- I called to wish you luck
at the conference.
- Look, Diane, if things go well...

113
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,755
this morning, everything'll change
around here, I promise you.

114
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,626
<i>Okay. I have</i>
<i>a house to show...</i>

115
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:59,995
and then I'll be home this
afternoon and we'll talk.

116
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,093
<i>- Good luck today.</i>
- Thanks. Bye, honey.

117
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,231
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make
this place spick-and-span, okay?

118
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:11,072
Nick, I want you to
mow the lawn. Amy...

119
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,411
good luck.

120
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:30,223
I'm helping my Dad with this
real important new invention.

121
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,094
So, mm...

122
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,158
I'll... I'll let you
mow half my yard.

123
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,726
No, thanks.

124
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:41,907
Wow! With that?

125
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:43,909
Yeah...

126
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,638
and...

127
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:47,646
this.

128
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,842
Oh, it's a remote control!

129
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,651
Tell you what. You thrown in
a box of cookies...

130
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:00,249
I'll let you cut the whole thing.

131
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,159
Uh, but I have to go
and meet Newt right now.

132
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,597
Uh, could I do it later?

133
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,659
- I don't think so, because, you know,
my Dad's gonna come home and...
- Aw, come on.

134
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:15,871
- Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.

135
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,536
- No problem.
- See you later!

136
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,581
Nothin' like a hard day's work.

137
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,725
French fries.

138
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,157
Tater Sticks.

139
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,927
Meat loaf.

140
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,230
Veal "parmedjian."

141
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,237
Hey, Dad, wanna go
play some baseball?

142
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:48,172
Hmm, baseball.

143
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:52,371
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.

144
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:55,312
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.

145
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:15,899
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal,
like play baseball?

146
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,403
Nope.

147
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,668
- Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.

148
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:26,439
- Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald!

149
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,605
Lug your stuff.

150
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,615
Later, worm.

151
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:40,255
Russell, gimme a hand here.

152
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:45,226
Russell! Gimme a hand here.

153
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,935
Dad, it's early.

154
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:52,995
The early worm catches
the fish, Russell.

155
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,004
Remember that.

156
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:00,773
The Forresters are coming by after
lunch, so come on! Quick march!

157
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:25,430
<i>Something here between us</i>
<i>is something that I can't resist</i>

158
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:33,540
<i>Aphysical attraction</i>
<i>Feel it every time we kiss</i>

159
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,638
Weird family.

160
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:40,516
<i>Oh, you got me so excited</i>
<i>Still it's not enough</i>

161
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:45,455
<i>I'm gonna try to fight it</i>
<i>till I know if this is love</i>

162
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,550
<i>Turn it up</i>

163
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:50,892
- Yeah!
<i>- Turn it up, ooh hoo</i>

164
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,790
<i>I love to hear</i>

165
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,600
Russell...

166
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:02,440
I know it seems strange
when you look at me today...

167
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:07,536
but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.

168
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:11,310
- I know, Dad. You've told me
about a million times.
- All right. Just hear me out.

169
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:14,717
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.

170
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:19,190
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds
of pure, unadulterated...

171
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:22,625
blitz-the-quarterback
and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.

172
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:27,792
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months...

173
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:31,462
you will be throwing farther,
you will be running faster...

174
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:34,472
and you will be hitting harder
than anybody else on that team.

175
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,763
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.

176
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:06,026
Um, Dad, you... you know that
weights aren't my thing.

177
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,971
Fishing isn't your thing.

178
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,341
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?

179
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,778
I don't know, but I'll
keep you posted, okay?

180
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:23,652
Fine. Until you do,
you're trying these.

181
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:27,557
And you're coming fishing
with the family. Is that clear?

182
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,255
I can't hear you!

183
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,991
Yes, sir.

184
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,431
Better.

185
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,959
Now, uh, lift with your legs,
not with your back.

186
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,846
What am I doing wrong, Spike?

187
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,588
Russell, you're not smoking
a cigarette, are you?

188
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,930
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.

189
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:25,373
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.

190
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:30,047
- Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?
- Tubular!

191
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,853
He's only 12, and he's already
thinking about construction.

192
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:38,420
- Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.

193
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,838
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of
the ninth. It's a clutch situation.

194
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:54,972
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.

195
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,743
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh!

196
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,377
He's never been good
on the high outside pitch.

197
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,616
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.

198
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,350
Grand...

199
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,752
slam.

200
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,290
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.

201
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:18,633
- Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.
Nobody saw it but you.

202
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:22,003
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.

203
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:25,305
You're not supposed to fink
on your own brother!

204
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,142
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that
you spend your allowance on... Uuh!

205
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,148
Come on, Russ!

206
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,286
Look, either you tell them
or I tell them, okay?

207
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,789
Okay. You tell 'em.

208
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:57,970
- Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...
- Tell them.

209
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:02,481
- What's going on?
- Hi. Um...

210
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:05,574
l-I'm Russ Thompson
from next door, uh...

211
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,380
Um...

212
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,718
Uh, my brother has something to
tell you, or else I could tell her.

213
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,055
Okay! See, I was playing
with my ball, right?

214
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,458
Well... Well, actually,
it's not my ball exactly.

215
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,326
- It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.

216
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,855
It never would've happened
if their house wasn't so close!

217
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,425
- He hit a baseball
through your attic window.
- He what?

218
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:27,597
It shouldn't have been closed
in the first place. It's a nice day!

219
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:31,439
- We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take
it out of his allowance, all right?
- My allowance? Dream on.

220
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,172
Okay, we'll just have
Dad pay for it, huh?

221
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,441
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.

222
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:39,382
Until you pay,
no man shall pass.

223
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,821
- You got nothin' to say
about it, space boy!
- Cool it!

224
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,881
Nick, take him upstairs and get him
his ball. And clean up the mess.

225
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,258
- What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't
have time to mess around.

226
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:56,495
Come on. This is what's wrong with
the American system of justice.

227
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,301
So, y... You like to dance, huh?

228
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:06,467
- How do you know?
- Well...

229
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,479
- You could see me?
- No.

230
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:12,608
Uh, no, l... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. L...

231
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,282
Awesome.

232
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,985
So your Dad's still in contact
with his home planet.

233
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:35,004
And given that my machine can
substantially reduce...

234
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:40,671
the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies...

235
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,544
the savings to the space program
would be staggering.

236
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:45,914
Mr. Szalinski, are you
trying to tell me that...

237
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,510
suddenly size is
no longer relative?

238
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,748
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is...

239
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:53,121
made up of not only density,
but of empty space.

240
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,660
And if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space<i>...</i>

241
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,595
in any given object, we can
thereby shrink the object.

242
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:01,758
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?

243
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:05,429
When Einstein came up with
the atomic bomb, did they ask
him to prove that it worked?

244
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,701
You, Mr. Szalinski,
are hardly Einstein.

245
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,346
- I picked a name.
- You have, however,
managed to shrink one thing...

246
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,677
the size of this audience.

247
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:20,708
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know
about you, but I'm going to lunch.

248
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,024
Wayne. Wayne.

249
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:34,065
- Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.

250
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,728
It will take time to convince
people without proof.

251
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,896
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.

252
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:44,371
By the way, you were right
about the electric flea collar.

253
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,377
The extension cord was a bad idea.

254
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:52,545
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.

255
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,686
Nick!

256
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,518
- Nick...
- Ron?
- If you guys are hiding up here...

257
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,754
it's not funny.

258
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:05,058
Nick, you know what Dad said.

259
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,190
You're not supposed
to be playing up here.

260
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:25,040
Where are we?

261
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,122
God, what happened?

262
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,892
- Amy!
- Russ!

263
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,457
Amy!

264
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,527
- Nicky.
- Ron?

265
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,435
- Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers!

266
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,948
Be quiet, Quark!

267
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,715
- Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball!

268
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,983
- Shut up, wimp!
- We have to get Dad.

269
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,082
He'll know what to do.

270
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:13,462
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.

271
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,906
Can somebody get that?

272
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,671
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.

273
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,981
Amy? Nick?

274
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,987
Hello?

275
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,989
It's not for you.

276
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,587
What is it, Quark?

277
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,963
Nick!

278
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,968
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?

279
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,300
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.

280
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,966
Mr. Szalinski! Up here!

281
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,635
- Up here, Dad!
- Quick, over there by the door.

282
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,305
- Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?

283
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,042
- Nick!
- Get off and give us a hand!

284
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,709
Nick? Amy?

285
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,311
Hey, Amy, your date's here.

286
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:13,790
- Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack!

287
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:21,961
Hurry up. He's coming!

288
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:37,814
- Right here!
- Szalinski!
- Dad! Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

289
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:40,842
- Down here!
- Help!

290
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,888
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!

291
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:02,337
Where's my couch?

292
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:09,513
What is he, deaf?

293
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:13,039
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.

294
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,489
Dad!

295
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,366
I don't believe this.

296
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,902
What a day.

297
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,904
Ow!

298
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:38,438
This is all your fault!

299
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,444
- Five years...
- No, Dad, it works!

300
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,776
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No! Mr. Szalinski!
- Dad!

301
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,782
You don't even work!

302
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:51,016
Don't!

303
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,058
- Run!
- Run.

304
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,129
Run, Nicky! Keep up!

305
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:02,560
Dad!

306
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:12,474
Stay there!
There's glass everywhere here now.

307
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,984
- No!
- Dad! Run, Nicky!

308
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:23,988
No! Back the other way!

309
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:39,164
Go!

310
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,267
- Help!
- Help!

311
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:55,009
No!

312
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,658
Help! Somebody!

313
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,141
Not now, Quark.

314
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:31,489
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash
the same day they get ours?

315
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,149
Ow! Nick?

316
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:36,456
- I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?

317
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:39,292
I don't know, but I'm not waitin'
around to find out. Move over.

318
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,162
- Ow! Watch it!
- Look out.

319
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:57,606
Oh, my God.

320
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,745
Reminds me of the backyard.

321
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,419
Something tells me we're
not going fishing this weekend.

322
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:10,120
- That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.

323
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,322
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?

324
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,195
L... I think so.

325
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:18,566
- Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.

326
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:23,404
I'm never goin' back to your house!
I'm goin' home.

327
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:26,239
Come on, Russ.

328
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:31,476
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.

329
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,316
- Could your Dad help us?
- Russ! We're supposed to go fishing!

330
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,548
Yeah, right!
How are you going, as bait?

331
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:41,622
What a witch!

332
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:56,898
Russ, you comin' down, or what?

333
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:59,068
Well, we can't stay here.

334
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:04,612
Well, I think we should
stick together.

335
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:06,776
Well, come on.

336
00:30:12,024 --> 00:30:14,083
Nicky!

337
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:38,146
I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore, Toto.

338
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,777
I don't think we're in
the food chain anymore, Dorothy.

339
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:49,758
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.

340
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:54,390
What? You let a girl
tell you what to do?

341
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,991
Look, Ron, down here,
you're gonna listen to me.

342
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:01,130
From now on, you're gonna
do what I say! Run!

343
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:20,951
Great Sir Russell Thompson,
stalking the rogue butterfly.

344
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:23,859
Knock it off, Ron.

345
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:26,420
We're now a quarter
of an inch tall...

346
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:29,865
and 64 feet from the house.

347
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:33,769
That's the equivalent
of 3.2 miles.

348
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,774
That's a long way,
even for a man of science.

349
00:31:36,842 --> 00:31:41,779
Nick, I've got six hours to get home,
get big and get to the mall.

350
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:43,781
Now get moving!

351
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:50,115
That butterfly had
a wingspan of 42 feet!

352
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:51,348
Nick!

353
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,269
Hi.

354
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,864
Hi.

355
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:13,410
- Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...

356
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,537
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!

357
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:18,811
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.

358
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:21,444
I only had to show it
to them 12 times.

359
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,513
- How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.

360
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,785
- Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.

361
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:32,193
L-l... I'm just gonna get my old job
back, if I can get my old job back.

362
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:34,630
But from now on,
things are gonna be different.

363
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,633
Different.

364
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,703
Right.

365
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:46,040
- Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them
since I left this morning.

366
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:50,548
- Well, did you tell
them I was coming home?
- Yeah, that's why
they cleaned things up.

367
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,812
I see. Oh, they're probably
just at the mall.

368
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,315
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.

369
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,792
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.

370
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:15,068
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than
those nature hikes Dad drags us...

371
00:33:16,842 --> 00:33:20,437
Nick, don't you ever
pick up your toys?

372
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:24,278
- What a wimp!
- Been looking for that guy.

373
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:31,581
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.

374
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:37,288
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,
but it's years to the rest of the world?

375
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:40,058
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.

376
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,760
Impossible. Time doesn't exist,
except as a...

377
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:46,133
- Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?

378
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:50,641
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,
and it'd look like a river to us.

379
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:55,541
Let's swim it.

380
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,919
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.

381
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:06,086
Hey! Hey, if we could
get some rope...

382
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:08,251
we could make a log bridge!

383
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,288
If... If we... If we had some logs.

384
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,598
- Quark!
- Your dog?

385
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,161
- Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.

386
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,264
Yeah, he can!
Dogs have great ears.

387
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,606
If we can get on him, he'll take us
all the way back to the house.

388
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,612
Whistle.

389
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,451
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.

390
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:49,500
Let's get higher up.

391
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:56,967
You know how to whistle. You just
put your lips together and blow.

392
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:09,812
From the top of that flower,
we could see over the grass.

393
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,455
Let's climb.

394
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,528
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.

395
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,969
Just have Amy call me if
you hear from her. Thanks.

396
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:29,996
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at
the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.

397
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:32,600
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?

398
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,271
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.

399
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,512
Nick, be careful.

400
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,525
Yes, Mother.

401
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:50,686
I'll go up with them.

402
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:07,111
It's Quark!

403
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:10,676
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?

404
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:13,877
- It's that stupid cat of theirs!
- Our cat is not stupid.

405
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,979
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Russ' stupid cat!

406
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:21,890
- Hang on, Nick!
- I can't! I'm slipping!

407
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,690
Nicky!

408
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:29,200
Nicky! Get out of there!

409
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,929
You're allergic to pollen!

410
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:35,632
It's too big!

411
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,971
I'm too little to breathe it in!

412
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,487
Diane!

413
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,455
Hi, Mae.

414
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,652
- We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.

415
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,696
You haven't seen Ronnie
or Russ, have you?

416
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:01,926
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.

417
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,434
If you see them, would you
send them home right away?

418
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,164
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing
if you see mine.

419
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:12,568
Russell, the Szalinski kids
are missing too.

420
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:15,340
If they're smart,
they ran away with the circus.

421
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,608
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.

422
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:19,582
Ronald?

423
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,585
Russell?

424
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,616
Amy?

425
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:31,628
Nick?

426
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:35,900
Amy?

427
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,197
- What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.

428
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:41,669
Sounds more like a swarm of...

429
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:46,644
Bees!

430
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,985
- Amy! Get him off of me!
- Nicky!

431
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,214
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!

432
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:02,054
- Russ!
- Nicky!

433
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,096
Nick, give me your hand!

434
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,724
- Nick, hold on!
- Russ!

435
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:13,237
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault!

436
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:16,296
Shut up!
My brother's up there too.

437
00:38:16,374 --> 00:38:19,172
Help!

438
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:21,337
Russ, don't let go!

439
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:26,049
Hold on!

440
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:34,654
Help!

441
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,905
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go
to the mall and look for the kids.

442
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:50,634
Why don't you stay here
in case they come back?

443
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,642
Okay.

444
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,812
Hey, Szalinski!

445
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:00,816
Your lawn's beginning
to look like the Amazon.

446
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:04,912
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.

447
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,980
You know, the jungles
are receding everywhere.

448
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,294
Dad!

449
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:15,562
- Don't!
- Stop! Stop, please! We're on the bee!

450
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,335
Wh... Where is it? Come on!

451
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,771
- Stop! Don't kill us!
- Dad, don't kill us!

452
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:27,742
Stop it! Whoa!

453
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:36,513
Hold on, Nick!
We're goin' down!

454
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:44,928
Wayne...

455
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:49,729
if the Boorsteins come by,
their escrow papers are in my briefcase.

456
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:52,326
You think you can handle that?

457
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:56,538
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.

458
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,679
Wait a second.

459
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,149
Nick doesn't play baseball.

460
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:13,617
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.

461
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,625
This is all a bad dream.

462
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:18,594
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!

463
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,961
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.

464
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,728
I'm warning you.

465
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,634
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.

466
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,267
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.

467
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:37,508
- But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow!

468
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,415
Get up!

469
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:42,783
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.

470
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,550
Yeah, I hope your face
ends up on a milk carton.

471
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,798
My chair.

472
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:02,972
My couch.

473
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,514
It works.

474
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:21,355
Nick? Amy?

475
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,360
Can you hear me?

476
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:27,163
Nick.

477
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:28,251
Mm-hmm.

478
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:42,629
Nick.

479
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:44,038
Nick.

480
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:49,745
Nick?

481
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,442
Are you okay?

482
00:42:56,554 --> 00:43:00,285
When we crashed, my entire life
flashed before my eyes.

483
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:02,723
It didn't take too long.

484
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,764
I'm scared, Russ.

485
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:11,859
We could be anywhere now.

486
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:15,964
- I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?

487
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,133
Any other yard,
the grass would be shorter.

488
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:21,269
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.

489
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:23,870
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.

490
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:27,816
After all, she's the one who paid
for it. That makes her an accomplice.
You know what it's like in jail?

491
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,183
I am gonna tell you
one more time to shut up!

492
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:32,279
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?

493
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:37,555
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them
after a big bee ate my brother,
you smacked me around.

494
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:40,324
No jury in the world
would fail to convict you.

495
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:43,424
- The whole Szalinski family's
gonna be in jail for life.
- Look.

496
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:44,991
My dad's machine works.

497
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:48,835
When we get home and he fixes us all,
we're gonna be so rich.

498
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:50,840
You'll regret this.

499
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:55,703
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.

500
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,714
I mean, your dad's
a real nice guy.

501
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:02,481
He's not as weird as I thought he was,
and I love you and Nick
like my own brother and sister.

502
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:25,303
It's just that my dad
doesn't understand your dad.

503
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:27,310
Your dad doesn't understand anything.

504
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:45,222
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?

505
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:50,661
Run, Nick!

506
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,171
Whoa! Oh! Ow!

507
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:10,920
- Russ! Russ!
- Get up!

508
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,603
Get in there!

509
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:32,108
Get out of there!

510
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:45,955
- Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?
Uh, we're the Boorsteins.

511
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:48,082
Get off the grass!

512
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,787
Get off the grass!

513
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:57,794
Up there!

514
00:46:09,347 --> 00:46:10,371
Nicky!

515
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:20,317
- Amy!
- Get under that ledge!

516
00:46:59,196 --> 00:47:02,256
It's very delicate, the lawn.

517
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,267
You don't want
to overwater, really.

518
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,537
Get her!

519
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:28,991
Amy?

520
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:39,168
Get away.

521
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,670
Please don't die.

522
00:48:03,995 --> 00:48:05,087
Amy.

523
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:48,598
No, Cathy, I just thought
they might have stopped by.

524
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:51,334
Okay, listen. If you see them,
would you send them home?

525
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:53,434
Okay. You have a good weekend.

526
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:59,210
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?

527
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:05,755
Oh, no.

528
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,796
You had to bring the dog. I don't want
to hear any more about the cat.

529
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,059
It's the Forresters!
What are we gonna tell 'em?

530
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,102
- How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?

531
00:49:20,071 --> 00:49:21,402
Don!

532
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,807
How 'bout catching some...

533
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,837
- Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.

534
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:33,440
Say good morning, Sushi.

535
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:37,544
Well, the fishing report
looks stellar. Let's make exhaust
while the sun still shines, huh?

536
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:40,647
- I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.
- He's says they're jumpin' in the boat.

537
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:45,161
- Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.
- Donald, that man over there is flying.

538
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:48,027
- Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.

539
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:51,330
I don't think
we're gonna be able to make it.
Maybe you oughta go on ahead.

540
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:55,065
What do you... What do you mean you don't
think you're gonna be able to make it?
We're caravanning, good buddy.

541
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:57,539
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!

542
00:49:57,608 --> 00:50:00,338
And besides, if you're not there
by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.

543
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,003
Confidentially...

544
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,181
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.

545
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,845
Plumbing.

546
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,477
"Plumbing"?

547
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:14,324
Well, this isn't
the Big Russ Thompson I know.

548
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:17,690
I mean, plumbing would not stop
the Big Russ Thompson I know...

549
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:19,956
especially with
an $80 deposit on the line.

550
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,329
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?

551
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:35,502
Don?

552
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,541
- Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...

553
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:43,382
- Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?

554
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:44,716
Come on.

555
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:50,390
Mm-hmm.

556
00:50:57,368 --> 00:51:00,132
- You tell him the truth?
- Honey!

557
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:02,195
- They take it okay?
- Mae.

558
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:09,813
Eighty bucks, Mae!
Nonrefundable!

559
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,905
Those kids are grounded!

560
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:23,056
Mud is still mud,
no matter how small you are.

561
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:27,123
I can't believe some stores
actually charge for this stuff.

562
00:51:31,802 --> 00:51:34,100
That was really great,
what you did for Nick.

563
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:38,305
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.

564
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:42,705
Yeah, I know, Nick.

565
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,806
Where'd you learn
artificial respiration?

566
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:51,683
- French class, kid.
- Oh.

567
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,388
"French class"?

568
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:16,671
How 'bout a truce, okay?

569
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,944
Okay.

570
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:34,189
I think this is the flagstone
in the middle of the yard.

571
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:37,359
- You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.

572
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:38,696
Let's go.

573
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,000
French class.

574
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:04,358
I'd die for a strawberry sundae...

575
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,919
with chocolate sprinkles,
and a banana split.

576
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:11,366
I could eat a corn dog
the size of a truck.

577
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:15,629
Ron, if you had a corn dog,
it would be the size of a truck.

578
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:21,775
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house!

579
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:24,313
I saw it first.
It's mine!

580
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:26,872
I got dibs on the cream filling!

581
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,941
Nick, it's one of your cookies!

582
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:40,889
They're never gonna
believe this at school.

583
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:43,899
Yeah, I could just see
the note to the teacher.

584
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:45,400
"Dear Miss Mason:

585
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:48,165
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note."

586
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:57,739
- Guys, quick! Over here!
- Where?

587
00:53:57,815 --> 00:54:00,409
- Right there.
- Nicky, hurry!

588
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:05,522
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.

589
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:08,581
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.

590
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:12,389
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.

591
00:54:12,463 --> 00:54:16,593
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.

592
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:19,636
- Just one ant.
- When is the last time
you saw just one ant?

593
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:22,263
- He's a scout. The rest of them
will be here any minute.
- Wait!

594
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,908
You ever see how fast ants go?

595
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:29,503
We could ride him and get back
to the house in no time.

596
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,104
Forget it, Nick.

597
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:35,010
Amy, he could take us all.

598
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:38,418
- Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?

599
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:41,219
That's like bench-pressing
a bulldozer!

600
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,782
Yeah, so think of what
he could do to us.

601
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:45,795
Let's go before he brings
the rest of them.

602
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:48,127
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.

603
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,223
Russ?

604
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:56,335
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!
- Come on, you guys!

605
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:59,001
Geronimo!

606
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:01,476
Get him!

607
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:03,445
You guys! Nicky!

608
00:55:03,514 --> 00:55:06,972
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!
- Ron, be careful.

609
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,813
Yee-ha!

610
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:10,649
- Nick, get over there! Over there!
- You guys...

611
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:13,087
Get behind it!

612
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:16,757
- Get back here, Nicky!
- Watch out!

613
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,497
- Look out!
- Nick, the others
could come any second!

614
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,263
- Nicky!
- Go, Nick!

615
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:32,107
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, the wrong end!

616
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:35,873
- Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.
- Go over there.

617
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,445
- Nicky, get away!
- Ron, get on!

618
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:42,610
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.

619
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:48,722
Ron, go for it!

620
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:51,854
Hey. Hello.

621
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:54,189
Ant!

622
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,364
Here.

623
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:01,370
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.

624
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:07,471
You guys, come on.

625
00:56:08,345 --> 00:56:11,007
Somebody take this cookie.

626
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,981
Nicky, take this thing!

627
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,043
Help! Nicky!

628
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,219
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.

629
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,657
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.

630
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:26,093
- Somebody, help me!
- Yeah.

631
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:28,154
- Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky!

632
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:30,166
- For a girl.
- Of course.

633
00:56:50,054 --> 00:56:52,989
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.

634
00:56:53,057 --> 00:56:55,582
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.

635
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:57,820
Quark, get away from there.

636
00:56:57,895 --> 00:56:59,487
Quark. Here, boy.

637
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:02,559
Quark. Quark.

638
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:07,732
Get away, boy. Drop it!

639
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:09,796
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

640
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:12,671
Whoa!

641
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:18,272
Whoa!

642
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,383
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.

643
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:24,717
Oh, okay, it's 646...

644
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:31,522
That guy's got serious problems.

645
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,059
<i>Mrs. Thompson? Hello?</i>

646
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:38,158
646 Sycamore. Yes.

647
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:45,268
Great idea, Russ, even if
the boy genius didn't think of it.

648
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:47,276
Low bridge!

649
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:52,440
At this rate,
we'll be home by dinner.

650
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,509
Maybe I can still go out...

651
00:57:56,654 --> 00:57:58,645
with Patty.

652
00:57:58,722 --> 00:58:02,556
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.

653
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:04,958
I know Dad.
We're grounded.

654
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:07,862
We are camping, Ron,
only better.

655
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,491
- This is like a safari.
- Hey.

656
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,626
Yeah, I never thought
of it that way, you know.

657
00:58:13,404 --> 00:58:14,996
Onward!

658
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:33,982
Amy?

659
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:35,582
Nick!

660
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:38,694
Wayne?

661
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:51,238
Uh, yeah, um, I would like
to report, um, two missing children.

662
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:53,936
Well, instead of flapping
your gums about it,
why don't you go out and...

663
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:57,174
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

664
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:59,477
- You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.

665
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,714
- You were kind of upset
about Russ quitting the team, hon.
- Quit? I thought he was cut.

666
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,483
- He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...

667
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:10,049
What do you mean he was afraid to tell
me? He could tell me anything he wants.
You know me. I'll always listen.

668
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:11,992
Mm-hmm.

669
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:13,927
- What's "Uh-huh" supposed to mean?
- Russell.

670
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:17,296
- No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.

671
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:21,065
- You know, it's not unusual
for these runaways to...
- Whoa, my kids did not run away.

672
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:25,541
They are happy kids,
and there's no way you can
make me believe that they ran away.

673
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:28,442
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?

674
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:29,774
Mm-hmm.

675
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:34,250
- Russell!
- Why do I feel like
I'm the one on trial here?

676
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:36,718
- Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?

677
00:59:36,787 --> 00:59:39,255
Well, I think we have
enough to get started.

678
00:59:39,323 --> 00:59:42,087
Please give us a call
if you hear from the boys.

679
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:43,524
Fine.

680
00:59:51,835 --> 00:59:53,860
Don't they need a warrant or something?

681
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:57,429
Russell, there's a few things
about yourself I think you should know.

682
00:59:58,709 --> 01:00:02,145
- Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.

683
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:07,979
Oh, another missing children report.

684
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:12,579
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.

685
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:16,326
I've called the police.
What's on your head?

686
01:00:16,393 --> 01:00:18,725
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?

687
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:21,060
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?

688
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:23,122
Diane, I got something
real important to tell you.

689
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:26,794
That is the couch from the attic.

690
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:30,703
You can see the marks
where Quark chewed the arms.
I found it on the floor.

691
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:33,242
It's my thinking couch.

692
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,607
Wayne...

693
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:38,714
Are you trying to tell me...

694
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:40,647
You did it?

695
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:43,948
It works?
The machine works?

696
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:47,047
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.

697
01:00:47,124 --> 01:00:49,149
- That's great.
- No, it's not that great.

698
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:51,490
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.

699
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:53,154
- What?
- And the Thompson kids too.

700
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,926
- They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.
- What?

701
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,763
Threw them out with the trash.

702
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:01,066
Stay here.
I'll get the door.

703
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:03,534
Yes?

704
01:01:03,607 --> 01:01:06,872
Did, uh, you report
some missing children?

705
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:11,005
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?

706
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:17,481
She's w... Thank you.

707
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,051
Mm-hmm.

708
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:35,601
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?

709
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:44,772
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.

710
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,052
Here. You deserve this.

711
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,218
We're not gonna make it before dark.

712
01:01:58,295 --> 01:02:02,026
Yeah. Even if we did,
the mall would be closed.

713
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:06,263
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.

714
01:02:09,406 --> 01:02:12,898
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family
might be worried about him.

715
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:17,037
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.

716
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:19,048
Help me get off the harness.

717
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,260
You can go now.

718
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:36,763
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.

719
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,733
Thanks for the lift, Antie.

720
01:02:42,673 --> 01:02:45,107
You're free.
You get home now.

721
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:46,437
Shoo!

722
01:02:49,646 --> 01:02:53,446
- Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know
what's best for him.

723
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:58,943
Go on! Go home!
Mom will never let me keep you.

724
01:03:06,597 --> 01:03:08,394
Amy? Nick?

725
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:10,490
- Nick?
- Are you there, kids?

726
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,592
Nicky.

727
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:14,261
Where are you?

728
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:18,674
- Any luck?
- No.

729
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:36,090
Nick?

730
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:38,627
Amy?

731
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:47,165
- You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.

732
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,398
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.

733
01:03:50,774 --> 01:03:53,072
Keep looking. Nick?

734
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:55,077
Amy?

735
01:04:00,851 --> 01:04:03,513
- What was that?
- Ow!

736
01:04:03,587 --> 01:04:04,918
Watch out!

737
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,079
Come on.

738
01:04:18,435 --> 01:04:20,528
- Ugh.
- Where did that come from?

739
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:30,238
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.

740
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:37,109
Oof. Looks like
he started up again.

741
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:39,951
No. He only smokes when he's
really worried about something.

742
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,694
Nicky, be careful.

743
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:49,997
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.

744
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:08,576
Cool. Now we can
see in the dark.

745
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:17,056
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.

746
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:20,619
- I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.

747
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:23,393
But you always make
a big deal out of sports.

748
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:27,403
- Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.

749
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:30,372
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...

750
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,807
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

751
01:05:33,877 --> 01:05:35,868
We've got to tell the Thompsons.

752
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,991
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

753
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,392
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.

754
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:55,590
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?

755
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:58,463
Well, the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound...

756
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:01,333
- and then through laser inversion,
it takes all the...
- Wait, Wayne, wait.

757
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:03,634
I think the Thompsons
need to see the couch.

758
01:06:05,776 --> 01:06:08,301
This guy is a waste of skin.

759
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,872
- This is a microscope.
- I know.

760
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:14,976
Look in there.

761
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:17,617
All right.

762
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:22,485
You see, that's the couch that
used to be sitting right over here,
until the machine shrunk it.

763
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,891
All right, so there's
some doll furniture. Big deal.

764
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:27,794
They sell that kind of stuff
at swap meets.

765
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:29,798
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

766
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:32,994
Well, until now,
the machine just blew things up.

767
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,060
- Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?

768
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:36,469
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.

769
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:40,567
- If the machine had blown up the kids,
there'd be piece of them everywhere.
- Wayne!

770
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:45,513
Sorry, l... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?

771
01:06:45,582 --> 01:06:48,574
- The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one
who needs a shrink, Szalinski.

772
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:52,019
- Russ.
- You are a nutcase,
and I'll tell you something.

773
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:54,648
I have got an air hammer
in my attic...

774
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:58,251
and if you did do something to my kids,
there's gonna be pieces of you
all over the neighborhood!

775
01:06:58,328 --> 01:06:59,761
Come on, honey.

776
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,304
I think that went well.

777
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:12,000
I think we should
have them over more often.

778
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,509
Yeah, well,
it's a priority for me.

779
01:07:14,578 --> 01:07:16,569
Now, why don't you do
what you're paid to do?

780
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:19,809
Find my kids.

781
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:34,296
I thought you didn't believe him.

782
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:36,760
Oh, I don't.

783
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:40,035
Electricity's cheap.

784
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:07,259
Come on. Look at this.

785
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,264
We don't have to sleep
on the ground.

786
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:14,996
- What is it?
- One of my Legos.

787
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:17,439
Give me a boost.

788
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:22,907
Hey.

789
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:25,946
Not bad.

790
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:31,517
Yeah. I don't even
have to brush my teeth.

791
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:36,425
- Quit pushing!
- Move over.
- You move over.

792
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:39,793
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?

793
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,928
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.

794
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,997
Night, Antie.

795
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:58,836
- Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.

796
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:14,025
You think you'll be warm enough?

797
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,565
Good night, Russ.

798
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:25,640
Good night, Amy.

799
01:09:31,414 --> 01:09:32,938
Good night, Amy.

800
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:37,486
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.

801
01:09:37,554 --> 01:09:39,647
<i>Meow!</i>

802
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:56,438
Are you okay?

803
01:09:57,807 --> 01:09:59,069
I'm scared.

804
01:10:02,012 --> 01:10:04,981
Somehow I feel
like this is all our fault.

805
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:06,982
No, it's my fault.

806
01:10:08,318 --> 01:10:11,617
I start working on something, and l...
I don't think about anything else.

807
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:16,415
I should have been more careful
with that thing. I'm sorry.

808
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,762
That's not what I meant.

809
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,065
You know, it's not important...

810
01:10:25,135 --> 01:10:27,763
if I sell another house...

811
01:10:27,837 --> 01:10:30,135
or if you get a grant
this year or next.

812
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:34,839
We've just got to get
this family back together.

813
01:10:38,748 --> 01:10:40,511
I feel the same way.

814
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,120
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.

815
01:10:53,196 --> 01:10:56,131
We've got to get up early
and come out here and look for them.

816
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:58,600
No, I couldn't sleep.

817
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,229
Not with my babies
out here all alone.

818
01:11:03,306 --> 01:11:06,298
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.

819
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:07,843
They'll be fine.

820
01:11:09,379 --> 01:11:11,370
That's another thing
I'm worried about.

821
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:14,910
Amy in the dark...

822
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,975
with Little Russ Thompson.

823
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:18,452
Get some rest.

824
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:27,161
They'd better behave themselves.

825
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:33,665
It's funny.

826
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:36,534
The moon looks the same size
whether you're big or small.

827
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:39,598
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.

828
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:43,478
Why? Does he pick on you
about your size?

829
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:47,082
The bigger the guy,
the bigger the moon.

830
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:50,949
It's just the way he thinks.

831
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,647
Russ?

832
01:11:53,857 --> 01:11:55,950
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?

833
01:11:58,495 --> 01:11:59,962
Well...

834
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:05,263
I mean...

835
01:12:05,335 --> 01:12:07,496
you talked to me
once or twice last year.

836
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:11,998
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...

837
01:12:14,144 --> 01:12:16,305
I just always thought
you were too popular to notice me.

838
01:12:17,981 --> 01:12:20,074
I was too popular to notice.

839
01:12:21,918 --> 01:12:23,180
I was stupid.

840
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:47,833
- Get down! Hurry!
- Get down! Hurry!

841
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:50,038
Ron, get down!

842
01:12:50,113 --> 01:12:51,444
Run!

843
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:58,521
Russ! Help!

844
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:03,184
- Russ, help!
- Help him!

845
01:13:03,259 --> 01:13:04,556
Russ!

846
01:13:05,929 --> 01:13:07,260
Stay here.

847
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:19,536
No!

848
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:24,212
Ron, get out! Quick!
Get away!

849
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:36,988
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on!

850
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:45,026
He-He'll get killed.

851
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:47,626
- We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.
- Sit down.

852
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:58,238
We gotta help him.

853
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,593
Now!

854
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:15,923
- Get him!
- Get him!

855
01:14:25,275 --> 01:14:27,334
- Let him go!
- Look out!

856
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:34,507
Back!

857
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:53,900
Where's Antie?

858
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:01,676
- Antie!
- There!

859
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:09,042
Oh, my God.

860
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:11,052
- He looks hurt.
- No!

861
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:15,251
You saved my life.

862
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:18,383
No, he's gonna be okay.

863
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:42,938
Where you going?

864
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,445
Nature calls.

865
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,280
Boys on the right,
girls on the left.

866
01:16:55,858 --> 01:16:57,792
I must look absolutely gross.

867
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:24,819
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.

868
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:13,532
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.

869
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:16,003
Can't we sleep just a little longer?

870
01:18:23,646 --> 01:18:25,739
Something's very weird here.

871
01:18:32,822 --> 01:18:35,848
- What is it?
- Earthquake!

872
01:18:35,925 --> 01:18:39,622
No, worse! Lawn mower!

873
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:09,047
Nicky!

874
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:41,379
- What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope
whatever lived here has moved out.

875
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:44,290
This is the burrow of
a <i>Lumbricus terrestris.</i>

876
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,262
- A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant
this time of year.

877
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,866
Plug that in.

878
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,635
We're almost done here.

879
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,665
Is that a chain saw?

880
01:19:59,742 --> 01:20:02,370
No, it's more like
our lawn mower, I think.

881
01:20:11,287 --> 01:20:14,188
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!

882
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:18,059
Tommy, stop!

883
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,288
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

884
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:24,833
- Tommy! Don't go on the grass!
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here!

885
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,959
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
- All right, together!

886
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:28,560
One, two, three.

887
01:20:28,638 --> 01:20:32,005
Tommy! Tommy!

888
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,613
I think we'll be safe in here.

889
01:20:42,485 --> 01:20:44,316
Nicky!

890
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:46,048
Come on! Come on!

891
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,452
No! No!

892
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:57,028
Hold on to me, Russ!

893
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:00,702
Amy, don't let go!

894
01:21:02,938 --> 01:21:04,565
Amy!

895
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:09,438
- Hold on!
- Give me that thing!

896
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:21,714
- Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?

897
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,589
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.

898
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,821
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.

899
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:30,263
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.
Go on through the house. It's safer.

900
01:21:33,536 --> 01:21:34,867
"Safer"?

901
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:41,334
I thought my folks are weird.

902
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,347
My knee.

903
01:21:50,486 --> 01:21:52,215
Is everyone okay?

904
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:54,415
I feel like a banana whip.

905
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:04,632
Nick? Nick, are you all right?

906
01:22:07,269 --> 01:22:08,566
Nicky!

907
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,902
Dad?

908
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:19,141
Mom!

909
01:22:19,215 --> 01:22:21,046
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!

910
01:22:21,117 --> 01:22:23,517
- Dad! We're down here!
- Over here!

911
01:22:23,586 --> 01:22:26,020
- Mr. Szalinski!
- Down here!

912
01:22:26,088 --> 01:22:28,352
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!

913
01:22:43,272 --> 01:22:44,705
We'll make it, Nick.

914
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,469
They're never gonna find us.

915
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:49,136
We were right under their noses,
and they didn't even see us!

916
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:51,372
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?

917
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:54,610
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked!

918
01:22:57,353 --> 01:22:59,480
Quark!

919
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:02,217
Come on, everybody!
Grab on!

920
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,727
Go inside, Quark!
Find Dad!

921
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:28,509
Nicky!

922
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:31,552
Quark, what's gotten into you?

923
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:37,223
- Dad!
- I think he just misses the kids.

924
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:39,386
Dad! Stop!

925
01:23:40,963 --> 01:23:42,487
No!

926
01:23:46,035 --> 01:23:48,162
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, at their size...

927
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,671
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!
- That backyard is like ten miles.

928
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,730
Giant blades of grass.

929
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:54,503
Huge insects.

930
01:23:54,577 --> 01:23:58,069
- It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head
right for the house.

931
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:01,015
- It's us!
- Dad!

932
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,381
Yeah, you're probably right.

933
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:05,010
No!

934
01:24:08,858 --> 01:24:10,553
- We're down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!

935
01:24:11,594 --> 01:24:13,687
No, Dad!

936
01:24:16,966 --> 01:24:20,902
- Dad!
- No!
- Dad!

937
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,700
- We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help!

938
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,296
Don't eat me!

939
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:31,704
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

940
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,982
No, Dad! Dad!

941
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:38,212
- It's Nick!
- Oh, Nicky!

942
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:40,585
- Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.

943
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:45,586
- Look! It's the rest of them!
- Yeah!

944
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:47,595
- Yeah!
- We're saved!

945
01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:50,791
- I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.

946
01:24:52,234 --> 01:24:55,169
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.

947
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,839
- Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.

948
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,140
- So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...
- I know.

949
01:25:03,212 --> 01:25:06,204
- These kids aren't you.
- Baseball!

950
01:25:06,282 --> 01:25:08,750
- Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball!

951
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,411
- I can't make it out.
- Let me see.

952
01:25:13,188 --> 01:25:15,520
The baseball, Dad!

953
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:17,456
What are you saying, Nick?

954
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:23,287
Swinging?

955
01:25:23,365 --> 01:25:26,061
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.

956
01:25:26,135 --> 01:25:28,603
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping!

957
01:25:28,671 --> 01:25:30,935
- Pitching.
- Um...
- Throwing.

958
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:34,134
- You're out! You're out!
- Baseball!

959
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:37,508
- Dad!
- Right!
- The baseball!
- The ball!

960
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:40,309
- Baseball?
- Good, honey!

961
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:45,577
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.

962
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:50,154
I got it. The ball
came through the window...

963
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:54,662
and activated the machine,
and they got in the path of the laser.

964
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:58,166
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.

965
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,997
- Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.
That's why everything was blowing up.

966
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:03,538
- Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.

967
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:06,165
- Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.
- Hold it, Szalinski.

968
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:10,337
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids
until you try it on something living!

969
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,316
You know something,
maybe I should do it on myself.

970
01:26:16,385 --> 01:26:18,319
- I'll show you how to work
the machine. It's not that hard.
- I don't know.

971
01:26:18,387 --> 01:26:22,187
- I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no! Do it on me.

972
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:23,519
Are you sure, honey?

973
01:26:28,831 --> 01:26:31,026
How'd those get there?

974
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:48,506
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.

975
01:26:49,752 --> 01:26:51,743
- No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?

976
01:27:06,869 --> 01:27:09,929
- Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.

977
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:12,405
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.

978
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,980
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

979
01:27:45,074 --> 01:27:49,636
So, if this works,
you wanna go to the dance on Friday?

980
01:27:51,547 --> 01:27:52,980
Can you dance?

981
01:27:55,084 --> 01:27:57,848
- Not really.
- I'd love to.

982
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:21,309
- Oh!
- Russ! Ron!
- Dad!

983
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:23,776
Oh, I knew my boys
wouldn't run away.

984
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:26,778
Are you and Dad okay?

985
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:29,682
- Yeah, honey.
<i>...</i>all the way
across the yard, for miles.
- We're great.

986
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,685
- Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.

987
01:28:31,753 --> 01:28:34,187
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.

988
01:28:34,256 --> 01:28:37,316
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.
She's all right.

989
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:39,826
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?

990
01:28:39,895 --> 01:28:42,830
You were right.
You were brilliant.

991
01:28:42,898 --> 01:28:47,562
- I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.
- I know, Ronnie, I know.

992
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:50,400
Dad, if you really want me
back on the team...

993
01:28:50,472 --> 01:28:52,804
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.

994
01:28:53,775 --> 01:28:56,539
- Proud of you.
- I got better.

995
01:28:56,612 --> 01:28:59,547
- I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.

996
01:29:09,491 --> 01:29:10,981
- Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.

997
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,027
- Good idea.
- Oh, great.
- Oh, I love toasts.

998
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:16,121
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis
and many more dinners together.

999
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:19,895
- Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be
having leftovers for a while.

1000
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:21,560
- I wonder what's
for dinner, right, Russ?
- Who wants bread?

1001
01:29:21,637 --> 01:29:24,003
- Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta
carve this thing, huh?

1002
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,438
- Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
