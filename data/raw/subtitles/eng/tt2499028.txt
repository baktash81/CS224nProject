3
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,702
- If you say we're
going rock climbing,

4
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,053
you're going rock climbing.

5
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,403
But the description for
canyoneering would be

6
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,622
we're going hiking, wading,
swimming, rock climbing,

7
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,972
rappelling over waterfalls.

8
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,110
- Inverted mountaineering
is the negative space

9
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,243
of the mountain, and all
you're doing is descending.

10
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,723
You're not climbing up, you're
going down all the time.

11
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:20,471
- It's almost like
caving in a way.

12
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,604
A little bit of challenge
and a little swimming

13
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,258
kinda dark, kinda cold.

14
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:25,520
Have to do things a
little differently

15
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,348
than when you're just walking.

16
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,702
- The beautiful thing
about canyoneering

17
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:36,879
as a sport is rappelling
and down climbing,

18
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,360
getting in the water and
splashing around and having fun.

19
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,840
It brings out the kid in us.

20
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,195
- That's looking pretty good.

21
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,587
We used to call it gorging.

22
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:51,328
We thought that's what
it really sounded like

23
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,417
'cause you're going
down a narrow gorge

24
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,550
and we'd get sandpapered.

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,179
- Originally, people had
a very narrow concept

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,920
of what a canyon is.

27
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,184
If you say you're going to
Utah or northern Arizona

28
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:25,884
to go canyoneering, they say,
"Ah, yeah, the Grand Canyon."

29
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,756
But canyoneering
can be practiced

30
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,324
anywhere there are mountains.

31
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:34,110
I live in Cedar City, Utah,

32
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,330
and you'd think the people
of Utah would all know

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,159
what canyoneering is,
but I'm always amazed

34
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,899
that I meet people in my town

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,249
that I tell them canyoneering

36
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,164
and they say "Is that
like with a canoe?"

37
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,688
- Now the experience of the
climbing inside these gashes

38
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:49,343
in the Earth is called
slot canyoneering

39
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,171
and it's not something
to be taken lightly.

40
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,522
- A hopelessly obscure sport,
canyoneering found recognition

41
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,438
only after occasional
TV appearances.

42
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:00,310
- Aaron amputated his
arm below the elbow,

43
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,051
utilizing his pocket knife.

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,358
- The most
remarkable, airing in 2003,

45
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,142
when news of a man trapped

46
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:09,101
by a boulder captivated
a global audience.

47
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,235
- I feel that I did
what I had to do.

48
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,498
- Before
the publicity,

49
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,108
stories about
canyoneering's origins

50
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,417
included river pioneers and
even more primitive inhabitants.

51
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:24,378
But for decades, as countless
hideaways laid uncharted,

52
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,423
canyoneering remained
accessible only

53
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,991
to the most intrepid explorers.

54
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,824
- So, we go northeast

55
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:39,654
and we should hit
that rim just right.

56
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,787
So, okay.

57
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,706
- By 1986, with
barely enough participants

58
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,360
to be considered a sport,

59
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:53,276
canyoneering was edging
into mainstream's periphery

60
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,192
with the arrival of a guidebook.

61
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,500
Featuring over 100
canyon adventures

62
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,806
with photos of
surreal topography,

63
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:05,288
the book was as beautiful
as it was obscure.

64
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:09,684
- My main distributor at that
time was a guy in Salt Lake.

65
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,729
He took it down to one store

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,991
and he introduced the book there

67
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,471
and the guy looked at him funny

68
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:17,996
and he said "Where's
the Colorado Plateau?"

69
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,433
He said, "Boy, I think
you've got a problem here

70
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:20,651
"because these guys don't know

71
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,741
"where the Colorado Plateau is."

72
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,743
- Despite
it's pragmatic name,

73
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,355
the vast desert region
had already captivated

74
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:32,402
the tenacious guidebook
author from Provo, Utah.

75
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,578
- We gotta be 100 meters

76
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,233
from that last end of
the last little slot,

77
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,061
the one we walked through.

78
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,367
There's a little teeny drainage

79
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,543
and that's what we're
looking at right here.

80
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:45,807
When I got into it, it was
an unexplored area basically.

81
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,504
Just all these neat canyons,

82
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,767
you don't find them
anywhere else in the world.

83
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,900
We can do this.

84
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,118
Oh, if we come in there.

85
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,382
That's the slanted
part I remember seeing.

86
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,779
I enjoy going through
the slot canyons.

87
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,477
I mean, it was just fun for me,

88
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:07,524
and I figured, well, slot
canyons are for everybody too.

89
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,787
Oh, shit, eh, that worked.

90
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,487
I was one of the first guys
out there to do a guidebook

91
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,140
for this region.

92
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,142
I was in that first
wave of people starting

93
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,753
to write guidebooks.

94
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,146
- A
prolific adventurer,

95
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,453
Mike Kelsey's earliest
feats were detailed

96
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,803
in guidebooks on
mountain hiking.

97
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,588
Among his first published,

98
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,764
was the inexhaustible
world guide,

99
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:33,028
listing over 600 ascents
across the globe.

100
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,291
The book included his
attempt to solo climb

101
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,815
the Himalayan peak, Masherbrum.

102
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,819
Discovering exciting
terrain closer to home,

103
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,084
Mike's canyon guides featured
accessible walk through treks,

104
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,567
but his work began
on a new edition.

105
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:54,832
He hoped to include an entirely
different kind of adventure.

106
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,490
- I could see that
the best scenery,

107
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,666
the neatest slot canyons,
though they were the darkest

108
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,451
and maybe the most
water sculptured

109
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,844
and they're the
ones with dropoffs,

110
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,585
so you had to rappel.

111
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:14,635
I knew then that this was
the next step in adventure.

112
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,117
- The terrain that
had caught Mike's attention

113
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,337
was called technical
canyoneering,

114
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,862
referring to steep, vertical
canyons with drop offs.

115
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,561
And while thousands of
technical canyons existed,

116
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,519
they remained
accessible only to those

117
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,739
with climbing skill
and equipment.

118
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,399
- The tunnel that goes through
the east entrance of Zion

119
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,618
goes right by Pine Creek.

120
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,360
In the old days, you
could stop in the tunnel.

121
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:47,232
You could look over
into this canyon.

122
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:50,453
And I saw some amazing
things out those windows

123
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:54,501
and I decided that I
wanted to go in there.

124
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,676
- Nearly a decade

125
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,721
before Mike had
written his first book,

126
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,071
a deep canyon in
Zion National Park

127
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,596
had captured the attention
of a young climber

128
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,424
named Dennis Turville.

129
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:08,689
The year was 1977 and
the canyon Dennis planned

130
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,520
to descend dropped over 300
feet within a half mile.

131
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,088
With hazardous obstacles
lurking in the darkness below,

132
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,829
Pine Creek was
considered more a tomb

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,528
than a climbing project.

134
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:25,619
- I realized that I needed
two 150 foot climbing ropes.

135
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:29,013
I needed full on climbing
gear, a wet suit for any pools

136
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,755
that might be down there,
that probably were.

137
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,105
And then I brought
the last missing piece

138
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:38,501
of the equation and that
was a climbing buddy, Dean.

139
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,590
- You know, we'd been on
plenty of adventures together

140
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:44,507
at that point, so it was
pretty easy to say yes.

141
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,336
The only weird part was,
yeah, we're going down

142
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,380
instead of going up.

143
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:49,730
What's with that?

144
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:56,824
It seemed to me pretty
unimposing initially,

145
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,915
but then once you
get to the spot

146
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:05,659
where it just all of a
sudden turns vertical down.

147
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,619
When you can't see the
bottom, where you're going,

148
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,143
there's the unknown down there.

149
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:18,672
- I had gotten to the first
big rappel in Pine Creek

150
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:22,937
and it was a place we called
the Cheese Rock Factory.

151
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:28,116
The water over eons of time
had worn different holes

152
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,944
through the rock and
it literally looked

153
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:33,643
like the sandstone was
Swiss cheese in there.

154
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,694
I got off of the fourth rappel

155
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:44,436
and I was walking through
this beautiful white sand

156
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,527
and I'm realizing no one's
ever been here before.

157
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:48,789
I'm it.

158
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,182
I'm the first guy to
walk through here.

159
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,277
We were the first
humans to see this

160
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,585
and that just sent
shivers up my back

161
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,848
and it made me wanna
do more of them.

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,639
Every time we went out, we
were doing a first descent.

163
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,815
We had canyon after
canyon after canyon

164
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:18,035
without anybody around
to see anywhere.

165
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,908
Sometimes when we walked out
of Zion Narrows afterwards

166
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,954
with packs and ropes and
clanking pieces of iron,

167
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,435
people would look
at us pretty funny.

168
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,437
We could see the questions
forming in their head,

169
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,047
but they didn't dare ask them.

170
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,746
And that was good.

171
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,183
- While accessing
terrain where few could follow,

172
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:39,448
Dennis explored canyons in
solitude for nearly 20 years.

173
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:44,801
- I do remember him pouring
over 7.5 minute topos

174
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:48,762
to really look for
skinny little canyons.

175
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:53,549
Ones where the actual
contour crosses the creek.

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,073
- Most of our names have
to do with our impressions

177
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,901
of the canyon when
we went through it.

178
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,948
Troll's Treat was because
we felt like we were a bunch

179
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,864
of trolls carrying our
packs through this canyon.

180
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,214
And treat because it was fun.

181
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,744
We felt we had a
reason to name them

182
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,094
just as climbers
name climbing routes.

183
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,705
We were naming our canyon routes

184
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,576
after whatever we felt like

185
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,883
because we were the
first ones through.

186
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,843
We had the right.

187
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:29,672
These canyons just
led me toward others

188
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,457
that were getting
increasingly more difficult,

189
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:36,113
longer, harder to get
to, harder to get out of.

190
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:39,073
And as we found more
and more challenges,

191
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,685
we found techniques to
match those problems.

192
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,037
We realized then that
what we were doing

193
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,518
was a special thing.

194
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
That it was intensely enjoyable

195
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,785
but it was rigorous, and
it wasn't for everybody.

196
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,011
- By
1997, as work began

197
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,056
on a fourth edition guidebook,

198
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:09,581
Mike had acquired
technical climbing gear.

199
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,801
- I got into Zion
and did some rappels.

200
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,760
Went down Pine Creek.

201
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,413
I started thinking, you know,

202
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:17,807
maybe there is room for
another type of guide here

203
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,940
because this'll add
a little more flavor,

204
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,290
a little more adventure
to just canyon hike,

205
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,119
just walking down
a boring canyon.

206
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,732
The best canyons out there
are the ones you have

207
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,821
to use ropes to get through.

208
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,911
It introduces people to
a new challenge there,

209
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,826
a step up in adventure.

210
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,612
- Delving
into deeper, more
challenging terrain,

211
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:44,181
Mike's work marked a dramatic
new twist on guidebooks

212
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,792
as mundane hikes were updated

213
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,925
with thrilling new
rappelling routes.

214
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,754
But before the
book went to print,

215
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,714
the quaint sport would
make an unexpected debut

216
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,804
when on a summer
afternoon in 1997,

217
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,895
a startling event sent shock
waves across the nation.

218
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,898
- Thundering flash floods
swept away 12 people.

219
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,683
11 of them died.

220
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,820
- The eighth and
ninth bodies were found later.

221
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,823
Searchers never found any
trace of the other two.

222
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,999
- It was on international news

223
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,959
and the Navajos said that
they got a tremendous number

224
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,701
of phone calls because
people never knew

225
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:28,530
that landscapes
like that existed.

226
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,620
There they are watching
their TV in New Jersey

227
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,926
or wherever they are

228
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,494
and looking at this tight
little sandstone slot canyon.

229
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,932
So the interest spiked.

230
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,672
- As
inquiries flooded in,

231
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,022
it was the arrival
of the internet

232
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,765
and accessible information
that fueled the excitement.

233
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,724
As canyoneering was
ripped from obscurity,

234
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:53,381
Zion National Park witnessed
the first wave of participants.

235
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,210
- A lot of local folks had
known about the slot canyons

236
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,342
in Zion for a number of years.

237
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,996
But with the advent
of the internet,

238
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,868
all of a sudden that
information was out there

239
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,348
for large numbers of people.

240
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:09,049
- I think guidebooks and
the internet both appeared

241
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,224
at roughly the same time,

242
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,443
but both of them,
coupled together,

243
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:16,708
it all just created a firestorm
of canyoneering interest.

244
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,845
- This is called standard mode.

245
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,587
If I want a little more
friction, I can drop it here

246
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,068
and that's called vertaco.

247
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,505
So, this is the textbook
way of doing it,

248
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:34,770
but I've seen students that
will come over the top this way

249
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,861
to add more friction,
and that's okay.

250
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,689
And they go under here.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,691
I've had a few come over here

252
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,040
and then go over the top.

253
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,739
And there's all kinds of
different ways that'll work.

254
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,874
So, I like it because
it's somewhat idiot proof.

255
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,965
- As
recreationalists arrived

256
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,401
to try the new sport,

257
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:00,100
a young professional guide
from Phoenix, Arizona

258
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,536
assembled a teaching group

259
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,887
called the American
Canyoneering Association.

260
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,498
- When people started
publishing guidebooks,

261
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,979
it made a huge difference
in the amount of traffic

262
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,722
in the canyons and the number
of people that got into it

263
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,377
because all of a sudden
they're more accessible.

264
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,858
We felt like canyoneering was
gonna get enough promotion

265
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,772
on its own, all we
wanted to do was

266
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,905
once you become a canyoneer,

267
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,342
can we help you
become more safe.

268
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,997
Safe and efficient
solutions, right?

269
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,217
- Before
establishing the ACA,

270
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,480
Rich Carlson made his
living bringing clients

271
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,961
on climbing and
mountaineering excursions.

272
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,051
An outdoor enthusiast
throughout his life,

273
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,967
Rich had discovered
canyoneering in the late '70s,

274
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:44,884
experiencing the solitude of
the sport's formative years.

275
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,929
But during one early adventure,

276
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,890
Rich found himself in
a precarious situation.

277
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,021
- Well, at the
time I wasn't thinking

278
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,154
of going down a canyon

279
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,330
as being something technical.

280
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,375
All I was thinking was
I was out for a hike

281
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,725
that would have a little
bit of scrambling to it.

282
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,119
- In a naive
oversight, 21 year old Rich

283
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,165
had climbed down without
considering his ability

284
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,123
to reverse the move.

285
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:10,997
- Going down canyon and
realizing I couldn't
go any further,

286
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,868
the oh shit moment
was coming back

287
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,305
and assuming it would
be easy to go back up

288
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,308
what I just came back down.

289
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,181
It was at that point where
I saw those two drops

290
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,009
and being stuck in between them,

291
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,403
when I realized, man, someone
could get killed in here.

292
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,318
- Ready?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,279
- When I finally managed to
get out and got back to my car,

294
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:35,717
I was thinking, I am so stupid.

295
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,416
I am so stupid, I will
never do that again.

296
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,331
Okay, who's up?

297
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:44,813
I feel like part of my job
is to instill a respect

298
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,425
for all the great
things about the sport,

299
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:51,167
the beauty and the adventure
and so on and so on,

300
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:54,866
but also instill that there
are risks in this sport.

301
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:06,226
- Going down a canyon is easier
than going up a mountain.

302
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,968
All you have to do is rappel.

303
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:10,186
Once you know how to rappel,

304
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,014
rappelling isn't
that big of a deal.

305
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,104
That's the simplest
part of canyoneering.

306
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,110
- Canyoneers can easily
get themselves deeper

307
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,895
into the doodoo than
a rock climber can.

308
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,116
A rock climber has
to go up first.

309
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:30,511
And if you get to a point
where you can't go any higher,

310
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,775
your partner lowers
you down and it's over.

311
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,778
In a canyon, you start downhill.

312
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,781
You do the first
rappel, pull your rope,

313
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,479
and if you can't deal with
what's in front of you,

314
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,266
you're screwed.

315
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,920
- There are lots and lots
of problems in canyons.

316
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,967
Pools of water that may or
may not be over your head.

317
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,838
Mud, log jams.

318
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,581
So you need to be ready for
whatever you might run into.

319
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:00,106
And canyons teach
you quite quickly,

320
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:01,107
if they're hard enough,

321
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,369
and if they're long enough,

322
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,197
if it's mean enough,

323
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,286
just what you're up for.

324
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,031
- We live in this
society where we're stuck

325
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,729
in an office somewhere, behind
a computer or something,

326
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,559
and for some people,
they want some challenge.

327
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:23,738
It gives the readers a
chance to enjoy something new

328
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,522
and in this world
we live in now,

329
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:29,787
we're always looking for
something to do on weekends.

330
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:34,183
- Currently
there's a lot of people

331
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:38,231
that haven't developed
an outdoors sense.

332
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,494
There's a lot of us that
were raised in the outdoors.

333
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,236
We've got parents
that like camping,

334
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,673
hiking, hunting,
fishing, whatever.

335
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,283
But there's people
now that are going

336
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,720
from the sofa to the canyon.

337
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,331
And if something goes wrong,

338
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,334
they can't find that
thing inside them

339
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:59,904
to be able to deal effectively
with the situation.

340
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,255
- We knew that people
would get into canyons

341
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,778
and get in trouble.

342
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:05,084
We knew it was coming.

343
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,737
It was inevitable and
it was not that hard

344
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:10,219
to see down the road
what was gonna happen.

345
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,484
- Most of us that
say we want adventure

346
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,661
are secretly hoping
we don't find it.

347
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,929
- Hmm.

348
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:31,675
Well, I thought it would
be a little easier to find.

349
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:34,591
They said it would be
difficult to find in the dark,

350
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,116
but it's still light ,

351
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,595
what does that say?

352
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:44,253
There is dirt road
going up there.

353
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,169
Looked pretty chunky.

354
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:52,522
I'm not sure where
I'm going .

355
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,177
Ah.

356
00:18:56,613 --> 00:19:00,051
I think it's time
to look at the map.

357
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,836
Is this the right weekend?

358
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,854
- Encouraged by his
father to enjoy the outdoors,

359
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:22,291
Steve's childhood was
immersed in hiking,

360
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,380
fishing and camping.

361
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,686
Even into adulthood,

362
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,471
when Steve had exhausted
his local trails,

363
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,777
his father guided him

364
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:32,214
into an entirely new
kind of adventure.

365
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,956
- I gotta read the directions
on how to use this thing.

366
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,394
- Exploring canyons

367
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:40,396
that were just a stone's
throw from the hiking trails

368
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:42,355
they had explored
throughout their lives,

369
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,618
Steve and his father
rekindled the thrill

370
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,402
of local adventure.

371
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,456
- It was a whole new adventure,

372
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,719
seeing all these waterfalls
that are so close

373
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,937
to the hiking trails.

374
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,463
It was quite an exciting
experience for us.

375
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,859
- There's so much
to see out there.

376
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,861
There are waterfalls that
are a hundred feet high

377
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,820
and would have never
known that they were there

378
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,909
without being introduced
to canyoneering

379
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,347
and knowing how to rappel
off of those waterfalls.

380
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,525
- When we first started,
it was a little bit

381
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,746
of a sense of both awe and fear,

382
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:28,227
but we managed to make
it through all right.

383
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:30,229
- Being told to
just trust the gear

384
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,319
and that moment of
standing on solid rock,

385
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:37,105
the next thing you know you're
legs are dangling in the air.

386
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,585
Should you be doing this?

387
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,239
Is it safe?

388
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,936
That's where the
thrill comes in.

389
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,416
To overcome that barrier,

390
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,157
to put yourself out there.

391
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,637
It's a lot of fun.

392
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,439
A little chilly last night.

393
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,441
Had to put some fleece on.

394
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,841
I am really wondering what
the Facebook site says

395
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,368
on how many people
are coming now.

396
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:27,460
I'm thinking the rain may
have turned people around,

397
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,637
changed their minds.

398
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,510
- Steve's
introduction to canyon thrills

399
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,817
had gotten off to a shaky start

400
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,515
when in 2003, during
their annual trip

401
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:43,606
to Zion National
Park, his father had
stumbled on a brochure

402
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,609
with directions to
a remote canyon.

403
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,871
- We didn't know
anything about it

404
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,525
and we were quite ill-prepared

405
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:52,876
for what was about
to come about.

406
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,530
- We knew that there
would be various places

407
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:58,317
to scramble over
small waterfalls,

408
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:00,406
but at that point,
we really didn't know

409
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:03,322
that that was
considered canyoneering.

410
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:05,541
We tried so hard to
keep everything dry.

411
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,457
We took a length of rope so
we could string our packs,

412
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,416
shuttle them across the pools.

413
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,027
We probably looked ridiculous.

414
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,464
- I got so cold at
one period of time,

415
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,161
I had to take off
my cotton t-shirt

416
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,380
and put it in my backpack.

417
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,950
I mean it was warmer
without any shirt on at all.

418
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,995
- Despite
the awkward start,

419
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,346
Steve and his father have
garnered enough interest

420
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,217
to devote their
free time in pursuit

421
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,262
of their newfound hobby.

422
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,051
- Well, it wasn't pretty.

423
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,748
- But without
climbing experience,

424
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,359
developing the necessary skills

425
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,187
would become a lasting endeavor.

426
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,232
- Just don't pull
yourself up too hard

427
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,582
and knock your head .

428
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,323
After completing that canyon,

429
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,500
we realized that we needed
to develop more technique.

430
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,589
- Learn a little more
about the technical aspects

431
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,548
of going through a canyon.

432
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:56,984
- We knew
that we would want

433
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,508
to graduate to other canyons.

434
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,337
- You okay?

435
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:05,775
- We realized that
we need to get some training.

436
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:14,436
- Okay, bring your hands
out from behind you.

437
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,655
Okay, right here you
can lean forward,

438
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,570
put your hands on my shoulders.

439
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,399
Watch that rock down there.

440
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,530
Okay.

441
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:22,923
Lean forward.

442
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:24,403
- Offering
a unique curriculum

443
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,405
of canyoneering
technique and safety,

444
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,798
Rich's course is filled
with students eager

445
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,757
to try the sport.

446
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,280
- Jumps over the log,

447
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,587
runs around the back
side of the tree.

448
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,545
- But following
the success of his classes,

449
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,112
it was another innovation

450
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,593
that stirred the
fledgling community.

451
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,508
- One of the first things
that ACA accomplished

452
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,727
was a development
of a rating system.

453
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,555
The first component is numeric.

454
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,557
It goes one, two,
three, and four,

455
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,430
and that's related to the
difficulty of the terrain

456
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,083
or the rope work involved.

457
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,695
A class one canyon
is a canyon hike.

458
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,523
A class two canyon
should be considered

459
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:00,569
maybe an intermediate canyon.

460
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,354
It's got some
scrambling involved.

461
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:07,446
Class three canyons are canyons
that involve rappelling.

462
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,143
And a class four
canyon is something

463
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,798
that will have, let's
just call it an advanced

464
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,628
or expert canyon.

465
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,153
The second component is an
alpha character, A, B, or C.

466
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,590
A is a primarily dry canyon.

467
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,767
A class B canyon is
one that's got water

468
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,552
but basically no current.

469
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,510
And class C canyon is a canyon

470
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,556
that's got flowing water in it.

471
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,620
- The ACA rating
system was accepted instantly

472
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,709
as the standard in canyoneering.

473
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,625
Even Mike, recognizing
it's significance,

474
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,672
included it in his
latest guidebook.

475
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,590
Published in 2003, the
Tehcnical Slot Canyon Guide

476
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,896
responded to a growing
need for adventure

477
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:11,031
including only canyons that
require rope to traverse.

478
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,685
With each canyon
listing a rating,

479
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:15,122
readers could choose
an undertaking based

480
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,211
on a desired level of challenge.

481
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,605
- Your rope comes up
out of the rope bag,

482
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,432
passes through the rappel ring,

483
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,260
and you set your rope length.

484
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:24,958
When people get
into canyoneering,

485
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:28,265
they're after two
kinds of information.

486
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:32,443
One kind of information is
what technical skills do I need

487
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,794
and another set of
information they need is

488
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,405
where are the canyons.

489
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,973
Part of our American
way of doing things

490
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:43,324
is "Point me in the right
direction, I'll figure it out."

491
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,805
Of course, I feel like
the technical information

492
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,894
is the more
important of the two.

493
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,678
You should get the
technical skills

494
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:51,332
before you go
looking for canyons.

495
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,689
- Look good there.

496
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,126
This thing should be warm.

497
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,999
This is the old fashioned way.

498
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,479
Wax the back, cut and paste.

499
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:11,570
But it works damn good for me,

500
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,484
so I don't care.

501
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,269
People probably think
I'm funny as hell

502
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,662
using this old method,

503
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,535
but I can do these
about as fast as you can

504
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,972
on a computer.

505
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,278
Cut that off.

506
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,411
That's the one of size
I want right there.

507
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,676
In this country, there's
a lot of Cedar Mesa.

508
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:31,938
Sandstone.

509
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,853
Let's see this one now.

510
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,776
Should be big enough.

511
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,954
Right now my biggest
problem is space.

512
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,696
Space in my store
room for books.

513
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:57,833
Because neither of these
books will be great sellers.

514
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,489
This was here years ago,

515
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,665
while my mother was here and
we rented the top part out,

516
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:07,669
I closed it off and made
a separate apartment here.

517
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:09,932
Now, this is a mess.

518
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,630
This is my old
office right there

519
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,762
and everything's filled up.

520
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:16,852
This is typical
bachelor, I guess.

521
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,117
This is where I
lived for 20 years

522
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:25,644
in this little apartment
here, plus the office.

523
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,776
Now, I got some
books down here now.

524
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:31,606
It's kind of an extra
bedroom if I want it.

525
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,785
So what I'm gonna
have to do is just

526
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,787
to forget about having a
guest bedroom, I guess,

527
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:41,921
and take this bed out of here

528
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,532
and stack more books in here.

529
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,883
Most heroic author of all.

530
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:52,627
The author, that's, I use that,
if you will, is of course,

531
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,717
the great man you
so viciously malign

532
00:27:56,936 --> 00:28:00,417
in your slimy
article, Mark Kelsey.

533
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,418
I don't know what.

534
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,812
I think this was the black hole.

535
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,858
He said, hell, nobody
used to go down there.

536
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,990
Now I went past
there on Memorial Day

537
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,862
or one of those weekends

538
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:13,039
and there was 13 cars stacked
up there, parked there

539
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,823
with everybody going down there.

540
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:19,088
Slot canyons are his, that's
the note I made on the outside.

541
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,701
The slots are so small

542
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,051
that it doesn't take
much to ruin them.

543
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:26,966
I've seen a lot of them
in the last few years

544
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,403
and the results are sickening.

545
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,755
Anyway.

546
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:41,502
- When I did my first attempt
on Edge of the Earth canyon,

547
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:44,374
I told everyone, you
are not to tell anybody

548
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,420
that you ever went here.

549
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,641
What we really
wanted was a canyon

550
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,121
that hadn't been descended

551
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,907
that maybe we were the
first people to ever see,

552
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:58,171
and that we'd be
pretty seriously sure

553
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,521
of not seeing anybody else.

554
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:05,831
When you're talking
about a canyon

555
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,224
called Edge of the Earth,
it's not on any map

556
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,228
and no one is gonna know
what you're talking about.

557
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,405
We knew early on that
eventually people were going

558
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:18,017
to find out how fun
running through canyons

559
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,758
and rappelling through pools

560
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,456
and overcoming the challenges

561
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,066
and seeing the beauty
of these canyons,

562
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,981
it was going to become popular.

563
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:29,028
But we weren't gonna
hurry it along.

564
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:39,038
- It looks like a
storm in the water.

565
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,875
I knew that there was
so much more out there

566
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,964
and finding what was online

567
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,663
and eventually
picking up guidebooks.

568
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,493
There was a drive to
want to see it firsthand.

569
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,714
I've seen the local
canyons so much,

570
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,935
I've barely touched
on what's in Utah.

571
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,027
The slot canyons,
it's nice when you get

572
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,551
into somewhere you have to
squeeze to get through them.

573
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:17,859
I think that's unlike
what we have in LA.

574
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,137
Knowing how tight
these canyons can get,

575
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:39,098
it just adds a different
element of excitement.

576
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,192
- While exploring,
Utah's narrowest slot canyons,

577
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,498
Steve's scrambling
brought him further

578
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,979
into unknown territory.

579
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,939
- All right, woo.

580
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,984
That's a hard start
to the morning.

581
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:58,421
- Using the
opposing walls for support,

582
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,119
he had discovered stemming,

583
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:04,863
a climbing technique crucial
to traversing tight canyons.

584
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,777
Inadvertently,
Steve had stumbled

585
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,171
into advanced canyon terrain.

586
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,478
- Initially, we weren't
that far off the deck

587
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,132
and we just kept moving along

588
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:17,223
and it did get to a point
where it may have been 30 feet

589
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:21,140
or so off the deck.

590
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,056
I'd never done
anything like that.

591
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:28,060
I didn't know what I
was getting myself into.

592
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,108
I'm getting a little off here,

593
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,895
I don't really like.

594
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,943
Anybody in the
party were to slip,

595
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,379
it's not like it's
going to kill you,

596
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:45,642
but you're certainly gonna
get yourself stuck in there

597
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,296
and be trapped.

598
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:57,045
Wow.

599
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:59,395
Getting down and just
dropping into the sand,

600
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:02,964
it was a relief that
that canyon was over.

601
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:10,929
That was hair
raising .

602
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,278
But you look back
at it and you go,

603
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,195
that was a good kind of scary
because I had a great time.

604
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,153
It's not something my
father's going to do

605
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:20,721
or even some, a few
people in my circle

606
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:23,115
of canyoneering friends, I
don't think it's something

607
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:25,508
that they would want to do.

608
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,164
Knowing that I got
through that canyon

609
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,253
without much difficulty,

610
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,081
you'll think what other
canyons are out there

611
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:36,824
that have that element
of excitement in them.

612
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,960
Check out some other canyons
of greater difficulty.

613
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,488
- Now, with your right foot,
go ahead and move it down

614
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,012
to that shelf that's
six inches below.

615
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,057
Nope, just down.

616
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,232
Just down.

617
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,015
There you go.

618
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,408
Almost, okay.

619
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,453
Now, if you switch
your left hand back

620
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,368
to that position,
is that comfortable?

621
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,370
- Um, nope.
- Okay.

622
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,459
Left hand right
here on this ledge.

623
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,809
- Why?
- Right hand on that ledge.

624
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,117
- Why?
- Drop down maybe a foot

625
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,206
and a half.

626
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:12,903
- Put your left hand here.

627
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:13,687
- I could actually walk down.
- Okay.

628
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:14,775
Then you're good.

629
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:17,996
- Okay.

630
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,172
I did some pretty dumb things

631
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:23,044
when I was a young rock climber.

632
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:27,048
I see people now doing some
of the same dumb things I did.

633
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,354
You're right handed,

634
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,399
your right hand should
be on the break strand.

635
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,575
And I'd rather see you
leaning up against the rock

636
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,925
or sitting, brace
yourself, be secure.

637
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,536
It's like having
a kid and saying

638
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:40,322
"Son, I've been
there, I've done that.

639
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:43,108
"You don't have to go through
the same stupid things.

640
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,980
"Let me help you pass that
just with a conversation."

641
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,417
You kids don't listen, do ya?

642
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:49,940
And I don't expect
very many people

643
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,247
that are coming up
the ranks in climbing

644
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:54,206
and canyoneering
to listen either.

645
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:57,122
They need to learn
it on their own.

646
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,517
And with the tail,
let's go ahead and start

647
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:04,781
with about 2.5,
three inches of tail.

648
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:08,220
Now, stick your finger
inside of that girth hitch.

649
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,221
You'll be happier if
you're using a finger

650
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,092
instead of a thumb, though.

651
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,138
- Okay.

652
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,792
- Take the end piece
off, put that piece on,

653
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,490
and then the end
piece back again.

654
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,708
- I got the first there.

655
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,884
Op, now I gotta
start all over again.

656
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:25,454
- What the ACA teaches
is a set of skills

657
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,544
that I refer to as
tools in the toolbox.

658
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,024
But does everybody
have something

659
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,505
that generally looks like this?

660
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,769
- Starting over.
- Rip here.

661
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,860
- Hard skills are here,
here's how you tie this knot.

662
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,079
Here's how you rig this rope.

663
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,558
Here's how you set up an anchor.

664
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:45,866
Soft skills are things like
common sense and judgment

665
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,694
and those aren't
as easy to teach.

666
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,130
And I mentioned in the
classroom this morning

667
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,393
that that's the way
I always teach it,

668
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,569
but then I see
students in panic mode

669
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,746
that just go like
this, and it's okay.

670
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,400
It works.

671
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,533
Here's the tools
in your toolbox.

672
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,491
We hope we've given
you enough information

673
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,711
to point you in
the right direction

674
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,539
as to which skills
are appropriate

675
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,193
in which kinds of situations,

676
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,587
but until that person is
standing out there by themselves

677
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,198
on the top of a cliff

678
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:17,027
and making the decision
for themselves, who knows.

679
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:29,257
- As the main canyons
have been done,

680
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,303
everybody knows how to
get through these now

681
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,218
once a guidebook comes out.

682
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,133
Then you're always
looking for more

683
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:37,657
and the natural
evolution there is

684
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,399
that some of these are
getting more difficult

685
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,141
and more dangerous.

686
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:46,144
In case we have to go
back up this canyon,

687
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:49,190
we'll know where to turn.

688
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,151
Whoa.

689
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:53,977
Look what we have here.

690
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,805
These are bear tracks.

691
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,286
Three little toes right there.

692
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:02,203
How on Earth are they
getting into this canyon now?

693
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,510
Everybody wants to
be the first man

694
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,338
to reach the top of Everest

695
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,818
and every person,
every canyoneer wants

696
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,211
to be the first one
to make the descent

697
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,821
of such and such canyon.

698
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:16,086
11 a.m. at first
slot of big drops.

699
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:23,442
I think we can climb
up there if we have to.

700
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:26,271
This looks like a
swimmer, right here.

701
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:30,275
Could get up there and walk
on the bench for a ways.

702
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:40,807
I think we're running
out of room here.

703
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:43,549
Yeah.

704
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,379
Well, there's trees
and more water.

705
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:50,382
We'll go back and
get up on the bench

706
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:55,038
and it looks like there's
a two anchors, two maybe.

707
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,475
One thing I enjoy
is being the first

708
00:36:56,605 --> 00:37:00,174
to make it public
and put it on a map.

709
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,915
I enjoy that.

710
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,396
I consider myself, I
guess, in that small group

711
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:06,702
of people who enjoy being
the first to go down

712
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,138
because there is that danger

713
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:11,141
and we don't know what
the hell's down there.

714
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,012
We got a tree over there.

715
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:13,274
We can anchor it by.

716
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,364
I see some places we can
build an anchor or something.

717
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:19,454
That looks like
we're in business.

718
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,284
Whoa, little steep right here.

719
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:26,200
Maybe we can just.

720
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,119
Little bit scary.

721
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,042
Just, you know, two
or three quick hops

722
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,870
and you're over there.

723
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:52,922
Getting a little past
my comfort level here.

724
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,536
I don't like this.

725
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:07,154
Perfect.

726
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,908
Whoa.

727
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:29,307
Got a little tree over
there, so that's good news.

728
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:34,268
Uh, we don't have any
anchors down below here.

729
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,488
So I think we're
gonna have to just

730
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,969
one big rappel down to there

731
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,190
and then I think we can just
get bench walk over there.

732
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,105
That's what it
kind of looks like.

733
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,715
But we're gonna have to
do something up here.

734
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,935
We might have to
use this little rope

735
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:51,938
to go back from the
rim on this tree

736
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,243
and then have it come over.

737
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,725
That's what I'm
thinking right now.

738
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:57,813
Oh, hell.

739
00:38:57,944 --> 00:38:59,989
Hell, look.

740
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:05,908
We're not the first .

741
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,915
- As the number of
canyoneers continued to rise,

742
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:15,178
even the most remote
corners of wilderness

743
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,267
show evidence of visitors.

744
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,798
- Back in Pine Creek
days, I didn't think

745
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:28,453
that it would
become what it has.

746
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:32,544
I thought that it would
eventually become popular.

747
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,328
It was just too cool.

748
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:43,250
Edge of the Earth has a
very distinctive pour over,

749
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,600
which we call the
Monster pour over.

750
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:49,952
And that image is now on
the side of a U-Haul van.

751
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,520
I cannot tell you what
my feelings were like

752
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,915
on the day that I
first saw that image.

753
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,961
I used to say in the '80s even,

754
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,572
I'm gonna take you to a canyon,

755
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:04,140
we're gonna go down there
on Labor Day weekend

756
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,100
and we're not gonna see
a soul for five days.

757
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,582
I would have a hard
time doing that now

758
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,540
and that's what I miss.

759
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:42,048
These people, they think
that canyoneering began

760
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,267
when they discovered
it on the internet.

761
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,444
And that canyoneering
wouldn't even be possible

762
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:48,750
without the internet.

763
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:51,666
And I came up with a
term for these people.

764
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:56,192
I had to, and I decided
to call them canyonista.

765
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:00,806
They're not climbers.

766
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:02,634
They don't have the background.

767
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:05,071
They get hyped up about the gear

768
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,377
and about the
notoriety of canyons,

769
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,509
especially when a guidebook says

770
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,860
this canyon is for
tough guys only.

771
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,819
- Okay, you guys ready?

772
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,300
Hey, are you okay?

773
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,780
- There's no reason anyone

774
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:22,305
should break their
leg on a rappel.

775
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:25,700
A rappel is an
infinitely safe thing.

776
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,659
You have to be a complete idiot

777
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,052
to break your leg on a rappel.

778
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:33,708
- Oh, shit, Matt.

779
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,884
Holy shit.

780
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:38,496
- I'm rolling, whoa, whoa.

781
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:42,717
- In canyoneering, a
lot of people come up

782
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,980
with ideas for techniques.

783
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,462
One person will look
at it and they'll say,

784
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:50,682
wow, that's a really
cool technique.

785
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:51,683
Other people will look at it

786
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:55,861
and they say "Holy
crap, that's dangerous."

787
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,647
Canyoneering above
all should be fun.

788
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:02,215
My biggest concern would be

789
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,565
when somebody else
looks at that video

790
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,307
what is their perception.

791
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:10,266
If somebody looks
at it and laughs

792
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:14,488
but inside, they're thinking,
"Man, that guy was lucky."

793
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,142
Okay.

794
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:19,667
If somebody is looking
at it and thinking,

795
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:22,235
"Here, hold my beer,
let me give it a try."

796
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:25,412
Then it's a problem.

797
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,153
- These are the people,
a lot of people,

798
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:29,459
that are going
down canyons today.

799
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,549
That's not good
for the rest of us.

800
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,898
And it's not good for canyons.

801
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,813
It's not good for
government agencies

802
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:36,728
that have to rescue them.

803
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,340
It's just kind of
spiraling out of control.

804
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,255
- Wow.

805
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,300
Holy shit.

806
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:49,479
I turned around the camera.

807
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:06,671
- Good morning.

808
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:09,630
What are your plans, man?

809
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,632
- Probably
heading back to town.

810
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:14,635
- You thinking about coming
up tonight or tomorrow

811
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:17,333
or basically calling it quits?

812
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,817
- Tomorrow I've gotta go get
some stuff done at my work.

813
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:25,864
- What are your plans, man?

814
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,909
- I think
I'm gonna go home.

815
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,781
- What's your plan?

816
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:33,523
- I don't know,
not feeling so well.

817
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,090
- What's your plans, man?

818
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:38,050
- I think it's
gonna be a day off

819
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,660
or do something short.

820
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:42,794
- Some people are calling it
quits and going home early.

821
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,839
- .

822
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,146
- Rendezvous are
not guided events.

823
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:50,105
They're an opportunity for
self-reliant canyoneers

824
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:54,066
to get together with other
self-reliant canyoneers.

825
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,676
So, folks, we're
doing really well.

826
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,460
It's40 and people
are showing up

827
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:58,984
for our eight o'clock departure.

828
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:05,033
And when you tell everybody
they're equally responsible,

829
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:07,383
they all become cats

830
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:09,385
and nobody's able to hurt them.

831
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:11,257
- So guys, this brings
up a good point.

832
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,824
We're already running late.

833
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:15,304
So, I think let's
make some decisions.

834
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,958
Are we all one group?

835
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:17,916
Are we two group,

836
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,396
and what's our plan of attack?

837
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,661
Who's in the top
down, playing around?

838
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:26,751
So, pretty much we're one group.

839
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,405
- I'm comfortable that we
can move quickly enough.

840
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:31,712
- I'm not.
- And finish with headlamps.

841
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,322
- I have done it.

842
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:34,933
I'm not confident.

843
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:37,283
Playing through is
always a challenge.

844
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,850
We're just gonna
have to be efficient.

845
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,808
We're gonna have to be
better at being efficient.

846
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:44,769
- Okay, let's go.

847
00:44:46,988 --> 00:44:47,510
- And when it's all
over, I look back on it

848
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:50,426
and take a deep
breath, heavy sigh.

849
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,473
- With
attendees assembled

850
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,214
from all over the U.S.,

851
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,390
Rich's Arizona
rendezvous was geared

852
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,522
for a successful week.

853
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,960
But those who couldn't
make it to the event had

854
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,919
to find adventure
closer to home.

855
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:13,972
- Woohoohoo.
- Yeah.

856
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:14,973
- That's a hoohoo.

857
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,801
- Going deep now.

858
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:18,716
Oh, in the beginning,
it was amazing

859
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,630
how many times we could
do the same canyon over

860
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,936
and over again.

861
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:24,983
Being that their local, it's
just an hour drive away,

862
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:27,333
I've probably been
through Little Santa Anita

863
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:28,726
30 times, perhaps.

864
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,207
- Woohoo, got me down
in the woohoo again.

865
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:36,081
- I think I tired on doing
the same, same canyons.

866
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:37,865
Yeah, you definitely
wanted to graduate

867
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,346
to something a
little bit bigger.

868
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:43,871
A bigger rappel, just to
have different challenges.

869
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:46,526
Certainly getting into
canyons where it is necessary

870
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:48,397
to build your own anchors.

871
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:52,358
It's not gonna just be
clip onto a bolt and go.

872
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,490
- With
a steady regiment

873
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:55,796
of home base canyoneering,

874
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:00,061
Steve's desire for more exotic
adventures was mounting.

875
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:02,150
But until his next trip to Utah,

876
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,892
he would have to settle
for local terrain.

877
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:11,986
So desperate was his
quest for thrills,

878
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,989
Steve was primed
for any opportunity,

879
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,427
even recognizing his chance
after floodwaters had set off

880
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:20,778
a landslide into his canyon.

881
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:22,040
- I remember last
time we were here,

882
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,564
there was a bunch of boulders
that needed to be moved.

883
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,305
That's why I thought
this would work.

884
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:28,046
- With his
favorite rappel section buried

885
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,917
under rocks and debris,

886
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:32,441
Steve sees the challenge
to restore the canyon

887
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,313
to original condition.

888
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:38,099
- I think the key stone
to move is right there.

889
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,058
- It probably
weighs 500 pounds.

890
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,933
- You know how much fun that
was to go down this channel,

891
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:50,024
then walk underneath the
chalk stone and come out.

892
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:51,809
There was a pool underneath.

893
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:12,830
We had some movement!

894
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,007
- I was a little concerned,

895
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:18,444
particularly when Steve climbed
underneath that big rock

896
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:21,273
and were dislodging
these very large boulders

897
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:25,320
that were probably anywhere
from 100 to 500 pound.

898
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:39,987
It was a little exciting
and a little disconcerting.

899
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,033
I was more worried about him.

900
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:45,079
- Look at that, look at it go.

901
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,735
There she blows.

902
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:53,348
- Initially we
started to move beyond

903
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,873
what we would consider
simple canyons

904
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:58,005
and do some more
difficult canyons.

905
00:47:58,136 --> 00:48:00,573
I moved up the ladder
to a certain level

906
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:02,444
and a certain comfort zone,

907
00:48:02,575 --> 00:48:06,057
and he went beyond that
and move into areas

908
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:10,191
that he was comfortable
in doing, but I wasn't.

909
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:12,106
As you explore more
and more of these,

910
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:14,892
you really need to leave
off at that one rung

911
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:19,026
and let the people who
are more equipped to climb

912
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,464
to the next rung continue on.

913
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,904
- There was an element
that you want to move on

914
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:31,125
into more difficult canyons
that require more skills.

915
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:34,999
I think everybody who has
the sense of adventure

916
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:39,873
in the outdoors, always wants
to challenge themselves.

917
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,962
You feel that you
have what it takes,

918
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:44,269
and to get out there
and actually do it,

919
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:48,055
it's exciting to find
out what you're made of.

920
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:50,144
What you can overcome.

921
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:52,016
- My hat was off to him

922
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:53,756
and he was very
comfortable in starting

923
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,064
to do some of the more
difficult canyons.

924
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:58,544
I was happy to see that

925
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:01,721
as long as he was
doing things safely.

926
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,122
- As we started doing
bigger and nastier canyons,

927
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:14,299
we started thinking about
it very intellectually.

928
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:18,129
What kinds of problems
could we run into down here?

929
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:19,782
What if you get too cold?

930
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:21,610
What if your pack
self-destructs?

931
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:23,090
What if your rope is cut?

932
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:25,701
Any of these things
could happen.

933
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,181
- On one end of the spectrum,

934
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:29,618
you have things like
somebody's t-shirt got stuck

935
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,229
in their rappelling device.

936
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,796
It's not life threatening,
it just is a problem

937
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:36,974
that needs to be
addressed in some way.

938
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:38,540
And then on the other
end of the spectrum,

939
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,977
you've got things like,

940
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:43,067
what if I go out into
a canyon all by myself

941
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:46,200
and pull a rock down
on top of my arm.

942
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:49,334
- So I, and the boulder
smashed my left hand here.

943
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:52,206
- We were in constant fear
of running out of bolts

944
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,600
or having a rope
chopped from rockfall

945
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,559
and so we started
inventing ways of dealing

946
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:58,821
with these problems.

947
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:04,305
Climbers used bat
hooks for a long time

948
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:07,917
and simply that they were
little c-shaped hooks.

949
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,268
You were able to engineer
your way up the rock

950
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,444
without placing a
number of bolts,

951
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:15,273
simply by climbing
up the little holes.

952
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:18,015
It would also be a way of
climbing out of canyons

953
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,191
if we ever got
stuck by bad weather

954
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,410
or injury or something else.

955
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:32,507
Later on, as the years went by,

956
00:50:32,638 --> 00:50:35,119
there were a number
of people that died

957
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:37,686
because they hadn't
been thoughtful enough

958
00:50:37,817 --> 00:50:41,516
to figure out some of
these what if questions.

959
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:48,262
- Hm, 640, the
same shutter speed.

960
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:49,176
Let's see, hold it,

961
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,873
there's a thing here.

962
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:53,615
May 26, 2011,
that's not long ago.

963
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:57,576
This hike is doable
for experienced hikers.

964
00:50:57,706 --> 00:51:00,274
The water level was very low,

965
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:03,103
which added
considerable difficulty.

966
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:04,931
Hmm.

967
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,282
Easy route back out
of the canyon is

968
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:11,155
through a, is tough to navigate.

969
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,897
We had to do it in the dark.

970
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:17,509
Well, with some scrambling.

971
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,250
No kidding.

972
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,383
Allow six to eight
hours for this hike.

973
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:25,908
Six to eight hours.

974
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,258
I've never done it
in less than five.

975
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,434
It's always been
about five for me.

976
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:33,351
I have no idea who would
have taken that long.

977
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:34,656
Let's read more.

978
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:38,269
Well, well, a 57 year
old lady made it through

979
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:41,141
with some help.

980
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:42,099
Six to eight hours.

981
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,362
Well, it's a 57 year old lady

982
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:46,625
that's never
exercised in her life.

983
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,583
But maybe it was tough.

984
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:52,631
Anyway.

985
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:57,157
Oh, let's see.

986
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:58,811
So we're, say,51.

987
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,995
I'm gonna write this thing down.

988
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:17,090
But if they'd spent
some money on it

989
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,440
like the CCCs did
back in the '30s

990
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,529
when they made all
these other trails,

991
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,183
then it would last a long time.

992
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:26,143
So, anyway, here's
that other sign.

993
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:32,061
So, well, it's exactly
the same sign as up above,

994
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:35,543
but they're just saying do
not descend the Black Hole.

995
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:37,632
That's ridiculous.

996
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:41,897
Just only well-prepared people
should do it, or something.

997
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,249
This is a little
bit of overkill.

998
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:47,381
I guess they're trying
to save themselves

999
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:50,645
from having to come out
here and rescue people

1000
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:53,474
and I don't know how many
times they've had to do that.

1001
00:52:53,605 --> 00:52:55,781
That one girl from
Alpine or American Fork

1002
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,652
or somewhere up in
northern Utah, you know,

1003
00:52:57,783 --> 00:52:59,263
she got drowned.

1004
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,829
They had a big flood,

1005
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,963
a big storm up near
Bridges National Monument

1006
00:53:04,093 --> 00:53:08,446
and that was on a Friday,
Friday afternoon, I suppose,

1007
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:11,405
and then they came in
here Saturday morning

1008
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,538
and the flood came about
eight o'clock as I recall

1009
00:53:13,668 --> 00:53:18,282
and it caught them right
in the worst possible place

1010
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,980
that they could be for a flood

1011
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:24,418
and they lost one
girl, a teenage girl.

1012
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:25,767
That's what this is all about.

1013
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:27,943
They're afraid people
are gonna come down,

1014
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:30,294
the ill-prepared people
are gonna come down here

1015
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:34,907
and attempt it and then
they'll have to drag them out.

1016
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:37,039
So, anyway.

1017
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,522
- It was supposed

1018
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:44,525
to be a five day
adventure of a lifetime.

1019
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:47,920
David Fleischer and Kim
Ellis helped lead a group

1020
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,749
of teenage hikers from
Salt Lake City down

1021
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:54,187
into one of Zion's most
treacherous narrow canyons.

1022
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,539
- A
foreboding canyon,

1023
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,888
Kolob Creek had
first been explored

1024
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:02,587
by Dennis and his
friends in 1978.

1025
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,243
They couldn't have
known at the time,

1026
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:08,854
but their canyon would
become the setting of tragedy

1027
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:10,856
when 15 years later,

1028
00:54:10,986 --> 00:54:14,425
a boy scout group
attempted the same descent.

1029
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:16,514
- When they did
that first rappel,

1030
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,907
they're in water
that is normally

1031
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:22,259
one inch to two inches deep.

1032
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:24,522
It was so swift right there

1033
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:26,393
that they could hardly
keep their footing.

1034
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,699
I'm out of there.

1035
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,006
Right then, this is
obviously too much water.

1036
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:32,399
- With
excess water arriving

1037
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,053
from a nearby reservoir,

1038
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:37,274
the group found the
canyon in unusual form.

1039
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:40,277
- Can you describe what
that should look like

1040
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:44,542
if it were safe?

1041
00:54:44,672 --> 00:54:46,283
- You wouldn't hear any noise.

1042
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:48,372
You'd hear a nice
babbling little brook,

1043
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:51,070
and a little trickle of
water going through there.

1044
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,985
- I can understand, okay, well,

1045
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:55,030
why don't we just go down
a couple little drops

1046
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:57,859
and see what it's like and
maybe leave rope someplace,

1047
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,773
but they didn't do that.

1048
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:02,473
They just went for it.

1049
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:03,778
- At that point in time,

1050
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:05,302
they should have been
giving it a lot more thought

1051
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:08,522
and made a decision that
maybe we're not aware

1052
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:11,612
of what conditions we're
gonna face downstream.

1053
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,571
- Rappelling
into turbulent water,

1054
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:16,356
group leader David Fleischer
was caught in a whirlpool

1055
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,489
while still connected
to the rope.

1056
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,796
In a brave, hasty effort
to rescue his partner,

1057
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,711
Kim Ellis jumped into the pool,

1058
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:27,498
but in the chaos, Ellis hit
his head on the rock wall

1059
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:29,761
and disappeared under water.

1060
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:32,503
- The decision should
have been made right then.

1061
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,505
Let's get out of this canyon.

1062
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:36,333
To try and continue
and then turn around

1063
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:39,640
and lose a second
person was unnecessary.

1064
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:42,339
- Believing
it was too difficult

1065
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:43,775
to retreat up canyon,

1066
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:47,822
a rattled Fleischer ordered
the group to proceed.

1067
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:50,608
But less than a hundred feet
from where Ellis had vanished

1068
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:53,437
and while descending into
another churning pool,

1069
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:57,397
Fleischer was again pulled
into the powerful hydraulics.

1070
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,404
- David Fleischer
and Kim Ellis both drowned

1071
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:06,101
in raging waters.

1072
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:10,236
The six survivors could only
wait and hope for rescue.

1073
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,718
- He just wanted to take the
kids down that canyon so bad

1074
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:17,983
that he completely forgot who
he was and where they were.

1075
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:25,251
- It's unfortunate that a
couple people lost there lives.

1076
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,513
It's especially unfortunate

1077
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:29,124
because it didn't
have to happen.

1078
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,605
There were some errors
in judgment made.

1079
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:39,439
- Just as
Zion had been grounds

1080
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,659
to the first influx
of canyoneers,

1081
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:45,924
the park would also witness a
steady increase in accidents.

1082
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,928
In response, park
managers went to work

1083
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:53,279
in developing sophisticated
rescue procedures focused

1084
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,196
on extracting victims
from inaccessible canyons.

1085
00:56:57,326 --> 00:57:00,721
And with an average of 60
backcountry rescues each summer,

1086
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:02,897
the national park
had plenty of chances

1087
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:04,943
to perfect their skills.

1088
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,642
- Of course we want to
be good at what we do,

1089
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:10,470
and so we want to be good
at search and rescue.

1090
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,994
We want to improve the
high angle techniques

1091
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,518
that we can use.

1092
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:17,303
We wanna improve our
emergency medical skills.

1093
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,611
So I do feel like
we've got an advanced,

1094
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:24,092
highly competent search
and rescue team in the park

1095
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,140
but that's not really the
message we wanna get across.

1096
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,098
If you get hurt in one
of the slot canyons,

1097
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:32,057
you're gonna be
there for a while

1098
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:34,276
and we'd rather
people recognize that

1099
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:37,236
than feel like there's a
highly competent rescue team

1100
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:40,457
in Zion and that I
can go push my limits

1101
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:43,677
and those guys will go get
me if something bad happens.

1102
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,944
I believe strongly in
the concept of wilderness

1103
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:51,685
and part of that
concept of wilderness

1104
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:53,121
is the idea that
when people go out,

1105
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:55,297
we have to make good decisions,

1106
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:58,823
and if we don't, we're
gonna pay for those.

1107
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:03,958
We want people to be ready to
solve problems for themselves.

1108
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:06,091
We want people to be ready
to take care of themselves

1109
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:08,093
and we definitely
don't want people

1110
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:09,964
to feel like somebody's
gonna take care of them

1111
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:11,792
if they make mistakes.

1112
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,753
I hope that people
continue to look

1113
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:18,625
for more tools in their toolbox,

1114
00:58:18,756 --> 00:58:21,062
more ability to solve
problems on their own,

1115
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:23,587
and I also hope that people
continue to understand

1116
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,677
that Zion is more than
simply an outdoor playground.

1117
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:30,158
It's a national park,
it's a wilderness.

1118
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:52,529
- So you guys all know
this isn't a guided trip.

1119
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:56,533
We're all responsible for
ourselves and each other, right?

1120
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:01,625
I think an important
part of my job is

1121
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:03,627
to facilitate experiences,

1122
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:06,543
not to be the boss,

1123
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,587
and to encourage other people

1124
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:10,982
to become self-reliant
canyoneers.

1125
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:15,290
If my goal is to step back and
let them solve the problems

1126
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,292
and let them make the decisions,

1127
00:59:17,423 --> 00:59:20,426
I start getting a little
nervous if it's a large group.

1128
00:59:24,735 --> 00:59:27,651
- Okay, someones off on that,
so go ahead, next person.

1129
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:30,871
- On rappel.

1130
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:36,747
- Okay, rope.

1131
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:44,581
- All right, who ever is next.

1132
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:49,063
- I do have high expectations
from former students.

1133
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:53,024
I am confident that I give
them a solid skill set

1134
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:55,200
for their toolbox.

1135
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,810
Off rope.
- Okay.

1136
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:00,161
- Thank you, Steve.

1137
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:01,598
- Just seeing people that
are willing to step up

1138
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:02,860
and accept some responsibility

1139
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,907
and not wait for somebody else
to do what needs to be done,

1140
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:09,083
pretty proud of the
guys that I trained

1141
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,042
that stepped up to the plate.

1142
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:12,609
- Off rope.
- Off rope.

1143
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:20,791
- Hey, Quint.

1144
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:23,881
You two and two more?
- Yeah.

1145
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:25,709
- Once things
started moving smoothly

1146
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,668
it was nice to just sit
back and be one of the crew

1147
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,236
going through a canyon.

1148
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,847
Demonstrating competency
throughout the canyon,

1149
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:37,590
Rich and his team were rewarded
with a thrilling finale.

1150
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:10,536
- Six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11.

1151
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,886
- It's your reflection
in the window there.

1152
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:15,367
It looks like
there's someone else.

1153
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:18,196
- You coming up
with 11 like I am?

1154
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:25,116
- Now I can take my wetsuit off.

1155
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:28,336
- But put your hiking boots on

1156
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:30,774
in case we have go
looking for Walt.

1157
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:33,037
Walt is missing.
- What?

1158
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:36,344
We thought Walt
was with you guys.

1159
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:37,998
Oh, was Walt with us?
- No.

1160
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:40,174
- From where I was, I could
see where he was going

1161
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:42,611
and I said, "Walt,
it's not gonna work."

1162
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,352
And he said, "Oh,
don't worry about it.

1163
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,877
"I'll go up to the
top of the ridge."

1164
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:48,574
So he went.

1165
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,750
The problem with somebody
taking off on their own

1166
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:52,883
and not telling the
group what they're doing

1167
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,972
is they leave the
rest of the group

1168
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:59,454
in a position where they've
gotta guess what's going on.

1169
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:01,326
And right now it would
be really nice to believe

1170
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:04,068
that he's still in that
creek bed heading that way.

1171
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:05,678
Because he kept asking me

1172
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,942
what direction is
my truck from here.

1173
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:13,338
And I pointed, I said, but
you don't wanna go that way.

1174
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:16,384
He could have got cliffed
out, slipped and fell.

1175
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:19,126
He could be hurt out
there bleeding somewhere,

1176
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:22,086
and we have no idea
where the hell he is.

1177
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:28,092
- Structure.
- Come on.

1178
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:31,922
Find a hold.

1179
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:36,753
- There's a protocol
for the lost person.

1180
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:41,148
The protocol is to sit down
and let yourself be found.

1181
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:45,283
Of course, not all people
know that they're lost.

1182
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,028
If you know what
the person is doing,

1183
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:53,726
you can come up with a plan.

1184
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,816
But we had no idea
what he was up to.

1185
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,427
It's a very helpless feeling.

1186
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,945
- There are a select
few places we'd be able

1187
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:42,079
to pick him up at

1188
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:45,517
so we're just gonna
have to hope for that.

1189
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,870
- Oh my gosh.

1190
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:00,488
- Did you see my flashing
headlamp over there?

1191
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,926
- Walt, we are happy to see you.

1192
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:04,405
- I figured you
were either happy

1193
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:06,103
or you were gonna ditch me.

1194
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:09,933
- No, we did wait a
considerable amount of time.

1195
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:12,065
- Well.
- Hey, well let's.

1196
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:14,241
- I owe you all a
nice dinner for that.

1197
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:15,503
- No, no, no, you're fine.

1198
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:16,765
- No, I'm not fine.

1199
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,419
I screwed up .

1200
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,684
- I was thinking ,
we just dodged a bullet.

1201
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:30,910
There was an extreme amount
of luck involved in that.

1202
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:34,392
Part of me was relieved,
I was happy to see him,

1203
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:35,915
happy to see him safe.

1204
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:38,700
Another part of me
wanted to kick his ass.

1205
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:39,876
- Jigger huh?

1206
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:42,879
- Okay.
- No, I'm still pissed at him.

1207
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:45,882
- Well, I.

1208
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:05,989
Following the success

1209
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,860
of his first technical guide,

1210
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,689
Mike set out to create
a second volume.

1211
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:13,822
Hoping to include new
offerings in the updated book,

1212
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:17,478
he turned to more
challenging canyons.

1213
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:20,394
- In the last, well,
three or four years,

1214
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:25,008
I was continuing to get to
do more difficult canyons

1215
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,140
and maybe I've got too
many difficult canyons

1216
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:30,927
in that edition.

1217
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:41,024
It would be nice to be the
first to get through this thing.

1218
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:43,635
That's what everybody
wants to do.

1219
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:47,378
They want to be the first
descent or something.

1220
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:56,039
It took a while to
get down, didn't it?

1221
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:00,478
- Mike's opportunity
for challenge arrived

1222
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:02,959
in the form of high stemming.

1223
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,840
Too narrow at the
bottom for passage,

1224
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:19,845
v-shaped canyons force the
canyoneer high off the ground

1225
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,066
and where a climber might
place protection from a fall,

1226
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:26,417
smooth canyon walls
offer little support.

1227
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,683
As Mike's adventures
reach new heights,

1228
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,598
so do the consequences.

1229
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:41,084
- The extreme now of
course is X slot canyons.

1230
01:06:41,214 --> 01:06:44,261
That's definitely
life-threatening there.

1231
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:47,090
- The X and the R are
actually part of kind of an

1232
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,614
off the wall rock
climbing rating.

1233
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,137
And it basically boils down

1234
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:54,053
to the risk involved
in the canyon.

1235
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:58,188
The X canyon might have

1236
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:00,886
some difficult
exposed rock climbing.

1237
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,105
It might be a canyon

1238
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:04,977
that's got very long
sections of commitment.

1239
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,457
You do a rappel, pull your rope,

1240
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:10,504
and you have no choice
but to finish the canyon.

1241
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:14,247
- In 2008,
Mike's updated version

1242
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:16,162
of his Technical
Canyoneering guide

1243
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:20,210
had included over a dozen
R and X rated canyons.

1244
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:24,431
- There's people who want
to extend the adventure

1245
01:07:24,562 --> 01:07:25,824
of going through these canyons

1246
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:27,217
and those are the only
ones who are gonna

1247
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:30,437
even attempt R or
X rated canyons.

1248
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:32,048
I guess that's the
reason I added it,

1249
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:35,051
for those who want to go as
far as they possibly can.

1250
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,791
That's hitting the
limit for most people,

1251
01:07:36,922 --> 01:07:38,489
the absolute limit.

1252
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,148
- One person could
make an argument

1253
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:47,106
that they shouldn't
be published at all

1254
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,586
to keep people away from them.

1255
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,849
Other people will say,
yeah, but sooner or later

1256
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:52,242
people are gonna hear about 'em,

1257
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:56,115
so we're doing the community a
service if we do publish them

1258
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:57,638
and make it very clear

1259
01:07:57,769 --> 01:08:00,076
that these are difficult,
high risk canyons.

1260
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,168
- And hopefully
they'll have the sense

1261
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:06,560
to work their way up,

1262
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,433
start out with just simple
rappelling and simple slots

1263
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:10,782
and then work up to the point

1264
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:13,350
where you're doing a
lot of chimney work.

1265
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,047
- I think there
is a fair warning

1266
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:19,312
as long as people in fact
understand the rating system

1267
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:20,792
and more importantly,

1268
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:22,489
they've actually done
an honest assessment

1269
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,491
of their own skills.

1270
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:27,277
Some people do a couple
of easy canyons and say,

1271
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:29,017
"Okay, what's next?"
and they wanna jump

1272
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:31,150
into something big.

1273
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,195
They need to pay more dues

1274
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:35,111
before they jump
into the big ones.

1275
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,861
- Okay, let me think about
this just for a second.

1276
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,604
- With a growing
resume of canyon descents,

1277
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:54,391
Steve progressed into
more serious endeavors.

1278
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,005
And expanding on a
knowledge base gained

1279
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,312
from early canyoneering classes,

1280
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:04,009
he sharpened his skills
under the guidance

1281
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,098
of experienced partners.

1282
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:07,317
- Thank you.
- When you're the belayer

1283
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:08,622
at the bottom.
- Yeah.

1284
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:09,971
- You want to keep
your arms locked

1285
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,712
so you walk your arms up.

1286
01:09:11,843 --> 01:09:14,150
Pushing into the wall.

1287
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,848
- Pushing into the wall.
- Now you can bend.

1288
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:19,546
- So, just sliding
my hands up the body.

1289
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:20,808
Just uh.
- Yeah, you work them up.

1290
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:21,896
- Work em up.

1291
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,681
Okay, not sliding .

1292
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:26,249
- Don't pull, push.

1293
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:27,293
You were pulling me down.

1294
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:30,383
- Oh okay .

1295
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:35,388
- Oh yeah, very nice.

1296
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:43,744
- I've got it.

1297
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,272
- Poifect.

1298
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,238
- I'm not doing that.

1299
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,154
- As part of a team,

1300
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:05,505
difficult canyons were traversed
with ease and efficiency.

1301
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:08,987
But as Steve advanced into
more hazardous ratings,

1302
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:12,338
the biggest challenge
still eluded him.

1303
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,215
- The walls are
low at this point,

1304
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:22,000
marked at 1265
meters on the map.

1305
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:26,700
So climb left or north
up a little ridge.

1306
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:30,182
Once on top, route
find northeast

1307
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:34,404
to where you can overlook
the lower end of Middle Fork.

1308
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:36,884
Planning for an X canyon,

1309
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:39,235
I think initially there's,

1310
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:42,803
there's some anxiety as to

1311
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,284
what am I getting myself into.

1312
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:48,287
You immediately have to wrap
while the canyon tightens up

1313
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:49,723
and you'll start
your high stemming up

1314
01:10:49,854 --> 01:10:52,378
to about 10 meters or so.

1315
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:55,163
Certainly in a canyon that
requires high stemming,

1316
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:57,253
you're putting a
lot on the line.

1317
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,429
You have to have
the skills to do it.

1318
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:03,781
If you don't, then you're
in the wrong canyon.

1319
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:06,087
Knowing what you're
getting yourself into

1320
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:08,002
I think is very important.

1321
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:09,961
Knowing that it's
something that you're going

1322
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:13,791
to be comfortable with

1323
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:16,315
'cause you are committing
yourself to the canyon

1324
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,405
and you have to complete.

1325
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:21,102
Safely.

1326
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:32,549
- As far as evolving from
just walk through canyons

1327
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:35,291
to the X slots,

1328
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:36,814
I mean, it's just
natural progression.

1329
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:38,119
You're looking
for new adventure.

1330
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,949
Everybody's looking
for new adventure.

1331
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,430
So it's just natural
progression from walking

1332
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:46,563
up to the X slots.

1333
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:51,307
So yeah, my readers come
along with me, I'm sure.

1334
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:54,745
We got about halfway
through the canyon

1335
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,486
and had to turn back.

1336
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:58,488
Just down a bit is
where it slots up again

1337
01:11:58,618 --> 01:12:00,359
and that's the middle slot.

1338
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,926
It's an XX slot.

1339
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:03,623
So it's a good one.

1340
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:07,323
Anyway, we went down there
and had to come back out.

1341
01:12:07,453 --> 01:12:08,889
On the right hand side
of that wall there

1342
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,587
is what we climbed up.

1343
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:12,893
And right now, I'd hate to
go back and do it again.

1344
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:14,939
It looks pretty tough to me.

1345
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:24,427
Okay.

1346
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:26,864
I think about where
it turns there is

1347
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:31,129
where it starts to get
pretty nasty looking.

1348
01:12:31,259 --> 01:12:33,087
- A dark,
menacing fracture.

1349
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:35,612
Scorpion West was
listed in his guidebook

1350
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:39,398
as the most difficult canyon
the author had ever seen.

1351
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:41,792
- And I was down climbing
one piece without the helmet.

1352
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:43,663
None of us had helmets on

1353
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:47,363
because we were just getting
into the difficult spot

1354
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,060
and I slipped and fell.

1355
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,322
I fell on my pack,

1356
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:52,803
but my head hit the rock
behind or something.

1357
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,152
It wasn't very far, you know,

1358
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:56,633
and it was bleeding like a dolt,

1359
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,374
but nobody took my picture then.

1360
01:12:58,504 --> 01:12:59,723
- High
off the ground,

1361
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,421
the group encountered green
moss covering the walls.

1362
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:04,467
Without the friction
of the sandstone,

1363
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:08,471
the already treacherous
adventure had become deadly.

1364
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:10,647
- I think we were
getting exhausted.

1365
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,213
You know, this was a hot summer

1366
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:14,259
and we were getting
tired at that point

1367
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,393
and decided it was
too much for us now.

1368
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:18,698
- Fatigued from hours

1369
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:20,570
of relentless high stemming,

1370
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,485
Mike and his group turned back.

1371
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:25,575
In his book, Mike deemed
the canyon impossible

1372
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:28,142
without the aid of
climbing hardware.

1373
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:31,058
It was his first
incomplete canyon.

1374
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,234
- Well, I don't really
have any animosity

1375
01:13:33,365 --> 01:13:36,412
or whatever toward the canyon.

1376
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:39,589
We just didn't make
it and that's it.

1377
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:44,420
Don't cry over spilt milk
or whatever they say.

1378
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:51,296
But, I mean, I started
getting up close

1379
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,559
to 60 when I was doing
this for the first time,

1380
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:57,171
so it pays, with
something this difficult,

1381
01:13:57,302 --> 01:14:00,479
it pays to be young
and a little stupid

1382
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,090
like I was when I was a
younger, mountain-climbing,

1383
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:06,616
big glaciers, big
crevasses, going alone.

1384
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:10,489
Kind of stupid.

1385
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,751
You gotta retire sooner or later

1386
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:14,754
from some of this
difficult stuff.

1387
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:17,714
I'd rather live to
die of old age than

1388
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:21,065
in the bottom of one
of these, frankly.

1389
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:28,986
- He's starting to reach
his limit of what he can do

1390
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,770
comfortably and safely

1391
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:33,947
and I think he recognizes
it which is great.

1392
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:38,038
My concern goes up
as the ratings go up,

1393
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:41,738
but I know he's fully
capable of these.

1394
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:46,090
But there's always the
risk factor that goes up.

1395
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,396
You have to, again,
be comfortable in
what you're doing,

1396
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,659
and at some point,
you have to realize

1397
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:51,530
that maybe you
shouldn't be doing it

1398
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:53,706
and maybe that's why
they call it Don't Do It.

1399
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:09,200
- A long ways down.

1400
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:18,252
Having an idea what an X
canyon is and the stemming,

1401
01:15:18,383 --> 01:15:22,996
it's certainly, it woke me
up at night more than once.

1402
01:15:23,127 --> 01:15:26,696
What am I gonna be doing,
risking great injury

1403
01:15:26,826 --> 01:15:29,350
if I were to fail.

1404
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,274
I'm feeling good, absolutely.

1405
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:41,537
I think there's
some nesting birds

1406
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,364
that live right there.

1407
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:54,332
It looks tight.

1408
01:15:54,462 --> 01:15:57,291
It's lots of, right away,

1409
01:15:57,422 --> 01:16:00,730
gee, that's like a
foot wide down there.

1410
01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:22,403
Crazy.

1411
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:30,716
- Dude, that
whole thing is moving.

1412
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,500
- Is it really?

1413
01:16:32,631 --> 01:16:34,807
Oh, I don't like that at all.

1414
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:39,769
Oh, poop.

1415
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:44,338
I saw it move.

1416
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,736
That pack is heavy.

1417
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:58,962
What if something happens
that's not going your way?

1418
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:02,356
What if someone tires
and can't proceed?

1419
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:10,538
What if part of your two,
if someone were to fall,

1420
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:14,934
what do you do?

1421
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:17,676
You hope that, well,
you're planning,

1422
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:20,113
you're planning that
you have a strong team

1423
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:24,074
and there's not gonna be
any of those what ifs.

1424
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:41,091
All right.

1425
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:44,137
Wow, it really, the
bottom did drop away.

1426
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:48,011
I would say we're
probably 50 feet up.

1427
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:50,927
It's hard to get a clear
picture of the bottom.

1428
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,711
I'm gonna say that's 50.

1429
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:06,159
Now I'm forced to go
down just a little bit.

1430
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,599
We're getting a little mossy.

1431
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,211
It's not wet,

1432
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:16,953
but certainly below
me looks moist,

1433
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,912
but this part right here is not.

1434
01:18:20,043 --> 01:18:23,916
I think it needs a little
water to come back to life.

1435
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:37,843
I gotta get up higher.

1436
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:51,814
Don't wanna rely
on that handhold.

1437
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:10,571
Got a charlie horse .

1438
01:19:10,702 --> 01:19:12,399
I'm getting a workout here.

1439
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:15,446
Elbows are starting
to feel abraded.

1440
01:19:20,146 --> 01:19:24,977
This section's, I think you
can actually see further

1441
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:29,242
to the bottom and maybe it's a
little psychological as well.

1442
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:34,639
I think at some point it
crosses over from less fun

1443
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,338
to more challenge and
I enjoy the challenge

1444
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:41,733
so you can keep
developing your skills,

1445
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:44,649
but I think the
fun has diminished.

1446
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:07,803
Up here at the turn, it looks
like it's a wider bottom,

1447
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:10,153
it looks like I can make
out a little bit of a sand

1448
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:12,633
on the bottom and
maybe some grass.

1449
01:20:12,764 --> 01:20:14,853
So, hopefully we'll be
walking for a little bit

1450
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:18,030
and move forward.

1451
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:19,553
Get off the stemming
here for a little bit

1452
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,947
and let our bodies recuperate.

1453
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,954
Or I see now, I guess I
really didn't see the bottom.

1454
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:30,303
I thought I did.

1455
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:32,871
Maybe I was fantasizing but
now I can look out there

1456
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:34,481
and see that golden wall,

1457
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:38,877
so I suspect we should
be walking at that point.

1458
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:42,272
Whew.

1459
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:46,537
I think we're gonna be walking
here in another 30 yards.

1460
01:20:52,151 --> 01:20:54,110
The canyon did not relent.

1461
01:20:55,676 --> 01:21:00,072
I guess, I'm just gonna wait
until I see what it is for sure

1462
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:02,858
because I thought
it was opening up

1463
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:06,035
but it's still very tight.

1464
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:21,050
Here we are at the end
of the stemming section,

1465
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,182
the long section
that Kelsey describes

1466
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:25,968
as an hour and a
half of stemming.

1467
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:29,319
And at this point
here is a way to exit

1468
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:34,106
if you don't want to continue
on with more stemming.

1469
01:21:34,237 --> 01:21:38,154
Certainly people can get
out here and walk back.

1470
01:21:39,633 --> 01:21:41,853
So that's where we are and

1471
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:50,731
we're just gonna continue on.

1472
01:21:50,862 --> 01:21:52,908
Oof.

1473
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,218
- Don't Do
It delivered everything

1474
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:01,307
the guide book had promised.

1475
01:22:01,438 --> 01:22:04,049
An unrelenting testing
ground where a careless move

1476
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,486
would be deadly.

1477
01:22:06,617 --> 01:22:08,924
After hours of
continuous high stemming

1478
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:12,188
at heights up to 60 feet
above the canyon floor,

1479
01:22:12,318 --> 01:22:15,147
Steve found his
ultimate adventure.

1480
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:16,192
- It was long day.

1481
01:22:16,322 --> 01:22:17,671
It was an early start.

1482
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:21,023
It was a lot of fun
and the challenges,

1483
01:22:21,153 --> 01:22:23,895
I think that defines
an adventure.

1484
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,768
The risk is part
of the excitement.

1485
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:30,510
It certainly is for me.

1486
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:35,385
- Only a short
distance from the final rappel,

1487
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:37,300
Steve would soon add Don't Do It

1488
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,042
to his list of accomplishments.

1489
01:22:52,315 --> 01:22:55,840
- Well, we just had
a cloud move overhead

1490
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:01,237
and we're getting a very
light drizzle on us right now.

1491
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:06,633
A little drizzle's not
gonna be a problem.

1492
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:10,768
It would be nice to get
out of the tight section.

1493
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,514
It's pretty tight right there.

1494
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:22,171
The walls are getting
slippery here.

1495
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:33,573
- Steve!

1496
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:37,621
Steve!

1497
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:52,157
- You do kind of climb the
ladder as you continue on

1498
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:56,248
and do perhaps more
challenging canyons.

1499
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:58,120
When you start to
feel more comfortable

1500
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,600
with that last rung, you
move onto another one

1501
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,473
because you tend
to look for more,

1502
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,170
I don't know whether
it's challenging

1503
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:08,260
or more beautiful places to go.

1504
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:10,915
But we look for the
beauty that's out there

1505
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,961
and sometimes that
beauty comes in places

1506
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:17,052
where there is some
degree of risk.

1507
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:19,184
You just hope you
can manage that risk

1508
01:24:19,315 --> 01:24:21,578
and continue on and
find that beauty.

1509
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,329
- I can still put weight on it.

1510
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:39,335
I just took a little
slip right here

1511
01:24:39,465 --> 01:24:41,293
when a rock broke loose

1512
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:45,080
and it kind of made my
shoulder hurt a little bit

1513
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:48,561
but I still have
good mobility in it.

1514
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:02,880
Oh, gotta keep pulling
it really hard.

1515
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,405
It caught me totally off guard
that my foot was gonna slip

1516
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:09,843
and it was quite a scare.

1517
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:11,367
All you could to
was grasp at things

1518
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:14,979
to do your best to stop.

1519
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,200
Fortunately I did.

1520
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,505
There's not much more stemming

1521
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:23,205
but that's not gonna
help the stemming any.

1522
01:25:23,335 --> 01:25:27,470
It may have been 40 feet
still off the deck there.

1523
01:25:29,646 --> 01:25:33,737
I was fortunate that it
wasn't worse than it was.

1524
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,392
- A few years ago I did
feel a responsibility

1525
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:23,265
as the guy that started the ACA,

1526
01:26:23,395 --> 01:26:25,658
as the guy that was
training other instructors

1527
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:27,443
and so on and so on.

1528
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:31,011
I felt like pulling
my hair out at times.

1529
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:35,233
Thinking like why isn't
this message sinking in?

1530
01:26:35,364 --> 01:26:37,453
- Get and length and
width out of there.

1531
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,802
- But I'm at the point now,

1532
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,284
maybe I'm just older, wiser,
more patient, whatever.

1533
01:26:43,502 --> 01:26:46,331
I just know people
are gonna be people

1534
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:48,768
and some people you can teach,

1535
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:52,816
some people need to
learn it the hard way.

1536
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:55,210
Some people are gonna get hurt.

1537
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,385
Some people are gonna die,

1538
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,952
but you can't help everybody.

1539
01:27:09,746 --> 01:27:12,401
- Well, that's
where I wanted it.

1540
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:22,889
That just went on and on.

1541
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:25,457
That was just relentless.

1542
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:28,460
I'm tired.

1543
01:27:33,857 --> 01:27:35,337
My arm feels better
now after my fall,

1544
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:38,296
like maybe the
ibuprofen kicked in.

1545
01:27:41,517 --> 01:27:42,344
I've done it.

1546
01:27:42,474 --> 01:27:45,347
I'm glad I did it.

1547
01:27:45,477 --> 01:27:48,785
Not likely I'll come
back and do it again.

1548
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:57,272
Good time to pack it
up and get outta here.

1549
01:27:58,925 --> 01:28:01,841
I'm a little cold now.

1550
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:10,285
- If you don't want to be
thought of as a canyonista,

1551
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:13,375
you really need to
increase your skillset

1552
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:16,160
so that you can make
decisions on your own

1553
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,336
and so you can get
yourself safely

1554
01:28:18,467 --> 01:28:20,730
through a canyon on your own,

1555
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,515
whatever it might throw at you.

1556
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:27,214
You don't have to
have Canyon Beta.

1557
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,478
You don't have to
read guidebooks.

1558
01:28:29,608 --> 01:28:31,915
If you want, really,
to be a gorger

1559
01:28:32,045 --> 01:28:35,310
in the true sense
of the old term,

1560
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,312
you wanna go down there blind

1561
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:41,316
and just react to what
happens and do it well.

1562
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,448
That's gorging.

1563
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:53,458
Dark slide.

1564
01:28:53,589 --> 01:28:57,506
Now we wait for
people to be gone.

1565
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:02,728
This could take a while.

1566
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:04,730
There are too many canyoneers.

1567
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:06,471
There are too few canyons.

1568
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:09,605
Go, go, keep walking.

1569
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:11,955
Keep walking .

1570
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:13,870
That's really the
bottom line for me

1571
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,134
is I'd like these canyons
to remain the way they were

1572
01:29:17,264 --> 01:29:20,833
when I saw them first,
and that's impossible.

1573
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:24,620
Except a couple of canyons
that they haven't found yet

1574
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:28,624
and I'll be damned if I'll
tell them where they are.
