1
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,556
Stroke! Stroke!

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,645
Stroke! Stroke!

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,104
Stroke! Stroke!

4
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:56,624
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

5
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,217
Pick him up, pick him up.

6
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,924
Son of a bitch!

7
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,351
I mean, Your Honor,
that was a hell of a shot.

8
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,182
<i>Well, I'm currently doing an
externship for two extra credits</i>

9
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:14,358
<i>as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten.</i>

10
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,777
B.J. Hookstratten?

11
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:20,482
That's more impressive
than being in the top 5%.

12
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:23,192
Look, I don't know what kind of offers
you've had from Wall Street...

13
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,199
The top five, sir. In my class.

14
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:27,905
Not the top 5%.
I'm sorry, I just...

15
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:31,208
Mr. McDeere, we've just
offered you $68,000 a year

16
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:33,661
from arguably the leading
law firm in Chicago.

17
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,542
Is there somewhere else
you have to be?

18
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:37,501
Yes, sir. I have a job.
I'm just on lunch break.

19
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,251
<i>I know you've
had a lot of offers.</i>

20
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,304
<i>Did you know, for example,
that we have 127 clients</i>

21
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:46,257
<i>that are Fortune 500 companies?
Now, look, we'll offer you $74, 000...</i>

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,184
...our billing requirement for a
first-year associate is only 2,000 hours,

23
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,433
not the usual 25 or 26 or 2,700.

24
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,357
We want you to have a
life outside the office, Mitch.

25
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,185
And if you're a Lakers fan,
we have a fabulous box at the Forum.

26
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,852
<i>I know there are firms
from all over the country</i>

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,329
<i>that have been up here
offering you everything.</i>

28
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:12,533
<i>But with your ability and ambition,
there is only one place for you,</i>

29
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,708
<i>and that's with our
firm in Washington...</i>

30
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,786
<i>Let's stop talking
about the ribbon on the package,</i>

31
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,416
<i>and start talking about
what's in the package.</i>

32
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:19,965
<i>One of our partners is an
ex-governor, two are congressmen</i>

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,042
<i>and one's a former
Senator of Agriculture.</i>

34
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:25,755
May I take your coat, sir?

35
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,649
- Mitchell McDeere, right?
- Yes.

36
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,822
Lamar Quinn. Come on in.

37
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,278
I'd like you to meet

38
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,737
- Oliver Lambert, our senior partner.
- Mitch. Mitch.

39
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,493
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Royce McKnight,

40
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,698
- our managing partner.
- How do you do, sir?

41
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,704
- Welcome.
- Care for a drink?

42
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:57,411
- No, I'm fine.
- Take a seat, Mitch.

43
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,382
Tired of interviews?

44
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:05,176
No, sir. I just don't
quite know what to say.

45
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,095
Unusual for a lawyer.

46
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,299
I can get tongue-tied in any
number of situations, sir,

47
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:11,725
but it's usually with my wife.

48
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:16,388
Would you mind describing one,
with your wife?

49
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,976
The first time I saw her.

50
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,857
Any time we argue.

51
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,532
Whenever she walks into a room,
as a matter of fact.

52
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,862
Might we ask
about the rest of your family?

53
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,289
My father was killed
in the coal mines

54
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:37,083
and my mother remarried
and lives in Florida.

55
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,127
Brothers and sisters?

56
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:41,462
None.

57
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:45,338
Mitch, I hope you don't
think us intrusive,

58
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,638
but stability in the family
has a special importance for us.

59
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:53,513
Bendini, Lambert & Locke
is just a small Memphis firm,

60
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,515
41 lawyers.

61
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:59,724
But we're a large family.
So we're careful.

62
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,231
Now, sir, do you have
any questions for us?

63
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,235
Do you have an offer in mind?

64
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:16,160
It includes a bonus schedule,

65
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,664
a low-interest mortgage
so you can buy a home,

66
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:24,123
country club membership,
and we'll lease you a new Mercedes.

67
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:25,253
You pick the color, Mitch.

68
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,175
Lamar, you haven't been
paying attention.

69
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,378
His wife picks the color.

70
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,266
- Do I... Do I open it here?
- Of course.

71
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,064
Unless you can tell us what's in it.

72
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,854
A lawyer worth that offer
shouldn't have to open the envelope.

73
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,455
Mr. McKnight, you are
the managing partner

74
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,579
at Bendini, Lambert & Locke,
is that correct?

75
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:00,705
Yes.

76
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,081
Did Mr. Lambert, as senior partner,

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,959
give you any instructions
regarding my employment?

78
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,290
He did.

79
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:11,341
And, Mr. McKnight, do you usually
follow Mr. Lambert's instructions?

80
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,549
Objection.
Vague. Ambiguous.

81
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,008
Sustained.

82
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,348
What precisely were
those instructions?

83
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:24,900
That you were in great demand,
and I should make certain

84
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:29,355
that we obtained your services before
a bidding situation developed.

85
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,903
How did you go about making certain?

86
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,871
I bribed a clerk in the Harvard
Law placement office

87
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,870
for the exact amount
of the highest offer,

88
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,161
and then added 20%.

89
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:48,837
Mitch, the letter you got
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke

90
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,089
was the only one sent out.
We want you.

91
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:21,991
Okay.

92
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,665
You're gonna have to leave now.
I'm expecting my husband.

93
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,496
The hell with him.

94
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,048
Come here.

95
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:37,548
Moo shu pork, Szechwan beef,
mandarin duck from Wong Boys.

96
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,011
It's even got a cork.

97
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,766
What's going on?

98
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,266
You remember the letter I got
from that firm in Memphis?

99
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,726
Memphis?

100
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,857
That's what I thought,
until their offer.

101
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,483
What was the offer?

102
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,486
They didn't say.
It's in there.

103
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,698
It's sealed.

104
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,124
I guessed.

105
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:05,958
What?

106
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,332
Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.

107
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,844
Plus a 5% increase the second year.

108
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,263
Why?

109
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:25,721
"Why?"
Whose side are you on anyway?

110
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,564
Yours.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,393
<i>Plus bonuses, plus
a low interest mortgage...</i>

112
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,103
<i>As in a home,
with grass around it?</i>

113
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,816
<i>They want to fly us down
to Memphis for a little visit.</i>

114
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,470
If you've been in one limo,
you've been in them all.

115
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:17,280
Bye. See you later, Your Honor.

116
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,994
Sir.

117
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,955
Hey, Mitch.

118
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,710
Come on, associates first,

119
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,542
then lunch with the partners
in our private dining room.

120
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,471
He's our number one
draft pick, so to speak,

121
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:45,471
and he's being romanced
by the big boys

122
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,678
from New York and Chicago
and everywhere else,

123
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:52,023
so we have to sell him on
our little firm here in Memphis.

124
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,189
Meanwhile, he's gonna try
not to be embarrassed

125
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,364
while I remind you that he's about to
graduate from Harvard with honors.

126
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,528
Hear, hear.

127
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:08,368
No one's divorced in the Firm?

128
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,367
No one's divorced in the Firm.

129
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,044
- Impossible.
- No bachelors either.

130
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,046
What about women?

131
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,215
- They had one once.
- Only one?

132
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,464
Alice Krauss,
wobbled around on 4" heels.

133
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,887
Affirmative action on stilts.

134
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,803
All white, all male,
all married, huh?

135
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,813
- What the hell is this?
- There he goes.

136
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:37,064
Hey!

137
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,925
It's different from the northeast.

138
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,221
The pace, we're almost stately
by comparison.

139
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:08,346
Courteous and not as gossipy.

140
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,598
We keep each other's secrets.

141
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,099
I like that.

142
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,516
What do you like about it?

143
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,024
All of it. It's a family.
Just the way you said.

144
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,288
For the last three years,

145
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,874
I've been teaching in the Boston
area at a private school.

146
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,121
Do you work?

147
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,711
Well, not since
I put Lamar through law school.

148
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,709
But, you know,
working isn't forbidden.

149
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,291
- Forbidden?
- Working, by the Firm, you know.

150
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,547
- How could it be forbidden?
- It isn't.

151
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,722
Anyway, two babies in 14 months
and I had all the work I could handle.

152
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,471
- Do you plan to start a family?
- Maybe in a couple of years.

153
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,469
The Firm encourages children.

154
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,141
How do they do that exactly?

155
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,489
Hey, how about it?

156
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,157
How about it.

157
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:13,248
Okay, okay. The Love Boat band,
the secret recipe ribs,

158
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:14,603
they're a little square maybe...

159
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:18,002
I don't mind square.
I like square. Weird, I mind.

160
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,167
What do you mean, "weird"?

161
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,498
Well, here's a quote.

162
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:25,586
"The Firm does not forbid me to take
a job, and they encourage children."

163
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,261
Ask me why.

164
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,930
Because they love kids.

165
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,599
Because children promote stability.

166
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:34,094
Want to hear more?

167
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,514
No, you're right.

168
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,358
Don't pay any attention. I'm just gonna
throw myself over the rail.

169
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:44,150
- I think my will is self-explanatory.
- Okay, okay, okay.

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,857
These are nice people, Abby.

171
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,442
These are nice people.
Okay.

172
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:50,778
I'm more impressed with it than you are.
You grew up with it.

173
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,865
Do you know what
$96,000 a year is here?

174
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,707
It's like 150 in New York.

175
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,706
Did you ever think
I'd make a six-figure salary?

176
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,458
Absolutely.

177
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,793
You did?

178
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:10,214
Well, your folks! Your folks
are only a few hours away, too.

179
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,636
You mean, if we fight,
I don't have far to drive.

180
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,217
Exactly.

181
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,316
She made two
phone calls from the hotel,

182
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:28,569
one to her parents
and one to the Memphis School Board.

183
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,073
She seemed a little reluctant.

184
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,906
I'd hate to lose this young man.

185
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,662
I think she'll come around.

186
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,493
What about Kozinski and Hodges?

187
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:43,546
Have you spoken to Chicago?

188
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:45,916
I have.

189
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,385
It's not good.

190
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,180
We're gonna have to do something.

191
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,067
I drew the happy face.

192
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,408
Where's Memphis?

193
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,066
Is that it?

194
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,489
- Yeah?
- It looks different.

195
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,488
It's prettier than the
pictures they sent.

196
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:40,705
"Mitch and Abby, we've taken the liberty
of furnishing the house temporarily.

197
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,623
"Just a few things
to make you feel at home.

198
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,372
"Hope you don't mind."

199
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,506
Abby!

200
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,728
Not bad, huh?

201
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,064
Where's yours?

202
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,416
- Don't get up.
- Don't worry.

203
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,513
Mitchell McDeere.

204
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,216
Tad eager are we, Mr. McDeere?

205
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,228
What are you doing?

206
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,980
Dutch says you've been
here since 6:30.

207
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,561
I thought I'd jump start
the bar exam work.

208
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,988
Good. No associate has ever
failed the bar exam, you know.

209
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,815
Come on.
I'll show you your new office.

210
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,738
Wally Hudson, Contracts.

211
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,490
- Here to help with the bar exam.
- Thanks, Wally.

212
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,489
No associate of the Firm
has ever failed the bar exam.

213
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,911
The first day is a four-hour
multiple choice on ethics.

214
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,496
Look at the first six chapters.
I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.

215
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,084
Oh, no associate of this firm
has ever failed the bar exam.

216
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,839
No kidding.

217
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,843
- Ken Curry. Domestic Relations.
- Mike Allen. Wills and Estates.

218
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,511
Nina.

219
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,259
Fuck! Please.

220
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,638
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

221
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,519
Actually,
I think I'm here to help you.

222
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,317
I'm Avery Tolar,
your designated mentor.

223
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,565
Let's go to lunch.

224
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,188
Lunch? But it's not even...

225
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,445
Not even noon, I know.
It will be a working lunch.

226
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:24,698
Come on up to my office
while I drop this off.

227
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:27,913
Everything depends on billing.

228
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,150
How many hours you spend
even thinking about a client.

229
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:34,170
I don't care if you're stuck in traffic
or shaving or sitting on a park bench.

230
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,713
Now, my particular field...

231
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,069
Is forming limited partnerships
for offshore corporations,

232
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,751
mainly in the Cayman Islands.

233
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:44,006
Good. I want you to review the last one
I did for a client named Sonny Capps.

234
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,715
He made over 14 million last year,

235
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,347
paid less than 4% in taxes
and resents every buck of it.

236
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:52,181
But he paid us $400,000 in fees,
so I don't want to make him unhappy.

237
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:54,231
Take a look at the deal,
see if you can come up with anything.

238
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,059
Madge, tell him
I'll call him in the morning, please.

239
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,065
Yes, Mr. Tolar.
Should I save these for later?

240
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,272
- Could you, please?
- What do you mean by "anything"?

241
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,443
What do you think I mean?

242
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,566
I don't know, you're the risk taker.

243
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,529
Do you think I'm talking
about breaking the law?

244
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:08,162
No, I'm just trying to figure out
how far you want it bent.

245
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,786
As far as you can
without breaking it.

246
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,284
In other words,
don't risk an IRS audit.

247
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:15,127
I don't give a damn about an audit.
They just better not win.

248
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,497
Yes, Mr. Tolar?

249
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,457
Something before lunch?

250
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:23,632
I should warn you the Firm frowns
on drinking during office hours.

251
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:25,255
Iced tea, please.

252
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,636
Bombay martini on the rocks,
Ellis, three olives.

253
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:29,134
On the way.

254
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,684
Senator.

255
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,604
I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.

256
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:36,937
- Put that in the bedroom, please.
- Hey, hon, I made you some tea.

257
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:40,190
Kay, please. I've never had so many
people trying to do things for me.

258
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,523
It's the South, Abby.
We encumber you with hospitality.

259
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,485
Would you like to have your phone
programmed for speed dialing, ma'am?

260
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,863
Other than my husband's office number,
let's see, that's...

261
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:53,120
We have it, Mrs. McDeere. We do all
the installations for the Firm.

262
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,329
Oh.

263
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,545
What led you to law school?

264
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,170
- I can't remember, really.
- Sure you can, Counselor.

265
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,588
I was a delivery boy
for a pizza parlor.

266
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,594
One day the owner
got a notice from the IRS.

267
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:10,474
He was an immigrant,
didn't know much English,

268
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,893
even less about withholding tax.

269
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:14,847
He went bankrupt.
Lost his store.

270
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,394
That was the first time
I thought of being a lawyer.

271
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,475
In other words, you're an idealist.

272
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,482
I don't know any tax lawyer
who's an idealist.

273
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,940
When he lost his store, I lost my job,
and it scared me.

274
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,070
- Being out of work?
- No.

275
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,902
What the government
can do to anybody.

276
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,870
What about you?
What led you to law school?

277
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:37,919
It's so far back
I don't think I can remember.

278
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,088
Sure you can, Counselor.

279
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,626
I used to caddie for young lawyers
off from work on weekdays

280
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,336
and their wives.

281
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:51,349
I'd look at those long tan legs
and just knew I had to be a lawyer.

282
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,057
The wives had long tan legs, too.

283
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,441
Ellis, another martini, please.

284
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:03,144
So we're not a couple of idealists.

285
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,855
Heaven forbid.

286
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,701
- Hi.
- Hi.

287
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:20,040
I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.

288
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,337
- Are you sure it's today?
- That's what he told me.

289
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,096
Kay?

290
00:20:35,718 --> 00:20:37,311
There's been...

291
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:41,436
Marty Kozinski and
Joe Hodges were killed.

292
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,942
We just got word
about 20 minutes ago.

293
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,157
Did you meet them at the barbecue?

294
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,734
What happened, Kay?

295
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,320
We're not sure.

296
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:58,579
They were diving off a boat
on Grand Cayman,

297
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:02,253
and then there was some
kind of explosion on the boat.

298
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:17,643
Lamar?

299
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,017
Marty was...

300
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:26,061
His twin girls are a month
older than our son.

301
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,239
I'm very sorry, Lamar.

302
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh.

303
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:39,908
By the way, Oliver
wanted me to tell you,

304
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,624
you shouldn't be burdened
with a student loan.

305
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:48,333
Excuse me?

306
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:55,803
If you bring the papers by tomorrow,
the Firm will repay it for you.

307
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,990
Kay was scared.

308
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,070
What? No, she was upset.

309
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:20,828
There is a difference between
being upset and being scared.

310
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,783
She was scared.

311
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:26,041
Of what?
What, do you know her that well?

312
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,209
Maybe not.

313
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,337
But I've spent
a lot of time with her lately.

314
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,889
They have their own horses.

315
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,763
Two of them. Quarter Horses.

316
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,730
Does that make half a horse?

317
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,027
Sorry. I...

318
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:54,698
...and gently wipe away
every tear from our eyes.

319
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:59,950
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

320
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:01,656
Amen.

321
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,207
Let us pray.

322
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,128
Lord our God, you are always faithful
and quick to show mercy.

323
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:14,677
Our brother Marty was suddenly
and violently taken from us.

324
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,300
Come swiftly to his aid.

325
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:19,515
Have mercy on him,

326
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,434
and comfort his family and friends

327
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,390
by the power
and protection of the cross.

328
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,022
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.

329
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,862
Let us go in the peace of Christ.

330
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,822
I'm just gonna
go say goodbye to Oliver.

331
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:39,993
- Okay?
- Okay.

332
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,910
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right.

333
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,996
Mrs. McDeere, I'm Avery Tolar.

334
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,165
Oh!

335
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:57,219
You're the reason I see so little
of my husband these days.

336
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:59,672
He must be the most
ambitious man in the world.

337
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:00,927
One of them.

338
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:05,056
No, I mean leaving you every
day just to go off to work.

339
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,853
I'm sure you could manage.

340
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,685
Just tell me how.

341
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:17,823
Did you know them well?
The men who died?

342
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:19,241
Yes.

343
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:24,660
You must be overwhelmed with grief.

344
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:29,285
People grieve in different
ways, Mrs. McDeere.

345
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,053
Abby!

346
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,600
Hey, Hearsay, come here.

347
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,316
Shit.

348
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,448
- Is he in?
- Yes, Mr. Tolar.

349
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:47,992
Hell of a proposal, kiddo.

350
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:51,201
Just redraft this section
on repatriation of offshore funds.

351
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,580
I need it tomorrow.

352
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,709
- Tomorrow? I need another week!
- Can't have it, pal.

353
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,461
You and I are flying to the Caymans
tomorrow morning

354
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,008
to take on Mr. Sonny Capps
personally.

355
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:01,301
But the bar exam!

356
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,051
It will be here when
you get back, kiddo.

357
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,600
Shall I stay, Mr. McDeere?

358
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,396
Would you like me
to pick you up a sandwich?

359
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,680
No, I'm fine, Nina. Thank you.
You go on home.

360
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,765
- Good night.
- Good night.

361
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:36,129
- So what's good here?
- I'm just having coffee.

362
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,925
I'm going with the steak sandwich.

363
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,719
Two steak sandwiches on rolls,
please.

364
00:26:43,794 --> 00:26:45,762
Two steak sandwiches on rolls.

365
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,016
You with Bendini,
Lambert & Locke?

366
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:53,012
Yeah. How did you...

367
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:57,979
Ah! Sorry, I'm just a little...

368
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:00,231
It looks like
they're working you to death.

369
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,278
They do that with new associates,
I guess.

370
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,528
- I've just been with them now...
- Eight weeks.

371
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:12,157
Sorry, guys.
I'm just a little punchy.

372
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,583
That firm looks like
a health hazard.

373
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:17,753
- Hours they make you keep.
- Kind of work they make you do.

374
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:20,126
Kozinski and Hodges.

375
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:25,469
Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.

376
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:30,345
That's four dead lawyers out of 41
in less than 10 years.

377
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,802
And none of them
over the age of what, 45?

378
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:37,436
I mean, that beats the hell out of any life
insurance tables I've ever heard about.

379
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,437
Who are you guys?

380
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:44,442
Could we get those
sandwiches to go, please?

381
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:48,363
We'll probably see each other again.

382
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,961
The car wouldn't start.

383
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,343
I got

384
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:43,357
caught in this incredible accident,
12 cars, maybe 13.

385
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,197
There was a pregnant woman
in one of them.

386
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,616
I had to help deliver the baby.

387
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,578
It was a girl.

388
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:01,451
They said they're gonna
name her Abigail.

389
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:07,707
Come on, Abby. Why do you think
I'm working like this, huh?

390
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,791
- 'Cause I want you to have all the stuff...
- Wait a minute.

391
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,798
Wait a minute.

392
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,301
I never asked for anything, Mitch,
except for us to be together.

393
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,540
But I want to give it to you.

394
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,059
I want to give you everything
you gave up to marry me.

395
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:20,761
Stop it.

396
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,984
It's sweet. I know.

397
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,408
It's some kind of courtship,
but I don't need all that.

398
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,951
Just bring me flowers sometime.

399
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,965
What were you working on all night?

400
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:03,595
Just, you know, it's...

401
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,355
It's just this stuff Avery's got
me doing for the Cayman trip.

402
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:11,024
Hey, want to have some eggs?

403
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,946
I had some eggs.

404
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,023
Want to have some naked?

405
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,464
You don't even know
what moves me about you, do you?

406
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:43,223
Mitch, I know what you want,
but it's not for me.

407
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:46,055
It's not even for you.
And you know it.

408
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,816
It's easy for somebody rich
to talk about being poor

409
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,819
like it's some fly that's bothering
you and you just wave it away.

410
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,651
This isn't about rich or poor.

411
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:03,160
This is about trying to fix something
that won't get fixed with 10 Mercedes.

412
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:06,663
Hey, that's not fair, Abby!
That's not fair!

413
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:09,495
This is about a mother
in a trailer park.

414
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,582
And a brother you
pretend you don't have.

415
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:18,253
Have a nice trip.

416
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,519
<i>Just follow me,
and don't over-breathe.</i>

417
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:26,766
<i>What about Sonny Capps?</i>

418
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,264
<i>I thought we were under
a lot of pressure.</i>

419
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,599
<i>We're under
tremendous pressure.</i>

420
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,026
<i>If we don't get this dive in
before the bank, we can't do it.</i>

421
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,196
<i>You can't dive and then
fly within 24 hours.</i>

422
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,525
<i>I don't see how you can dive
so soon after the accident.</i>

423
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:41,952
<i>We don't even know what happened
to Kozinski and Hodges.</i>

424
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,828
<i>Hey, there was a
plane crash last week.</i>

425
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,706
<i>We didn't take a boat
to the Caymans, did we?</i>

426
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,128
That's ridiculous, Sonny.

427
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,298
Let us sit down with you
for five minutes. Thank you.

428
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:58,586
Son of a bitch pays less than 5% tax
and wants to fire us. The Hyatt!

429
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,967
This new plan
is very aggressive, Sonny,

430
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:10,314
and it defers all your tax liability for
years. And you could start right away.

431
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,979
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't talk right now.

432
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,979
These taxes are only deferred, right?

433
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:20,825
The future value of the tax dollars will
be less than half their present value.

434
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:23,160
- Who says?
- After the election...

435
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:26,325
Are you telling me who's gonna be in
the White House the next four years,

436
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,869
'cause that would be
valuable information.

437
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,368
- Well...
- Mr. Tolar has a plan that...

438
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,877
That meets all your needs,
whoever's in the White House.

439
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,375
- Let him tell me.
- He's been trying to.

440
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,923
Hey, who the fuck are you?
His lawyer or mine?

441
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:43,300
- Neither one, sir.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

442
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,886
Sonny, you're not the Firm's
only concern here.

443
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:52,522
We put you into deals
with other clients

444
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,936
where they may be very sensitive

445
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,815
about exposing their relationships
to outside attorneys.

446
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:01,273
You hear that, Counselor?
That's a veiled threat.

447
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,404
If you're talking about our friends
in Chicago,

448
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,165
they don't make money
when I pay you fees.

449
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:07,454
You make money when I pay you fees.

450
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,577
They make money
being in business with me.

451
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:10,915
And as long as
they're making money,

452
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:13,785
they don't give a flying fuck
who does my taxes.

453
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,338
Hey, you don't know me.
I'm a nice guy.

454
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:17,915
You lose a million bucks for me,

455
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,837
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna break your legs.

456
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:23,671
Sonny, let's don't get carried
away here, all right?

457
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:27,383
What did I say?

458
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,305
Maybe it's what you didn't say.

459
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:33,105
- "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?
- Thank you.

460
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,939
Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule

461
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:38,731
that virtually guarantees you
zero tax with zero risk.

462
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:41,446
The basis of your stock would be the
face amount of the installment note,

463
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:42,610
but the stock would have no value.

464
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:44,825
Even so, it's deducted
in offsets income.

465
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,621
You defer your tax in full
even though you have a bankable LC.

466
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:51,115
- Deferred till when?
- What do you care?

467
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,289
Whenever it is, it's still the best
interest free loan you'll ever get.

468
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:00,132
So the worst is, I pay my
taxes much, much later.

469
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:01,340
No.

470
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,260
The worst thing is next year
they're going to close the loophole,

471
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,425
change the regs and if
you haven't grabbed this proposal,

472
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:07,843
you're gonna feel like
you were fucked

473
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:11,302
with a dick big enough
for an elephant to feel it.

474
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,728
You know that for a fact?

475
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:22,480
Hey, you like the word "protege"?
I never had one. You ever been one?

476
00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:27,363
I'm A, you're B, right next door.

477
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:29,570
Avery, who's in Chicago?

478
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,952
We'll get to all that.

479
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:36,334
The hell with it.

480
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:37,748
Clean up and come on over.

481
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:40,421
You earned a good dinner
and a night out.

482
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:42,090
Hey.

483
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:16,916
I lost my son.

484
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,992
Don't you think I would have
screamed bloody murder

485
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:20,371
if I thought something was wrong?

486
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:23,920
You're right, Mr. Abanks, I'm sorry.
Okay? You're right. I'm sorry.

487
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:27,674
Nothing to bury even.
Just a stone.

488
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:30,673
They never did find him
or the other two.

489
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:33,680
What other two?

490
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:36,557
The other two who split the charter.

491
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,477
Your friends and two other guys.

492
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:42,355
- Lawyers?
- They were in swim suits.

493
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:44,648
They paid cash.

494
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:45,945
Were they American?

495
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:50,868
Could have been anything.
One was, I don't know, squat, heavy.

496
00:36:51,526 --> 00:36:56,077
Other guy had long blond hair,
almost white, with weird blue eyes.

497
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,049
- Mitch?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,086
Grab a Red Stripe out of the fridge.

499
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:10,921
I'm a little slow.

500
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,509
Take your time.

501
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:19,938
I'm trying to look as pretty as you,
which I'm convinced I can.

502
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,522
It just takes me a little longer.

503
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:27,070
You got anything to munch on?

504
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:30,991
Yeah, there's a thing full of
stuff next to the fridge.

505
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:35,071
It's got a lock on it. Use that key
from the ring I gave you.

506
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,752
Do you see it?

507
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,127
Yeah, sure.

508
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,270
You find something?

509
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:11,944
Listen, Capps is a tough guy,
but he's also a blowhard.

510
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,699
He loves to give the impression
that he's connected.

511
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,405
Thinks it's glamorous.

512
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:23,460
He said a couple of things.

513
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:31,006
Hey, you're about to
take the bar exam.

514
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:33,303
Here's a multiple choice.

515
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,174
The difference between tax
avoidance and tax evasion is...

516
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:40,386
A, whatever the IRS says.

517
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,394
B, a smart lawyer.

518
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,731
C, 10 years in prison.

519
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,404
D, all of the above.

520
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,234
Being a tax lawyer's
got nothing to do with the law.

521
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:56,989
It's a game.

522
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,908
We teach the rich how to play it,

523
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,614
so they can stay rich.

524
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:03,997
The IRS keeps changing the rules

525
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:06,996
so we can keep getting rich
teaching them.

526
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,582
It's a game. One you just
played very, very well.

527
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:12,588
Where's your beer?

528
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,011
I decided to wait for the rum.
I hear it's good down here.

529
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,680
Everything's good down here.
You deserve a taste of all of it.

530
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:37,109
I think that since we're
here on this island,

531
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:41,117
there's things we can do on it,
you know, primitive things.

532
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:43,869
Come on, you deserve it.

533
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:52,124
Look, I don't mean to hurt your
feelings, but this isn't gonna happen.

534
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:54,380
Would you tell my friend
I went back to the condo?

535
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:56,503
You don't know what you're missing.

536
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,390
Thanks anyway.

537
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,425
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me.

538
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,026
Are you all right?

539
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:57,231
It's okay.
Just wait a minute.

540
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:00,946
Wait a minute.

541
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:03,907
Can I look at this?

542
00:41:03,987 --> 00:41:05,864
You're not a doctor.

543
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:08,826
No, but I've

544
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,295
sprained a lot of ankles.

545
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,415
Mostly mine.

546
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:24,974
You should ice this.

547
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,431
You should also report that guy.

548
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,603
That was your boyfriend.

549
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:41,487
That was for money.

550
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:47,655
Oh.

551
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:55,998
- Aren't you gonna finish?
- I'm sorry.

552
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,461
- You think that's...
- Got nothing to do with me.

553
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:13,306
- Is this too tight?
- No.

554
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:21,072
I work in a travel agency.

555
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:32,162
I wanted to feel like
all those people

556
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:38,040
with first class tickets
and pretty clothes.

557
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,214
I guess I wanted to feel...

558
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,260
Rich.

559
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:04,236
How much would it
take to feel rich?

560
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:06,443
I don't know.

561
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:14,409
How much would it take to feel safe?

562
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:26,588
You did that.

563
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:33,136
You made me feel safe.

564
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:55,958
Hey...

565
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:19,231
Will you stay with me for a while?

566
00:45:47,895 --> 00:45:51,570
Why don't you take the afternoon off?
You deserve it.

567
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,617
Spend it with that
pretty wife of yours.

568
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:56,738
Oh, shit, I forgot,
she phoned last night.

569
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,748
What'd you tell her?

570
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,623
That you were probably
walking on the beach.

571
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:03,835
I was.

572
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,164
I guessed right then, didn't I?

573
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:15,762
Okay, Mr. McDeere.
If you'll sign where the "X" is

574
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,263
and initial where it's marked.

575
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:43,327
Well, well. The man from
<i>Gentleman's Quarterly.</i>

576
00:46:44,493 --> 00:46:46,495
How you doing, Ray?

577
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:49,298
Pretty fair. How's yourself?

578
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,756
It's a long time, huh?

579
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,309
It's okay.
I've become a patient man.

580
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,018
Don't beat yourself up, kid.

581
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,604
If I wasn't here,
I wouldn't want to be here either.

582
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:23,291
- Do you ever talk to Ma?
- A few months ago.

583
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,880
- Still with the same guy?
- They're all the same guy.

584
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:39,508
So, you finish law school?

585
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:41,675
Yeah.

586
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:44,929
That suit's a dead give-away.

587
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:48,812
What, you get a job on Wall Street?

588
00:47:48,891 --> 00:47:51,815
- You always said...
- No, I'm not. I just...

589
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:57,070
I went with a firm across
the river in Memphis.

590
00:47:57,149 --> 00:47:58,571
Memphis?

591
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,153
Hey, Ray,

592
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:03,781
wouldn't it be funny
if I went to Harvard and you went to jail

593
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:06,788
and we both ended up
surrounded by crooks?

594
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:12,958
Sonny Capps is thrilled.
McDeere was dazzling.

595
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,634
I think we ought to pull Lamar
out of that tax seminar in Washington

596
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,383
and send Mitch instead.

597
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,260
Let him take the jet.
Any problem with that, Bill?

598
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,808
No. No, no problem.

599
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:25,136
So far the kid's been
real predictable.

600
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:30,684
If you're even half right, you're gonna
need some help. What does Abby think?

601
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:33,732
I haven't told her.

602
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:38,532
I guess...

603
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:42,862
I guess I don't want it to be real.

604
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:46,161
Nothing's real until
I tell it to Abby.

605
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,671
How did you ever land a job
with a brother in the joint?

606
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,100
That's okay. I'd have done
the same thing myself.

607
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:15,357
You were always around for me, Ray.
All those years after Dad died.

608
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,530
I'd have done the same.

609
00:49:17,605 --> 00:49:21,985
You think I'd ever tell guys around
here I got a brother in Harvard?

610
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:25,120
Jesus, Ray.

611
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,040
Hey, listen. I want you
to see a friend of mine.

612
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,169
His name is Eddie Lomax. He's a
private investigator in Little Rock.

613
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:33,496
Ex-cop.

614
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:36,173
Anything I can do for you?

615
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:38,376
Sure. Get me out of here.

616
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:42,755
Where to?

617
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,139
Anywhere I can see a
whole lot of sky.

618
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:51,348
I can get through the days,
I even eat the food.

619
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,559
It's amazing how much
you miss the sky.

620
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:08,072
Ever plug one of these in
only you forgot to put the water in?

621
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:09,281
No.

622
00:50:10,032 --> 00:50:12,876
- Do you know what happens?
- No.

623
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:15,421
The lights go out.

624
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,094
He's been dying to see you
since you called.

625
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:24,171
That's what I saw.
Tammy!

626
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:28,096
Mr. Lomax will see you now.

627
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,096
- Mr. McDeere.
- Yes.

628
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,056
I practically went to
law school with you.

629
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,690
Ray talked about you every
stinking day for three years.

630
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,520
I was his cellmate,
he must have told you.

631
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,947
Did he tell you,
by the way, it was statutory rape?

632
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:45,071
She was 17. Looked 25.
I got one to four.

633
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,121
Sit down. Sit down. Come on. Sit down,
sit down. You want some Sweet'N Low?

634
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:49,287
- You want some dairy cream?
- No.

635
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:50,831
You want some sugar?
You want some...

636
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:52,283
Eddie, I've got some business

637
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,959
- I'd like to go over with you here.
- Good. Good. Good.

638
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:55,126
I owe your brother my life.

639
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:57,625
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you, dear.

640
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,879
That's my secretary.
She is terrific.

641
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,711
But she's got a nutcase for
a husband. He's a truck driver.

642
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,671
He moved here
to be close to Graceland.

643
00:51:05,754 --> 00:51:07,051
The reason why,
he thinks he's Elvis.

644
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:11,307
What do you think his name is?
It's Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.

645
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:13,308
I run across some strange
things in this job.

646
00:51:13,387 --> 00:51:16,687
Some things I'd never
spray-paint on an overpass.

647
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:20,736
Now, what can I do for you?

648
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:25,859
- What a nice surprise.
- Avery.

649
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,495
They didn't have to disturb you.
You didn't have to come down.

650
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,073
Believe me, it's no bother.

651
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,203
I was just looking for Mitch.

652
00:51:33,282 --> 00:51:35,376
Nina says he hasn't
been in all afternoon.

653
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:39,168
I didn't mean for her to call you.

654
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:42,416
Didn't he come back with you?

655
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,300
I'll be honest with you.
This is not my area of expertise.

656
00:51:47,296 --> 00:51:51,142
- But you think it's possible?
- Anything's possible.

657
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:54,471
I'll tell you one thing, if those guys
at the steak joint were feds,

658
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:55,805
you better watch out for them.

659
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:58,937
'Cause they don't give
a damn about you.

660
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:01,940
I get some pretty pissed
off husbands in here.

661
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:07,534
On the other hand, the lawyers at your
firm sure as hell seem accident prone.

662
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,240
Okay.

663
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:14,285
I'll see what I can find out.

664
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,619
You better let me call you.

665
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:23,549
You sure remind me of your brother.

666
00:52:25,501 --> 00:52:27,970
Ray comes up for parole in a while.

667
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,883
Says that he can last it.

668
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:34,139
What do you think?

669
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,482
There's guys that can do all the
hard time the State gives them.

670
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:43,903
Whatever Ray had,
he used up to get this far.

671
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:54,659
- Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,375
- I didn't think you were home.
- Why not?

673
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,078
- No car.
- I took it in for service.

674
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:04,005
Avery brought me home.

675
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,011
I went to the office
looking for you.

676
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,383
I wasn't there.

677
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:13,181
Apparently not.
I even looked under your desk.

678
00:53:14,216 --> 00:53:16,890
- Yeah, I went...
- Avery told me you were at MSU,

679
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,721
at the law library.

680
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:20,272
- Avery did.
- Avery did.

681
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:22,691
But when I happened to spot
your car in the parking lot,

682
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,110
it made him kind of edgy.

683
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:28,485
Yeah, well, Avery didn't
exactly know where I was.

684
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:29,986
Oh.

685
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:33,194
Probably thought you were
with another woman.

686
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,415
I went to see Ray.

687
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,622
Ray?

688
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:49,756
- Yeah.
- Just like that, after all this time?

689
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,888
You were right.
I've been stupid.

690
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,143
I would have gone
with you on Saturday.

691
00:53:58,218 --> 00:54:01,597
I know. God, I just wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.

692
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:08,654
How'd it go?

693
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:10,982
It was...

694
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:14,735
It was...

695
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:19,327
God, he...
He tried to make it easy for me.

696
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:23,081
Is he okay?

697
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:27,210
He's gotta get that parole.

698
00:54:32,586 --> 00:54:34,964
You want to try something?

699
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:36,845
Let's put the books away,

700
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:40,599
pretend we're back in our
old beat-up apartment, broke,

701
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:43,807
and we find some money
we forgot in pockets.

702
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,228
- We'll send out for pizza and drink beer.
- Drink beer.

703
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,399
And watch Star Search.

704
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:57,573
Who knows where it will lead.

705
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,019
Your wife?

706
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:24,643
- She's in Cleveland.
- She lies.

707
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,737
Don't you answer your phone?

708
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,736
Don't you knock?

709
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:36,943
Where's your secretary?

710
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:40,996
Out.

711
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:44,575
- She left a cigarette burning.
- She does that.

712
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:48,504
Why don't you come back in one hour,
and make an appointment?

713
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:50,377
Why bother? We're here.

714
00:55:50,456 --> 00:55:51,958
I'm busy.

715
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:54,626
Doing what?

716
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,712
I'm getting a pedicure.

717
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:59,465
What's it to you?

718
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:08,728
Now this is gonna turn
out badly for you,

719
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:10,480
but we can make it
relatively painless.

720
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,154
Why are you asking questions
about dead lawyers?

721
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:15,947
What dead lawyers?

722
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,745
Who hired you to do that?

723
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:27,706
Okay! Okay.

724
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,378
Just let me think.

725
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:38,797
His name was Julio Iglesias.

726
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:43,930
No! No!

727
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,056
Great!

728
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:50,729
Just great.

729
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:53,687
You want to ask him
a few questions now?

730
00:57:24,716 --> 00:57:27,265
<i>I think this is a carefully
balanced proposal.</i>

731
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:30,644
<i>I think it's high-minded
and I think it's fair-minded.</i>

732
00:57:30,722 --> 00:57:33,771
<i>In other words, it's got something
in it to offend everyone.</i>

733
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,437
<i>If you want to follow
along with me,</i>

734
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,615
<i>we'll begin on page "I"
of the introduction.</i>

735
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:45,325
<i>We'll revue sections 704-B
of the IRS code of 1986</i>

736
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:50,080
<i>and the treasury regulations
amended under Section 1/704-1.</i>

737
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:52,411
<i>Quote,
"The distribution provisions</i>

738
00:57:52,494 --> 00:57:55,338
<i>"in limited and general
partnership agreements."</i>

739
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:59,385
<i>These regulations permit the IRS
to disregard allocations</i>

740
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:00,961
<i>which are not made in accordance</i>

741
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,297
<i>with partners' interests
in the partnership</i>

742
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,805
<i>unless those allocations
satisfy the economic effect</i>

743
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,761
<i>most easily satisfied</i>

744
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:12,519
<i>by taking advantage of the safe
harbor provisions set forth therein.</i>

745
00:58:12,598 --> 00:58:16,068
<i>In other words, in an
ever-changing sea of tax laws...</i>

746
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:25,945
Hey, brother.

747
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:32,576
Brother, go down the steps
towards the pool.

748
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,753
Here you go, brother.

749
00:58:35,996 --> 00:58:38,340
- Voices from the Wall.
- Thanks a lot.

750
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:39,541
Oh, yeah.

751
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,751
Mister.

752
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,723
Who killed Eddie Lomax?

753
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:57,935
Go over and sit next to
the man on the bench.

754
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,998
I appreciate your coming,
Mr. McDeere.

755
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:21,459
I'll call you Mitch, if I may?

756
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:25,091
My name is Voyles.
Denton Voyles.

757
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,763
I'm with the Department of Justice.

758
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:29,136
What happened to Eddie Lomax?

759
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:34,017
We've been investigating Bendini,
Lambert & Locke for four years.

760
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,934
No lawyer has ever
left your law firm alive.

761
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:41,778
Two tried to leave,
they were killed.

762
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:45,027
Two were about to try,
you know what happened.

763
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:49,328
Now, we have reason to believe
that your house is bugged.

764
00:59:49,403 --> 00:59:52,998
Your phones are tapped,
your office is wired.

765
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:57,791
They may follow you, they may be here
in Washington as we speak.

766
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,134
Are you saying my life is in danger?

767
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:07,429
I'm saying that
your life as you know it is over.

768
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:14,057
Your law firm is the sole
legal representative

769
01:00:14,136 --> 01:00:16,605
of the Morolto crime
family in Chicago.

770
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,899
Known as the Mafia.
The Mob.

771
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,477
I don't believe it.

772
01:00:22,561 --> 01:00:24,063
<i>They set up legitimate businesses</i>

773
01:00:24,146 --> 01:00:27,867
with dirty money from drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

774
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:31,536
All cash, all moved
offshore. You believe it.

775
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,364
That's why you talked
to Thomas Abanks in the Caymans.

776
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,291
That's why you got
this private investigator

777
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:39,415
asking questions that
got him killed.

778
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:44,382
Maybe 30% of their
clients are legitimate.

779
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,085
They bring in a new rookie,

780
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:50,389
throw money at him,
buy the car, the house.

781
01:00:50,464 --> 01:00:54,219
After a couple of years,
and your kids are in private schools,

782
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:57,896
you're used to the good life,
they tell you the truth.

783
01:01:00,098 --> 01:01:01,850
You mean every partner
in the Firm is...

784
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:04,436
Every partner knows.

785
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:07,068
We suspect most of the associates.

786
01:01:11,985 --> 01:01:16,286
Why don't you get indictments
and bust it all up?

787
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,998
We have to have
somebody on the inside.

788
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:23,377
We need to see copies of contracts,
clients' bank records,

789
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:25,583
- articles of incorporation.
- Wait a minute.

790
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:28,339
- You think I'm...
- You can say no.

791
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,591
But we're gonna break this firm.

792
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:34,971
And when that happens, you're gonna
go to jail along with the rest.

793
01:01:35,717 --> 01:01:38,140
It will happen, son, believe me.

794
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:41,940
Why can't I just leave?

795
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,360
That's what Kozinski and
Hodges were trying to do.

796
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:50,024
You have to think this over.

797
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:54,328
Meanwhile, you and your wife have to
behave as though everything is normal.

798
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,874
Now don't discuss this with anyone,

799
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,461
but make a decision.

800
01:02:02,536 --> 01:02:06,166
If you help us,
we'll make it worth your while.

801
01:02:06,248 --> 01:02:07,875
Worth my while?

802
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,302
You can still have a
pretty good life.

803
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:14,052
You mean
in a witness protection program?

804
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:21,347
How?
I live somebody else's life?

805
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:25,734
In some nowhere place, and one day
I'm backing out of my driveway

806
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,649
and my car explodes?

807
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:31,156
Doesn't have to be that way.

808
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:35,486
I don't need much of a life,
Mr. Voyles, but it has to be mine.

809
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:38,163
Is that what you've got now, son?

810
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:44,661
You ought to get
back to the seminar.

811
01:02:44,744 --> 01:02:48,419
Tarrance has full authority
to negotiate on our behalf.

812
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,678
Why don't you wander back
past the memorial?

813
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:04,356
You can call me in Memphis anytime,
day or night.

814
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:06,934
The second one's a mobile number.

815
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:09,353
Let me get this straight.

816
01:03:09,436 --> 01:03:13,191
I steal files from the Firm
and turn them over to the FBI.

817
01:03:13,273 --> 01:03:16,117
Testify against my colleagues,
send them to jail.

818
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,314
They suckered you into this.

819
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,864
Reveal privileged information that
violates attorney-client confidences,

820
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:24,542
get me disbarred, and then testify
in open court against the Mafia.

821
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:27,872
- Well, unfortunately, Mitch...
- Let me ask you something.

822
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:30,548
Are you out of your fucking mind?

823
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,552
How long before they
find out Lomax's cellmate

824
01:03:33,627 --> 01:03:35,971
was a guy named Ray McDeere?

825
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:41,139
And when they do,
what do you think they'll do to him?

826
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,812
They can get to anyone, anywhere.

827
01:03:44,804 --> 01:03:46,306
What can you do?

828
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,768
Your brother comes up for
parole soon, doesn't he?

829
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:54,607
You cooperate with us, I'll
guarantee the board will be grateful.

830
01:03:55,607 --> 01:04:00,113
Otherwise... Well, you know what
those parole hearings are like.

831
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,998
It could go either way.

832
01:04:31,184 --> 01:04:33,778
Forget about home, driver.
Take me to the Firm.

833
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:35,855
- The employer will have...
- Mr. McDeere, you can't go in there!

834
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,612
Call everybody. Right now!

835
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:40,945
- I'm on overseas and I've got two...
- Right now!

836
01:04:41,027 --> 01:04:43,029
I just had a little
chat with the FBI.

837
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:52,713
- And they didn't try to coerce you?
- No.

838
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:57,882
- They didn't offer you money?
- Nope.

839
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,215
Did they ask you to
contact them again?

840
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,720
What for?

841
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:07,182
Exactly what did they want?

842
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:10,724
The secret files.

843
01:05:16,688 --> 01:05:18,736
Who had those secret files last?

844
01:05:18,857 --> 01:05:20,154
You have them, Royce?

845
01:05:20,233 --> 01:05:22,406
- I gave them to you.
- No.

846
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:27,249
They also suggested that Hodges
and Kozinski were murdered.

847
01:05:29,743 --> 01:05:31,916
Those sons of bitches!

848
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:38,590
Now, we ought to build a case
and sue. This is pure harassment.

849
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,341
And that was it?

850
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,595
That was everything that was said?

851
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,678
Well, I mean,
as far as I can remember.

852
01:05:47,761 --> 01:05:50,184
It wasn't exactly
a sequential conversation.

853
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:52,357
There was a lot of yelling,
mostly by me.

854
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:57,029
Mitch, we're always doing
battle with the government.

855
01:05:57,103 --> 01:06:00,949
If it isn't the Justice Department,
it's the IRS, and you know what?

856
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:03,364
We beat them every time.

857
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,866
And they hate us for it.

858
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:09,620
They can't get to us
so they pick on somebody new.

859
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,623
They invite you to break the law.

860
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,377
Doesn't cost them anything,
but it costs you everything.

861
01:06:18,249 --> 01:06:20,627
Now, I don't want you
to worry about this.

862
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,214
It's gotten serious enough.
We'll have to get into it legally.

863
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:28,427
I guess the only other question is,
who do we bill this hour to?

864
01:06:31,304 --> 01:06:32,977
How about the FBI?

865
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:10,177
I can't believe that.
That is so weird.

866
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,354
I was just thinking about you.

867
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:17,184
Somebody's burning leaves
outside, did you smell it?

868
01:07:17,308 --> 01:07:19,606
It reminded me of the time...

869
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:26,109
Hey!

870
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:29,992
If you're afraid you'll wake the kids,
we don't have any.

871
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:32,763
Abby!

872
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,358
Abby!

873
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,111
Abby!

874
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,074
- Abby!
- Don't say anything! Don't say anything!

875
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:52,077
Don't tell me any more!

876
01:08:52,904 --> 01:08:54,372
Everything.

877
01:08:55,114 --> 01:08:59,961
Every single thing we've said or
done since we've been in that house,

878
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,714
nothing has been between us.

879
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:07,215
Can't we just get in our own car
and drive back to Boston, tonight?

880
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:08,966
- We'll just leave everything.
- They'd find us.

881
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:11,328
How do you go to work tomorrow?
How do you look at Avery?

882
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:12,724
What do you say to him?

883
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,642
I talk about work.

884
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,888
- That's insane!
- I have thought of every possible way.

885
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:20,895
Here, in the Caymans, in
Washington, that's all I've done.

886
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:25,730
Try to think of a way out. if we run,
they'd find us, and it gets Ray killed.

887
01:09:25,812 --> 01:09:28,156
- But if you testify...
- The FBI says they'll help Ray

888
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:30,654
- and protect us.
- Protect what?

889
01:09:33,987 --> 01:09:36,331
What are you going to do?

890
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:40,501
Go in tomorrow and
start to copy files.

891
01:09:40,618 --> 01:09:42,120
I don't have a choice.

892
01:09:42,203 --> 01:09:44,456
Mitch,

893
01:09:44,539 --> 01:09:46,587
what are you saying?

894
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,668
You'll be revealing
clients' secrets.

895
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:50,313
- You'll be disbarred.
- Abby, don't...

896
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:53,057
You'll never be able to practice
law again for the rest of your life.

897
01:09:53,131 --> 01:09:56,305
Everything you've worked for!
They can't ask you to do that!

898
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:58,352
They are not asking!

899
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:10,195
We have to behave
exactly as we have been.

900
01:10:11,316 --> 01:10:15,412
We have to go to work
and come home every day

901
01:10:16,154 --> 01:10:20,000
and never wonder about the
walls and the wires...

902
01:10:20,074 --> 01:10:22,372
And do nothing we want to do.

903
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:39,553
Szechwan beef from Wong Boys.

904
01:10:40,428 --> 01:10:43,398
That was the last time
I remember laughing.

905
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:47,530
- Come on! Every single day we got...
- Oh, not you again, man.

906
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,312
...one of your trucks out here,
blocking this alley.

907
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:51,022
- Hey, leave me alone.
- What's it gonna take, huh?

908
01:10:51,105 --> 01:10:52,322
Hey, would you leave
me alone, buddy?

909
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:54,639
You're using
this place as a parking lot!

910
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:35,525
What the hell are you doing?

911
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:38,327
Jesus, I was just trying
to make a copy of...

912
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:43,041
They just started this. You have to
have the billing code for each client.

913
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:45,710
You mean every time
I copy a piece of paper, it's recorded?

914
01:11:45,785 --> 01:11:47,503
What are you trying to do,
kill yourself?

915
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,294
Come on.
Nina should do that anyway.

916
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,923
Come down for one night, can't you?

917
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,805
Well, it used to be worth it.

918
01:12:01,134 --> 01:12:05,310
Okay.
Yeah, maybe next time.

919
01:12:05,972 --> 01:12:07,690
Bye, Cordelia.

920
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:10,227
That was Cordelia.

921
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:12,482
Yeah. Your wife.

922
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:14,234
From the song of the same name.

923
01:12:14,313 --> 01:12:17,408
Avery, I have a couple of ideas
about those Capps LCs.

924
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:19,781
When's the next Cayman trip?

925
01:12:20,486 --> 01:12:22,739
For me? Next week.

926
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:26,543
If you think I'm gonna let Sonny Capps
get another look at you, you're crazy.

927
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:28,206
But you write down
every single thought you have.

928
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,671
I'll be happy to take credit.

929
01:12:32,665 --> 01:12:37,171
Mr. McDeere! Mr. Mulholland's
called twice about his bills again.

930
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:40,265
Tell Mr. Mulholland
to take his bill and...

931
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:42,637
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Isn't he just up the street?

932
01:12:42,717 --> 01:12:44,640
- Yes. In the Cotton Exchange.
- Cotton Exchange.

933
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,767
Tell him I'll see him later.

934
01:12:46,846 --> 01:12:49,770
Did you order a fried egg sandwich
from the Front Street Deli?

935
01:12:49,849 --> 01:12:51,647
A fried egg...

936
01:12:57,315 --> 01:12:59,409
Yes, I did. I did.

937
01:13:00,735 --> 01:13:02,203
Come in.

938
01:13:04,489 --> 01:13:07,493
It's $2.65.
The receipt's in the bag.

939
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:16,713
The receipt's in the bag.

940
01:13:36,354 --> 01:13:38,777
How did you see them,
and they didn't see you?

941
01:13:38,898 --> 01:13:40,775
I was under the desk.

942
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:48,792
I was vacuuming the rug.
You want me to draw you a diagram?

943
01:13:50,451 --> 01:13:51,953
I loved him.

944
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,753
I'm sorry, Tammy.

945
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,086
They wanted to know who hired him

946
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:03,636
and why he was asking questions
about dead lawyers.

947
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:10,476
You actually saw them?

948
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:16,774
One guy was stocky,
looked like a wrestler.

949
01:14:17,562 --> 01:14:20,111
He's gonna limp the rest of his life

950
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:23,280
'cause Eddie hit him in the knee
with that cannon under his desk.

951
01:14:25,444 --> 01:14:28,618
And the other guy
was like an albino.

952
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:34,830
Long thin hair,
almost white.

953
01:14:35,454 --> 01:14:37,081
Dead blue eyes.

954
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,665
My landlady said
they came looking for me yesterday,

955
01:14:41,669 --> 01:14:43,387
so I checked into the Motel 6
on River Street.

956
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:46,341
I couldn't think of
anywhere else to go.

957
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:53,598
Listen, they're gonna put Eddie
together with Ray, and when they do,

958
01:14:54,307 --> 01:14:56,150
it'll lead to you.

959
01:14:57,602 --> 01:14:59,980
I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

960
01:15:00,104 --> 01:15:02,198
Eddie wouldn't like it.

961
01:15:02,315 --> 01:15:05,114
So, you're in as much
trouble as I am.

962
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:10,615
<i>Listen, there's a building around
the corner called the Cotton Exchange.</i>

963
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:12,200
<i>Maybe you can help, Tammy.</i>

964
01:15:16,203 --> 01:15:17,455
Hi there, Mitch.

965
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:20,417
Bill Devasher, Firm Security.

966
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:24,970
Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert were telling
me about your little run in with the FBI.

967
01:15:25,046 --> 01:15:27,765
I wonder if we could
have a little talk.

968
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,842
Actually, I told them everything.

969
01:15:29,967 --> 01:15:31,647
I'm sure you did.
This won't take a minute.

970
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:41,896
Hop in.

971
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:14,554
So, Mitch,
this is a debriefing.

972
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,852
I know pretty much
what you told the fellows,

973
01:16:20,935 --> 01:16:23,233
so I kind of got the picture.

974
01:16:23,354 --> 01:16:26,198
Now it's my job to
give you the picture.

975
01:16:26,273 --> 01:16:29,072
What I'm concerned about,
son, is this.

976
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:32,037
The FBI wouldn't have come after you
if they didn't figure they'd get to you.

977
01:16:32,113 --> 01:16:34,286
What do you suppose
made them think that?

978
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:35,784
I have no idea.

979
01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:38,752
Well, see, it's my job
to have an idea about that.

980
01:16:38,869 --> 01:16:42,294
For example, they might know how
important your young wife is to you.

981
01:16:42,415 --> 01:16:44,258
They might use that.

982
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:46,589
How?

983
01:16:47,753 --> 01:16:51,678
Avery says last Friday
you took the afternoon off.

984
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:55,136
He figures you might have been
with another woman.

985
01:16:56,262 --> 01:16:57,388
- Why would Avery think...
- How do you know

986
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,939
you weren't followed?

987
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:07,402
Picture Abby one day
walking to the mail box,

988
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:12,112
anticipating the arrival of her Redbook,
her Sharper Image catalog.

989
01:17:13,404 --> 01:17:15,623
What does she find instead?

990
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,663
She finds heartache, Mitch.

991
01:17:19,618 --> 01:17:22,246
The death of love and trust.

992
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:24,957
Imagine her one day opening that.

993
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:27,130
Go ahead.
Take a look.

994
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:32,465
Devastating.

995
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:39,689
Not just screwing, Mitch.

996
01:17:41,515 --> 01:17:45,611
But the kind of intimate acts,
oral and whatnot,

997
01:17:46,645 --> 01:17:50,149
that can be particularly hard
for a trusting young wife to forgive

998
01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:52,368
and impossible to forget.

999
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,921
That's just the kind of stuff the
FBI could use for coercion, Mitch.

1000
01:18:02,995 --> 01:18:04,997
So you watch yourself.

1001
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:08,710
I'll do the best I can
to protect you,

1002
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:12,338
and I know you will do your best
to protect the Firm.

1003
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:16,889
So if the FBI so much
as spits in your direction,

1004
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:20,730
you'll let me know before
it hits the ground, won't you?

1005
01:18:23,349 --> 01:18:24,396
Won't you, Mitch?

1006
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:38,118
Oliver wants to see you right now
in the library. Where you been?

1007
01:18:38,197 --> 01:18:39,357
Let me just put my coat away.

1008
01:18:39,406 --> 01:18:41,704
Right now.
He's been waiting.

1009
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:54,047
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

1010
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:59,219
Well, we've been informed
there's somebody smarter.

1011
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:05,017
You didn't get the highest score
on the bar exam,

1012
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:07,648
you got the second-highest score.

1013
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:11,776
Cheers!

1014
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:14,033
Nice one.

1015
01:19:15,234 --> 01:19:16,907
Congratulations.

1016
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:22,332
They called you, huh?

1017
01:19:22,408 --> 01:19:24,376
Guilty, Your Honor.

1018
01:19:24,451 --> 01:19:25,873
I did it.

1019
01:19:26,745 --> 01:19:29,248
Well, it's your moment of glory.

1020
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:35,262
You know, my wife missed mine,
and she never forgave herself.

1021
01:19:36,589 --> 01:19:38,216
I wouldn't want that
to happen to you.

1022
01:19:38,299 --> 01:19:40,927
- That's very considerate, Avery.
- Well, I thought so.

1023
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:43,053
Well done. Well done.

1024
01:19:43,137 --> 01:19:45,105
- Quite an achievement, Mitch.
- Abby.

1025
01:19:46,891 --> 01:19:49,394
Well, the space is just great.
I'll take it.

1026
01:19:49,476 --> 01:19:50,819
And the lease would be under...

1027
01:19:50,895 --> 01:19:53,023
Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1028
01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:54,698
And you are...

1029
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:58,118
- Doris Greenwood. I like that suit a lot.
- Well, thank you.

1030
01:19:58,235 --> 01:20:00,454
They're gonna deliver
a copier tomorrow.

1031
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:02,949
- I'll make sure the office is open.
- All right.

1032
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:08,921
I will employ such means only as are
consistent with truth and honor.

1033
01:20:08,996 --> 01:20:15,129
I will employ such means only as
are consistent with truth and honor.

1034
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:19,928
I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1035
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:22,351
the secrets of my client.

1036
01:20:22,468 --> 01:20:26,723
I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1037
01:20:26,805 --> 01:20:29,228
the secrets of my client.

1038
01:20:29,308 --> 01:20:35,156
I will truly and honestly conduct myself
in the practice of my profession

1039
01:20:35,272 --> 01:20:39,778
to the best of my skill and ability,
so help me God.

1040
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:55,835
"I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1041
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,008
"the secrets of my client"?

1042
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:03,013
The first thing I'm gonna do
is violate the secrets of my clients.

1043
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:06,179
Do you see any other way?

1044
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:15,480
Okay, then. Aren't we
doing the best we can?

1045
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:21,364
No.

1046
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,161
What do you mean?

1047
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:31,920
I can't.

1048
01:21:38,252 --> 01:21:39,674
What?

1049
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:46,018
That...

1050
01:21:51,265 --> 01:21:53,108
That night...

1051
01:21:54,393 --> 01:21:57,397
That night in the Caymans
when you telephoned...

1052
01:21:57,521 --> 01:21:59,444
You were on the beach.

1053
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:10,250
What?

1054
01:22:12,911 --> 01:22:14,584
What did you do?

1055
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:21,758
No.

1056
01:22:23,922 --> 01:22:25,424
You didn't...

1057
01:22:44,735 --> 01:22:46,112
Who was she?

1058
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:48,580
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1059
01:22:49,281 --> 01:22:51,454
I don't even know her name.

1060
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,713
It didn't mean anything.

1061
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:59,793
Like hell it didn't.
It means everything.

1062
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:01,635
What did you do?

1063
01:23:02,836 --> 01:23:07,387
Why did you fuck some stranger
on a beach one night away from me?

1064
01:23:07,466 --> 01:23:08,558
Who does that?

1065
01:23:08,634 --> 01:23:10,682
- Abby, I promise you...
- What?

1066
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:16,350
You can't promise anything.
Not ever. Not anymore.

1067
01:23:18,811 --> 01:23:20,654
Why did you tell me?

1068
01:23:22,481 --> 01:23:24,984
Because I couldn't stand not to.

1069
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:30,164
I couldn't stand your not knowing.

1070
01:23:37,496 --> 01:23:39,294
Well, now I know.

1071
01:23:46,296 --> 01:23:48,014
Give me the keys.

1072
01:23:48,507 --> 01:23:50,350
Sorry, I...

1073
01:23:50,467 --> 01:23:52,686
Just give me the keys.

1074
01:24:03,522 --> 01:24:05,282
I thought
there were only two Brothers Grimm.

1075
01:24:05,315 --> 01:24:07,363
Sit down, Avery.

1076
01:24:07,484 --> 01:24:10,533
Anthony and Joey
are coming down next week.

1077
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:14,875
- What for?
- Works out your protégé's got a brother.

1078
01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:15,993
So?

1079
01:24:16,076 --> 01:24:18,420
He didn't mention him
at the interview in Boston.

1080
01:24:18,537 --> 01:24:20,297
I've got a brother
I might not mention either

1081
01:24:20,372 --> 01:24:23,672
- in polite conversation.
- This brother's doing time.

1082
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:24,967
How did you find that out?

1083
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:27,341
What do you think I am here,
a fucking night watchman?

1084
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:29,014
I get confused sometimes.

1085
01:24:29,089 --> 01:24:31,558
- Well, don't!
- All right, Avery.

1086
01:24:34,428 --> 01:24:37,307
We got a prison guard in
Arkansas. He's on the arm.

1087
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:41,895
He tells us about a Ray McDeere
doing time for manslaughter.

1088
01:24:42,019 --> 01:24:45,444
The Moroltos have been edgy ever
since the Kozinski and Hodges mess.

1089
01:24:45,564 --> 01:24:48,784
They're concerned that we
might be misreading McDeere.

1090
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:50,153
And the Moroltos are
coming for what?

1091
01:24:50,235 --> 01:24:52,658
- To personally take over?
- Are we misreading him?

1092
01:24:52,738 --> 01:24:54,991
I don't think so.

1093
01:24:55,073 --> 01:24:59,078
Wouldn't you lie if you had a felon
in the family to get a job like this?

1094
01:24:59,203 --> 01:25:02,002
I still think we ought to
keep him on a pretty tight leash.

1095
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,550
Why? You've got nothing to be
suspicious about.

1096
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:09,551
I get paid to be suspicious when
I got nothing to be suspicious about.

1097
01:26:37,509 --> 01:26:39,011
Excuse me.

1098
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:54,777
You're not listening,
Mr. McDeere.

1099
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,034
I'm sorry.
You were talking about hours?

1100
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:03,119
Listen, I know I'm not Bendini-Lambert's
most valuable client,

1101
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:05,545
but I've got a legitimate
complaint here.

1102
01:27:05,662 --> 01:27:09,383
You never spent 33 hours
last month on my account.

1103
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:10,801
Is that what you were billed?

1104
01:27:10,876 --> 01:27:12,799
You don't see your own bills?

1105
01:27:12,878 --> 01:27:16,473
No, I just submit my time sheet.

1106
01:27:16,548 --> 01:27:17,970
Where is it?

1107
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,894
It's on file with
the office manager.

1108
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:24,641
You know, this overbilling's
gotten so common

1109
01:27:24,723 --> 01:27:27,397
nobody gives it another thought.

1110
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:29,228
It's kind of like tipping.

1111
01:27:29,353 --> 01:27:32,232
Well, it's not policy,
Mr. Mulholland.

1112
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:36,660
It sure seems like policy. It's
been going on over there for years.

1113
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:40,080
People forget something else, too.

1114
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:44,918
When somebody over there
put a stamp on this and mailed it,

1115
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,586
you know what happened?

1116
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:48,835
- It became a federal offense.
- It became a federal offense.

1117
01:27:48,914 --> 01:27:50,666
You're damn right.

1118
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:53,093
Each instance punishable by...

1119
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:55,011
$10,000 fine.

1120
01:27:55,087 --> 01:27:57,761
Three to five years each instance.

1121
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:24,453
Nina, I'm going over to Mulholland's
for a half hour or so.

1122
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:25,910
All righty.

1123
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,294
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- I got the beeper.

1124
01:28:31,373 --> 01:28:33,046
I think there might be
a way of doing this

1125
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,469
without getting disbarred
and without breaking the law.

1126
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:38,047
Is that our chief concern here?

1127
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,225
Tear those up.
I might not have to use them.

1128
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,144
But I got to get to
that stuff in the Caymans.

1129
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,893
What, for the FBI?

1130
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:48,394
No. For me.

1131
01:28:48,473 --> 01:28:51,443
They won't let you go, you said.

1132
01:28:52,144 --> 01:28:54,238
Somebody's gonna have
to get to it another way.

1133
01:28:54,312 --> 01:28:56,280
It has to happen fast.

1134
01:28:57,816 --> 01:29:00,990
I got to figure out what
to do about Ray.

1135
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:02,328
What?

1136
01:29:05,657 --> 01:29:09,833
In Eddie's stuff, is there some
kind of wireless recording device?

1137
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,254
Yes. Yes!

1138
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,082
You know how to use it?

1139
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:15,918
Whenever Eddie said,
"My associate"? Yours truly.

1140
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:18,378
<i>Did he have any high-speed
camera equipment?</i>

1141
01:29:18,462 --> 01:29:19,463
<i>Sure.</i>

1142
01:29:19,546 --> 01:29:21,765
<i>I want you to get
hold of a van, Tammy.</i>

1143
01:29:53,872 --> 01:29:56,375
Hey, Tammy, did Elvis
ever find out about Eddie?

1144
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:00,721
Oh, man. He loved Eddie.
Are you kidding?

1145
01:30:02,714 --> 01:30:05,558
Hell, that stuff was over
between me and Elvis when I was 18.

1146
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:07,477
We'd been married two years,

1147
01:30:07,552 --> 01:30:11,398
and one morning at breakfast
I just turned too old for him.

1148
01:30:12,349 --> 01:30:15,319
But I tell you, everybody loves Elvis.
The man's a panda.

1149
01:30:15,393 --> 01:30:16,815
And he'd do anything for me.

1150
01:30:16,895 --> 01:30:19,819
<i>They're off,
and Say Something comes away on top</i>

1151
01:30:19,898 --> 01:30:22,151
<i>and Right There is
stepping over on the inside.</i>

1152
01:30:22,234 --> 01:30:23,736
<i>Champagne Now rushes up...</i>

1153
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:26,163
Doesn't a dog ever get the bone?

1154
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:28,491
Yeah, I hear it happens once in a while.
It's a disaster.

1155
01:30:28,573 --> 01:30:31,076
They can never get that
dog to run again.

1156
01:30:32,202 --> 01:30:33,499
Listen, Mitch,

1157
01:30:33,578 --> 01:30:35,672
Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you
how much the Bureau appreciates...

1158
01:30:35,747 --> 01:30:39,342
A million dollars in a numbered
account in Switzerland.

1159
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:43,339
IBG Bank International in Zurich.

1160
01:30:44,589 --> 01:30:46,762
Well, you sure as hell
turned greedy overnight.

1161
01:30:46,883 --> 01:30:49,181
And my brother out.
Now.

1162
01:30:49,928 --> 01:30:51,930
Your brother is a
convicted felon, Mitch.

1163
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:55,025
Then get yourself another snitch.

1164
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,773
He's in for manslaughter.

1165
01:30:56,893 --> 01:30:58,440
It was a brawl in a bar.

1166
01:30:58,562 --> 01:31:00,860
If he hadn't done any boxing,
it would have been self-defense.

1167
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:02,361
It's still a felony, Mitch.

1168
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,943
You heard me, Tarrance.
My brother out now.

1169
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,199
And make it a million and a half.

1170
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:09,373
How about you get down on your knees
and kiss my ass

1171
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:11,370
for not indicting you
as a co-conspirator right now,

1172
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:13,122
you chickenshit
little Harvard cocksucker!

1173
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,802
I haven't done anything,
and you know it!

1174
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:16,128
Who gives a fuck?
I'm a federal agent.

1175
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:17,797
You know what that means,
you low life motherfucker?

1176
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,375
You got no rights.
Your life is mine.

1177
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:21,801
I could kick your teeth down your throat,
yank them out your asshole

1178
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:24,296
and I'm not even
violating your civil rights.

1179
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:27,804
- You are Agent Wayne Tarrance.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right I am!

1180
01:31:27,924 --> 01:31:30,222
Maybe local cops can't...

1181
01:31:38,435 --> 01:31:40,654
- Yeah.
<i>- Is this Wayne Tarrance?</i>

1182
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:42,823
- Who is this?
<i>- Is this Wayne Tarrance?</i>

1183
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:44,241
Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.

1184
01:31:44,316 --> 01:31:45,818
<i>So is this.</i>

1185
01:31:45,942 --> 01:31:46,989
<i>...cocksucker!</i>

1186
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,737
<i>I haven't done anything,
and you know it!</i>

1187
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,163
<i>Who gives a fuck?
I'm a federal agent.</i>

1188
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:51,660
<i>You know what that means,
you low life motherfucker?</i>

1189
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:53,249
<i>You got no rights.
Your life is mine.</i>

1190
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:55,669
<i>I could kick your teeth down your
throat, yank them out your asshole</i>

1191
01:31:55,785 --> 01:31:58,459
<i>and I'm not even
violating your civil rights.</i>

1192
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:04,419
Now,
I think you ought to reconsider.

1193
01:32:29,694 --> 01:32:32,447
I think I might have
found a way out.

1194
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:39,542
Not out, exactly.
It's more like a way through.

1195
01:32:41,539 --> 01:32:46,010
It's a long shot, but it's...
Well, it's legal.

1196
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:55,395
I know it's weird, but if we follow
the law, it just might save us.

1197
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:04,149
You don't want to hear the plan.

1198
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,074
Would it change anything between us?

1199
01:33:11,236 --> 01:33:12,988
It's just a plan.

1200
01:33:13,905 --> 01:33:17,660
I can't do this anymore.

1201
01:33:17,742 --> 01:33:20,996
I can't help you here.
I can't help myself.

1202
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:25,585
I've given notice at the school.
I'll leave after the break Wednesday.

1203
01:33:44,269 --> 01:33:49,116
You're right.
It's better if you go, safer.

1204
01:33:57,782 --> 01:33:59,955
- You have no idea...
- Don't!

1205
01:34:03,621 --> 01:34:07,751
- I love you, Abby.
- Don't you dare, you son of a bitch!

1206
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:22,645
You want to tell me your plan?

1207
01:34:22,766 --> 01:34:24,234
Tomorrow.

1208
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:29,607
Abby, where are you gonna go?

1209
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:35,324
To my parents, first.
After that, I don't know.

1210
01:34:41,117 --> 01:34:44,838
It might not be safe for you to leave,
unless they know why...

1211
01:34:44,913 --> 01:34:48,008
I know. I know.

1212
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:52,759
Somewhere inside,

1213
01:34:52,837 --> 01:34:56,011
in the dark,

1214
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,344
a Firm is listening.

1215
01:35:04,516 --> 01:35:07,690
Shall we go in now
and do this for the record?

1216
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,620
<i>I've made a decision.</i>

1217
01:35:24,702 --> 01:35:28,297
<i>My mother hasn't been well,
she's having some tests.</i>

1218
01:35:29,207 --> 01:35:33,212
<i>I want to be there.
We never see each other, anyway.</i>

1219
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:36,055
<i>And I need some time to think.</i>

1220
01:35:37,507 --> 01:35:39,976
Call Devasher.
She's leaving him.

1221
01:35:44,681 --> 01:35:46,308
Knock, knock.

1222
01:35:48,184 --> 01:35:49,731
Bad times, huh?

1223
01:35:52,564 --> 01:35:54,237
Abby called Kay.

1224
01:35:56,693 --> 01:36:00,914
Listen, all the wives
go a little nuts the first year.

1225
01:36:01,865 --> 01:36:04,084
She'll be back.

1226
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,503
Probably want to get pregnant.

1227
01:36:13,585 --> 01:36:14,928
Big help, huh?

1228
01:36:15,044 --> 01:36:16,324
You think I'm gonna let this kid

1229
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:18,510
tell us how to run the penal system
in this country?

1230
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:22,265
Sir, it's the only way
he'll give us the files.

1231
01:36:22,385 --> 01:36:24,683
Then stall on the money.

1232
01:36:24,762 --> 01:36:26,935
Get the brother out
with a federal subpoena.

1233
01:36:27,015 --> 01:36:30,861
Follow him and the minute
we get the files, yank him back.

1234
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:36,775
Abanks' Dive Lodge.

1235
01:36:36,858 --> 01:36:40,112
Mr. Thomas Abanks, please.
This is Mitch McDeere.

1236
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:04,553
Sorry, Dutch, but I've got to justify a
client's bill before a breakfast meeting

1237
01:37:04,636 --> 01:37:07,606
and all the time sheets and bills are
locked up in the office manager's office.

1238
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,853
I don't know if I'm really
supposed to do this for you.

1239
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:11,810
Hey, you want to wake up Avery?

1240
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:16,986
I'm just trying to head off
a legal action against us.

1241
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:21,821
I promise, I'll have everything back
in the drawer before the office opens.

1242
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:55,357
You're taller than I thought.

1243
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,859
That's nice to hear.

1244
01:37:57,981 --> 01:38:00,325
There's been a change of plan.

1245
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:03,620
I didn't know there was a plan.

1246
01:38:03,695 --> 01:38:06,164
Good, because it's been changed.

1247
01:38:07,031 --> 01:38:08,874
Who are you, sweetheart?

1248
01:38:14,956 --> 01:38:16,549
<i>Abanks' Diving Lodge.</i>

1249
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:18,547
What time has Avery
chartered the boat for?

1250
01:38:18,668 --> 01:38:19,965
2:30.

1251
01:38:20,712 --> 01:38:24,137
Okay, now, you got to keep him out long
enough to copy everything in that closet.

1252
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:26,416
Don't worry. My friends are taking him
to Trinity Caves.

1253
01:38:26,509 --> 01:38:28,477
- It should be a good six hours.
- Okay.

1254
01:38:28,553 --> 01:38:31,727
Tammy's coming down tomorrow
to set things up.

1255
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,369
I can...
I can whip us up some eggs.

1256
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:52,911
Last day, I don't want
to be late for school.

1257
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:02,177
Has Tammy left to meet Abanks?

1258
01:39:02,253 --> 01:39:04,255
Not until this evening.

1259
01:39:07,383 --> 01:39:10,683
You're running a real 3-ring circus,
aren't you?

1260
01:39:13,431 --> 01:39:15,854
- I hope it goes well.
- It has to.

1261
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:22,782
You know, isn't it amazing?

1262
01:39:23,733 --> 01:39:27,704
You did the cheating,
and I'm the one who feels guilty.

1263
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:29,031
Don't.

1264
01:39:38,289 --> 01:39:40,417
Take care of yourself.

1265
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:50,135
Hey! Hey! Stop that!

1266
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:51,310
Where are your gloves?

1267
01:39:51,386 --> 01:39:54,731
Get back to the dodge ball game.
You, too, Sheila.

1268
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:09,112
Boys and girls together,
rehearsing for later life.

1269
01:40:09,821 --> 01:40:11,323
What are you doing here?

1270
01:40:11,447 --> 01:40:14,075
Would you believe I just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

1271
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:15,330
No.

1272
01:40:16,494 --> 01:40:18,917
I heard this was your last day.

1273
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:21,583
Was I misinformed?

1274
01:40:23,459 --> 01:40:24,927
I'll be gone for a while.

1275
01:40:25,002 --> 01:40:27,755
I just stopped off to say goodbye.

1276
01:40:27,839 --> 01:40:30,183
- Just in case.
- In case what?

1277
01:40:31,175 --> 01:40:34,099
In case it's more than a while.

1278
01:40:34,178 --> 01:40:38,479
I'm going to the Caymans tomorrow,
and I would miss saying goodbye.

1279
01:40:39,892 --> 01:40:43,271
Well, thank you.
Have a nice trip.

1280
01:40:43,354 --> 01:40:44,697
Want to come?

1281
01:40:44,814 --> 01:40:49,536
I know.
I know, it sounds outrageous,

1282
01:40:50,153 --> 01:40:51,496
but think about it.

1283
01:40:52,697 --> 01:40:57,954
We could grab some sun, take a dip,
drink some Havana Club.

1284
01:40:59,203 --> 01:41:02,548
I could give you marital advice
and hit on you,

1285
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:07,219
and whatever happens,
I promise I take rejection well.

1286
01:41:09,046 --> 01:41:11,390
What makes you think
I need marital advice?

1287
01:41:11,507 --> 01:41:14,010
Okay, you give me marital advice.

1288
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:18,314
I couldn't possibly.

1289
01:41:19,682 --> 01:41:23,482
- I don't scuba dive.
- Perfect. I can't scuba dive either.

1290
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:24,904
Really?

1291
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:28,232
I'd heard that you
don't miss a chance to...

1292
01:41:28,357 --> 01:41:29,734
Not this time.

1293
01:41:29,859 --> 01:41:32,658
I had to shorten the trip,
clients coming into town.

1294
01:41:32,737 --> 01:41:36,332
I can't dive and fly in the
same 24 hours. So, you see?

1295
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:39,251
How about it?

1296
01:41:40,745 --> 01:41:42,747
My mother isn't well.

1297
01:41:44,332 --> 01:41:46,426
They're doing some tests.

1298
01:41:46,918 --> 01:41:49,592
That's why I'm going home.

1299
01:41:49,921 --> 01:41:52,049
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1300
01:41:52,924 --> 01:41:55,018
How could you possibly?

1301
01:41:56,260 --> 01:42:01,232
I hope she feels better,
and if she does, bring her with you.

1302
01:42:04,602 --> 01:42:07,947
Goodbye, Avery.
Have a good flight.

1303
01:42:17,532 --> 01:42:19,284
Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1304
01:42:19,408 --> 01:42:21,035
Tammy, this is Abby McDeere.

1305
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:22,620
I think you've got
a serious problem.

1306
01:42:22,703 --> 01:42:24,751
Avery's not going diving.

1307
01:42:26,624 --> 01:42:28,126
We're dead.

1308
01:42:31,128 --> 01:42:33,130
Well, how do we...

1309
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:37,810
How am I gonna tell Mitch?
How am I gonna let him know?

1310
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:49,234
I'm going anyway.
I've got to try to do something.

1311
01:42:49,313 --> 01:42:51,782
My flight's in three hours.

1312
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:00,162
Mr. McDeere's office.

1313
01:43:00,783 --> 01:43:02,660
I'm sorry, he's not in.
May I take a message?

1314
01:43:20,011 --> 01:43:22,514
Tammy, don't tell Mitch anything.

1315
01:43:26,684 --> 01:43:28,607
I'll just be a sec.

1316
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:32,649
A prescription for Abigail McDeere.

1317
01:43:49,206 --> 01:43:50,549
One!

1318
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:57,056
Well, you want to go,
or do you want to stay here?

1319
01:43:57,131 --> 01:44:00,556
- Aren't you gonna cuff him?
- I'll take care of it.

1320
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:14,149
Yeah?

1321
01:44:14,231 --> 01:44:16,404
<i>Guess what I'm looking at?</i>

1322
01:44:17,818 --> 01:44:19,161
Tell me.

1323
01:44:19,695 --> 01:44:22,244
My first sunset in six years.

1324
01:44:24,408 --> 01:44:26,251
- You made it.
- Yeah.

1325
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:29,163
Yeah, I did.

1326
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:31,419
<i>Lowe you, little brother.</i>

1327
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:34,843
No, you don't.

1328
01:44:37,672 --> 01:44:40,926
- Anything from Abanks?
- Last I heard, everything was set.

1329
01:44:41,926 --> 01:44:43,849
It's gonna be fine.

1330
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:46,772
It already is.

1331
01:44:50,351 --> 01:44:52,194
I'll be seeing you, Ray.

1332
01:44:53,938 --> 01:44:56,691
Okay, you spoke to him.
Now, where are the files?

1333
01:44:56,774 --> 01:44:58,026
Where's the money?

1334
01:44:58,109 --> 01:44:59,611
Not until I get the files.

1335
01:44:59,694 --> 01:45:01,446
You send half now.

1336
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:05,700
Account number 6194408S.
You got that?

1337
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:10,296
Yeah. 6194408S, yeah.

1338
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:14,880
When I get confirmation it's there,
I'll send the files.

1339
01:45:23,134 --> 01:45:25,478
Here's some pocket money.

1340
01:45:25,594 --> 01:45:29,224
You're free, McDeere.
There's a bus stop a quarter mile.

1341
01:45:29,306 --> 01:45:32,310
Follow the yellow line.
You're used to that.

1342
01:46:19,064 --> 01:46:20,737
Excuse me.

1343
01:46:39,543 --> 01:46:42,092
You don't seem that surprised.

1344
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:44,094
I'm deeply surprised.

1345
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:47,263
So am I.

1346
01:46:59,438 --> 01:47:01,566
Stephanie, could we have
two Havana Club, please?

1347
01:47:01,649 --> 01:47:03,242
Yes, Mr. Tolar.

1348
01:47:17,915 --> 01:47:20,259
How'd the test turn out?

1349
01:47:20,334 --> 01:47:22,962
We were worried for no reason.

1350
01:47:23,087 --> 01:47:24,259
Good.

1351
01:47:26,423 --> 01:47:30,098
I didn't think we'd got on that well
in the school yard.

1352
01:47:31,595 --> 01:47:34,189
Maybe I've grown up since then.

1353
01:47:34,265 --> 01:47:36,359
I'd love to believe that.

1354
01:47:55,452 --> 01:47:57,796
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?

1355
01:47:57,872 --> 01:47:59,624
It's like cognac.

1356
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,299
You know,
I have a very bad reputation.

1357
01:48:07,673 --> 01:48:10,051
- What do you do?
- I run around.

1358
01:48:11,343 --> 01:48:13,186
Why do you do that?

1359
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:19,144
I think it's because
my wife understands me.

1360
01:48:24,148 --> 01:48:26,321
The fact is, I love my wife.

1361
01:48:30,321 --> 01:48:33,996
<i>But she's... Well,
I guess she's lost interest in me.</i>

1362
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:36,327
I know I have.

1363
01:48:40,205 --> 01:48:43,584
And I haven't cared
for anyone since.

1364
01:48:46,503 --> 01:48:48,346
I'd like to, though.

1365
01:48:49,715 --> 01:48:51,092
I miss it.

1366
01:48:56,764 --> 01:48:59,893
My, you lay a lot on a
girl for a first date.

1367
01:49:01,518 --> 01:49:03,361
Is that what this is?

1368
01:49:12,613 --> 01:49:13,660
This is Unit B.

1369
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:17,789
We'll be pulling into Five Points
at 11:15 for a 20-minute rest stop.

1370
01:49:17,868 --> 01:49:19,870
Mrs. Sunderland, I'm sorry
to call you at home so late,

1371
01:49:19,954 --> 01:49:22,958
but I need to speak to you
about something that's, well,

1372
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,587
it's really quite embarrassing.

1373
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:27,257
Let me preface this by saying you're
not the only client at the Firm

1374
01:49:27,378 --> 01:49:28,699
that I've had to call about this.

1375
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:43,792
I'd like a big steak, medium rare,
three fried eggs over,

1376
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:46,294
French fries and coffee, please.

1377
01:50:50,794 --> 01:50:53,388
I'll see you, darling.

1378
01:52:02,991 --> 01:52:04,368
Fuck!

1379
01:52:21,426 --> 01:52:23,849
What the hell is going on?
We lost your brother.

1380
01:52:23,929 --> 01:52:26,102
Why, were you following him?

1381
01:52:26,223 --> 01:52:28,191
Are you trying to fuck with me?

1382
01:52:28,267 --> 01:52:29,707
Where are you?
Where are those files?

1383
01:52:29,768 --> 01:52:33,238
Are you trying to fuck with me?
You want the files, you wire the money.

1384
01:52:33,355 --> 01:52:34,902
I want those files now.

1385
01:52:35,023 --> 01:52:36,866
Got to go, Wayne.

1386
01:52:39,236 --> 01:52:42,035
He knows exactly
where his brother is.

1387
01:52:43,115 --> 01:52:44,617
Have them check
all the credit cards

1388
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,291
of everybody that got fuel outside
that diner between 11:00 and 11:45,

1389
01:52:48,412 --> 01:52:50,665
whenever we lost Ray.

1390
01:52:50,747 --> 01:52:52,044
There couldn't be
more than a dozen or so.

1391
01:52:52,124 --> 01:52:54,047
He's got to be on one of them.

1392
01:52:54,126 --> 01:52:56,470
And get me a map of Louisiana.

1393
01:52:58,255 --> 01:53:00,257
Get me a map of Louisiana!

1394
01:53:38,295 --> 01:53:40,468
It hasn't even begun to melt.

1395
01:53:41,423 --> 01:53:44,017
The staff was chosen for its timing.

1396
01:54:35,477 --> 01:54:38,401
I would do that,
but I could never do that.

1397
01:54:39,856 --> 01:54:42,029
The buttons are too small.

1398
01:54:43,986 --> 01:54:46,489
It requires terrible...

1399
01:54:46,571 --> 01:54:48,073
Dexterity.

1400
01:54:50,826 --> 01:54:52,544
Amazing.

1401
01:55:04,381 --> 01:55:06,008
What are you doing here?

1402
01:55:06,091 --> 01:55:07,718
What do you mean?

1403
01:55:07,843 --> 01:55:10,471
I mean, exactly what
did you come here for?

1404
01:55:10,554 --> 01:55:12,727
I thought I was invited.

1405
01:55:13,098 --> 01:55:15,271
You're not being truthful.

1406
01:55:17,394 --> 01:55:19,897
Why are you doing this?

1407
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:24,952
Because I'm sick and I want
you to tell me the truth.

1408
01:55:26,903 --> 01:55:31,079
I came here to punish Mitch
for letting the Firm ruin our lives.

1409
01:55:32,409 --> 01:55:36,039
I came because when Mitch was here
with you he slept with someone else.

1410
01:55:36,121 --> 01:55:38,465
Is that what you want to hear?

1411
01:55:44,588 --> 01:55:47,216
That's better than the alternative.

1412
01:55:47,924 --> 01:55:49,676
What alternative?

1413
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,063
That you came here to see me.

1414
01:56:21,124 --> 01:56:22,376
Avery?

1415
01:56:57,577 --> 01:56:58,857
It came in about
three hours ago.

1416
01:56:59,913 --> 01:57:01,586
<i>You sure he'll be all right?</i>

1417
01:57:01,665 --> 01:57:03,838
<i>What the hell you want to do? Call 911?</i>

1418
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:07,421
<i>Get the key, grab the
stuff and get over here.</i>

1419
01:57:07,504 --> 01:57:09,006
Keep calling him.

1420
01:57:09,089 --> 01:57:12,184
Wake the son of a bitch up. When you
get him on the phone, find me.

1421
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:13,392
I want that girl.

1422
01:57:19,182 --> 01:57:23,437
The account number is 6194408S.

1423
01:57:25,021 --> 01:57:28,366
And can you confirm
that it is $750,000?

1424
01:57:49,045 --> 01:57:52,174
Absolutely. I'm fixing
to get out of here now.

1425
01:57:52,966 --> 01:57:54,468
You got all the information I need?

1426
01:57:54,551 --> 01:57:57,805
Yeah, but, Mitch...

1427
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:02,064
I've been looking at this stuff
and there's no numbers listed.

1428
01:58:02,142 --> 01:58:04,395
There's no numbers?
No amounts?

1429
01:58:04,478 --> 01:58:06,480
No, I got papers for bank
accounts everywhere

1430
01:58:06,563 --> 01:58:10,067
from the Caymans to Hong Kong,
but there's no amounts.

1431
01:58:12,027 --> 01:58:14,496
I can't play the poker game
I'm gonna play and bluff.

1432
01:58:14,571 --> 01:58:17,074
I gotta know how much
they have and where.

1433
01:58:17,157 --> 01:58:20,081
There's a note on
each one that says,

1434
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:24,415
"Info held by client and
my Mac. Signed A.T."

1435
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:27,418
Is there any other information?
Is there a password?

1436
01:58:27,542 --> 01:58:29,920
Some kind of password?
Just look on the paper, Tammy.

1437
01:58:30,003 --> 01:58:31,676
Wait a minute.

1438
01:58:31,755 --> 01:58:35,009
On the side of one,
in parenthesis it says,

1439
01:58:35,091 --> 01:58:39,597
"R-E-F," then a colon,
then, "Cordelia."

1440
01:58:40,347 --> 01:58:43,271
Okay, okay, I've got to get to Avery's
computer in the morning before I leave.

1441
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:44,688
Well, listen, be careful.

1442
01:58:44,768 --> 01:58:47,191
We don't know how this is
all gonna look in the morning.

1443
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:49,443
I should be able to get
through the morning fine.

1444
01:58:49,564 --> 01:58:52,283
By the time they notice I'm not
back from lunch, I'll be in Chicago.

1445
01:59:00,742 --> 01:59:03,541
Okay. We're finished. That's it.
I gotta get these out to the boat.

1446
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:05,247
The boat?

1447
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:07,882
- What boat?
- Oh, man.

1448
01:59:09,251 --> 01:59:11,879
Later on there's some stuff I gotta
tell you about what Mitch is doing.

1449
01:59:11,962 --> 01:59:13,305
Tell me now, Tammy.
What?

1450
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:16,554
Get the damn keys back in his pants and
get out of there before he wakes up.

1451
01:59:36,152 --> 01:59:37,699
Hello?

1452
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,453
You have to repeat that.

1453
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:50,170
That's not possible.

1454
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:53,254
<i>She stole your keys
and God knows what else.</i>

1455
01:59:53,878 --> 01:59:55,972
<i>Now who the hell is she?</i>

1456
01:59:56,047 --> 01:59:59,017
You know me,

1457
01:59:59,092 --> 02:00:01,390
just somebody I met last night.

1458
02:00:01,469 --> 02:00:04,188
<i>Then how the hell does she know
to go after your keys?</i>

1459
02:00:04,264 --> 02:00:07,859
<i>The guys will be landing in about
10 minutes and she better be there.</i>

1460
02:00:40,634 --> 02:00:41,851
Don't.

1461
02:00:44,054 --> 02:00:46,307
They heard you on the phone.

1462
02:00:50,894 --> 02:00:52,521
Mitch sent you.

1463
02:00:57,484 --> 02:00:59,737
I knew he was a closet idealist.

1464
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:01,913
He doesn't know I'm here.

1465
02:01:03,865 --> 02:01:05,959
But I did do it for him.

1466
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:09,789
That's even better
than getting even with him.

1467
02:01:12,415 --> 02:01:14,167
You gotta get out of here.

1468
02:01:21,257 --> 02:01:22,975
What are you going to do?

1469
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:25,429
Abby, the girl was a set-up.

1470
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,603
On the beach, she was a set-up.

1471
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:34,688
They do things like that.

1472
02:01:35,355 --> 02:01:38,484
Just in case the usual
inducements don't work.

1473
02:01:40,944 --> 02:01:44,039
What's going to happen?
What are they going to do to you?

1474
02:01:44,114 --> 02:01:46,082
Whatever it is...

1475
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:50,708
They did it a long time ago.

1476
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,923
Get this thing
out of here, will you?

1477
02:01:53,998 --> 02:01:56,217
Look, this ain't your cotton
truck, and this ain't your alley!

1478
02:01:56,292 --> 02:01:58,511
I'm calling in to the
Department of Traffic right now!

1479
02:01:58,586 --> 02:01:59,803
They call?

1480
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:01,347
Not yet.

1481
02:02:05,552 --> 02:02:07,429
Madge, I just talked to Avery
in the Caymans.

1482
02:02:07,512 --> 02:02:09,685
He needs some work done
on the Kemmer papers before 10:00.

1483
02:02:09,764 --> 02:02:11,937
I'll just get it off his computer.

1484
02:02:17,063 --> 02:02:18,315
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?

1485
02:02:18,398 --> 02:02:20,571
This thing's out of paper.

1486
02:02:37,876 --> 02:02:39,253
McDeere in yet?

1487
02:02:39,335 --> 02:02:41,633
Check every goddamn
floor and find him.

1488
02:02:41,713 --> 02:02:43,431
That son of a bitch cut a deal.

1489
02:02:54,142 --> 02:02:56,770
Natisin, Earlywine, Hemphill.

1490
02:02:56,853 --> 02:02:57,900
Hemphill?

1491
02:02:58,354 --> 02:02:59,697
Wait a minute.
That's Lomax's secretary.

1492
02:02:59,773 --> 02:03:02,902
Wayne, it's Warden Dynehart
from Wrightsville prison.

1493
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:06,613
<i>Wayne, we've got a problem
here. I've just been questioning a guard</i>

1494
02:03:06,696 --> 02:03:09,370
<i>who sent an unauthorized fax
to a law firm in Memphis</i>

1495
02:03:09,449 --> 02:03:11,417
<i>and I think it was in
regard to your prisoner.</i>

1496
02:03:11,493 --> 02:03:14,372
No! No, no, no, no!

1497
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,510
No, he's not in his office, Your Honor.
I'll see if he's in the building.

1498
02:03:31,554 --> 02:03:33,022
- Thank you, Madge.
- You're welcome.

1499
02:03:33,097 --> 02:03:34,474
Mitch...

1500
02:03:35,767 --> 02:03:38,190
We've just been looking for you.

1501
02:03:39,562 --> 02:03:41,656
Can you step in here, please?

1502
02:03:43,149 --> 02:03:47,746
Mr. Tolar's office. Yes, he's right here.
Nina, transfer him.

1503
02:03:47,821 --> 02:03:51,416
Mr. McDeere,
a Judge Tarrance for you.

1504
02:03:52,242 --> 02:03:54,040
One moment please.

1505
02:04:08,007 --> 02:04:09,259
Hello?

1506
02:04:09,342 --> 02:04:12,061
<i>Get out of there.
They know. Get out.</i>

1507
02:04:13,388 --> 02:04:17,564
<i>Did you hear what I said?
Get out of there and get over here now.</i>

1508
02:04:20,937 --> 02:04:22,564
<i>Can you?</i>

1509
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:26,693
I understand.

1510
02:04:30,947 --> 02:04:32,369
Come on.

1511
02:04:36,327 --> 02:04:39,877
He ain't going nowhere.
Rudy, get to the front door.

1512
02:04:52,552 --> 02:04:56,227
Mitch, what can I do you for?
Have a seat.

1513
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:12,739
Okay, Rudy,
he's headed east up the alley.

1514
02:05:13,823 --> 02:05:15,700
Get him and hold him.

1515
02:05:21,331 --> 02:05:23,083
God damn it.
I knew they wouldn't find her.

1516
02:05:23,166 --> 02:05:26,511
Now, I need him here now,
so you get him back on that plane.

1517
02:05:27,837 --> 02:05:30,807
If we don't get McDeere before
he gives what he got to the feds...

1518
02:05:30,882 --> 02:05:32,134
Well, what direction was he running?

1519
02:05:32,216 --> 02:05:33,263
- Wayne...
- Just a minute.

1520
02:05:33,343 --> 02:05:34,890
It's McDeere!

1521
02:05:36,846 --> 02:05:38,189
<i>Where are you?</i>

1522
02:05:38,264 --> 02:05:39,891
Never mind.
What happened?

1523
02:05:39,974 --> 02:05:42,978
Look. It's okay.
I'll send you a car.

1524
02:05:43,061 --> 02:05:44,984
You just come on in.
I'll tell you when you get here.

1525
02:05:45,063 --> 02:05:47,157
No, you tell me now!

1526
02:05:47,231 --> 02:05:49,780
Mitch, it was a prison guard.

1527
02:05:49,859 --> 02:05:51,406
<i>You just come on in.</i>

1528
02:05:51,486 --> 02:05:53,614
Come on in and we'll place you
in protective custody.

1529
02:05:53,696 --> 02:05:55,539
Somehow you don't
make me feel protected.

1530
02:05:55,615 --> 02:05:57,993
Are you looking to get whacked?
Do you know what's going on here?

1531
02:05:58,076 --> 02:05:59,749
The Moroltos are arriving today.

1532
02:05:59,827 --> 02:06:01,374
- From Chicago.
- What?

1533
02:06:01,454 --> 02:06:03,422
<i>I got their itinerary
right in front of me.</i>

1534
02:06:03,498 --> 02:06:05,921
The Moroltos are coming here,
Memphis, this afternoon.

1535
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,174
I got the itinerary right in front of me.
Northwest, arrives 2:16 p.m.

1536
02:06:09,253 --> 02:06:10,630
<i>Straight to the Peabody.</i>

1537
02:06:10,713 --> 02:06:13,182
Now, listen to me, the whole goddamn
world is gonna be looking for you.

1538
02:06:13,257 --> 02:06:16,852
<i>You can't go home, you can't go
back there, so get in here. Now!</i>

1539
02:06:22,475 --> 02:06:25,274
I've got to get lost
for a few hours.

1540
02:06:25,353 --> 02:06:27,071
There's something I gotta do.

1541
02:06:27,146 --> 02:06:28,443
Where the hell are
the files, Mitch?

1542
02:06:28,523 --> 02:06:30,992
You'll get instructions.

1543
02:06:31,067 --> 02:06:32,865
<i>- After.
- After what?</i>

1544
02:06:40,034 --> 02:06:41,456
<i>He's withholding evidence.</i>

1545
02:06:41,536 --> 02:06:44,130
He's got three quarters of a
million dollars of our money.

1546
02:06:44,205 --> 02:06:46,958
<i>He's a fugitive.
I want him brought in.</i>

1547
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:50,170
<i>Use the Memphis police if
you have to, but get him.</i>

1548
02:06:50,253 --> 02:06:54,258
It's a red KW 10-ton registered
to a Farley's Catfish Farm.

1549
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:57,969
Get its routes and find that truck.

1550
02:06:58,052 --> 02:07:00,805
And issue APBs on Ray
and Mitchell McDeere.

1551
02:07:18,948 --> 02:07:22,873
During the great steamboat era,
which was at its height in the 1870s,

1552
02:07:22,952 --> 02:07:25,671
these great floating palaces,
like the Robert E. Lee,

1553
02:07:25,747 --> 02:07:28,500
whose model you see here,
numbered by the hundreds

1554
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:30,130
on the Mississippi River.

1555
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:32,632
The Robert E. Lee was actually
designed specifically

1556
02:07:32,712 --> 02:07:35,761
to travel on the Mississippi River,
which is a shallow river...

1557
02:07:40,178 --> 02:07:42,226
Follow me now to the
main deck of the boat

1558
02:07:42,305 --> 02:07:43,807
where the cargo would be carried

1559
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,688
as well as the deck passengers.

1560
02:07:45,767 --> 02:07:48,145
The great rollers that
powered the steam engine

1561
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:50,650
were situated here
on the main deck of the boat.

1562
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:52,698
Hey, Mitch. Mitch!

1563
02:07:52,774 --> 02:07:56,199
The end of the great steam era
and the advent of the railway.

1564
02:07:56,277 --> 02:07:58,120
The next gallery detailing...

1565
02:08:01,365 --> 02:08:04,084
We have here the working
steam engine off the US Army

1566
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:05,161
Corps of Engineers

1567
02:08:05,244 --> 02:08:07,167
snag boat, the <i>Arkansas II.</i>

1568
02:08:07,246 --> 02:08:08,668
Now a steam engine works

1569
02:08:08,748 --> 02:08:12,343
by lighting a fire underneath the boilers
where the water is contained.

1570
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:14,716
This heats the water
and turns it into steam.

1571
02:08:14,796 --> 02:08:17,800
Because the kids wanted me
to bring them by.

1572
02:08:18,382 --> 02:08:20,635
Why, what's the matter?

1573
02:08:20,718 --> 02:08:24,439
Okay. Oh, Lamar, I just saw
Mitch at Mud Island Museum.

1574
02:08:24,514 --> 02:08:26,357
He was zipping through
like a tourist.

1575
02:08:26,432 --> 02:08:28,025
I waved to him but he didn't see me.

1576
02:09:02,051 --> 02:09:07,182
<i>Northwest Airlines
Flight 264 arriving from Chicago,</i>

1577
02:09:07,265 --> 02:09:10,735
<i>Gate B-1, main concourse.</i>

1578
02:09:15,606 --> 02:09:16,653
<i>- Devasher.</i>
- Sir,

1579
02:09:16,732 --> 02:09:18,450
they spotted McDeere on Mud Island.

1580
02:09:18,568 --> 02:09:20,445
<i>Get the boys
over there, right away!</i>

1581
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:22,322
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1582
02:09:24,949 --> 02:09:28,328
Okay. Let's get these below
with the rest of them.

1583
02:09:31,747 --> 02:09:34,341
- Abanks' Diving Lodge.
- How are my friends?

1584
02:09:35,251 --> 02:09:36,628
Okay.

1585
02:09:38,337 --> 02:09:41,591
Your brother's on the plane and
Tammy's loading the ship now.

1586
02:09:44,594 --> 02:09:46,141
It worked out.

1587
02:09:47,763 --> 02:09:49,982
Your lawyer friend is dead.

1588
02:09:51,017 --> 02:09:54,487
He never was on the boat.
He canceled the charter.

1589
02:09:56,606 --> 02:09:58,734
- Well, how did...
- He drowned.

1590
02:09:58,816 --> 02:10:01,865
In his bathtub.
After the lady left.

1591
02:10:01,944 --> 02:10:03,867
<i>Didn't Tammy tell you?</i>

1592
02:10:05,323 --> 02:10:06,950
What lady?

1593
02:10:08,117 --> 02:10:10,245
- How did you get...
- I don't know.

1594
02:10:10,328 --> 02:10:13,753
A lady friend of Tammy's slipped
him some kind of Mickey Finn.

1595
02:10:13,831 --> 02:10:15,799
I think it was somebody he knew.

1596
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:20,464
What are you talking about?
What lady friend?

1597
02:10:20,546 --> 02:10:21,718
Wait a minute.

1598
02:10:21,797 --> 02:10:25,802
Mitch is asking about your friend Abby.
Isn't that her name?

1599
02:11:06,133 --> 02:11:07,430
Hey!

1600
02:12:10,948 --> 02:12:12,416
Excuse me.

1601
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:02,773
Come here.

1602
02:14:02,852 --> 02:14:05,947
He's in that first door.
I'm going around the front.

1603
02:16:54,189 --> 02:16:57,489
You sick son of a bitch!

1604
02:17:28,932 --> 02:17:31,492
Well, of course I can talk.
Why, isn't that what I'm doing?

1605
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:33,779
I mean, if it's something else,
please advise me, Maury.

1606
02:17:33,896 --> 02:17:36,945
I always like to learn something
I don't know at $500 an hour.

1607
02:17:37,066 --> 02:17:39,489
I swear to you, Joey, every fucking
lawyer on the face of the earth

1608
02:17:39,568 --> 02:17:41,161
ought to be killed.

1609
02:17:41,236 --> 02:17:44,285
You want to what?
You want to meet with McDeere?

1610
02:17:44,406 --> 02:17:47,660
For what? So the two of you can get
together and charge me $1,000 an hour

1611
02:17:47,743 --> 02:17:49,837
while they send me to Joliet
for 30 years?

1612
02:17:49,912 --> 02:17:51,539
Stay in Chicago, Maury.

1613
02:17:51,622 --> 02:17:54,125
This kid's cut a deal
and I bet it's a beaut.

1614
02:17:54,249 --> 02:17:57,048
If I get my hands on this fucking kid,
Joey, if I get my hands on this kid...

1615
02:17:57,127 --> 02:17:58,925
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Ruthie.

1616
02:17:59,004 --> 02:18:01,302
I think it's urgent, Mr. Morolto.

1617
02:18:01,423 --> 02:18:03,016
Ruthie thinks it's urgent.
What do you think, Joey?

1618
02:18:03,092 --> 02:18:04,935
It's a Mr. McDeere.

1619
02:18:05,594 --> 02:18:07,437
Mr. Mitchell McDeere.

1620
02:18:08,764 --> 02:18:10,812
He's waiting to see you.

1621
02:18:12,643 --> 02:18:14,645
I think Ruth is right.

1622
02:18:39,294 --> 02:18:40,762
I'm Mitch McDeere.

1623
02:18:42,631 --> 02:18:44,929
I'm your attorney.

1624
02:18:45,676 --> 02:18:47,599
One of them, anyway.

1625
02:18:48,595 --> 02:18:52,475
I assume you knew, but I thought
I'd mention it, in case.

1626
02:18:55,102 --> 02:18:58,026
- Would you care to sit down?
- Not really.

1627
02:18:59,481 --> 02:19:02,610
I want to try and...

1628
02:19:06,655 --> 02:19:10,626
This is just...
This is very awkward.

1629
02:19:13,162 --> 02:19:17,417
I'm afraid my firm has behaved

1630
02:19:17,499 --> 02:19:19,877
in an unethical manner.

1631
02:19:21,879 --> 02:19:24,723
It seems that we,
Bendini, Lambert & Locke,

1632
02:19:24,840 --> 02:19:27,343
the entire firm,
has been engaged in a...

1633
02:19:28,802 --> 02:19:31,021
Well, a conspiracy.

1634
02:19:33,015 --> 02:19:36,269
We've been

1635
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:38,820
overbilling our clients.

1636
02:19:54,745 --> 02:19:57,373
In some cases, massive overbilling.

1637
02:19:58,874 --> 02:20:03,721
I assure you I had no idea any of this
was going on when I joined the Firm.

1638
02:20:03,837 --> 02:20:07,182
Well, I feel I have to report
this criminal behavior.

1639
02:20:08,550 --> 02:20:10,393
But I can't use...

1640
02:20:10,511 --> 02:20:15,517
I can't use your invoices
without your written authorization.

1641
02:20:15,599 --> 02:20:17,897
- Our invoices?
- Tony, please.

1642
02:20:18,852 --> 02:20:20,104
Listen.

1643
02:20:20,229 --> 02:20:21,355
Yes, sir. Your bills.

1644
02:20:21,438 --> 02:20:25,659
You see, it's an important part of
the proof that we've overbilled you.

1645
02:20:27,236 --> 02:20:28,613
That's it?

1646
02:20:29,905 --> 02:20:32,124
Pretty much.

1647
02:20:32,741 --> 02:20:36,791
Well, most of our clients have
already agreed, pretty much all.

1648
02:20:36,912 --> 02:20:39,665
Except for you.
Which is why I'm here.

1649
02:20:41,291 --> 02:20:44,921
And this is what
you've been talking to the FBI about?

1650
02:20:46,505 --> 02:20:48,758
You want us to let
you turn our bills...

1651
02:20:48,841 --> 02:20:52,812
What we charged you,
I should say overcharged you.

1652
02:20:52,928 --> 02:20:55,772
- ...over to the government.
- Yes, sir.

1653
02:20:55,848 --> 02:20:57,896
- Now, does that in any way...
- No, sir.

1654
02:20:57,975 --> 02:21:02,606
It does not in any way waive your rights
to full and complete confidentiality

1655
02:21:02,688 --> 02:21:06,283
in any other area of the
attorney-client relationship.

1656
02:21:08,777 --> 02:21:10,654
I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.

1657
02:21:12,114 --> 02:21:15,084
Whether I like it or not, I can't talk
to the government about you

1658
02:21:15,158 --> 02:21:17,786
even when I'm no longer your lawyer.

1659
02:21:19,454 --> 02:21:22,333
That would be breaking
my word, my oath.

1660
02:21:22,958 --> 02:21:24,631
All right, Mitch.

1661
02:21:25,669 --> 02:21:28,172
So what was this
stealing of the files?

1662
02:21:28,297 --> 02:21:30,800
What the fuck was this all about?

1663
02:21:30,883 --> 02:21:33,181
The files haven't been stolen.

1664
02:21:33,302 --> 02:21:36,306
They're in exactly the
same place they were.

1665
02:21:37,139 --> 02:21:40,063
I just felt it was important for me
to be thoroughly familiar

1666
02:21:40,142 --> 02:21:42,645
with the precise make-up
and whereabouts

1667
02:21:42,728 --> 02:21:45,481
of all your holdings and activities.

1668
02:21:46,857 --> 02:21:50,202
So I prepared copies of everything.

1669
02:21:53,405 --> 02:21:55,703
That way you and I
can communicate perfectly,

1670
02:21:55,824 --> 02:21:59,579
and, of course, if we ever
have to talk to a third party,

1671
02:22:01,163 --> 02:22:02,881
then I know everything,

1672
02:22:02,998 --> 02:22:07,344
right down to the penny, pound,
franc and deutsche mark.

1673
02:22:08,754 --> 02:22:11,473
I know everything you know.

1674
02:22:11,548 --> 02:22:14,176
As I should, as your attorney.

1675
02:22:16,303 --> 02:22:20,103
And what if the Firm
should desire at some point

1676
02:22:20,182 --> 02:22:22,184
to terminate your employment?

1677
02:22:22,267 --> 02:22:28,695
Whatever I know, wherever I go, I am
bound by the attorney-client privilege.

1678
02:22:29,816 --> 02:22:32,035
I am very much like...

1679
02:22:33,695 --> 02:22:36,118
I would say I am exactly like

1680
02:22:37,491 --> 02:22:41,121
a ship carrying a cargo
that will never reach any port.

1681
02:22:43,205 --> 02:22:48,757
And as long as I am alive, that ship
will always be at sea, so to speak.

1682
02:22:49,795 --> 02:22:52,594
Like Yasir-fucking-Arafat, huh?

1683
02:22:53,131 --> 02:22:55,554
Never a night in the same place.

1684
02:22:57,219 --> 02:23:00,143
In any case, I need
your written authorization,

1685
02:23:00,222 --> 02:23:04,318
so I can release your bills,
like every other client has given.

1686
02:23:09,898 --> 02:23:12,822
You have this
authorization with you?

1687
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:14,198
I do.

1688
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:39,553
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1689
02:23:42,973 --> 02:23:44,065
Fuck!

1690
02:23:44,808 --> 02:23:48,654
You got the account number?
You know how to access it?

1691
02:23:48,729 --> 02:23:50,106
Mitch has verified
that the money's there.

1692
02:23:50,188 --> 02:23:51,986
$750,000.

1693
02:23:52,065 --> 02:23:54,659
I love your crooked little mouth.

1694
02:24:03,326 --> 02:24:05,328
Well, it's not my best feature.

1695
02:24:05,454 --> 02:24:07,047
Wow!

1696
02:24:08,707 --> 02:24:09,833
Well, what is?

1697
02:24:33,148 --> 02:24:35,196
Where the hell are you?

1698
02:24:42,407 --> 02:24:44,705
What is this supposed to be?
Huh?

1699
02:24:44,826 --> 02:24:47,067
- You let the Moroltos off the hook?
- They're my clients.

1700
02:24:47,079 --> 02:24:49,199
They're the crooks.
You're letting the Mafia get away.

1701
02:24:49,247 --> 02:24:51,215
- What the hell are you doing?
- You guys are always one villain

1702
02:24:51,333 --> 02:24:52,334
behind the times, you know that?

1703
02:24:52,417 --> 02:24:54,545
You gave me a bunch of pencil
pushers who padded their bills.

1704
02:24:54,669 --> 02:24:56,922
You think if they don't pull guns,
they aren't the bad guys.

1705
02:24:57,005 --> 02:24:59,053
Ask the Moroltos who's
harder to find,

1706
02:24:59,174 --> 02:25:01,142
the killer or the lawyer
who hides their money.

1707
02:25:01,218 --> 02:25:02,265
Don't give me that shit!

1708
02:25:02,344 --> 02:25:03,470
That's a bunch of double talk
and you know it.

1709
02:25:03,553 --> 02:25:05,806
You want the Mafia?
Get their lawyers.

1710
02:25:05,889 --> 02:25:08,108
Without the Firm, the only way
the Moroltos can launder money

1711
02:25:08,183 --> 02:25:09,309
is in a washing machine.

1712
02:25:09,392 --> 02:25:11,144
You are so naive.

1713
02:25:11,228 --> 02:25:13,071
There'll be a thousand other
Bendini-Lamberts

1714
02:25:13,188 --> 02:25:14,906
fighting for the chance
to launder money tomorrow.

1715
02:25:15,023 --> 02:25:16,741
How the hell you gonna
get all of them?

1716
02:25:16,858 --> 02:25:18,360
One at a time.

1717
02:25:19,277 --> 02:25:20,654
I'm a lawyer and I got mine.

1718
02:25:20,737 --> 02:25:22,956
You're the cop, Tarrance,
you get the rest of them.

1719
02:25:23,031 --> 02:25:24,374
Get them with what?

1720
02:25:24,449 --> 02:25:27,043
Overbilling? Mail fraud?
That's exciting.

1721
02:25:27,119 --> 02:25:32,171
It's not sexy, but it's got teeth,
$10,000 and five years in prison.

1722
02:25:32,249 --> 02:25:34,798
That's 10 and five for each act.

1723
02:25:36,044 --> 02:25:38,217
Have you really looked at that?

1724
02:25:38,296 --> 02:25:41,175
You've got every partner
in the Firm on overbilling.

1725
02:25:41,258 --> 02:25:43,807
There's 250 acts of
documented mail fraud there.

1726
02:25:43,885 --> 02:25:45,102
That's racketeering.

1727
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:48,224
That's a minimum
of 1,250 years in prison

1728
02:25:48,306 --> 02:25:50,684
and two and a half
million dollars in fines.

1729
02:25:50,767 --> 02:25:52,769
That's more than you had on Capone.

1730
02:25:52,894 --> 02:25:56,273
You twist this into whatever you want.
You made a deal to save your ass.

1731
02:25:56,398 --> 02:25:58,798
You got our money, three
quarters of a million dollars of it,

1732
02:25:58,817 --> 02:26:01,161
you're still a hot-shot lawyer
and you're out of this.

1733
02:26:01,236 --> 02:26:02,453
I didn't keep a
nickel of your money.

1734
02:26:02,571 --> 02:26:04,448
It was always for somebody else.

1735
02:26:04,573 --> 02:26:05,620
And, yeah,

1736
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:08,209
I'm still a lawyer with references
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke.

1737
02:26:08,285 --> 02:26:11,129
You want to put that
on your resume?

1738
02:26:11,246 --> 02:26:13,374
You think I'm ever gonna
turn on the ignition in my car again

1739
02:26:13,456 --> 02:26:14,582
without sweating?

1740
02:26:14,666 --> 02:26:18,136
Then I don't understand you.
What did you do it for?

1741
02:26:19,462 --> 02:26:20,839
You didn't win a thing.

1742
02:26:20,922 --> 02:26:25,177
Oh, yeah, I did. I won my life back.
You don't run me and they don't run me-.

1743
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:28,059
You want to know something weird?

1744
02:26:28,138 --> 02:26:31,733
I discovered the law again.
You actually made me think about it.

1745
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:36,279
I managed to get through three years
of law school without doing that.

1746
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:42,786
It's you at the dog track.
I could've gone public with it.

1747
02:26:42,861 --> 02:26:45,660
- Why didn't you?
- It's against the law.

1748
02:26:51,453 --> 02:26:52,875
Okay.

1749
02:26:55,790 --> 02:26:59,670
How in the hell did you ever
come up with mail fraud?

1750
02:27:00,962 --> 02:27:02,964
It was on the bar exam.

1751
02:27:04,341 --> 02:27:06,969
They made me study like hell for it.

1752
02:27:43,463 --> 02:27:47,559
Well, you've had a busy day.

1753
02:27:50,387 --> 02:27:52,060
So did you.

1754
02:27:54,557 --> 02:27:57,527
Why didn't you tell me the
truth about your plan?

1755
02:27:57,644 --> 02:27:59,692
All of it?
The Moroltos.

1756
02:28:00,313 --> 02:28:04,034
Because I knew you'd worry,
and that might make you stay.

1757
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:07,829
And I knew you needed to leave.

1758
02:28:17,914 --> 02:28:20,667
I like what you've
done to the place.

1759
02:28:21,668 --> 02:28:24,888
- I thought you were going to your folks'.
- I was.

1760
02:28:27,257 --> 02:28:28,930
Some detour.

1761
02:28:32,512 --> 02:28:34,059
Where are you going?

1762
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:35,898
To look for you.

1763
02:28:40,562 --> 02:28:44,863
I guess I didn't feel I could leave
you without trying to help you.

1764
02:28:48,403 --> 02:28:51,202
Do you want to tell
me what happened?

1765
02:28:54,409 --> 02:28:56,082
Someday.

1766
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:02,425
I think you should know
that Avery was pretty decent.

1767
02:29:05,253 --> 02:29:09,349
He was decent, and corrupt,

1768
02:29:09,424 --> 02:29:11,802
and ruined, and so unhappy...

1769
02:29:11,926 --> 02:29:12,973
Listen, Abby...

1770
02:29:13,094 --> 02:29:15,017
And it could have happened
to you, all of it.

1771
02:29:15,096 --> 02:29:16,598
You were on your way.

1772
02:29:16,723 --> 02:29:18,316
Did I lose you?

1773
02:29:25,273 --> 02:29:26,445
You look tired.

1774
02:29:26,566 --> 02:29:27,783
Did I?

1775
02:29:39,746 --> 02:29:41,965
I've loved you all my life.

1776
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:46,048
Even before we met.

1777
02:29:48,797 --> 02:29:52,597
Part of it wasn't even you,
it was just a promise of you.

1778
02:29:53,927 --> 02:29:58,558
But these last days,
you kept your promise.

1779
02:30:06,231 --> 02:30:08,154
How could you lose me?

1780
02:30:41,099 --> 02:30:44,103
<i>- You think it will make it?
- Make it where?</i>

1781
02:30:45,437 --> 02:30:47,110
<i>Boston.</i>

1782
02:30:47,188 --> 02:30:48,940
<i>What's in Boston?</i>

1783
02:30:49,607 --> 02:30:50,950
<i>We are.</i>

1784
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:56,949
<i>And the Wong Boys, and my kids.</i>

1785
02:30:58,783 --> 02:31:02,378
<i>And a very small
unknown law firm.</i>

1786
02:31:02,454 --> 02:31:04,502
<i>With a lot of potential.</i>

1787
02:31:05,707 --> 02:31:06,959
<i>Yeah.</i>
