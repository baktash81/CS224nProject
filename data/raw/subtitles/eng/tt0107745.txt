Abigail.

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,832
Abigail.

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,512
Abigail.

When are you gonna learn
to come when you're called?

7
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,198
Abigail.

8
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,351
Oh!

9
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,033
There you are.

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,315
I'll have you know that when I was a furling,
I couldn't wait to get to Cornelius's class.

11
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,074
Yes, Daddy.

12
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,313
At least he's taught you to behave.
I'm glad you've stopped climbing trees.

13
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,834
Yes, Daddy.

14
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,955
- See you later. Love you.
- Me too, Abigail.

Mom, they won't give me
a chance for breakfast.

Well, you'll just have to be quicker, Roland.

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,034
I'm not Roland, Mother. I'm Russell. Russell!

20
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,591
No, no. You couldn't be Russell.
He's at furling class.

21
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,830
Class?

24
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,754
Mama, Cornelius has a big surprise planned
for today and you're making me late.

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,878
Now hold still, Edgar. I'm almost finished.

26
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,240
- Don't I even get a goodbye kiss?
- No time. I'll kiss you when I get back.

27
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
Guess what? You're never
gonna guess, I betcha.

28
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,478
Uncle Cornelius said I could go
with you, but, as you're late,

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,192
he's probably forgotten all about it and
I'll never get to see what the big surprise is.

30
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,840
What took you so long?

31
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,320
- My dad.
- My mother.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,790
No breakfast.

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,876
Come on. We'd better hurry.

34
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,033
If Uncle Cornelius asks, tell him
it isn't my fault you're late.

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,240
Hey! Where's Cornel...

39
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,155
- Shh! He's experimenting.
- On the big surprise, I betcha.

40
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,434
Oh, I love surprises. Let's have a look.

41
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,678
Don't take another step.

42
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,753
Furlings, prepare to be amazed.

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,312
Wow!

44
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,351
It's really flying.

45
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,750
- It's coming this way.
- Wow.

46
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,480
Well? What do you have to say?

47
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,796
- Sorry we're late?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. About this.

48
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,999
My life's work. The flapper-wingamathing.

49
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,475
Of course, this is only a test model.

50
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,676
Oh!

51
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,320
One day, I shall build it full size.

52
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,555
- It's wonderful, Cornelius.
- Russell, your mouth is hanging open.

53
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,072
I wanna fly it next. Please.

54
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,231
Don't be silly. You'll crash it.

55
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,480
Correct, Abigail. It's far
too delicate for furlings.

56
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,598
Huh? I didn't mean me.

57
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,312
- Me! Me!
- Let's have another go, shall we?

58
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,272
Yeah!

59
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,834
Oh, dear. Furlings!

60
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,800
- I'll get it!
- No, Russell. No!

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,075
No, furlings. That's delicate.

62
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,277
My books!

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,194
- Abigail, not that!
- Yippee!

64

- It's going that way.

69
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,120
I got it. I got it. I got it.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760

Great hulk!

74
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,876
Look what you've done.

75
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,837
Sorry, Cornelius.

76
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,953
Well, furlings, there are times when
we of science must learn to accept...

77
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,430
setbacks.

78
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,716
Looks like one of those times, doesn't it?

79
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,395
I guess we wrecked the big surprise, huh?

80
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,793
No. You wrecked months
and months of work.

81
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,557
The big surprise is
awaiting us on our ramble.

82
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,200
Oh! Give me strength.

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,190
Now. Now, let's hurry along
before we have any more setbacks.

84
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
- Step lively, furlings.
- Wait for us.

85
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,072
Left, right, left, right.

86
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,634
- I'm ready.
- Come on, you guys. Hurry.

87
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,951
Michelle, not that way.

88
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,559
That area is off limits.

89
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,877
- Why, Uncle Cornelius?
- That's not our lesson for today.

90
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,952
Come along, furlings.

91
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,356
Today is plant day.

92
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,117
We'll learn how everything we need
grows right here in Dapplewood.

93
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,830
Now, what is this, furlings?

94
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,475
I know. I know. A willow, Cornelius.

95
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,597
Correct.

96
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,754
And did you know its bark
can be used to cure rheumatism?

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,991
Uncle Cornelius, what's rumourtism?

98
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,756
Rheu-ma-tism, Michelle. Ooh.

99
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,633
I know. Rheumatism makes your bones
hurt when the weather gets damp.

100
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,196
Correct again.

101
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,392
Wow.

102
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,357
Now, as we get further along the trail,

103
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,671
- notice the vegetation.
- Mr Smarty-pants.

104
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,956
Hey! Give that back.

105
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,430
- Over here. Over here.
- Hey!

106
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,637
Furlings.

107
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,478
We shall go home right now, if you are
not going to take this ramble seriously.

108
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,677
No, no. Please, Cornelius.

109
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,400
- We promise to be good.
- Come along, then.

110
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,676
We've lots to see.

111
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,478
- I'll lead the way.
- You always lead.

112
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,236
Not so fast, Abigail.

113
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,149
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

114
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,633
You've been leading long
enough. Now it's my turn.

115
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,633
Forget it. You don't know where I'm going.

116
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,598
But I know where I'm going.

117
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,719
Whoa!

118
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,632
Hey, wait for us.

119
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,274
Russell, where have you led us?

120
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,591
I don't know.

121
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,640
This ground isn't normal. It's... it's hard.

122
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,874
And it smells kinda funny.

123
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,634
Furlings, get away from there!

124
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,155
Get out of the road this instant.

125
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,636
Furlings!

126
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
Move!

127
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,193
Russell, you are one lucky hedgehog.

128
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,478
It's rare that a furling survives
an encounter with... with...

129
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,520
- A monster?
- That is a good name for it.

130
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,991
- What was it really, Cornelius?
- Where did it come from?

131
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,040
No more questions.
I want you to forget this place.

132
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
Oh.

133
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,317
- When will we see it?
- Are we there yet?

134
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,837
Yes, yes. I believe this is the right trail.

135
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,717
Ready, furlings?

136
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,240
Here's the big surprise.

137
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,993
- Wow!
- A boat!

138
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,235
- Are we going to ride in it?
- Of course. Get in. Get in.

139
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,790
- I get to steer.
- Don't be silly, Russell.

140
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,235
- You'd just sink us.
- Would not.

141
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,313
- Gimme a chance.
- You two settle down.

142
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,869
Everyone will get a chance.

143
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,952
Hop in, Edgar.

144
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,712
Now, in you go.

145
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,917

00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,310

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,872
All right. Abigail, Russell, you paddle first.

148
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,950
No, no, no. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

149
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,032
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

150
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,753
No, no. We'll never get anywhere that way.

151
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,071
Now, together.

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,431
Mommy! Daddy! Where are you?

177
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,512
Mommy!

178
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,756
Michelle! Wait!

179
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,633
- Hello?
<i>- (echo)</i> Hello?

180
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,279
Mommy, is that you?

181
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,034
Wait, Michelle! It's dangerous.

182
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,796
No, furlings! There's a deadly gas in there.

183
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,400
- But what about Michelle?
- Just a moment. I'll think of something.

184
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,714
- We're not waiting.
- Cover your mouth!

185
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,271
Don't breathe the gas.

186
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,237
<i>(Michelle coughs)</i>

187
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,632
Michelle.

188
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,359
<i>(Michelle moans)</i>

189
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,909
Oh, Michelle.

190
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,676
Abigail, for once, I'm glad
you didn't listen to me.

191
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,238
We must get her to higher ground.
Quickly, furlings. To my house.

192
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,834
- Did you find your mother?
- No.

193
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,639
Just her apron.

194
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,639
Then we're the only ones left.

195
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,235
I was in such a hurry this morning...

196
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,236
I never kissed my mother goodbye.

197
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,552
Tell me there's good news.

198
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,119
Can we stay with you tonight?

199
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,396
Of course.

200
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,556
What happened to our home, Cornelius?

201
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,310
I had hoped you'd be a little older
before we had this lesson.

202
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,800
A long time ago, when I was a furling,

203
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,239
I lived far away in a place
called Willowbrook.

204
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,753
<i>It was winter, during our bedtime story,</i>

205
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,753
<i>- when we... we heard the sound.
- (crash)</i>

206
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,312
<i>Mother and Father told us to run.</i>

207
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,235
<i>I was the first to the door,
and that's when I saw them.</i>

208
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,951
<i>Humans.</i>

209
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,957
<i>We got out.</i>

210
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,396
<i>But Mother and Father...</i>

211
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,918
<i>they didn't.</i>

212
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,400
There was nothing I could do
for my mother or father.

213
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,872
<i>(Michelle moans)</i>

214
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,871
But there is something
you can do for Michelle.

215
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,710
- Us, Cornelius?
- I need special plants.

216
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,599
Eyebright to soothe the burns on her eyes.

217
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,911
And her lungs are badly damaged,
so you must collect plenty of lungwort.

218
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,029
- But everything in our meadow is dead.
- Then you must find another.

219
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,237
- Another meadow?
- There's no choice.

220
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,471
You only have two days' time.

221
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,598
The herbs must be applied
before the moon waxes full,

222
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,831
or it will be too late for Michelle.

223
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,196
- You're coming with us, right?
- I wish I could, but I dare not leave her side.

224
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,115
- We'll be by ourselves?
- No. You'll have each other.

225
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,671
You'll want an early start.
Now get some sleep.

226
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,471
And if you dream, dream
of better times for Michelle

227
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,552
and Dapplewood.

228
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,275
- Is the pack full yet?
- I have more room in my pockets.

229
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,478
- Whoa!
<i>- (Abigail)</i> This isn't a picnic.

230
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,795
Here, pack something useful.

231
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
Boy, I'm already working up an appetite.

232
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,789
Think we should take this?

233
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,432
Oh, Edgar.

234
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,393
Hm.

235
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,160
- Well, I'm ready. Let's go.
- Wait.

236
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,756
I feel like we're forgetting something,
and I'd hate to be unprepared.

237
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,719
Is this what you're thinking of, Edgar?

238
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,309
Cornelius! Your map!

239
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,791
It will take you to the edge
of Dapplewood Forest.

240
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,836
Then you will be on your own.

241
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,876
Now, I want you to stay together.

242
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,598
The only other thing I can
give you is this warning.

243
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,720
Avoid the humans and try to work together.

244
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,357
Good luck, my furlings.

245
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,520
Michelle is counting on you.

246
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,996
<i>(panting)</i>

247
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,073
Wait, Abigail. Haven't we
come far enough for one day?

248
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,111
Edgar, look at the moon. Cornelius said to
get those plants to Michelle before it's full.

249
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,399
We have to travel as far as we can tonight.

250
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,915
But... but it's not safe out there.

251
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,356
There's no cover.

252
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,720
OK. If it makes you feel better,

253
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,431
we'll run for that tree, catch our breath,
and plan the next move from there.

254
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,560
Ready? Let's go.

255
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,991
<i>(Russell)</i> Hold on.

256
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,199
- I gotta stop.
- Russell, we can't rest now.

257
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,434
Easy for you to say.
You're not carrying our supplies.

258
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,557
Well, I will. Hand 'em over.

259
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,957
Abigail, not so loud.

260
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,272
Help!

261
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,160
Edgar! Russell!

262
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,709
- Abigail!
- Help!

263
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,992
<i>(owl squawks)</i>

264
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,675
I'm gonna...

265
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,912
- Climb?
- We can't dig our way up.

<i>(gasps)</i>

267
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,911
Can you see her yet?

268
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,196
Uh-huh.

269
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,116
Good thing you're a slow climber.

270
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,752
Hurry! Let's get outta here.

271
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,270
There! Under that log.

<i>(panting)</i>

273
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,677
That was close.

274
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,992
Shoo! Go away.

275
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,712
Agh!

276
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,878
Edgar, are you all right?

277
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,877
That's it, Abigail. That's the last time
I'm gonna let you get us into trouble.

278
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,114
- From now on, I'm gonna do...
- You're right, Edgar.

279
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,192
I was wrong.

280
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,670
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

281
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,954
What about me? I broke your fall.

282
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,276
You too, Russell.

283
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,156
Well, now that that's settled,

284
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,598
our only problem is that
we're hopelessly lost.

285
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,316
Don't worry. If anyone can get us
on the right trail, you can, Edgar.

286
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,314
What about our food? Most of it
got dumped out all over the heath.

287
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,072
You'll find more, Russell. That's
never been a problem for you.

288
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,597
That's true.

289
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,994
After all we've gone through,
the worst has gotta be over.

290
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,715
I sure hope so.

like you.

294
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,192
You are. Good night, Edgar.

Hey, maybe they know where a meadow is.

Brothers and sisters.

It is indeed a sad day.

302
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,120
One of our flock has crossed
over to a better place.

303
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,951
Excuse me? Excuse me?

304
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,276
- My friends and I are lost...
- Say no more, child.

305
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,479
We too are lost, lost in our grief.

306
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,750
- Amen, Brother Phineas.
- But verily, verily, verily,

307
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,074
the end that comes to us all has come
too soon to one of our feathered brothers,

308
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,998
who has been brought
down by an evil scourge.

309
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,833
Evil.

310
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,914
And by what name do we call this scourge?

311
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,878
- Yellow dragons.
- Yellow dragons.

312
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,319
Yellow dragons have drained our marsh

313
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,636
and turned our nestin' ground
into a muddy graveyard.

314
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,954
- What's he squawkin' about?
- Shh. Someone's died.

315
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,360
Oh.

316
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,116
So, brethren,

317
00:34:52,200 --> 00:35:00,119
step forward and pay your last
respects to our dearly departed

318
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,157
Bosworth.

319
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,112
Goodbye, Mother.

320
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,557
Bosworth. Oh, my son.

321
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,429
Wait. It doesn't have to be that way.

322
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,480
No? Is there a ray of hope?

323
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,031
- Hope?
- Hope?

324
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,873
There is a ray of hope. Brothers
and sisters, we can save Bosworth.

325
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,798
Hallelujah.

326
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,354
Russell, you find us a couple of branches.
And Abigail, we'll use the twine you packed.

327
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
Bosworth, you're back.

328
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,799

00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,553
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! There's
gonna be some celebratin' today.

331
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,436
- I hope you plan on staying.
- Sure.

332
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,355
- Will there be any food other than worms?
- Sorry, we can't stay.

333
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,160
We only have until tonight to find a meadow.

334
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,554
Oh, on a pilgrimage, eh? There's
a glorious meadow just yonder.

335
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,396
But you have to walk
among the yellow dragons.

336
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,356
That's the second time
you've mentioned the... yellow dragons.

337
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,399
- Are they as terrible as they sound?
- Worse.

338
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,999
They are huge monsters
that breathe fire and brimstone.

339
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,033
We can take care of ourselves, thank you.

340
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,478
Yeah, well, after what you did
for Bosworth, I truly believe you can.

341
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,711
If you are strong of heart,
the only path lies that way,

342
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,360
across a cursed ground over which
my flock will not even fly.

343
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,390
It's the yellow dragons!

344
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,517
Whoa!

345
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,158
Russell, now's no time to get all balled up.

346
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,712
Whoa!

00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,552
Whoa!

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,792
<i>(coughing)</i>

350
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,718
Hey, maybe he didn't
wanna eat us up after all.

351
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,919
No, but that one does.

352
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,235
- Whoa!
- Suck in your stomach, Russell.

353
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,710
Wiggle. Wiggle harder.

354
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,713
Agh!

355
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,874
I'm drowning. Help! Help!

356
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,232
Edgar, get up.

357
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,392
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.

358
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,954
Wow! Look at this place.

359
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,754
- Gives me the creeps.
- We're only underground.

360
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,990
Yeah, and you're a mole, right?

361
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,710
Think of this as home... only stinky.

362
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,514
We're not helping Michelle by just
standing around. We've gotta get moving.

363
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,910
<i>- (clanging)</i>
- Listen. What's that noise?

364
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,592
Huh?

365
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,910
Now where are we?

366
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,951
I don't know. None of this is on the map.

367
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,433
It's all over. We'll never find our way now.

368
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,270
Don't say that, Abigail.
Michelle's counting on us.

369
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,554
Maybe if we climb that hill, we can start over.

370
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,030
Boy, we could be anyplace.

371
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,472
The meadow!

372
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,510
We made it.

373
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,432
Now all we need is
the eyebright and the... Whoa!

374
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,472
Ow!

375
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,870
Thanks, pal.

376
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,078
Why'd you take that?
Oh, come on. You give that back to me.

377
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,800
- Are you all right, Edgar?
- Whoa.

378
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,278
Ha, ha!

379
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,312
Gee, and I thought meals
were outta control at my house.

380
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,678
I saw it first.

381
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,754
You mice are all the same.
Greedy little cowards.

382
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,400
How are we gonna get anybody
to help us find the herbs?

383
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,200
Maybe these guys won't be
so grouchy after they eat.

384
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,237
We can't wait that long.

385
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,519
Hey! Let go! What's the big idea?

386
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,837
Hey, just what do you think you're... you're...

387
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,677
Gosh, I hope I didn't hurt you
when you threw me down.

388
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,592
Hurt me? No. I'm fine.

389
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,672
You're not from around here, are you?

390
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,274
Aha! Now the truth comes out.
They're just here to steal our food.

391
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,159
No, we're just looking
for lungwort and eyebright.

392
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,516
- Liar.
- It's true.

393
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,069
We need the herbs to help
a sick badger back home.

394
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,790
More lies. Why would a mole,
a mouse and a hedgehog

395
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,238
wanna help a foul-smelling, worm-eating,
good-for-nothing badger?

396
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,679
Michelle's none of those things.
She's our friend.

397
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,036
We've come too far to be stopped now.

398
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,032
Step aside.

399
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,911
Russell, Abigail, are we
doing this together or not?

400
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,590
Wait for us.

401
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,473
- I'm proud of you, Edgar.
- Hey, look at all the eyebright.

402
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,278
For all the good it'll do ya,
I'd like to see you get the lungwort.

403
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,238
No one in Oakdale's
ever been able to reach it.

404
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,516
But I'll bet you three can.

405
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,160
That's right. We've already got a plan.

406
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,596
- Right, Edgar?
- Mm-mm.

407
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,752
Just like a hedgehog!
Big mouth and no brains.

408
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,632
<i>(others laugh)</i>

409
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,916
Don't listen to Waggs.
He just likes to pick fights.

410
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,233
Wait a minute. I know how to get up there.

411
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,631
We'll use Cornelius's flapper-wingamathing.

412
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,436
Russell, good thinking.
We'll fly to the top of the cliff.

413
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,160
- You don't really mean <i>fly?</i>
- You heard 'em, Willy.

414
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,517
They'll flap their little paws
and fly like birdies.

415
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,674
Laugh all you want. We'll show you.

416
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,399
It looks like it really might work.

417
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,916
To your stations.

418
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,195
Crank the winder-uppers.

419
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,834
Yay! We're flying.

420
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,591
They did it! They really did it!

421
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,759
Abigail.

422
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,159
I'm locking the wings.

423
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,597
We're on full glide. Edgar,
get ready to grab the lungwort.

424
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,840
Don't worry, Edgar. I'll do it.

425
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,151
- Be careful, Abigail.
<i>- (Russell)</i> Yeah, the wind's picking up.

426
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,557
- Oh, no!
- What?

427
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,318
Agh!

428
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,392
Abigail.

429
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,672
Russell, do something.

430
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,712
I've got my hands full. You've gotta save her.

431
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,715
Hang on, Abigail. I'm coming.

432
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,312
I can't hold on.

433
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,032
Is everyone all right?

434
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,395
Uh... yeah.

435
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,672
I guess we have to try again.

436
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,913
It's no use now. The lungwort's gone.

437
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,832
- We've failed.
- No, we haven't.

438
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,311
Look! We got it.

439
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,230
- We got it?
- They got it.

440
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,835
You were so brave, Edgar.

441
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,120
Look. The land of the yellow dragons.

442
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,678
Won't Cornelius be excited
to see where we've been?

443
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,440
Abigail, you're standing in my light.

444
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,278
It's not Abigail. Look.

445
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,952
Hold on!

446
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,872
Where are we?

447
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,395
Right where we wanna be.

448
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,596
Look! The willow from our ramble.

449
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,559
We're home!

450
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,120
Michelle.

451
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,112
Come on.

452
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,191
Cornelius.

453
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,511
My furlings, you're back.

454
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,752
- Did you get the herbs?
- Yes. How is Michelle?

455
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,312
I'm afraid she's slipping away. I must
administer the herbs immediately.

456
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,715
- Any sign of our parents, Cornelius?
- None. I'm sorry.

Someone's outside.

Cornelius, come here, quick.

461
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,391
Oh, no. Not again.

462
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,711
- It's the gas.
- We can still get away.

463
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,675
Out the back.

464
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,395
This way.

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,390
Oh!

Abigail?

01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,914
Mama!

524
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,639
Edgar. Oh, Edgar.

525
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,952
When we ran from the gas
I was worried sick about you.

526
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,440
Oh, did you forget your scarf somewhere?

527
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,479
No, Mama. This is what I forgot.

528
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,398
Oh, Edgar.

529
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,838
I guess nothing will ever be the same
again. Will it, Uncle Cornelius?

530
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,036
Well, my dear,

531
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:09,356
if we all work as hard to save Dapplewood
as your three friends worked to save you,

532
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,510
it will be.
