1
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,333
Mrs. Claus is hot!

2
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,252
Yeah!

3
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,672
My name is Samantha Caine.

4
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,716
At least, I think it is.

5
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,553
You might not believe it to look at me,
but I was born only years eight ago...

6
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,430
on a beach in New Jersey.

7
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,100
I entered the world fully grown,
wearing clothes I don't remember buying.

8
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,352
In the back pocket a single key...

9
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,188
filed blank and faceless.

10
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,942
A fitting metaphor,
but otherwise no help whatsoever. None.

11
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,028
Sometimes I stand naked in the mirror...

12
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,779
try to guess my age.

13
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,365
Thirty-five, maybe?

14
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,993
I have lots of scars.

15
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:08,039
They call my condition
focal retrograde amnesia.

16
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,459
It's no picnic,
but I've learned to live with it.

17
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,045
Got a job I love, been seeing someone.

18
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,505
Nice guy. Good sense of humor.

19
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,343
- Hound of the Baskervilles.
- Mad dogs. Mad dogs.

20
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,762
- Hal, I gotta tell you.
- Yes? Yes?

21
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,181
Of all the Christmas pageants
I have ever seen...

22
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,600
this was by far the most recent.
Ha, ha.

23
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,143
For God's sakes, Sam...

24
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,188
I've got teenage girls that are
playing the Three Wise Men.

25
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,522
What'd you expect?

26
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,774
Teenage boys?

27
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,609
I thought they did fine.

28
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,446
It was the first nativity where Joseph
stares at the Wise Men's tits all night.

29
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,740
Yeah? Ha, ha.

30
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,661
Her name is Caitlin,
and when I woke up on that long-ago day...

31
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,746
I was two months pregnant
with her.

32
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't know who her father is.
I may never.

33
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,541
I just know she's mine.

34
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,544
His name is Mr. Perkins.

35
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,171
My mom named him for me.

36
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,508
- Caitlin! Come help in the kitchen!
- That's her.

37
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,385
- That's who?
- Her mom.

38
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,178
She's got amnesia.

39
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,222
- Swear?
- Swear.

40
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,225
Too weird.

41
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,727
Hello, girls.

42
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,854
Caitlin, come help me in the kitchen.

43
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,440
Hurry up, because I forget where it is.

44
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,944
- Bah!
- Ha, ha.

45
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,495
Some more sugar.

46
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,506
Raymond! If I catch you smoking again...

47
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,633
they'll never find the body.
Understand?

48
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,969
- Yes, Miss Caine.
- Have a cookie.

49
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,309
- Quiet, everybody.
- As the year draws to a close, I would like...

50
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,271
I would like to share with you
a few things about myself...

51
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,481
things of which I am especially proud.

52
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:02,737
First, I'm proud to say
that I don't smoke...

53
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,115
I don't drink, and I don't swear.

54
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,576
- Oh, shit, I do smoke and drink.
- Hal.

55
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,663
- You see, right there.
- Block your ears.

56
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,665
To our dear friends...

57
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,128
may the best of your past
be the worst of your future.

58
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,172
I'll drink to that.

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,466
Take a bow, my dear. Take a bow.

60
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,760
We got the mistletoe.

61
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,019
Oh, sweetie.

62
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,980
Eight years.

63
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,691
Except for my name, all traces are lost.

64
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,651
I used to hire expensive detectives.

65
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,320
Now I'm down to the cheap ones.

66
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,821
Doesn't seem to matter.

67
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,325
The woman I was,
the one I used to be, she's gone.

68
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,910
I've kissed her good night.

69
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,164
- Ha, ha.
- Police. Don't move.

70
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,333
What the hell is this?

71
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,835
Don't give me attitude, sir.

72
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,588
See, you're assuming
I won't shoot your sorry ass...

73
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,174
and everyone knows,
when you make an assumption...

74
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,426
you make an ass
out of "u" and "mption."

75
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,847
I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice,
and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff...

76
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,726
I will see to it you spend the next
10 years in prison getting ass-fucked.

77
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,771
If the case is thrown out
because my arrest was too violent...

78
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,358
I will personally hire men
to ass-fuck you for the next 10 years.

79
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,402
So if you're an ass-fucking fan,
you go ahead and mouth off.

80
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,573
Meanwhile, you're under arrest
for the crime of prostitution.

81
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,576
Officer Donlevy, read him his rights.

82
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,870
- What?
- His rights.

83
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,040
You have the remight...

84
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,959
You have the right to remain silent.

85
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,963
And anything you say and do
will be held against you in a...

86
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,508
You gotta listen to me, man.
I got a wife. This... I've never...

87
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,426
This is the first time I've done this.

88
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,636
Sir, sir.

89
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,431
Listen to me. I can see from your choice
you're not a wealthy man.

90
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,602
Now, in light of the damage
that this arrest could do to you...

91
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,021
we might be able to make
some arrangement.

92
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,234
God!

93
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,320
Gotta stop using bums.

94
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,655
Forget that.

95
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,240
They looked like cops.

96
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,200
We pulled it off, didn't we?

97
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,660
It was embarrassing.

98
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,579
Want me to hire actors, for chrissake?

99
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,665
These guys are cheap.
They work for food.

100
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,750
When they puke on you, is that a refund?

101
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,296
Oh, Trin...

102
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,424
I'm pissing myself here,
you're so funny.

103
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,305
- What's this?
- I got movement on Samantha Caine.

104
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,100
- You're kidding.
- Nope. I may have a lead on someone...

105
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,437
who rented Amnesia Chick
an apartment back in '87.

106
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,772
They still have some of her stuff.

107
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,233
Get out of here.
Where'd that come from?

108
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,904
Lucky break. Old lady died
and one of her asshole grandkids...

109
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,989
found a credit card in a shoe box...

110
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,949
name Samantha Caine on it.

111
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,327
Tried to use it at Nordstrom's.

112
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,164
Okay, here's what we do.

113
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,627
You get on the phone to Amnesia Chick.
Tell her we need more cash.

114
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,513
Hey, that was a really swell party.

115
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,433
Thanks again for the ride.

116
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,977
You and Hal, you've been
together now, what?

117
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,647
What? A couple of years?

118
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,149
How often do you two...?

119
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,152
Stick our fingers in our hands
and pull them out again?

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,654
Every chance we get.

121
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,905
Earl, do me a favor.

122
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,574
Have bubbles come out of your mouth
and say, "Hic."

123
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,994
Goddamn it, I am not drunk.

124
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,121
Here, I'll prove it to you.

125
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey. Hey, come on.

126
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,877
Hey! Stop that!

127
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,254
- I'm sorry.
- No!

128
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,832
And so much for
the skydiving Santa of Hutchinson County.

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,211
Meanwhile, WICC News journeyed
to Honesdale today...

130
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,005
where Santa's Mrs. Kringle
turned out to celebrate...

131
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,924
her hubby's worldwide tour.

132
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,759
And after one look at her...

133
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,013
I'm thinking Santa got
what he really wanted this Christmas.

134
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,809
The parade included floats
and participants from four counties.

135
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,979
Everyone enjoyed themselves, especially
the young and the young at heart.

136
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,147
Up next...

137
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,483
Gotta be fucking kidding!

138
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,651
No.

139
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,947
No fucking way!

140
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,199
It's impossible!

141
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,381
So you rest up.

142
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,468
And I'll see you in the morning.

143
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,845
Sweet dreams.

144
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,584
I want a cigarette.

145
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,711
I don't smoke.

146
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,923
You used to.

147
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,596
See how easy it comes back?

148
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,514
I'm coming back.

149
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,726
You know that, don't you?

150
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,061
Name's Charly, by the way.

151
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,898
You're gonna love me.

152
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,576
Now, this is the intergalactic
slammer. It's a jail, all right?

153
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,913
This guy here, this is the Borium Dude.
He's kind of like a dinosaur.

154
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,623
And this is his escape chute.

155
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,043
He's mean, quick, and he don't
take no shit, either, all right?

156
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,962
He can shoot at the guards
with his arrow right here.

157
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,635
- It's cool?
- Todd, time for dinner.

158
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,220
Now.

159
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,102
Guess you'd better go in.

160
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,438
Hey, hope you like the toy.

161
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,774
It's awesome.

162
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,111
Dad, Mom, she gets weird.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,699
Like on my birthday
when you gave me that Schwinn...

164
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,538
she called the bicycle store
to see if there's been any robberies.

165
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,585
Look, tell her I don't
steal them locally, all right? Ha, ha.

166
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,295
Man.

167
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,509
Sorry, but I can't take this.

168
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,761
You know how Mom will get.

169
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,059
- Guess I'll see you.
- Yeah. All right.

170
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,650
How do you like that?

171
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,741
Yo, Trin. Me. What's up?

172
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,868
- Ready to be happy?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,870
Remember the landlady I told you about?

174
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,248
The Caine woman
was her favorite tenant.

175
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,709
Then one day,
the tenant never comes home.

176
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,127
Old lady very sad.

177
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,546
So sad, she can't throw away
Amnesia Chick's shit.

178
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,172
It's pay dirt, Mitch.

179
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,049
Got an old postcard, never mailed.

180
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,385
Woman telling everyone
she just got engaged.

181
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,637
Samantha's handwriting. Perfect match.

182
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,182
She was engaged to some guy in Jersey.
No phone number, just an address.

183
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,226
Holy shit. Score.

184
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,437
Sweetheart, that's worth time and a half.

185
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,481
Double. I made us look good.
Her other PIs couldn't find dick.

186
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,192
Of course not.
Took a true dick-hound like yourself.

187
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,862
Tell Miss Caine I'm coming
to see her tonight.

188
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,085
Honey, you have an ETA
on that carrot?

189
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,254
Stow it.

190
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,300
Maybe you should just take it with you
to school tomorrow.

191
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,012
- Ha, ha. You're killing me. You're so funny.
- Ha, ha.

192
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,556
Here. Here. Give me the knife.

193
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,392
I'm gonna cut this carrot...

194
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,687
and you'll eat the blood-soaked pieces
and like it. Piss off.

195
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,414
Hon?

196
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,958
Look at something, will you?

197
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,593
How the hell do you...?

198
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,721
I used to do this.

199
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,349
I'm a chef. Yahoo!

200
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,767
Look what she's doing here.

201
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,937
Give me something else.

202
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,897
Quick. Anything.

203
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,399
- Here.
- Go. I'm hot to trot.

204
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,817
- Tomato, tomato.
- Tomato!

205
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,112
Look at this.

206
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,781
Look at this woman go. Okay, okay, fine.

207
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,408
More.

208
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,494
Pepper! Pepper! Celery!

209
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,372
Look at this!

210
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,873
- More! More!
- Scallions!

211
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,625
Scallions. Give her scallions.

212
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,672
One more tomato.

213
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,758
Look at this. Look at this woman.
She's amazing!

214
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,228
Chefs do that.

215
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,572
Timothy, I know you're gonna
kill me. I know you're gonna kill me.

216
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,490
Please use the gun, not the knife.

217
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,660
As a favor to me. I'm begging you.

218
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,167
Goddamn it, how can I tell the feds
about the fucking Honeymoon thing?

219
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,627
I don't know a fucking thing about it.

220
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,180
No, you don't.

221
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,098
I don't know a fucking thing.

222
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,560
You know, I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

223
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,107
What's so fucking important?

224
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,234
Remember your old colleague...

225
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,611
One-Eyed Jack?

226
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,529
Yeah. He's doing seven to 10 upstate.

227
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,907
Not anymore. He broke out.

228
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,826
Two days after seeing something
on TV that "disturbed" him.

229
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,870
Yeah, me too.
It's called Baywatch Nights.

230
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,538
Wanna get to the fucking point?

231
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,583
While under sedation,
he said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir.

232
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,002
Daedalus is understandably concerned.

233
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,130
He was under the impression
you disposed of her eight years ago.

234
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,382
I know it's unlikely,
but if she were alive...

235
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,761
I think she might be in contact
with the old man in Massachusetts.

236
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,971
Tap his phone.

237
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,351
Tell Daedalus I'm on my way.
Timothy out.

238
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,994
I can't see Mr. Perkins.

239
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,331
He's there. He's on the sled. See him?

240
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,999
He's watching you.

241
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,627
He's very excited.

242
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,462
Oh, that's better.

243
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,381
Ready to try it alone?

244
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,050
I want you to hold my hand.

245
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,845
Oh. Just pretend I am.

246
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,054
You can do it.

247
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,056
Piece of cake. Here we go.

248
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,266
Ready?

249
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,102
- Mom, it won't work, I swear.
- Sure, it will!

250
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,062
You're one of the X-Men. You're tough.

251
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,772
Ready? Let's go.

252
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,108
Three, two, one, go.

253
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,317
Wait! I'm not ready!

254
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,571
Go! Go!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

255
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,707
I can't do it. I wanna go home.

256
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,542
Look, I know you're afraid.

257
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,712
That's the whole point.
Can't you see that?

258
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,926
Stop being a little baby and get up.

259
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,847
I can't skate anymore. My wrist hurts.

260
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,856
Life is pain.

261
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,399
Get used to it.

262
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:39,154
See, you will skate all the way
to the shore, princess...

263
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,657
and you will not fall again.

264
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,826
Am I understood?

265
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,356
I'm just guessing,
but this is a tree house.

266
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,900
I think you wanted a doghouse.

267
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,738
Little joke.

268
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,368
She said that her wrist hurt.

269
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,955
I didn't know it was fractured.

270
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,550
I don't remember...

271
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,011
what I said to her.

272
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,056
I can't remember.

273
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,231
No!

274
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,441
For God's sake, I'm not gonna hurt you.

275
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,986
It's not me I'm worried about.

276
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,478
Evening, Charly.

277
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,897
Long time.

278
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,069
- Mommy!
- Get out!

279
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,115
Mommy! Help!

280
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,628
Mommy!

281
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,216
I want my eye back, bitch!

282
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,425
No!

283
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,585
Chefs do that.

284
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,468
Caitlin.

285
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,680
Oh, my God!
We have to find Caitlin! Caitlin!

286
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,181
Caitlin! No!

287
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,560
Slow down, slow down!
Your kid's okay. She's in my car.

288
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,480
Jesus! What the hell's going on here?

289
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,315
Freeze!

290
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,733
Don't hurt him!

291
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,110
Don't shoot!

292
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,737
Yeah, don't shoot, like she said!

293
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,739
Call an ambulance!

294
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,997
This man, he's going to help me
find out some things...

295
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,167
so we'll be safe. You understand?

296
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,627
When will you be back home?

297
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,215
Before you know it, I swear.

298
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,428
Here. I want you
to keep a candle burning...

299
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:17,098
in a window for me.

300
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,560
That's called keeping a vigil.

301
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,395
Okay?

302
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,231
That's to light my way home.

303
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,985
Here.

304
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,614
This is to my portable phone.

305
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,449
I keep it with me.

306
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,701
You call me any time.

307
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,620
Okay?

308
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,794
Why don't you keep this?

309
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,758
For luck.

310
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,719
Let's have Mr. Perkins wear it.

311
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,598
There. See?

312
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,656
You do what you have to.

313
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,660
But, Sam...

314
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,079
the person you used to be...

315
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,123
Whatever you find, I'm not scared.

316
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,543
I never will be, not ever.

317
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,630
Thank you.

318
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,313
Bye.

319
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:58,199
Mr. Perkins,
you lost one of your agents...

320
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,953
whose training included,
among other things...

321
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,997
counter-assassination.

322
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,543
And now she turns up as belle
of the Christmas parade.

323
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,796
Well, that information is
two weeks old, Mr. President.

324
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,341
To my knowledge,
Charlene Baltimore died...

325
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,094
in my employ, relic of the Cold War.

326
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:23,224
The kind of violent operative that has
since been eliminated from our ranks.

327
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,851
You recruited this woman?

328
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,229
For Chapter, sir.

329
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,316
In the late '70s
her father was a friend of mine.

330
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,901
Stop that.
I don't wanna hear that stuff.

331
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,237
Intelligence community.

332
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,822
You people are unbelievable.

333
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,991
You dump a mess like this in my lap...

334
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,578
and then you come whining to me
and say, "Where is our funding?"

335
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,455
Well, I'll tell you where it is.

336
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,541
Can you say "healthcare"?

337
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm not talking about the linen

338
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,270
And I don't wanna change your life

339
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,438
Moving in.

340
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,065
What?

341
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,941
It's...

342
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,071
It's... The song's not about linen.
It's not linen.

343
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,074
Yeah, whatever. So you cold?

344
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,325
Yeah. Freezing.

345
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,118
I'll turn on the heat.

346
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,496
Doesn't work,
but it makes an annoying noise...

347
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,623
- ...distracts from the cold.
- I'll pass.

348
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,041
Thanks.

349
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,880
Who knew I had an old fiancé?

350
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,552
And now we're just gonna
pay a surprise visit?

351
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,473
Well, there are no bells
or whistles going off...

352
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,475
because I don't remember any of this.

353
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:51,020
Jeez, that's too bad, because that's
the cream of the crop, believe me.

354
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,648
I forgot to ask.

355
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,691
Why is it that you got so far?

356
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,943
Say what?

357
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,238
Well, I mean...

358
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,824
you seem kind of low-rent.

359
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,033
No offense.

360
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,576
None taken.

361
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,203
Really, I was about to... Hey!

362
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,663
Hey, now!

363
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,542
Yeah.

364
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,836
Shit.

365
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,840
Are you okay?

366
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,259
Is your neck all right?
You don't have whiplash?

367
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,094
What?

368
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,762
I'm just...

369
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,223
Since you almost
just ran us off the road...

370
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,684
I'm wondering, what it is
that you take away...

371
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,686
from an experience like that.

372
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,022
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm sure it's very enriching in some way.

373
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,483
And I know that she was
probably very moved...

374
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,695
by having some asshole
hang out the window and go, "Woo-hoo!"

375
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,489
Hey, I didn't hang out the window
and go, "Woo, woo, woo."

376
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,991
I checked out her form, okay?

377
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,871
If it's any consolation,
you got her beat hands down.

378
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

379
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,666
From the neck up.

380
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,376
This is exciting.

381
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,004
You saw her tits. It's so neat.

382
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,506
Look, it's a guy thing, all right?

383
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,758
Hey, now, you got a nice body and all...

384
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,678
but those, you could see them
coming around the corner.

385
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,014
You got time to comb your hair. Shit.

386
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,601
Hey, hey, hey.

387
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,269
What's that?

388
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,897
Charly was my name in the dream.

389
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
"To Charly. Love, Nathan."

390
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,986
Nathan J. Waldman, Ph.D.

391
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,947
- All right. Let's find a phone.
- Found one.

392
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,157
Find his number.

393
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,368
Take the stand.

394
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,705
I got it. Now what'll I do with it?

395
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,168
Sit down!

396
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,640
Alice, please.

397
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,266
Your dog, Alice.

398
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,102
It and my appetite
are mutually exclusive.

399
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,105
- Well, what's wrong with the dog?
- It's simple.

400
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,400
He's been licking his asshole
for the last three straight hours.

401
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,654
I submit there is nothing there
worth more than an hour's attention...

402
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,990
and I should think that whatever
he is attempting to dislodge...

403
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:11,244
is either gone for
good or there to stay.

404
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,789
Wouldn't you agree?

405
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,674
Yes. Hello.

406
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,676
Mr. Waldman?

407
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,136
I got your number from a Realtor...

408
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,431
in Massachusetts,
and I'd just like to speak to you.

409
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,141
Who is this?

410
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,310
You tell me, Mr. Waldman.

411
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,938
Charly.

412
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,148
My full name, please.

413
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,402
God.

414
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,946
It's really you.

415
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,534
Chapter, they think you're dead.

416
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,578
- Everyone thinks...
- My full name, please.

417
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,912
You don't know your name?

418
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,752
Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.

419
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,088
Don't talk, Charly. Just listen.

420
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,591
You could be in danger. Understand?

421
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,175
We must meet.

422
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,678
We must meet straightaway.
Where are you now?

423
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,639
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.

424
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,516
We'll meet halfway.

425
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,853
There's a town in New Jersey,
Chestermon.

426
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,564
Tomorrow, Central Train Station...

427
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,733
at 11 a.m.

428
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,526
Meet me.

429
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,486
I'll tell you everything.

430
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,536
Signal Daedalus. We got her.

431
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,875
- Some what?
- Curry brand cat food.

432
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,836
- Could you spell that?
- Yeah. Curry brand.

433
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,379
All this shit is the same.

434
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,715
You don't happen to have a cat
by any chance...?

435
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,884
What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

436
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,552
Yeah. Pussy's pussy.

437
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,262
You got a girl, I got a cat.

438
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,650
Mom, can I stay up for Rugrats?

439
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,234
What, sweetie? I lost you.

440
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,778
Rugrats. I want to stay up.

441
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,489
- Yes. You can stay up for Rugrats.
- Oh, good.

442
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,616
I'm gonna go now.

443
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,326
All right.

444
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,453
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you too.

445
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,913
Big kiss.

446
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,289
- Bye, Mom.
- Good night.

447
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,252
Put my glasses in my pocket

448
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,882
Put the jacket on the chair

449
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,810
I sing the things I do, you know,
so I won't forget.

450
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,269
Like:

451
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,023
Turning off the downstairs light

452
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,402
Before I go to bed at night

453
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,033
Shit.

454
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,204
I can't take this fucking waiting.

455
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,916
Excuse me.
Do you normally curse this much?

456
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,127
I didn't...

457
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,129
What, are you a Mormon?

458
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,922
Yes, I'm a Mormon.

459
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,634
That's why I just smoked a pack of Newport
and drank three vodka tonics.

460
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,094
What I'm saying is...

461
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,804
back when we first met...

462
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,641
you were all like, "Oh, phooey.
I burned the darn muffins."

463
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:25,312
Now, you go into a bar, 10 minutes later,
sailors come running out.

464
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,605
What up with that?

465
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,358
Thanks for sharing.

466
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,819
Mind your own damn business.

467
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,321
While you're at it,
if you're gonna smoke inside...

468
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,490
close the damn door.

469
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,115
No!

470
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,367
Hey, I heard you screaming.

471
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,743
Shit!

472
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,795
Henessey, I didn't know about the gun.

473
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,131
I wasn't hiding things. I swear.

474
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,632
Goddamn it. Stop walking.

475
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm going home.

476
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,594
- Hey!
- And so are you!

477
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,387
I paid you!

478
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,016
Well, here. Here.
Take your money. Take it!

479
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,311
I can't go home...

480
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,855
until I know why that man
tried to kill me.

481
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,649
I'm trapped.
It's like I'm in goddamn prison.

482
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,485
- Do you know how that feels?
- Yeah!

483
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,863
Yeah, I know exactly what that's like.

484
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,490
Four years inside! Marion, Illinois.

485
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,451
A real shithole.

486
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,162
And I'm not going back!

487
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,690
Seven years ago I was an Atlanta cop.

488
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,361
Me and my partner handled
a lot of impounded shit.

489
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,947
That motherfucker hated me.

490
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,908
I forget why, but he did.

491
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,453
Well, one weekend,
when he was conveniently away...

492
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,957
some bonds disappeared
from his office.

493
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,544
Lo and behold, when my brothers in blue
responded to an anonymous tip...

494
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:21,090
you'll never guess what they found
sitting in my closet.

495
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,802
The bonds. Your partner put them there.

496
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,887
Oh, no, no, no. I did.

497
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,056
I stole the damn things.

498
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,902
I never did one thing right in my life,
you know that?

499
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,904
Not one.

500
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,990
That takes skill.

501
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,088
You just missed our exit.

502
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,466
Give me back my money.

503
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,010
Oh, so you're...?

504
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,847
I'm taking you to the train station, yes,
to meet Mr. Waldman.

505
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,099
Merry Christmas.

506
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,642
Bah, humbug.

507
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,353
Look out the window and shut up.

508
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,960
You know we're about 10 minutes early.

509
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,259
Got a bad feeling about this.

510
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,067
Putting the keys in my left pocket

511
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,195
Gun in the right-hand side

512
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,821
Makes a bulge. People can see.

513
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,240
Want me to stick it in my pants,
shoot my dick off?

514
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,658
You're a sharpshooter?

515
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,294
Going to shake hands with the man

516
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,756
- How you doing?
- Hi.

517
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,259
That's for you.

518
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,432
Another in a long line
of bad personal investments.

519
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,184
Excuse me?

520
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,019
I just saw the ring on your finger.

521
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,196
Do I know you from somewhere?

522
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,656
Back up.

523
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:53,659
Total pickup line.
Forget I said it. I take it back.

524
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,996
Thank you for the beer,
but I don't know you. No.

525
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,209
No, you don't.

526
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,422
And I can tell
when someone's lying to me.

527
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,634
I am sorry to have bothered you.

528
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,221
- Yours?
- Yeah.

529
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,681
Who's your boyfriend?

530
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,850
Oh, some guy.

531
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,936
Okay, people. I got what I need.

532
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,063
Move in. Do them both.

533
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,481
Hey, hey.

534
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,941
That man walking this way.

535
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,402
Is that him?

536
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,404
I think so.

537
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,622
Mr. Waldman?

538
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,170
Gun!

539
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,601
Jesus wept.

540
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,936
Let's go, Miss Caine.
We gotta get to the car.

541
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,480
This way! This way! This way!
Come on! Come on! Go!

542
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,401
No! No! No! Come on!

543
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,489
Shit, there's more of them!
No! No! No! This way!

544
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,183
Come on, come on, come on!

545
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,061
Come on, Miss Caine! Come on!
Come on, goddamn it! Come on!

546
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,319
- Where are they?
- Oh, shit!

547
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,112
Here, take this. Take it. Take it.

548
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,240
I got three shots left in this revolver.

549
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,868
You got a full clip.
Just point and spray, okay?

550
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,245
- Ready?
- Yeah.

551
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,788
And...

552
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,040
Fuck it! Run for your life!

553
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,836
There's no way out!

554
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,093
Jump!

555
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,762
That's a three-story drop! Are you crazy?

556
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,918
- What happened?
- I saved your ass. It was great.

557
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,878
Come on. We gotta get to the car.

558
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,424
Come on! Come on! This way! This way!
Come on. Come on.

559
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,676
Get down! Get down! Get down!

560
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,812
Get in, both of you. Now!

561
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,063
I said, now!

562
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,741
We jumped out of a building.

563
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,702
Yes. It was very exciting.
Tomorrow, we go to the zoo.

564
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,995
You're Waldman.

565
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,913
No, I'm the Hills Bros.' bean buyer.

566
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,457
Who else would I be? Hang on.

567
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,713
If you want me to talk in front of him,
you may be asked to kill him later.

568
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,922
- What?
- Your call.

569
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,051
- What?
- Fire out the back if you have to.

570
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,762
Jesus, old man.
How many of those things you got?

571
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,598
Three. One shoulder, one hip,
and one next to Mr. Wally...

572
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,433
where patdowns never reveal it...

573
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,394
as an agent's often reluctant
to feel up a man's groin.

574
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,689
- Any other questions?
- What's the weather like on your planet?

575
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,108
Charlene, my darling.

576
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,402
My name is Samantha. Samantha Caine.

577
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,071
No, no, no! Forget all that.

578
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,989
That teacher business was your cover.

579
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,283
Do you hear me, Charly?
Hear what I'm saying?

580
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,661
Your memory was gone. You got confused.
You bought your own cover.

581
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,372
It was a fantasy, for chrissake!

582
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,208
Samantha Caine never existed.
You wrote the bloody thing.

583
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:15,087
No. It's not a fantasy.
I'm in the goddamn PTA.

584
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,797
Then quit!

585
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,133
You're an assassin
working for the United States government.

586
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,718
I ought to know.

587
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,261
I trained you.

588
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,642
Get the fuck out of here! Ha, ha.

589
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,812
Assassin? Ha, ha.

590
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,442
Your father was in the Royal lrish Rangers,
assigned to Belfast.

591
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,113
After he was murdered there in 1975...

592
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,449
his friend Perkins adopted you.

593
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,743
Or perhaps I should say recruited you...

594
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,831
to work for Chapter, a black-bag operation
working from the U.S. State Department.

595
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,666
You getting this?

596
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,209
October, 1988.

597
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,087
You're assigned to take out
a munitions dealer, Daedalus...

598
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,047
and his hired enforcer, Timothy.

599
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,341
You failed to complete your mission...

600
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,178
electing instead to die, of all things,
despite clear orders to the contrary.

601
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,848
And dead you remained until,
without preamble...

602
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,601
you re-emerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier.

603
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,191
Anyhow, I think we can safely assume...

604
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,111
that Daedalus is aware
of your resurrection...

605
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,488
and attempting to reverse it.

606
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,907
He'll be watching the police,
watching hospitals.

607
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,492
We must stay away. Understand?

608
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,661
Yes, Mr. Henessey? Can I help you?

609
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,913
Henessey, what is it?

610
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,874
It's a setup. It's gotta be.

611
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,960
Put that down.
This is not an episode of television.

612
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,922
Those guys back there at the train station,
how'd they know we'd be there?

613
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,009
Impossible,
unless Waldman here told them.

614
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:46,344
- I did not.
- They tapped your phone at least.

615
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,096
I know it sounds preposterous...

616
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,600
Oh, just happened to know we'd be calling?
Get in the car.

617
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:53,643
See here, my friend...

618
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,937
Oh, shit!

619
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,315
Oh, damn!

620
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,777
Get in the car now!

621
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,703
So how about it?

622
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,122
You believe any of that crap
he said back there?

623
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,957
Oh, I don't... No.

624
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,751
That guy was a lunatic.

625
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:20,086
We gotta talk to someone else.

626
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,755
You thinking what I'm thinking?

627
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:25,217
I hope not, because I'm thinking
how much my balls hurt.

628
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,262
But if you're talking about that postcard,
I don't wanna meet more of your friends.

629
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,139
We have no choice.

630
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,767
We need some answers
or we're gonna die.

631
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,970
I saw you from the road.

632
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,807
I think your name is Luke...

633
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:17,269
and I think I was gonna marry you.

634
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,652
Charly?

635
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:29,072
Oh, baby. Hey.

636
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,491
Oh, man.

637
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,077
Luke.

638
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,205
She's my only daughter...

639
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,124
and I don't quite trust you yet.

640
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,254
So, what about it?

641
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,172
You and Mr. Outdoors here bump pelvis?

642
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,507
It's possible.

643
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,343
How about your daughter?

644
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,345
- What's her name? Cat head?
- Caitlin.

645
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,973
Yeah, well, you think
he might be the father?

646
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,516
I don't know. I don't know.

647
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,185
But all these little details about him
are coming back.

648
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,895
I'm remembering things about him.

649
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,230
Like what?

650
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,318
Look, is this America's Funniest
Practical Videos or something?

651
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,361
Keep your hands where I can see them.

652
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,989
I had an itch.

653
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,034
Charly, this is crazy.

654
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,328
You and me, we were like...

655
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,834
Don't you remember?
Hell, you pursued me.

656
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,088
I know that he has a pin in his leg.
Car accident.

657
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,049
I know he... He cuts his own hair.

658
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,467
He doesn't even own a TV.

659
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,135
He sits down when he pees...

660
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,055
Hey, that's enough.
I'm getting a boner here, all right?

661
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,432
Henessey, I know this man, okay?

662
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,225
I must have been seeing him.

663
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,977
Let me talk to him.

664
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,687
Alone.

665
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm sorry.

666
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,694
You wanna take a walk?

667
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,744
Got me a handgun

668
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,623
Got a rifle too

669
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,752
Anybody fucks with Mitch

670
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,713
He knows just what to do

671
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,801
'Cause I'm a bad motherfucker

672
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,596
Stay quiet and drop the rifle.

673
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:23,978
How'd you find us?

674
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,980
There may be reasons not to kill you...

675
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:29,109
but among them is not
that you'll be missed by NASA.

676
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,111
I found the address in your coat.

677
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:33,738
Here.

678
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,740
Between the address of a topless bar...

679
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,284
and the picture of what looks
like a man's penis.

680
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,745
That's a duck, not a dick.

681
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,998
The man she's with, who is he?

682
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,292
He's her former fiancé. His name's Luke.

683
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,169
- Former fiancé?
- Hey, hey, hey.

684
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,213
That's ridiculous.
She was never engaged.

685
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,465
For chrissake,
I went through this with her.

686
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,676
She knows how the man pees.

687
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,053
Look at him. He's cool.

688
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,972
A former fiancé.

689
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,807
Why on earth would she think that?

690
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,518
We found a note. It's in her handwriting.

691
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,688
- She saw a note?
- Who are you, William Shatner? Calm down.

692
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,481
Yeah, a note to her uncle.

693
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,358
- Max?
- Yeah.

694
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,738
Uncle Max.
That's the agency, you blithering idiot.

695
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,074
And the word "engaged" means
she's locked on to target. Fuck!

696
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,285
He's not her former lover, he's a target?

697
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:24,122
That's why she knows personal things.
She studied the bastard to assassinate him.

698
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,331
Stop!

699
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,499
- Charly!
- Stop!

700
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,126
- Charly!
- He's Daedalus!

701
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,211
- Get out of there!
- It's him!

702
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,338
He is Daedalus, Charly!

703
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,415
Well, howdy there.

704
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,084
If it isn't the forgetful spy.
How you feeling?

705
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,171
You're the man from the bar.

706
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,715
Would you look at her?
She's not faking it.

707
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,842
She doesn't know me from Adam.

708
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,222
It's not that I don't trust my
compadre here, Major Baltimore.

709
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,975
In fact, I had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine...

710
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,435
until you showed up here.

711
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,729
You follow?

712
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,482
I'm trying to pull off the biggest job
of my career...

713
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,612
so you see, darling,
I have to know how much about me...

714
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,908
you really remember, and who you told.

715
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,453
I haven't told a soul. I swear.

716
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,164
We'll soon know.

717
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,127
What is this? Some kind of torture thing?

718
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,213
Torture, yes.

719
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,799
A woman's face
never looks quite so beautiful...

720
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,677
as when it's distended in pain.

721
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,847
Witness the beauty of childbirth.

722
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,225
- Untie me and I'll make any face you want.
- Let's not and say we did.

723
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,521
Take a deep breath.
We're gonna do the torture thing.

724
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,810
Operation Honeymoon's on schedule.

725
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,979
I've secured the tanker.

726
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,647
Now I just gotta make the soup.

727
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,984
I'll follow as soon as I'm done here.

728
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,572
Ten minutes in this cold water,
she'll be insane or dead.

729
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,783
Five minutes.
She'll tell me everything I need.

730
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,306
That's right. Take all the air you can.

731
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,767
If you need to vomit, do it now.

732
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:36,105
So you
don't remember anything at all?

733
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,524
Best night of your fucking life.

734
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,819
I say drown the wench.

735
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,114
Talk to me, major.

736
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,075
Is my identity safe?

737
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,578
My name is Samantha Caine.

738
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,916
Answer the question.

739
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,918
Who knows about me?

740
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,879
Nobody. Fuck you!

741
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,714
Fuck you!

742
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:07,387
I hate to see you like this, Charly.

743
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,058
I heard you were a hell of a spy once.

744
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,270
Watch your back.

745
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,022
I'm not done yet.

746
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,983
Good night.

747
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,095
Okay. I'll signal Daedalus.

748
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,431
Your money will be waiting.

749
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,434
Jack?

750
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,310
Jack. Jack!

751
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,479
Do yourself a favor, man.

752
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,481
Don't let her looks fool you.

753
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,608
She's the Energizer fucking Bunny.

754
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,028
Just do her and dump her.

755
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,196
Don't try to get cute
and play doctor first.

756
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,450
I made that mistake. It nearly killed me.

757
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,393
Motherfucker!

758
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,129
Daedalus...

759
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,672
I'll make you a deal.

760
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,175
Let me go now...

761
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,512
and I'll leave you the use of your legs.

762
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,141
Why have you resurfaced?

763
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,311
Is it Operation Honeymoon? Is that it?

764
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,897
Who sent you?

765
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,649
Why are you here?

766
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:28,820
I let you touch me, cowboy.

767
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,366
I think I need a bath.

768
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,425
Samantha, please.

769
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,927
Who's Samantha?

770
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,097
Where's Henessey?

771
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,632
The lengthening of its neck
makes it easier for it to swim.

772
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,301
Its front feet are larger...

773
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,637
and that's good, to have paddle-like
feet to move through water...

774
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,535
Hey, Mitch.

775
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,331
You're awake.

776
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,381
You're seeping.

777
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,050
Here. Look at this.

778
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,055
Shit.

779
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,724
That hurt like shit.

780
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,852
I know. That's why I distracted you first.

781
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,896
Same principle as deflowering virgins.

782
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,857
What? Virg...? What?

783
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,818
I read it in this Harold Robbins book.

784
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,195
Guy bites her on the ear,
distracts from the pain.

785
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,405
You ever try that?

786
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,700
No, no. I sock them in the jaw
and yell, "Pop goes the weasel."

787
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,202
Who the fuck are you?

788
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,495
The name's Charly.

789
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,163
The spy.

790
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,706
Nice to meet you.

791
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,335
Drink?

792
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,421
Yeah.

793
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,216
Now, as you can see,
things are still very crazy here...

794
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,093
but the sheriff has told me this:

795
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,138
There have been gunshots, and yes...

796
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,598
Okay, let's say I buy it.

797
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:52,101
You are a trained killer.

798
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,774
I can't even say that with a straight face.

799
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,860
So Samantha, she...

800
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,319
Never really existed.

801
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,781
Like Nathan said,
she was a total fabrication.

802
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,741
I made her up.

803
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:12,204
So now she's just gone
forever and ever?

804
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,664
Thank God.

805
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,749
Look at my inordinately large ass.

806
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,043
Look what she did to me.

807
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,421
Pretty convincing act.

808
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,131
I guess.

809
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,010
You know, her personality
had to come from somewhere.

810
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,179
Change the subject.

811
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,889
Better yet, bring me that bottle.

812
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,811
Here you go. Drink up.

813
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,065
So, what's next?

814
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,275
What do we do now?

815
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,527
I contact Chapter.

816
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,070
I come in for debriefing...

817
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,114
bury the last eight years...

818
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,908
get back to work.

819
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,868
Cheers.

820
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,748
Would you believe it, Harry?

821
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,126
We got an appropriations review
in three weeks...

822
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:02,046
and the president wants to know
how I lost an agent.

823
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,924
Yes, sir. You have a call on line 3, sir.

824
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,342
Gonna tell me who it is?

825
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,052
Charly Baltimore, sir.

826
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,432
Run a trace.

827
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,646
This is Mr. Perkins.

828
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,980
Turn on the TV.

829
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,191
Farm in New Jersey. Seven dead.

830
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,443
Charly.

831
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,196
Good Lord, girl.
We've been looking all over for you.

832
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,908
I got a photo of you in a Christmas parade.
What the hell is happening?

833
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,785
Don't be stupid.

834
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,662
I completed my assignment.

835
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,248
You mean Daedalus?

836
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,750
I shot him. He's pretty much dead.

837
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:42,753
Actually, I would have done it earlier,
say back in '92...

838
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,214
but I was baking. Don't ask.

839
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,882
I wanna come in.

840
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:51,053
Sure. Of course.

841
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,888
Let me direct you to a safe house.

842
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,308
Forget it. We play it my way.

843
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,894
You want me back, then you stay away.
I'll call you.

844
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,771
Those are the rules, understand?

845
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,400
Shit.

846
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,865
Did you hear that?

847
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,701
If she got to Daedalus...

848
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,537
she could know about Honeymoon.

849
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:20,165
She might know that old targets
have become your new best friends.

850
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,209
That could be trouble.

851
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:23,419
Goddamn you.

852
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,796
There were weapons at that farm.
She's armed now.

853
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,173
Stop having kittens.

854
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,719
You're the head of a major spy network,
and you have a tendency to whine.

855
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:32,970
Do you realize that?

856
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:36,056
She could compromise
this entire operation.

857
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,809
We have 24 hours.

858
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,352
We find her...

859
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,605
then we kill her.

860
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,024
Do whatever it takes, but be careful.

861
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,693
If it gets out you work for me...

862
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,362
I'll be grabbing my ankles
on the White House lawn.

863
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:54,033
The lady's wacked, Trin.
She's lost it. I gotta get out of here.

864
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,534
Look, I need you to meet me.

865
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,371
I'll sneak back out to this phone
and call you at midnight with the details.

866
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,873
Bye.

867
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,376
All right, Sam. What did that accomplish?

868
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,128
I'm testing our boy Perkins.

869
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,047
Got a light?

870
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,758
I don't really trust him.

871
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,843
Come again?

872
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,430
A little experiment.

873
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:20,184
If he was looking for me in Pennsylvania,
he sure as hell tapped your office.

874
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:22,436
You mean he just traced that call?

875
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,396
Come midnight, you hang by the phone.

876
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,231
If he wants to erase me...

877
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,568
he'll send someone to kidnap
and torture you for my whereabouts...

878
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:32,112
in which case, hey, I don't trust him.

879
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,115
No, no, no. Time out.

880
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,507
I haven't had a date in eight years, Mitch.

881
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,594
Is this a fun date?

882
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:01,433
What's going on?

883
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,230
True love. Shut the fuck up.

884
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,360
Beautiful.

885
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,987
White lady seducing the colored help.

886
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,031
Get real, sweetheart.

887
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,242
I ain't handsome, I ain't rich...

888
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:22,579
and the last time I got blown,
candy bars cost a nickel.

889
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,956
What's going on?

890
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,792
Chemistry. Go figure.

891
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,670
Chemistry, my ass.

892
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:31,964
You know what I think?

893
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,341
I think this is why you'd fuck me.

894
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,638
To kill a schoolteacher.

895
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,641
To bury her once and for all.

896
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,435
I kind of liked that schoolteacher.

897
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,729
When she comes back,
give me a call, all right?

898
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,858
Oh, and call your fucking kid.

899
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,317
It's two days to Christmas.

900
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,904
She might be under the mistaken impression
Mommy gives a fuck.

901
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,782
I didn't ask for the kid.

902
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,660
Samantha had the kid, not me.

903
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,830
Nobody asked me.

904
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,548
Merry Christmas.

905
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,514
Good evening, pretty lady.
How about some company?

906
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,851
No, thanks.
I'm saving myself till I get raped.

907
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,853
Step in the alley.

908
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,690
I ain't asking you. I'm telling you.

909
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,609
Fuck.

910
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,406
Goddamn it. You're early.
So Perkins wants me dead?

911
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:40,991
What's the rush?

912
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,745
Why don't you go away
and come back at midnight?

913
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:45,954
Shoo.

914
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,082
Hey, honey, this is a real big fucking gun.

915
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,962
- This ain't no ham on rye, pal.
- What the hell are you doing?

916
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,422
Saving your life.

917
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,342
I would've come sooner,
but I was thinking up that line.

918
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,511
You think I can't take him?

919
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,846
- Probably scared the others away.
- What others?

920
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,056
Headhunters, nimrod.

921
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:05,599
They don't travel alone.

922
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,227
Were you always this stupid,
or did you take lessons?

923
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,728
- I took lessons.
- Hey.

924
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,605
What?

925
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,690
I still got this fucking gun.

926
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,000
Fuck this.

927
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,878
Put that away.

928
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,548
I'm out of here.

929
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,979
Perkins, you prick.

930
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,106
Now you want me dead. Why?

931
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,191
What's going on?

932
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:00,362
Easy, sport.
I got myself out of Beirut once.

933
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,489
I think I can get out of New Jersey.

934
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,617
Yeah? Well, don't be so sure.
Others have tried and failed.

935
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,537
The entire population, in fact.

936
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:14,042
You keep saying "I" this,
"I" that, like, well...

937
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:17,546
It's like you don't need me anymore.

938
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,090
Good point.

939
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,758
Hey, hey, hey.

940
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,720
Get in.

941
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,817
Found a use for me?

942
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,319
Yep.

943
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,988
I'm leaving the country, Mitch.

944
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,950
I need a fake passport,
and I need money, lots of it.

945
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,743
Well, why didn't you say so?

946
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,245
Hold on a minute
while I pull that out of my ass.

947
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,497
The key, Mitch.

948
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,499
The one I keep on that charm bracelet?

949
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,001
It opens Box 227 in a bank in Buffalo.

950
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,712
How the fuck would you know?
The numbers are filed off.

951
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:43,215
I filed them off.

952
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,342
There's a briefcase in Box 227.

953
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,010
It's got cash and IDs in it.

954
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,388
I need you to get them for me.

955
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,225
Shit. I should have known.

956
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,518
Okay.

957
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,353
So where's this charm bracelet?

958
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,899
Yeah, well, that's the thing
about being a secret agent, Mitch.

959
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,442
Nothing is ever simple.

960
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:27,759
Drive past. Don't slow down.

961
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,303
You can park under those trees.

962
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,597
Honk if there's any trouble.

963
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,308
Yes, Miss Daisy. I be honking.

964
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,658
Good morning, Raymond.

965
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:53,827
Good morning, Miss Caine.

966
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,121
What did we learn
about the dangers of smoking?

967
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,914
Give it here.

968
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,338
Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me...

969
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,758
I'll blow your fucking head off.

970
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,774
Fuck.

971
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,070
Shoot the son of a bitch.

972
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,406
Oh, shit.

973
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,641
Hi.

974
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,113
You're about to have 2.4 children.

975
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,447
Oh, please.

976
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,200
Merry Christmas.

977
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:08,957
So how far to the money?

978
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,166
Hour, tops.

979
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,378
I haven't seen a cop in a while.

980
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,382
So, Mitch...

981
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,594
still think I'm warm and fuzzy?

982
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,763
Oh, yeah, sure.

983
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,515
Anything?

984
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:28,727
Phone bill, Christmas card.

985
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,896
You could've aimed
for those guys' shoulders.

986
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,190
- Back off, man.
- Ha, ha.

987
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:38,695
You know, I'm thinking maybe
Samantha Caine wasn't an act.

988
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,906
Yeah, you had amnesia and all...

989
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,577
but I think maybe you forgot
to hate yourself for a while. How about it?

990
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,205
What the fuck is that?

991
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,125
Oh.

992
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,054
Hello?

993
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,680
It's me. I got your kid.

994
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,851
Give your location. Don't waste time.

995
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,689
State Road 5...

996
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:18,443
15 minutes east
of Union Springs, New York.

997
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,196
I don't like cellular phones,
so here's how we do this.

998
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:23,031
Go to the Holiday Inn nearest you.

999
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,033
There's one in Cayuga.

1000
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,202
Be there when I call in 15 minutes.

1001
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:32,499
Who?

1002
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:36,336
He's got the kid.

1003
01:18:36,504 --> 01:18:38,296
Timothy?

1004
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:42,384
He's routing me to a landline.
Doesn't want to talk over the airwaves.

1005
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,511
Oh, shit.

1006
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,684
Maybe we can trace him.

1007
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,521
Trace him? How? It's a random hotel.

1008
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,898
- How long did he give you?
- Fifteen minutes.

1009
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,733
Okay.

1010
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,820
Why don't we try the phone company?

1011
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,448
Think you can get here
in under 15 minutes?

1012
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,248
Nobody move.

1013
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,918
You.

1014
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,712
You've got 40 seconds
to run a patch for me.

1015
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,381
Everybody up. Against the wall.

1016
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,017
Holiday lnn. Chet speaking.

1017
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,520
I'd like to page
Charlene Baltimore, please.

1018
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,896
Please hold.

1019
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:42,694
Yeah.

1020
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,988
Hi. It's me.

1021
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,449
No shit. Verify you have the kid.

1022
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,034
How else would I get
your cellular number?

1023
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,162
I got it off the cast on her right wrist.

1024
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,540
Right below "Mommy loves you."

1025
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,669
I offer up a simple trade.
You for the girl.

1026
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,546
I'll tell you where and when.

1027
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:02,964
And, Charly...

1028
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,592
you fuck with me...

1029
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,971
I'll blind the kid
and shoot out her knees.

1030
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,229
Give me an ANI trace.

1031
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,023
Do it.

1032
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,157
How do you know so much
about this Timothy?

1033
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,659
Oh, what do you think?
I bumped pelvises with him.

1034
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,537
He was a target, remember?

1035
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,290
Ma'am?

1036
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,959
That call was placed from Niagara Falls.

1037
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,337
Niagara Falls?

1038
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,925
Operation Honeymoon.

1039
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,134
Bingo.

1040
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,264
Perkins.

1041
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:36,599
What's he doing here?

1042
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:49,112
Timothy acting alone, we had a chance.

1043
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,324
Charly's hooked.

1044
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:56,452
All we gotta do is set a time and a place.

1045
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,127
My God. We're monsters.

1046
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,005
You talk to me about Honeymoon.

1047
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:09,841
Tanker's ready.

1048
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:12,885
One terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy.

1049
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:16,848
- And no loose ends?
- No, no. Not that I can tell.

1050
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:21,686
Feds are gonna find them crashed
in a ravine five miles from the blast site.

1051
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,323
I'm not a complete ogre.

1052
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:38,161
The young one gets a doll
to play with for Christmas.

1053
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,456
Oh, fuck you.

1054
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,130
- I think I should go in first.
- Negative.

1055
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,673
You'd just screw it up.

1056
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:54,218
Hey, I'm a much better shot up close.

1057
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,554
You couldn't hit a lake
if you were on the bottom.

1058
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,889
Forget it.

1059
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,933
Here.

1060
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,979
The guards are at 126.9 megahertz.

1061
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:09,651
You meet me at 127.1
if you need to talk.

1062
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:15,156
As soon as you spot me with the kid,
you start laying down cover fire.

1063
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,409
All right.

1064
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,583
They're gonna blow my head off,
you know.

1065
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,463
This is the last time I'll ever be pretty.

1066
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,999
Northeast sector, all clear.

1067
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,960
Roger, Northeast.

1068
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,024
Bogey.

1069
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:21,365
Round her up, gentlemen.
I want her alive and unmarked.

1070
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,868
Run. She's got the kid.

1071
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:03,825
I smell gasoline.

1072
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,660
Did you have a little accident?

1073
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,539
I got plenty of matches up here.
It would be a bad way for a kid to go.

1074
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:12,083
Thirty seconds. Think it over.

1075
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:28,349
- Oh!
- Pick him up.

1076
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,855
I'm gonna miss you, major.

1077
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:35,898
You ought to have stayed dead.

1078
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,692
You don't know the rules anymore.

1079
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:41,863
Tell me about it. Eight years ago,
this guy was on the hit list.

1080
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,323
Budget cuts, dear.

1081
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,369
Congress blinded us overseas.

1082
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,998
I was forced to turn
to any eyes and ears I could find...

1083
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:56,419
even if that meant recruiting
the quote-unquote "bad guys" here.

1084
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:01,424
Budget cuts, is that what this is about?

1085
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,302
Operation Honeymoon.

1086
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:07,847
Fuck me. You're running a fundraiser.

1087
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:09,181
Fundraiser?

1088
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,893
1993.

1089
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,521
World Trade Center bombing, remember?

1090
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:21,819
During the trial, one of the bombers
claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.

1091
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,366
The diplomat who issued
the terrorists' visa was CIA.

1092
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,120
It's not unthinkable they paved the way
for the bombing...

1093
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,664
purely to justify a budget increase.

1094
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:38,044
You're gonna fake some terrorist thing
just to scare some money out of Congress?

1095
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,962
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Henessey...

1096
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,715
I have no idea
how to fake killing 4000 people.

1097
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,886
So we're just gonna have to do it for real.

1098
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,096
Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.

1099
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,350
Then I get my funding.

1100
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,560
Good night, old girl.

1101
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,063
- Timothy, I'll be in Chopper 1.
- All right.

1102
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,487
No, no, no. Just her.

1103
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:07,865
Sam.

1104
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,910
I'll be waiting for you to come rescue me.

1105
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:12,912
Be just a minute.

1106
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,873
Hey.

1107
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,342
So you plant this poor Arab
to take the fall.

1108
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,052
What's going out in the tanker?

1109
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:30,721
Come on.

1110
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,431
I'm gonna die. I wanna know.

1111
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,935
Okay.

1112
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,521
Chemical bomb.

1113
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,440
Chain reaction.

1114
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,401
Once started, it can't be stopped.

1115
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,196
The catalyst injected
into the tanker heats up.

1116
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:50,992
We pull the truck
into the center of town.

1117
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,120
It goes critical around midnight.

1118
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:57,123
Farewell. Adieu.

1119
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,751
- Timothy.
- Yeah?

1120
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,628
Please...

1121
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,548
let my kid go.

1122
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:09,593
I'm about all out of favors, there, Chuck.

1123
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,472
But I'm already letting you spend time
with the kid while you freeze to death.

1124
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,808
Now, they're...

1125
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:21,105
They're gonna find your bodies
somewhere in Pennsylvania.

1126
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:25,443
And you're just gonna be written off
as some crazy mommy...

1127
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,737
who kidnapped her own kid...

1128
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,655
died with her in a blizzard.

1129
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,032
Goddamn you.

1130
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,784
Look at her eyes.

1131
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,578
Now, why would I wanna do that?

1132
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,455
Because they're yours.

1133
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,626
That night with you, I got pregnant.

1134
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,838
The little girl is your daughter.

1135
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,388
That's priceless.

1136
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,976
Would you bring my little bitch in here?

1137
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,070
Caitlin.

1138
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,240
Hi, princess.

1139
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,868
You mind if I take a look
at your fucking eyes?

1140
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,176
It's all right, Caity.

1141
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,804
We're gonna take a nap together.

1142
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,722
We'll be like the bears in the winter.

1143
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,600
Yeah, bears. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

1144
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,777
It ain't over.

1145
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:55,866
You're gonna die screaming.

1146
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,912
And I'm gonna watch.

1147
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,501
Am I telling the truth?

1148
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,518
Mommy, it's cold in here.

1149
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:24,228
Just for a minute.

1150
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,730
Polar bears, remember?

1151
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:33,881
Open.

1152
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,493
Step over there, sweetie.

1153
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,831
Give me a spark.

1154
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,548
Hi, Mitch.

1155
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,342
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1156
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,011
For you, Tim, always a pleasure to wait.

1157
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:26,141
I wanted to tell you this story.
The Grinch, like a mean fucker, but...

1158
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,773
Come on. Do it.

1159
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,108
Do it!

1160
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:36,735
It being Christmas Eve,
I'm gonna give you a choice.

1161
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:41,031
The knife or the gun.

1162
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:46,704
Do it.

1163
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,799
Mommy, don't cry.

1164
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,305
I keep these here for lighting your candle.

1165
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:09,935
Oh, Caity.

1166
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,689
I love you.

1167
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:15,065
Sam called Washington.

1168
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,526
By morning,
this place will be crawling with feds.

1169
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,445
We're gonna be gone by then, Mitch.

1170
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,572
That's what I'm saying.

1171
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:25,034
A couple of feds said they couldn't sleep,
so they might come early.

1172
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,579
That tanker goes bang
at 312 degrees Celsius.

1173
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:30,748
Right in the center of town...

1174
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:33,292
25 minutes from now.

1175
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,836
Mommy, am I gonna die?

1176
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,546
Oh, no, baby.

1177
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:40,424
No, you're not gonna die.

1178
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,344
They are.

1179
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,220
Cover your ears.

1180
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:48,098
Hey, should we get a dog?

1181
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,857
Bye, Mitch.

1182
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:01,779
Thanks for coming.

1183
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:26,387
Oh, shit.

1184
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,225
I know! Watch your fire!

1185
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,521
Ha, ha. You foxy bitch.

1186
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,030
- Mommy.
- Run, Caity.

1187
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:50,869
Hide.

1188
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:58,836
Caity.

1189
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,346
Yeah, Sam, they don't know
who they're fucking with.

1190
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,812
- Skin looks fine.
- Yeah, looks all right from here.

1191
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,944
Where the fuck is that kid going?

1192
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,824
Shit.

1193
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,877
Move it out! And find that bitch.

1194
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:43,964
All right, people, listen up.

1195
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:46,133
Nothing changes.

1196
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:49,178
Icy roads, five miles past the town limit.

1197
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,221
Plant the car in the ravine...

1198
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:53,682
and get your asses out of there.

1199
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:55,851
Where'd you go, baby?

1200
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,811
Show Mommy.

1201
01:36:58,313 --> 01:36:59,354
Sam.

1202
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:00,898
Sam, are you out there?

1203
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,275
Sam, where are you?

1204
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,235
Mitch. I don't believe it.

1205
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,864
I just saw Caitlin climb
in the back of the truck.

1206
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:10,908
She's locked in the toolbox, left rear.

1207
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:12,659
Jesus. The truck is a bomb.

1208
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,620
Tell me something I don't know.

1209
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:15,913
Timothy rigged it.

1210
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:18,457
Three hundred-twelve degrees,
it goes boom.

1211
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,917
We got 20 minutes, tops.

1212
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,294
I'll go in and get her.

1213
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,837
- No chance.
- I'm close.

1214
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,298
I make it a dozen
with automatic weapons.

1215
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,051
So kill them for me, bitch.
What are you good for?

1216
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,474
Okay, you can do this.

1217
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:36,767
Mitch, no.

1218
01:37:36,935 --> 01:37:38,852
Just do one thing right.

1219
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,521
Talk to me, Mitch.

1220
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,940
- Please.
- Mitch.

1221
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:49,071
Goddamn it.

1222
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:51,198
Your 9, Mitch, on your 9.

1223
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:58,413
Thirty degrees left, Mitch. Left.

1224
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,374
Your other left.

1225
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,758
They got you flanked.

1226
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:11,593
Mitch, get out, now!

1227
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:17,766
Mitch! Shit!

1228
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,066
Mitch.

1229
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,496
Move it out. Let's go.

1230
01:39:18,328 --> 01:39:21,079
Okay, listen up.
She's gonna make a try for the payload...

1231
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:23,540
so Units 2 and 4, watch your backs.

1232
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,584
Sky 1, get me a chopper in the air.

1233
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:26,960
I'm on my way. Out.

1234
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,739
Let me through.

1235
01:39:57,784 --> 01:39:58,909
Coming through.

1236
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,542
Out.

1237
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,511
Clear out of the way.
This truck's gonna blow up.

1238
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:20,931
Move.

1239
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,272
Sir, she's got the truck.

1240
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,982
She's headed out of town.

1241
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,610
I'm hurt real bad. I think I'm dying.

1242
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:36,488
Continue dying. Out.

1243
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,573
Head her off, please.

1244
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:54,464
Oh, fuck.

1245
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,510
No. No!

1246
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:00,053
Oh, not fair.

1247
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,055
Not fucking fair.

1248
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:04,683
Get out of the way.

1249
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:13,608
Hang on, Caity.

1250
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:25,454
Suck my dick, every one of you bastards.

1251
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,187
- Shit.
- Shit.

1252
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:46,618
Oh, honey, only four inches?

1253
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,371
You'll feel me.

1254
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,342
No!

1255
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,312
No!

1256
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:55,562
Mommy.

1257
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,241
She must be in the truck.

1258
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,786
Get away from her.

1259
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:16,374
- Mom.
- No!

1260
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:34,976
Help.

1261
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:37,479
Caity.

1262
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:42,192
- Caity.
- Mommy, I hit my head.

1263
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,777
Come on.

1264
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,326
Okay. Hold on.

1265
01:44:56,916 --> 01:45:00,210
Caity, run.

1266
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:01,544
Get out.

1267
01:45:01,712 --> 01:45:03,880
Don't go away again, please.

1268
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,132
Caity, the truck is a bomb.

1269
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:08,802
It's gonna blow up.

1270
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,804
Go.

1271
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,765
I'm right behind you, baby.

1272
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,310
Go, and don't look back.

1273
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:22,983
Good girl.

1274
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,587
Here! Over here!

1275
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:47,382
Mommy, no.

1276
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:56,850
It's okay.

1277
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:59,436
I'm sorry I left.

1278
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,730
Please get up.

1279
01:46:10,865 --> 01:46:13,616
Charlie Team 1, we're in position
and ready to advance.

1280
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,243
Charlie 1, that's a negative.

1281
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,121
Orders are to stand down until notified.

1282
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,626
Would you stop it?

1283
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:26,254
Stop being a little baby.

1284
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:29,924
Get up now. You're not dead.

1285
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,014
Don't you die.

1286
01:46:36,182 --> 01:46:38,641
You get up now.

1287
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:41,102
Life is pain.

1288
01:46:41,687 --> 01:46:44,647
You just get used to it.

1289
01:46:45,066 --> 01:46:48,735
So stand up right this minute, Mommy.

1290
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:24,771
You're grounded.

1291
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,115
Get me to the bridge.

1292
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,368
I'm not leaving till I know
that bitch is dead.

1293
01:48:03,352 --> 01:48:05,895
Somebody help me.

1294
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,068
I got a kid here.

1295
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:15,530
I got my 8-year-old daughter,
do you hear me?

1296
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:19,200
Somebody get this motherfucker off me.

1297
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,746
- Help me.
- Negative, ma'am.

1298
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:25,999
We understand your request, but...

1299
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:33,923
That's right.
You can't kill me, motherfuckers.

1300
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:49,063
Sam!

1301
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,565
Mitch.

1302
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,234
Hurry.

1303
01:48:57,448 --> 01:48:59,407
- Get in.
- Sam.

1304
01:49:02,203 --> 01:49:04,037
Stay here. Here.

1305
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,207
- I'm here.
- Sam.

1306
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:08,458
I'm here, you bastard.

1307
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:10,835
I'm here, you bastard!

1308
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:38,821
Die screaming, motherfucker.

1309
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:47,830
Don't let her get to the border!
They're heading for the border!

1310
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:49,499
Go!

1311
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,259
Don't hit the cars.

1312
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,204
Sorry.

1313
01:51:10,748 --> 01:51:12,999
I can't drive anymore.

1314
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:14,709
Okay.

1315
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:17,253
Are you okay?

1316
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:20,548
Are you stupid?

1317
01:51:27,348 --> 01:51:28,514
Hey, gorgeous.

1318
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:33,561
You got your mommy's eyes.

1319
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,565
Don't let nobody tell you different.

1320
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:44,947
Hey, hang in there, partner.

1321
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,492
Did you forget we're rich?

1322
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:57,585
Hello?

1323
01:51:57,753 --> 01:52:00,213
I'm putting your call
through to the president.

1324
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:02,382
- Hello, Miss Caine.
- Yes, Mr. President.

1325
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,133
I owe you.

1326
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,678
The country owes you
a debt of tremendous gratitude.

1327
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:12,642
I wonder, would I be out of line if I asked
you to come back into government...

1328
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:14,310
work for the State Department?

1329
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:15,978
Out of the question, sir.

1330
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:17,855
I've got a stack of papers to grade.

1331
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:21,317
The money involved would be substantial.

1332
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,570
You'd be surprised how much
a good teacher can earn.

1333
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,739
Oh, gosh, I know.

1334
01:52:26,907 --> 01:52:30,034
And I am working on it,
but it's for next term.

1335
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:34,914
Before I go, sir,
there is a small favor I'd like to ask.

1336
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,541
Welcome to Larry King Live.

1337
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,502
Tonight we seek closure
in the matter of Leland Perkins...

1338
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,547
indicted on six counts of high treason.

1339
01:52:42,714 --> 01:52:46,592
Joining us tonight
is CIA Section Chief Walter Hodge.

1340
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,177
He's in Langley, Virginia.

1341
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:50,638
At our studios in New York City...

1342
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:53,808
intelligence analyst
Jack E. Wadsworth.

1343
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:58,354
And in our studios here tonight
is Pittsburgh native Mitchell Henessey...

1344
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,398
who, at a surprise press conference...

1345
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:03,526
was singled out
by the president of the United States...

1346
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,278
for his role in this affair.

1347
01:53:05,446 --> 01:53:07,905
As the expression goes, "That ain't hay."

1348
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:10,616
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you, Mr. K, for having me.

1349
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,412
Mitch, you have had
one hell of a Christmas Eve...

1350
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:18,624
and we have heard from our reporter Carla
Krebs, on the scene in Niagara Falls...

1351
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,335
when she heard this story,
she didn't believe it.

1352
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:24,547
Well, what Carla failed to realize,
Mr. King...

1353
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:28,217
is that I'm always frank
and earnest with women.

1354
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:29,552
In New York, I'm Frank.

1355
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,888
In Chicago, I'm Earnest.

1356
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,480
Good boy.

1357
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:51,866
Yeah, I could just sit out here forever.

1358
01:53:52,034 --> 01:53:53,659
Couldn't you?
