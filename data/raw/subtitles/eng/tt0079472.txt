00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:19,913
Thank you.

4
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,290
Porky Wing's coming.

5
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,874
Morning. Morning.

6
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,973
Who was the poor wretch leaving
banana peel around?

7
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,398
Wan Chu-Cheong, good morning!

8
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,191
What are you doing?!

9
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,820
Uh... Those two pigs...

10
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,448
Oh! You wanna buy pigs, huh?

11
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,992
Business from a fellow butcher,
I'll give it to you for cheap!

12
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,243
Whaddaya mean, "buy"?!

13
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,329
Those two pigs were raised by me!

14
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,538
Yours?!

15
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,290
Then what kinda distinguishing marks
do they have?

16
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,709
Well, there's no distinguishing marks...

17
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,669
But all pigs look the same!

18
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,965
Oh... if pigs all look the same,
we're pigs too, so greet me properly.

Look at this.

I've got a beard.

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,060
You said it yourself that
all pigs look the same.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,478
Since I've got a beard...

27
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,605
Guess that makes me your dad then.

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,524
Call me Daddy, and I'll give you two pigs!

29

I'll just lose the pigs! Hmph!

00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,328
I knew I got conned,
but didn't even say anything.

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
I'm just screwing myself over, then.

33
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,998

34
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,208

That's right.

37
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,388
In that case, listen up.

38

Don't you dare call me that!

Since when did you have to call
when taking a chariot?

there's no going back!

l have practiced it for 30-odd years.

In the world of martial arts,
I have claimed the number two spot.

It was that disciple of Wong Fei-Hung,
Lam Sai-Wing.

143
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,292
He was throwing his weight around,
and he beat me up for no reason.

00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,711
How dare he!

145
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,462
Lam Sai-Wing was this vicious?!

146
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,633
I even told him I was with
Five Dragon Hall.

147
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,971
He said he didn't care if it was a
town hall, a dance hall, or a concert hall!

148
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,140
Then he threw in some extra punches too!

149
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,809
And that's not the end of it!

150
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,229
Wong Fei-Hung called you a phony!

151
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,608
Said you should change the name of
Five Dragon Hall to Five Snake Hall.

152
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,279
And make the most of the autumn wind,
change career to sell snake soup instead.

Hmph! The reputation of your Po Chi Lam
is so mighty,

00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,002

So, bring the tea.

Master Ko, please take a seat.

165
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,234
Ah! The chair has been eaten
through by insects.

166
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,069
Please excuse the mess.

167
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,783
What refined pursuits.

168
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:23,289
Master Wong, you must have a penchant
for the study of calligraphy.

169
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,666
You flatter me.

170
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,006
A single balding brush can unite a family,
govern a nation, bring peace under heaven.

171
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,469
I too studied calligraphy for a few years.

172
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,348
Master Wong, please evaluate
my semi-cursive script.

173
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,892
"Brush descends,
startling the wind and the rain."

rouses ghosts and gods to weep."

175
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,820
Brother Ko, your brushwork
is far too skewed!

176
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,321
An upright heart,
leads to an upright brush!

177
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,948
You should practice regular script
and master the basics first!

178
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,617
One must have an upright heart,

179
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,493
upright posture,

180
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,244

00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,089
Sai-Kwong...!

360
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,174
Yuet... Mui...!

361
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,509
Sai-Kwo...

362
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,844
Yuet-Mui!

363
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:25,886
Sai-Kwong!

364
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,804
Yuet-Mui!

365
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,722
Sai-Kwong!

366
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,959
We're always practising
the same old set of moves.

367
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,085
I'm bored to death!

368
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,128
Yeah!

369
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,921
What the hell's up with Master?

370
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,464
He hasn't taught us anything new in ages!

371
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,425
Are you bad-mouthing Master? Huh?!

372
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,219
- No, Master! We're not bad-mouthing you!
- No, Master! We're not bad-mouthing you!

373
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,806
As punishment, you must treat Wing
to Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

374
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,350
- Treat Wing to food?!
- Treat Wing to food?!

375
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,317
- Damn it! Trying to fool us?!
- Damn it! Trying to fool us?!

376
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,779
Wait... 'cause I managed to fool you
means I'm pretty great, yeah?

377
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,366
Ah... you fat bastard,
that's a pretty good impression of Master!

378
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,117
It's good, huh?

379
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,702
Let me show you some more!

380
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,583
. Wong Feil. Hung.

381
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,585
As a child lost his life.

382
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,754
Life-giving mother.

383
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,800
This turtle. Is actually my dad.

384
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,594
My dad's pet.

385
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,144
Laughing now?

386
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,020
It's good, isn't it?

387
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,063
There's more!

388
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,609
Foon, Seven. Go and fetch me a whore!

389
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,153
A whole bowl of chicken rice!

390
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,406
And we'll have to strip.

391
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,075
The feathers off the chicken!

392
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,077
Wing.

393
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,994
Wing! Wing! Wing!

394
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:14,870
Wing what?!

395
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,664
Why haven't you poured me some tea yet?!

396
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,417
How is it?

397
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,378
Not bad, but a bit cold.

398
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,379
Don't do it again!

399
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,305
Ma... Master...!

400
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,390
What Master?!

401
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,766
Finish your tea first.

402
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:36,934
Master is leaving!

403
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,478
Master... please don't go.

404
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,522
You do such a good impression of Master.

405
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,524
I might as well pack my things and
retire to the country.

406
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,318
See? Already packed.

407
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,155
M-master... I promise I won't do it again.

408
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,491
You promise? Hmph!

409
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,370
Master, is there somewhere you need to be?

410
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,622
Yes. I am going to Kwangsi
to purchase medicinal herbs.

411
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,416
Since it is on the way,
I will also visit Zhulin Temple

412
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,167
and pay my respects
to the Golden Zen Master.

413
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,794
I am instructing the three of you:

414
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,546
work hard treating our patients
here at Po Chi Lam.

415
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,881
And do not, do not
go around stirring up trouble.

416
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,508
Master, have some faith in us!

417
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,801
We won't get into fights ever again!

418
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,845
Then what will you do if
Ko Ba-Tin's men show up?!

419
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:13,595
Beat 'em!

420
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,346
Huh?!

421
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,367
If you don't give me back my wife,
it's your funeral today!

422
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,536
Die!

423
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:38,662
Die!

424
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,426
Die!

425
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,180
Die!

426
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,934
Die! Die!

427
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,102
H-h-hey!

428
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:02,895
You'd better stop it!

429
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,729
Are you trying to kill him?!

430
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,354
Die!

431
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,439
You don't know anything!

432
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,190
This is none of your business!

433
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,191
Get outta here!

434
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,776
If you don't get lost,
I'll beat you up too!

435
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,695
Goddamnit! You threatening me?!

436
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,363
I'm not scared of anyone!

437
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,448
Die!

438
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,251
Catch!

439
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,048
Ugh... Boss...

440
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,466
Gotcha!

441
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,980
You fat bastard!

442
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:47,898
You'd better watch your back!

443
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,067
Hey!

444
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,318
Are you all right?

445
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,945
I'm all right.

446
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,446
Thanks a lot, boss.

447
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:55,697
What do I call you, 'brother'?

448
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,573
My name's Ko Tai-Hoi.

449
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,700
Oh! I sell pigs at the market.

450
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,285
Everyone calls me Porky Wing.

451
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,578
Oh... Brother Wing.

452
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,539
To have troubled someone so righteous...

453
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,748
let me buy you a drink, eh?

454
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,208
That's too kind of you.

455
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:06,917
I insist... I insist...

456
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,918
No, it's fine.

457
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:08,418
I insist.

458
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,211
- No, it's too much!
- You really must join me.

459
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:09,962
Oh all right. Let's go, then.

460
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,542
Ah... It's been a while since
I've smelled the stench of chickens.

461
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,777
Yah damn fat beggar,
don' go pickin' at yer feet 'ere!

462
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,989
My chickens catch a whiff o' yer stink...
they'll get poisoned!

463
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,449
Right. Right.

464
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,121
Don' even know what yer up to...

465
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,289
Yer friggin' mental!

466
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,669
Hmm... Those crazy chickens
aren't cutting me any slack!

467
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,254
Making such a damn racket!

468
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,101
Aren't you a greedy one?

469
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,436
C'mon down and eat. C'mon down and eat.

470
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,067
Peck! Peck!

471
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,204
You shouldn't drink so much
if you can't hold your liquor.

472
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,665
People drink and get drunk,
but you drink and get killed!

473
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,594
I can't hold my own in a scrap.

474
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,220
I'm a wimp compared to the tough guys.

475
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,639
And now my wife's been taken too!

476
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,892
I'm better off dead!

477
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,040
H-h-h-h-h-h-hey, friend?

478
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,124
Can I bother you for a sec?

479
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,667
Is there a kitchen here?

480
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,713
Of course there is!

481
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,715
It's just behind you over there!

482
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,260
Thanks. Thanks.

483
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,390
Friend?

484
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,891
What now?

485
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,934
Can I borrow your kitchen?

486
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,477
It's not like you'll be using it anymore!

487
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,229
That's true...

488
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,106
It's all yours!

489
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,399
In that case, thanks a lot.

490
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,070
I'm busy even when I'm dead!

491
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,156
H-h-hey!

492
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,123
This money, why don't you lend it to me?

493
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,582
It's not like you'll be using it anymore!

494
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,839
This shirt's in my size.

495
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,136
It's not like you'll be
using it anymore, right?

496
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:09,970
You...!

497
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,765
Your pants... give 'em to me too!

498
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,474
Let's not waste them.

499
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,934
It's not like you'll be using them anymore!

500
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,535
I'm gonna borrow the rope as well.

501
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,078
It's not like you'll be using it anymore!

502
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,916
I almost choked...!

503
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,839
You've still got breath, right?

504
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,048
Just a little.

505
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,550
Hey, you should give that up too.

506
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,052
It's still good so let's not waste it.
C'mon!

507
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:58,101
Now... I'm gonna borrow your breath
to start up the stove.

508
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,982
What happened to your face?

509
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,619
Is that Ko Tai-Hoi really so tough?

510
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,786
Sure is.

511
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,747
He's got a lot of power.

512
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:22,459
I've heard... he has several
parts of the city under his control.

513
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,838
Wow! Th-th-th-then he's more powerful
than the electricity company!

514
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,090
Even if you know,
you can't do anything about it...

515
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,258
I can't do anything?!

516
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,637
Back in the day, not even ten big guys
could get one over me!

517
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,975
Old folks sure love going on
about "back in the day".

518
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,853
Oh. So you're just saying I'm old?!

519
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,855
Ginger gets spicier the older it gets!

520
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,900
Here... wine, the longer it's aged,
the finer it gets!

521
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,777
Watch this.

522
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,629
Heh! My bridge hands are hard enough.

523
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,898
My horse stance is steady enough.

524
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,659
My punches are powerful enough.

525
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,875
The wine is... strong enough.

526
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:16,990
Hey, dear customer!

527
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,242
What can I get you?

528
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,786
Yuk Ping Shu.

529
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,041
From the looks of you
I think you're delirious!

530
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,169
How about Mei Kuei Lu then?

531
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,837
Get the hell outta here!

532
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,380
Uh... Just Ma Jin is fine.

533
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,657
No need.

534
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,832
Brother Hoi...
Erm... I'm a bit tight lately...

535
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,211
After that last game of dominos,
you still owe me ten bucks...

536
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,340
I, Ko Tai-Hoi, a person of
such status and prestige...

537
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,633
can't owe you ten bucks?!

538
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,884
Why don't you announce it in the streets?

539
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,426
Just asking.

540
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,511
Asking is not allowed!

541
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,275
What's up?

542
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,739
Hit me?!

543
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,533
Nah, just having a scratch.

544
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,992
You call that a scratch?!

545
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,248
Fighting back too, now?!

546
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,584
No! It's not my fault!

547
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,397
Aren't you a tough guy?

548
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,940
Your toes are treading on my soles!

549
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,026
Like it needs to be said!

550
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,862
This is my first time
treading on someone like this, too!

551
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,029
How do you normally tread then?

552
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,364
I used to do it... like this!

553
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,275
C'm o Nn! 1 C' m on !

554
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,034
Hey, hit me all you want,
but don't hit the wine!

555
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,637
Wha?! What a waste.

556
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,180
Do you have a beef with the wine?!

557
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,977
You've spilled all the wine, pay up!

558
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,772
I'll pay. I'll pay you.

559
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,673
This is yours.

560
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,778
Ko Tai-Hoi, you better release
Lam Sai-Kwong's wife, Cheung Yuet-Mui.

561
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,655
Who's Cheung Yuet-Mui?

562
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,990
Still faking it, huh?

563
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,200
I remember... I remember...

564
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,702
If you remember, then speak up!

565
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,663
But... she's currently with
my 'big brother'.

566
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,790
Who's your 'big brother'?

567
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,666
Porky Wing.

568
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,042
Where is he now?

569
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,752
It's really hard to find him now.

570
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,630
How about I'll tell him to bring
Cheung Yuet-Mui

571
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,382
and wait for you at Yuet Loi Teahouse
tomorrow?

572
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,260
You'd better not pull anything funny.

573
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,262
I won't... I won't...

574
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,977
[YUET LOI TEAHOUSE]

575
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,105
That old fart's really up himself!

576
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,649
You're my friend, she's your wife,
and he dares mess with you?!

577
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,609
Yeah!

578
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,154
He even said that if I don't
hand over my wife to him today,

579
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,822
I'm gonna be done for.

580
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,367
So in the end,
I name-dropped you, Brother Wing.

581
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,744
Huh? Is that right?

582
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,454
Do I really have that much face?

583
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,080
So what did he say, then?

584
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,877
He said... I should buy you a coffin,
and dig a hole ready.

585
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,129
Wha?! That son of a bitch!

586
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,589
That really pisses me off!

587
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,341
When he gets here,
you tell him to go through me!

588
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,010
Hmph! What's taking him so long?

589
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,220
I'm gonna wait for him outside!

590
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,657
What's taking him so long?

591
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,912
Hey, old man, be careful, will you?!

592
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,789
Uh... thanks... t-thanks a lot.

593
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,301
What the hell?! Where is he?!

594
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,220
He's already here.

595
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,852
Thought you could hide from me?

596
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,650
Old man! My boss is here!

597
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,819
The person you want...
ask him for 'em!

598
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,323
You... you're the one called Porky Wing?

599
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:36,744
What a stink!

600
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,496
Have you rinsed this morning yet?

601
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,872
I haven't rinsed.

602
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,333
Uh... waiter, Yuk Ping Shu.

603
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,209
Here.

604
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:06,149
Old man, you're not here today
just to rinse your mouth out, right?

605
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,984
You reminded me.

606
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,485
You'd better hand her over now!

607
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,278
Hand?!

608
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,113
There's a lot of hands
down here in the south.

609
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,407
Do you want a pair, a straight, or a flush?

610
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,617
Ah... You've got a pretty big head.

611
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,745
Not as big as yours!

612
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,541
You've got the same personality and tone
as an old pal of mine.

613
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,000
Who?

614
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,001
Jesus!

615
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,462
He's all talk, and I can't get a word in.

616
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,883
Heh! Well, you've got the same character
as an old pal of mine!

617
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,717
Who?

618
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,469
Ximen Qing!

619
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,474
He stole another man's wife,
so he got beaten to death in the end.

620
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,350
Huh? What are you talking about?

621
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,186
I'm talking in proper Cantonese!

622
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,813
Hey, Brother Wing,
do you actually think you're Jesus?

623
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,148
What's with the sermon?

624
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,775
Hey, hit him already!

625
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,404
Hey! Do you really want her?

626
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,990
Heh! By hook or by crook!

627
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,284
Ah! If I hit you, then I'd be a bully.

628
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,203
I respect you old people.

629
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,205
I'll let you get in three punches first.
Hmph!

630
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,087
If you're given an advantage,
then there's no harm taking it!

631
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,643
Let's go, it's a fight!

632
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,165
- Hurry up! Let's go!
- C'mon! C'mon!

633
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,628
Hey! I've still got two more.

634
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,589
Oh no! You old bastard,
could you play any dirtier?!

635
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:54,924
That was three punches in one.

636
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,384
You've still got two more,
but you can forget it!

637
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,440
Wow! That's Hung Gar!

638
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,942
Hey, who's your master?

639
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,068
What's it to you?!

640
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,862
All that matters is you're not my master!

641
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,293
I'm just an old fart, right?

642
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,713
Still on, tiger?

643
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,590
I'll eat you alive!

644
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,216
The sleeping crane swallows its body.

645
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,625
Brother Wing, are you all right?

646
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,168
<i>I'm fine!</i>

647
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,628
I was just a bit careless, that's all.

648
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,923
Then you'd better be more careful this time.

649
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,430
Hissing head of the fleeing snake.

650
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,270
Oh? Even playing with snakes?

651
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,177
H-h-h-h-hey! What're you doing?

652
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,596
M-my-my foot...!

653
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,642
Looks like fatty's done for.

654
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,961
Are you gonna hand over the woman or not?

655
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,131
Even if you beat me up
so my head starts looking like a pig's,

656
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,674
I, Lam-Sai-Wing, won't hand over anything!

657
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,801
Huh?! So you're Lam Sai-Wing?!

658
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,553
You think I've got a double?

659
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,599
Heh! Aren't you a bad egg,
even stealing your little brother's wife?

660
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,683
What little brother?!

661
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,394
Your little brother: Lam Sai-Kwong!

662
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,071
That over there's Lam Sai-Kwong.

663
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,539
You piece of shit!

664
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,378
Die!

665
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:03,881
Die!

666
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,549
D-die!

667
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,389
Hey...!

668
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,557
Let go of me!

669
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,558
Let me beat him to death!

670
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:18,145
He's the big brother
you've been looking for: Scrawny Pig!

671
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,901
That's right... I'm Scrawny Pig!

672
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:25,986
You're really Scrawny Pig?

673
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,572
I'm as real as it gets!

674
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,076
I'm not lying to you.

675
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,498
That's me!

676
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,209
You're not as fat in the photograph...

677
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,710
All right, then!

678
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,379
What was I called when I was little?

679
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,423
Oh! You were called Scabby Cow!

680
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,257
That's right!

681
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,718
Also, when you were little,
I always used to hit you like this!

682
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:51,429
Big Brother!

683
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,055
Little Brother!

684
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,061
Why'd you help that scumbag
beat me up the other day?!

685
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,982
How was I to know that was you...?

686
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,401
If you didn't know,
why did you randomly help him?

687
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,070
You hit me back just now.

688
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,196
Let's call it even.

689
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,824
So I hit you back, but what's the use?

690
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,910
My wife, Yuet-Mui, already got taken
by that son of a bitch.

691
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,704
I don't even know what to do now!

692
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,334
Ko Tai-Hoi... you've really
made a fool outta me...

693
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,044
Come with me!

694
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,588
I'll sort out this mess with your wife!

695
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,098
Don't be scared.

696
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,349
I'm here to rescue you.

697
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,894
Really? Who are you?

698
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:40,936
There's no time for talk.

699
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,021
Hurry up and follow me!

700
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,196
That's some gall you have.

701
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,031
You wanna let my girl go?!

702
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,244
You don't know when to stop.

703
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,872
If you release her...

704
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,124
you'll be the one out of luck.

705
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,042
Young Master?!

706
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:06,212
Someone called Lam Sai-Wing
with a tied-up old guy's looking for you.

707
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,178
You keep an eye
on the two of them for me.

708
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,685
Hi, Brother Hoi!

709
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,109
Brother Wing... so you...
managed to beat the old guy?

710
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,070
Oh! Nothing makes up
for the virility of youth!

711
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,447
This old coot was all
high and mighty at first.

712
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,491
But in the end, he ran out of breath!

713
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,117
So then I took him down!

714
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,245
Brother Wing, you've really got it!

715
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,955
We'll put the old fart in the store room.

716
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,083
Then we'll go and have a drink,
celebrate a bit.

717
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,125
Great!

718
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,127
Let's stick him in there first. Come on.

719
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,172
Move it, old man!

720
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,465
Why are you doing it for real?

721
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,008
It's not believable
if ll don't put some muscle into it.

722
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,176
Move it!

723
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,015
C'mon, stick him in the storeroom
over there.

724
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,141
H-h-hey, Brother Hoi?

725
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,686
This room has guards.
It must be the treasury.

726
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,313
Open the door! Open the door!

727
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,898
Let us out!

728
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,275
Hurry up and let us out!

729
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,152
- No, this room belongs to my wife.
- Open the door!

730
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,488
We were afraid the old fart
would try and mess with her.

731
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,740
That's why I've got people
keeping an eye on her.

732
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,825
Let us out!

733
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,535
- Old man, why are you so obnoxious?!
- Open the door!

734
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,494
- Messing with people now?!
- Open the door!

735
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,831
Uh... oh, if that's what he says,
I should mess with him, then!

736
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,124
Ha! I don't believe it.

737
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,333
If you don't believe it,
untie these ropes and try me!

738
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,501
Don't think I won't. Hmph!

739
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,295
Hurry up and let us out!

740
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,631
W-w-w-wait!
There's nothing to fear with me here!

741
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,758
I'm gonna mess with you now.
Try and stop me!

742
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,385
- Oh no, Brother Wing...
- Don't worry!

743
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,930
Hey... it's none of your business.

744
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,938
H-hey, which one of you is Yuet-Mui?

745
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,356
I'm Lam Sai-Wing!

746
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,107
I am.

747
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,108
Oh! Come with me!

748
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,109
She...

749
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,027
Oh, her too?

750
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,278
I'll be charitable and save you too!

751
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:54,903
I am...

752
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,614
Oh, you must be the same as her. Come on!

753
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,824
H-h-hey, we're all done here.

754
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,783
You can drink when we're home!

755
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:00,909
Oh, let's go then.

756
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,418
Come on, less talk and drink up!

757
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,589
Now that the brothers are reunited.

758
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,382
And husband and wife are together again.

759
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,592
Everyone is happy!

760
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,679
She... she must be another one
Ko Tai-Hoi kidnapped.

761
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,307
[, Lam Sai-Wing,
was amidst one rescue already,

762
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,351
so I freed her as well while I was at it!

763
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,563
Wing? Acts of courage
in the name of justice:

764
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:30,898
definitely worth drinking to!

765
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,031
I'm

766
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:39,740
mll?

767
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,408
"I'm hungry" so eat up!

768
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,451
Help yourself, don't be shy.

769
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,203
We're all family here It's all the same.

770
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,497
I am Ko...

771
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,748
Oh, I know!

772
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,375
You're really content now, right?

773
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,125
Of course you are.

774
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,377
You've escaped a wretched plight!

775
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,629
I'm trying to say that
I'm Ko Ba-Tin's goddaughter.

776
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,797
What a know-it-all!

777
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,676
Uh... I'm also happy for you.

778
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,678
Ah... c-c-c-c-come on!

779
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,930
Uh... I also raise a glass to you.

780
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,014
No, it's all right, you're too kind.

781
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:04,556
I insist!

782
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,349
- No, you're too kind.
- Insist! Insist...

783
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,266
- <i>I'll</i> help myself!
- Insist... I Insist!

784
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,059
I'll help myself.

785
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,102
Oh, you'll help yourself?

786
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,645
Then I'll help myself, too!

787
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,451
Such fine wine,
and none of you are drinking...

788
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,328
Ah! What a waste!

789
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,755
From the look on your face,
Ko Tai-Hoi must have had his way with you.

790
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,757
It's nothing really.

791
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,218
I, Lam Sai-Wing, won't tell a soul.

792
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,513
Later on when you go back to your hometown
and get married,

793
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,098
just pretend it was all a bad dream.

794
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,766
Forget all about it.

795
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,894
That's even more reason
why you should celebrate.

796
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,405
Eh? Why's it spinning again?

797
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,368
He's drunk!

798
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,707
Hey! You don't have to look at with me
with such gratitude-filled eyes.

799
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,251
[, Lam Sai-Wing,
don't do good deeds to be rewarded!

800
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,588
Stupid fatty, acting so smart.

801
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,507
Hmm...! Just wait for this little miss
to have a bit of fun with you.

802
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:22,801
Big Brother?

803
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,512
It's already late; I think we'll get going.

804
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,140
In that case...
All right, you two get going.

805
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,351
Now, first thing tomorrow, pack your things
and come and live here with me.

806
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,186
All right.

807
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,107
And there's still you.

808
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,484
You need to get going, too.

809
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,652
Hey! It was you who
forcibly dragged me out here!

810
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,571
Now I don't have a home to go back to,
you tell me where I should go!

811
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,698
Huh?! It's that big a deal?!

812
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,241
In that case...

813
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,534
In that case what?

814
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,161
It's not my problem.

815
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,997
At any rate...
I'm not going anywhere tonight!

816
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,832
Huh? H-h-h-h-hey!

817
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,250
I don't even know you!

818
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,877
How can you stay here?

819
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,046
You don't know me,
but you dragged me back here.

820
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,172
What are you planning?!

821
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,383
The heavens smite me for my kindness!

822
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,635
How come it didn't smite you death, then?

823
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,679
Oh, miss...
Let's just say I'm scared of you.

824
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,765
At the very least
I'll put you up in an inn.

825
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,682
That's fine, right?

826
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,519
If you've got so much money,
why don't you give it to charity?

827
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,020
I'm nobody, you're a big shot.

828
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,272
Do I need to light some firecrackers
to send you on your way?

829
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,324
You kicked my foot,
and it really hurts!

830
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:29,993
Where's it hurt?

831
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,245
Let me rub it for you.

832
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,038
Stupid fatty!

833
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,289
Trying to cop a feel?!

834
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,166
Touch me again, and I'll cry rape!

835
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,210
Why are you so hot-headed?

836
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,878
Are you gonna leave?!

837
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,423
My foot hurts, so I can't walk...

838
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,384
Unless you carry me.

839
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,887
If a woman rides on your back,
it's three years of bad luck, though...

840
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,097
Count me out!

841
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,639
You won't carry me?

842
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,557
I'm not leaving, then!

843
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,351
I'll carry you... I'll carry you...

844
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,436
But I'm gonna carry you like a sow!

845
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,938
A real pain in the arse...

846
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,523
Easy come, but not easy go!

847
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,651
Come on, on my back!

848
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,379
It really hurts!

849
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,383
Don't worry, steady on!

850
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,426
[SPIRIT REVIVING MEDICINAL WINE]

851
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,555
This here's medicinal wine
passed down to me from my master.

852
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,056
Even if your bones are shattered to pieces,

853
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,600
drink half, rub on the rest,

854
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,143
you'll be right as rain!

855
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,853
My bones haven't shattered...

856
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,106
But... I got nudged hard in the chest.

857
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,399
Where? Let me have a look.

858
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,155
My master hasn't taught me about
this part of the body yet.

859
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,531
Apply it yourself on the bed.

860
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,040
What a pain...!

861
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,217
I'm not going tonight.

862
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,969
I'm gonna bunk with you.

863
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,359
Why was there a woman's voice?

864
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,319
Oh... I had too much to drink.

865
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,904
I've got a raspy throat, that's all.

866
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,865
Raspy throat?

867
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,495
Huh? Wha? W-What is it?

868
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,372
Mosquitoes. See?

869
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,332
Mosquitoes...? Mosquitoes...?

870
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,376
Are you gonna leave?

871
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,628
If you're not leaving, I'm leaving!

872
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,712
M... mosquitoes?

873
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,714
Gotta sleep even with mosquitoes!

874
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,137
Let's go out for another round!
My treat.

875
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,514
- There's more wine to drink?
- Yeah... yeah...

876
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,598
Oh! G-g-g-g-good!

877
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:57,641
Good... goo...

878
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,649
If there's wine to drink,
that's a different story...!

879
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,547
Stupid fatty,
you nudged my chest really hard.

880
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,965
You're really gonna get it
when you come back!

881
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,532
What are you doing?!

882
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,908
I'm your sister!

883
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,078
Hey, you're just someone
my old man adopted.

884
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,329
What's there to worry about?

885
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,082
Isn't this what they call,
"keeping it in the family"?

886
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:04,750
You!

887
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:33,987
Over here!

888
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,724
Scream?! Scream?!

889
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,144
Stop screaming!

890
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,316
You gonna keep making all that noise?!

891
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:12,818
All that noise?!

892
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,614
Scream...? Scream...!

893
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,407
You gonna keep screaming?!

894
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,450
You're done screaming, right?!

895
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,290
Gonna be quiet now, huh?

896
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,548
Ko Tai-Hoi?!

897
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,905
Dad?! Lam Sai-Wing ran off
with Ian-Sam earlier on!

898
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,992
I secretly tailed them,
and saw him take Ian-Sam back to his house.

899
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,494
I've come back to get help.

900
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,249
Lam Sai-Wing...
you beard the lion in his den!

901
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,208
We leave!

902
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,477
It's so dark in here...

903
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,105
The ill-tempered missy must've gone!

904
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:08,493
Head's spinning, eyes all fuzzy.
I should sleep.

905
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,370
Don't keep me up!

906
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,401
You don't listen,
no matter how many times I tell you!

907
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,861
You'd sleep here even if it'd kill you!

908
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,747
Hey! You better wake up now!

909
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,248
You're still playing dead?

910
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,458
Hey, wake up!

911
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,970
She really did die in here?

912
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,305
This ain't good.

913
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,556
How did this happen?

914
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,101
No, I should report it first.

915
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:20,774
Why are you all here?!

916
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,858
It's him!

917
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,282
Lam Sai-Wing, what gall you have!

918
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,118
How dare you lay a hand
on the daughter of Ko Ba-Tin?!

919
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,579
She's your daughter?!

920
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,961
Ian-Sam! Ian-Sam!

921
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,004
She's already dead!

922
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:44,923
You...!

923
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,674
It had nothing to do with me!

924
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,344
Dad, he's killed Ian-Sam!

925
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,304
H-h-h-h-hey! Watch your mouth!

926
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,597
I already said I didn't kill her!

927
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,724
If you didn't kill her, who did? Me?!

928
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,727
Ian-Sam...

929
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,521
Ian-Sam!

930
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,772
Ian Sam...!

931
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,649
You have blood on your hands.

932
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,359
How can you still deny it?!

933
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,486
I didn't do it,
so why should I confess?!

934
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,781
The price of murder...
is your own life!

935
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,669
Don't come any closer!

936
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,212
Whoever moves is whoever dies!

937
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,713
Ian-Sam!

938
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,554
Don't come any closer!

939
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:34,722
Unhand him!

940
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,392
If I'm willing to let him go,
are you willing to let me go?

941
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,060
Move it!

942
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,035
No need for pursuit!

943
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,330
We will take them at Po Chi Lam!

944
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,504
[PO CHI LAM]

945
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,756
Hmph! Tear it down!

946
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,382
Yes!

947
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,265
Strange Cat,
lie in wait for him at the entrance.

948
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,224
- Kill whoever comes out!
- Aye!

949
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,476
- We go out back!
- Aye!

950
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,527
Tell Wong Fei-Hung to come out!

951
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,361
Master is away.

952
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,362
Why are you looking for him?

953
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,656
He's looking for my master
to learn Hung Kuen, of course.

954
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,575
Aren't you a bit old to be
burning the midnight oil?

955
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,494
I want him to hand over Lam Sai-Wing!

956
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,455
Lam Sai-Wing hasn't come back!

957
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,998
Hmph! I don't believe it!

958
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:42,749
Search!

959
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,084
Hey, hold it!

960
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,921
Since when can you just waltz into
Po Chi Lam and rummage around?

961
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,214
Whoever moves, is whoever gets it!

962
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,302
Hand over Lam Sai-Wing,
or I'll tear Po Chi Lam to the ground!

963
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,054
If I said he hasn't come back,
he hasn't come back!

964
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,399
For tearing down Po Chi Lam's sign,
I'll take your lives!

965
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,428
Monkey's Heaven's Gate Staff?

966
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,178
Y-you...!

967
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,029
Knife up your sleeve?

968
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,027
Heh, your sleeve knife's only good for
fighting up close.

969
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,127
Keep my distance, attack from afar,
and your knife's useless!

970
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,350
You...!

971
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:15,456
Hold this!

972
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,628
He's torn down our sign?!

973
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,524
Lam Sai-Wing! You crawl out at last?!

974
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,486
Ko Ba-Tin... H-how dare you tear down...
Po Chi Lam's sign...?

975
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:32,658
I told Wong Fei-Hung before,
if his disciples caused any trouble,

976
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,493
I would tear down his sign.

977
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,371
You killed my goddaughter...

978
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,248
Both debts will be paid for now!

979
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,751
...didn't kill her!

980
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,880
Dad? They don't deserve any mercy.
Kill him!

981
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,308
Let me at 'em!

982
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:58,100
Let's go!

983
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,756
[LAM ANCESTRAL HALL]

984
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,563
Five Element Cinnabar Palm?!

985
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,942
I didn't kill anyone...

986
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,110
I didn't kill anyone!

987
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,654
You tore down Po Chi Lam's sign...

988
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,114
I'll take your lives!

989
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,453
Damn it... he really got me.

990
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,580
And I can't pay him back for it, either.

991
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,337
You two, hold him down.

992
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,340
If he socks me again,
I'll sock the two of you.

993
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,035
Will Wing be all right?

994
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,872
With me around, he's not gonna die.

995
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,127
With Po Chi Lam in such a state,

996
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,921
why aren't the two of you
out looking for your master?

997
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,384
In that case... we'll leave Wing
in your care, old sir.

998
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,117
What happened to me?

999
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:25,372
If I hadn't bathed you in medicine,
forcing your bruises out,

1000
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:28,667
the King of Hell would've taken you in
as his son-in-law ages ago.

1001
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,172
H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hey! Damn it!
What are you doing, huh?!

1002
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,590
I have to finish off Ko Ba-Tin!

1003
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:35,508
What are you doing?

1004
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,884
You wanna go streaking?

1005
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,394
Where are Foon and Seven?

1006
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:48,813
Keep your head.

1007
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,773
They've gone looking for your master.

1008
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,319
Po Chi Lam's sign's been torn down.

1009
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,696
I can't even look at Master right now.

1010
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,574
Y'know, your kung fu isn't bad at all.

1011
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,702
But your bridge hands
still aren't tough enough.

1012
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,665
Luckily, your life has been tough enough.

1013
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:15,506
The 12 Bridge Hands of Hung Gar
are a treasure of the martial arts world.

1014
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,883
Huh? Didn't your master teach them to you?

1015
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,218
Do you know 'em?

1016
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,138
A little here and there.

1017
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,222
You wanna learn?

1018
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,433
So I've got another master now?!

1019
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:27,351
Shut it!

1020
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,020
All this master and student stuff,
it's too old fashioned.

1021
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,398
How about you call me
Big Godbrother instead?

1022
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,567
R-r-right... right... Big Godbrother!

1023
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,904
Damn! Then doesn't that make me
a little bastard?!

1024
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:42,908
The 12 Bridge Hands of Hung Kuen.

1025
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:46,912

01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:52,877
Division Bridge.

1027
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:56,964
Steadfast Bridge.

1028
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:00,426
Inch Bridge.

1029
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,304
Straight Bridge.

1030

Flow Bridge.

1033
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,244
Resolution Bridge.

1034
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:02,863
Lift Bridge.

1035
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,123
Authority Bridge.

1036
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,589
You've got authority, but I'm a rebel.

1037
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,972
I might have a problem with authority,
but you don't have to lie in the dirt over it.

1038
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:33,894
Lam Sai-Wing...
let's see how far you've flown.

1039
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:34,728
Strange Cat!

1040
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:39,233
Dead or alive,
you will claw Lam Sai-Wing back to me!

1041
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,413
Oh... It's only a stupid cat.
You scared me to death.

1042
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,374
Hmm... you shouldn't be hiding
inside coffins.

1043
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,781
Huh? You're one of
Five Dragon Hall's goons.

1044
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:11,492
Maybe it's not your time,

1045
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,452
having escaped my fatal move:
The Phantom Cat Snares a Rat.

1046
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:14,912
Your mum's the rat!

1047
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,497
You killed one of Five Dragon Hall's own.

1048
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,999
Even if you hide in the depths of hell,
I'll claw you back out!

1049
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,813
Jumping around like that...

1050
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,189
It's about time you got smacked!

1051
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,734
Huh...? Oil?

1052
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,467
I'll beat you till
you're screaming like a cat in heat!

1053
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,801
Let's see where you jump to now!

1054
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:39,181
If you use Sticky Horse,
he won't be able to jump anymore.

1055
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,140
Sticky Horse?

1056
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,625
Ha! I haven't moved,
but you make a move on me?

1057
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,178
Wow! Why's your palm strength so powerful?

1058
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,431
That was nothing.

1059
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:05,017
I haven't even unleashed
my Iron Sand Palm yet.

1060
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,269
Iron Sand Palm?

1061
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,313
Hey, how about you teach it to me?

1062
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,026
Learning Iron Sand Palm
is really punishing.

1063
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,070
Gotta soak both your hands in vinegar,
then jab them in sand.

1064
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,989
It's too much for you.

1065
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,365
H-h-h-Hey!

01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,284

1067
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,994
They managed to find us even in this place.

1068
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,704
We gotta go somewhere else.

1069
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,122
Huh? H-hey! Hey! Hey!

1070
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:42,304

really live it up a bit.

1073
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,939
Today, I'll teach you something good,
a speciality of mine.

1074
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:53,982
Great! Great.

1075
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,942
What kind of wine is this?

1076
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,903
Hey, silly piggy.

1077
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,821
This here's vinegar.

1078
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:00,656
Vinegar?

1079
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,451
Learning Iron Sand Palm
is really punishing.

1080
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:07,162
Gotta soak both your hands in vinegar,
then jab them in sand.

1081
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:10,749
Oh... you gonna teach me Iron Sand Palm?

1082
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,794
C'mon now, you think learning
Iron Sand Palm is that easy?!

1083
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,754
Take this and marinate the pig's trotters!

1084
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,798
Hmm... Pig's trotters...?

1085
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,591
Ah! I know what to do!

1086
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,641
Aren't you supposed to
soak them after training?

1087
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,977
Shave off all the hairs
before you marinate.

1088
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,064
Shave off all the hairs?

1089
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:45,659
If you can't shave it clean,
burn it off with fire.

1090
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:49,037
Wha?! I've gotta burn it with fire, too?

1091
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:01,341
No wonder so few people...
know Iron Sand Palm.

1092
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,510
If you practise it...
you can't even grow any hair.

1093
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,973
Burn off the hair nice and clean,
then rub some salt into them.

1094
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,059
Wha?! I've still gotta...
rub them with salt?

1095
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,071
Rub harder!

1096
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,036
Then slice off the fingernails
with a knife.

1097
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,666
How do I slice them?

1098
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,049
When you're done slicing,
chop them into little pieces.

1099
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,311
Chop harder!

1100
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,979
You don't want them sticking together!

1101
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,815
Having them not stick together...

1102
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,275
It's not impossible, but...

1103
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,110
It's really hard!

1104
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,028
What's so hard?

1105
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,488
Let me show you how it's done.

1106
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:07,949
H-h-hey! What are you doing?

1107
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:08,867
Where are the trotters?

1108
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:10,702

1110

I wanna discuss with you.

It's too crowded here.

Let's go over there.

1125

Hey! Hey! There's so many people around,
don't try anything.

1128
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,543
This ring... how'd you get it?

1129
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,962
Well, one night... y'know?

1130
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,506
I was on my nightly patrol, right?

1131
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:49,676
I went past Lam Sai-Wing's house... and...

1132

1133
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:57,183
Here. Let's say I'm buying
the ring back from you with this money.

1134

If it's only enough for
scrounging in the dirt,

I've already got that much.

1136

Are you trying to take my chariot?

1141
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:19,748
Would you rather lose a chariot,
or do you want it to be checkmate?

1142
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:25,921
Even if I pay him off this time,
this guy'll just keep coming back for more.

01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:33,473
I hung up a new sign for Po Chi Lam today.

1233
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,850
Now Master won't scold me
when he gets back!

1234
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:40,104
Er... Little Godbrother,
don't get too happy yet.

1235
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:41,356
Look.

1236
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:54,827
Hoi, watch as your father avenges you!

1237
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,080
Lam Sai-Wing!

1238
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,999
Ko Ba-Tin, a good dog knows
not to block the road.

1239
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,626
What's the meaning of your mad barking?

1240
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,753
You caused the death of my goddaughter.

1241
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,381
And even killed my son.

1242
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,549
Today, I will have you make it even!

1243
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,384
Watch what you say!

1244
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,969
Your goddaughter
was actually killed by your own son!

1245
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:12,970
Bullshit!

1246
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:14,263
Huh? ll don't smell it!

1247
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:17,100
The revenge I took
for my little brother's death

1248
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:18,518
was fair in the eyes of heaven and earth!

1249
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:23,523
Then I invite you, one so virtuous,
to kill me as well!

1250
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:24,899
How could I kill you?

1251
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:26,192
You think you're a pig?

1252
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:30,988
Yeah! If you want a butcher
to slaughter pigs, it's gonna cost you!

1253
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,532
If you won't kill me...

1254
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:34,367
I will kill you!

1255
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:37,954
Gold Comes Full Circle

1256
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:49,632
Unleashing your Five Element Palm, huh?

1257
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,676
You must be itching for
the five elements of getting smacked.

1258
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:52,677
Hard Bridge!

1259
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,805
Leopard: Hard Form!

1260
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,349
Each blow is as strong as iron!

1261
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,745
Wood Needs to be Sharp!

1262
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:37,346
Soft Bridge!

1263
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:39,807
A snake tangled around a bundle:
Soft, Authority, Hard.

1264
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:41,684
Snake: Soft Form!

1265
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:28,648
Water Raises Waves!

1266
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:30,024
More like you're just raising your head!

1267
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,334
The water is up to your eyebrows now!

1268
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:00,846
A dragon has authority over water.

1269
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:04,392
Despatch Bridge!

1270
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:08,104
Dragon Form!

1271
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:17,822
My Black Dragon Swings its Tail
is really something, yeah?

1272
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:18,948
There's still my Earth Dragon!

1273
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:29,542
Heavenly Dragon!

1274
01:41:34,714 --> 01:41:35,673
Twin Dragons of Heaven and Earth!

1275
01:41:40,886 --> 01:41:43,264
Argh! My spine...!

1276
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:47,351
Watch out for his palms!

1277
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:49,478
Fire Brings the Wind...!

1278
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,414
Heh! Come up here
if you've got what it takes!

1279
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:30,728
Uh-oh! That was close.

1280
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,857
Don't worry, steady on.

1281
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:26,951
Crane: Spiritual Form!

1282
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,704
A crane forced into an inch,
its strength is chained together.

1283
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,055
Earth in Deadly Pursuit!

1284
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:15,750
Lam Sai-Wing, play with my son
down in hell!

1285
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:25,885
Put down the spirit tablet!

1286
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:26,677
No way!

1287
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:32,201
Godbrother, how are your hands?

1288
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,662
Oh, he's about the same as me.

1289
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:37,915
He can't exert any more power in his
Cinnabar Palm.

1290
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:44,755
Hey, you can break
his Five Element Palm now.

1291
01:45:44,964 --> 01:45:45,798
Five Element Palm?

1292
01:45:49,885 --> 01:45:51,720
To break the Five Element Palm,
seal the three parts of the arm.

1293
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,106
Opening seal:
Subdue the wrist with Inch Bridge.

1294
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,077
Second seal:
Attack the elbow with Hard Bridge.

1295
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:26,338
Second seal!

1296
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:35,055
Third seal is the shoulder!

1297
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,812
Bridge enters the third seal,
anything goes!

1298
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,808
Eh... Brother Fook-Sing, what a surprise.

1299
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,810
Fei-Hung, you're only back now?

1300
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:23,354
Show's over!

1301
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:27,232
Seven, help him up now!

1302
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:30,486
Wing!

1303
01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:34,448
Wing! Bringing me misfortune again!

1304
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:35,783
Someone tore down our sign, no?

1305
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,452
Uh... no. I've hung it back up now.

1306
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:39,286
Take a look...!

1307
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,998
Master, good stuff, huh?

1308
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:44,208
Hmph! Take a look!

1309
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:47,670
