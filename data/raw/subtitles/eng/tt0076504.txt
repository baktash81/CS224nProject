1
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,046
They are powerful and intelligent predators,

2
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:12,568
yet killer whales are, above all, families.

3
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:17,819
Families that hunt and play and travel together.

4
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:22,323
Take a look into the hidden lives of creatures

5
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:24,449
that rule like lords

6
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,760
over one of the richest
ocean wilds on earth.

7
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,758
The journey is an attempt to peer

8
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:13,993
with a camera into a hidden kingdom

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,026
of killer whales in the Pacific North West,

10
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,807
a long time goal of diver and
film-maker Theodore Pitcairn.

11
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,959
His destination is an area

12
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,524
inhabited by about 300 killer whales

13
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:32,645
in the straits between
the British Columbia mainland

14
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:34,646
and Vancouver Island.

15
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:52,372
Travelling to film the unseen the
events of ocean life is a kind of

16
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,151
continuing pilgrimage for Pitcairn.

17
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:02,890
I have come to appreciate that every

18
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,887
place in the ocean has its
own enchanting qualities.

19
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:10,826
Here we enter a world of cold beauty,
of ice, mist and fog.

20
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,315
We have come here not
only to film killer whales,

21
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:17,702
but the ocean wilds in which they live.

22
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,410
I am curious to learn
what makes this ocean

23
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:25,328
habitat so special that hundreds
of orcas congregate here.

24
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,071
To humans, the ocean here
is unbearably cold.

25
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,064
I must protect myself from
its sting by wearing

26
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,681
a drysuit that seals
out the frigid water.

27
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,308
Sometimes I can see only a few feet

28
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:47,294
away through the murk of
plankton and other particles.

29
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:52,045
Powerful currents often buffet me about.

30
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,732
These cold water winds blow constantly

31
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:58,483
through the kelp forests of the bottom

32
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,402
so that the realm of the killer whale

33
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:03,076
seems like a place invented by animators

34
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,638
who can make plants seem
like a troupe of dancers.

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,204
Amid the swirling cold currents, life abounds.

36
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,070
Everywhere I point the camera

37
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:47,730
there is something looking back at me.

38
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:51,865
Any shadowy corner can hold a surprise.

39
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:01,727
Curiosity is not limited to our species.

40
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,643
Sensing nothing either familiar or edible,

41
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,559
the octopus puts up his guard.

42
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:16,535
Which for the most intelligent

43
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,988
of all molluscs means transforming

44
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:22,104
its smooth body into a facade of menace.

45
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,708
I know from experience it is not likely

46
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,628
to attack something as large as me,

47
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,519
it's just trying to look as fierce as possible.

48
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,946
When I don't appear terrified,
it is time to leave.

49
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,269
For good measure, he appears to booby

50
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,658
trap my path with a sunflower star,

51
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,014
perhaps thinking that this predator,

52
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,919
feared by other bottom creatures,

53
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,061
will also intimidate me.

54
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:13,969
To avoid frightening the octopus,

55
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,625
Pitcairn moves off in
a different direction,

56
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,283
only to come upon another
strange creature.

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,028
It looks like a snake,

58
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,020
with the head of an old man.

59
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,529
Its name - the wolf eel - suggests

60
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:41,016
ferociousness and its powerful

61
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:43,301
jaws can crush spiny urchins.

62
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:51,780
But, like the octopus,

63
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,488
it's not inclined to attack a human.

64
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,325
The wolf-eel pair pay Pitcairn little notice,

65
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:11,965
preoccupied with courtship
and their version of nuzzling.

66
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,889
The dive is interrupted suddenly

67
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,030
by a reminder that Pitcairn is in

68
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,252
the home waters of killer whales,

69
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,719
which are often heard before they are seen.

70
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,096
Through the murk of this sea

71
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,781
they have detected my presence

72
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,726
and,at first, seem curious,

73
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,453
but one look and they are satisfied.

74
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:00,831
They return to the middle of the strait

75
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,835
and go on about their business.

76
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,272
Maybe they just prefer
their own company.

77
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,377
They are almost always
seen in groups

78
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,239
and rarely linger nearly a diver like me,

79
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,269
which makes it difficult to
observe their daily lives.

80
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,087
Maybe this group is moving

81
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,406
from one good fishing area to the next.

82
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,845
They are so skilful in hunting fish

83
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:31,500
that they seem to have ample time

84
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:34,686
simply to relax and to do very little at all.

85
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,817
Other creatures in the
killer whale realm below

86
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:50,810
must survive by eating organic

87
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,845
matter blowing by in
the endless currents.

88
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,171
Like this nudibranch -

89
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,391
a kind of snail without a shell.

90
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:02,571
Each invents its own way of
capturing morsels of food.

91
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,043
Sweeping the water with
its umbrella-like bonnet,

92
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,021
the hooded nudibranch
acts like a fisherman,

93
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:13,947
casting a net to catch passing plankton.

94
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,136
The sea pen simply stands in the current,

95
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:38,994
allowing bits of food to
lodge in its plume-like body.

96
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,992
The basket star, an animal that

97
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,458
looks like a small bush in winter,

98
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:55,117
snags passing food with it branches.

99
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,682
Barnacles scoop through the water

100
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,178
with their feathery back legs

101
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,571
and eat whatever they catch.

102
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:29,586
Sometimes the underwater
breezes deliver a windfall.

103
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:33,384
The jellyfish can rise
and descend by pulsing.

104
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:35,774
But its direction through the sea

105
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,983
is determined mostly by the currents.

106
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,413
Pretty as a flower, the tentacles

107
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:48,140
of the anemone are not only sticky

108
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:50,540
but armed with powerful stinging cells.

109
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,307
It's a sitting predator, awaiting whatever

110
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,588
the currents might send in its direction.

111
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:01,584
The jellyfish may have travelled

112
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,479
hundreds of miles to get here,

113
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,085
but once in the grasp of

114
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,742
the an anemone, its journey is over.

115
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:23,168
Killer whales are not the
only formidable creatures here,

116
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,404
but through size and intelligence,

117
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,834
they dominate this undersea world,

118
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:31,015
as strikingly as humans do the land.

119
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,344
To better understand them,

120
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,144
Pitcairn seeks out someone

121
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:41,868
who knows them intimately.

122
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:48,312
Biologist John Ford spends

123
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:49,938
his entire professional life

124
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,499
watching and pondering

125
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,460
the culture of killer whales or orcas.

126
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,743
He has done so since the early 70s,

127
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,468
like an anthropologist studying an ocean tribe.

128
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:04,722
Few know them as well,

129
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,242
or have made so many

130
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:08,616
discoveries about their way of life.

131
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,053
Day after day he observes,
records, photographs.

132
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,851
Accumulating over decades

133
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:28,273
a catalogue that identifies
not only individual whales,

134
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:30,780
but entire family trees.

135
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,571
The calls of the whales are
often loud enough to be

136
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,916
heard from the boat and
Ford has learned to pay

137
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,999
special attention to these sounds.

138
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:52,873
Studying underwater recordings,

139
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:56,402
Ford was among the first to
recognise that killer whales

140
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,883
communicate in dialects distinctive
to each family group or pod.

141
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,954
An individual's family heritage can be

142
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,871
determined from the unique calls it makes.

143
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,275
To catalogue the identity of every

144
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:21,495
individual whale he encounters,

145
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,550
Ford records distinguishing

146
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,370
characteristics and assigns

147
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,686
both names and numbers.

148
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,667
37 and 46 they are two brothers,

149
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,463
just swimming together,

150
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,686
just relaxing with a bellyful

151
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:47,821
of chum salmon and enjoying

152
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,478
themselves and enjoying this boat.

153
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,871
how close they want to get.

154
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:00,908
For all the years of observation,

155
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,306
researchers like Ford are
still baffled by a great

156
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,716
deal of killer whale behaviour.

157
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,897
The whale that was flipper
slapping and tail slapping

158
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:20,382
and following us along there was
A64, schooner, just a juvenile.

159
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,959
Not really sure what whales are
doing when they make those

160
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,570
kind of behaviours because it
depends on the context and

161
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,482
there is always kind of a curious
thing to me when all the rest

162
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,895
of the whales in the area are
just going about their business

163
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:39,900
and one individual like that one
seems agitated or worked up

164
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,372
about something and displays
these kind of things

165
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:45,281
over and over again for
sometimes hours at a time.

166
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:53,150
Because monitoring from a
boat is limited by weather,

167
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:56,948
Ford has installed a permanent
sound monitoring system.

168
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,585
Linked to a transmitter,
it broadcasts continuously

169
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:05,569
to his office the world's first
all killer whale radio station.

170
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:15,185
The live signal from the Robson Bight
area coming down to the Vancouver

171
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:22,125
aquarium here by a high-quality digital line,
so we are listening as if we were in our

172
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,346
little boat with a hydrophone at Robson Bight,

173
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,219
but instead we are down here

174
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:30,602
200 miles to the south, listening live.

175
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,609
This is actually a catalogue of the

176
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,435
calls that the whales make,

177
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:41,186
so we can match up the patterns this way.

178
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,392
So when it goes that

179
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:50,059
that is a N4 call.

180
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:53,713
Young animals that are
born into the pod learn

181
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,752
those unique family dialects.

182
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,500
Their vocal dialects represent

183
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,051
a kind of a family acoustic badge

184
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,987
that identify the pod and help to

185
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:07,271
keep the integrity and the

186
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,127
identity of the pod together.

187
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:20,939
My goal is to film them underwater

188
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,380
in their own fluid realm,

189
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,125
to try to convey how the
world looks and feels to them.

190
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,949
While they don't seem to like

191
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,452
swimming close to divers,

192
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,465
they often like to be near boats,

193
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:41,826
so we experiment with a camera

194
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,855
suspended on a pole, hoping

195
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,324
to get some close-up views

196
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,950
of these wary creatures.

197
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,991
We get a few tantalising glimpses

198
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,118
through the murk, but not
everything we hoped for.

199
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,301
We will have to find a location

200
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,526
where they are more at ease

201
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,937
and devise a way to place our

202
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,589
camera in their world without

203
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:40,880
attracting their attention and suspicion.

204
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,145
As the camera team deliberates

205
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,399
over how best to film killer whales,

206
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,486
an immense change is underway

207
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,049
in the kingdom the whales

208
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,989
rule beneath the surface.

209
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,836
Spring arrives in this world

210
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,511
of shadows and ghostly white anemones,

211
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,925
marked by the appearance of strange

212
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,191
matter adrift in the currents.

213
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,849
It's the stuff of life,

214
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:17,490
and it is everywhere.

215
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:24,987
A female sea cucumber prepares to launch

216
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,506
a bundle of eggs.

217
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,865
Nearby, a male has begun to eject sperm.

218
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,427
Conception among most
bottom dwellers occurs

219
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:46,195
not through intimacy with a mate,
but by blindly discharging

220
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:49,962
the elements of new life into
the passing currents.

221
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:56,388
The drifting eggs or sperm
of each individual will mix

222
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:00,150
with other reproductive cells
in a moment of fertilisation.

223
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,772
The ocean itself is the womb.

224
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,507
Throughout the coastal seas,

225
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:15,538
creatures of the ocean floor

226
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,239
cast the seeds of their next

227
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:20,024
generation into the liquid breezes.

228
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:28,231
Turning the ocean into a

229
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,637
soup of reproductive matter.

230
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,416
But a great percentage
of the spawn sent off by

231
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,551
creatures like the slime sea star,

232
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,487
is likely to be intercepted.

233
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,909
For hungry finish and filter feeders,

234
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:14,418
the seeds of new life are
just another kind of food

235
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,957
to pluck from the currents.

236
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,018
The killer whales are mostly just observers

237
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,398
their world explodes each March

238
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,538
with a rush of predators.

239
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,509
Dolphins, harbour seal

240
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,960
seabirds and sea lions

241
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,215
all attracted to a massive spawning

242
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:56,872
event that overshadows

243
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,933
those of the bottom dwellers.

244
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,618
Tens of millions of herring
stream from the open

245
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:07,401
Pacific toward the British
Columbia shoreline to spawn.

246
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:10,929
To get there they must make

247
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:13,143
it through a gauntlet of carnivores.

248
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,801
Panicked by the appearance of predators,

249
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:31,581
each fish seeks safety in
the middle of the school,

250
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:34,691
producing what looks like
a giant silver organism,

251
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,617
trying desperately to find a safe
path to its spawning grounds.

252
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,227
I encounter so many things

253
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,290
in the sea that could not occur on land.

254
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,479
In the dense embrace of water,

255
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,190
a thousand weightless creatures

256
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:54,231
whirl and dart side-by-side
like an artwork come to life.

257
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,428
I drift beneath it, mesmerised.

258
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,072
The local people call it simply a fish ball,

259
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:05,619
belying the elegant symmetry

260
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,646
and beauty of what I see down here.

261
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,929
The relentless attacks by birds,

262
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,850
sea mammals and larger fish continue,

263
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:17,116
but the herring are unable
to turn seaward and flee.

264
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:21,557
Programmed by their genes to spawn,

265
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,241
they have no alternative

266
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,806
but to push onward to the shallows.

267
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,180
The assault from above escalates.

268
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:30,621
In these shallow waters

269
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:32,525
there is no place to hide.

270
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:35,351
Gulls wait at the surface,

271
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:37,321
murres and cormorants dive

272
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:39,919
deep enough to strike from
the sides and below.

273
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,226
For a time, the annual herring

274
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,567
frenzy so dominates life along the coast,

275
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,423
that it attracts even migratory

276
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,133
grey whales into the
realm of the killer whales.

277
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:53,521
Among the patches of seafoam

278
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:56,090
fringing the shore, another kind of white

279
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,674
phenomenon appears signalling

280
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,278
that throngs of male herrings

281
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:01,966
have begun to disperse their

282
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,278
sperm into the sea.

283
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,083
In places the shallows turn milk white.

284
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,316
The release of these clouds of sperm

285
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,686
or milt triggers a reproductive frenzy.

286
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:22,341
The females try to press their eggs

287
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:23,803
into the milt deposited by

288
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,252
the males on the bottom.

289
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,687
All the while, the milt drifts upward

290
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:32,092
in such volume that vision becomes difficult.

291
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,185
A single female can produce 25,000 eggs

292
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,969
the result is an undersea blizzard

293
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:51,001
of almost incomprehensible proportions.

294
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,055
Sticky white herring
eggs encrust virtually

295
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:57,968
every surface of the shallows,

296
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,489
from eel-grass and rocks

297
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,425
to crab shells.

298
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:05,457
Nearly all of the eggs will be

299
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,225
lost to predators and the whims of the sea.

300
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,428
But if only one in every 5000

301
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:13,737
produces an adult,

302
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:16,613
the herring population will be sustained.

303
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,240
For gulls, the appearance of

304
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,488
herring means a season of plenty.

305
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:27,862
Each receding tide uncovers a feast of eggs.

306
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:32,628
There is such a profusion of nourishment,

307
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,262
that the grey whales come all

308
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,832
the way into the shallows to partake.

309
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:46,099
Raking the eel-grass
with its baleen plates,

310
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:48,679
one of the largest creatures in the sea

311
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:52,617
feeds on eggs the
size of bird seed.

312
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,587
Though most of the herring

313
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:07,962
return to deeper waters,

314
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,523
some die of wounds or stress.

315
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,339
The sunflower star takes

316
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:17,268
care of those left behind.

317
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,567
Oddities appear under water

318
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,097
during the herring spawning.

319
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:33,564
A hemlock tree seems to grow

320
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:34,939
from the bottom of the sea.

321
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:41,114
Observing the annual herring

322
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,521
feast over centuries,

323
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,473
native peoples sought ways

324
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,724
of exploiting it for human food.

325
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,366
They discovered that spawning

326
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:51,627
herring were attracted to

327
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,236
hemlock for some reason.

328
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,380
Along the west coast of Vancouver Island,

329
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:01,022
the Hesquiat tribe still harvests eggs

330
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:03,538
deposited on the hemlock branches

331
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,817
they set up early each Spring in

332
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,426
advance of the spawning.

333
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,598
Like their ancestors,

334
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,929
present-day Hesquiats treasure

335
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,039
the herring caviar as a delicacy.

336
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:21,215
Their harvest is purely
for tribal consumption.

337
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,430
But a taste for herring eggs

338
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,847
is not limited to native people here.

339
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,409
In another cove, spawning herring

340
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:38,966
pass among kelp fronds

341
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:40,868
strung artificially on lines.

342
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,241
The Ahousaht and Toquat

343
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,676
peoples of Vancouver Island

344
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:47,504
have modified their traditional

345
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,442
herring harvests to take advantage

346
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:50,942
of the great demand for

347
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:52,743
herring eggs elsewhere.

348
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:56,449
In Japan, herring roe is a

349
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:59,644
delicacy that commands high prices.

350
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:04,286
The tribes and some non

351
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,944
native fishermen as well,

352
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,305
catch schools of herring

353
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,569
using fishing nets,

354
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:12,216
then transfer them into netted enclosures

355
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,353
where they spawn on the kelp fronds.

356
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,727
The captive herring school attracts

357
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:33,737
nonhuman harvesters as well.

358
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,592
River otters descend from nearby

359
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:39,267
streams to fill their bellies with herring.

360
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,543
Working under commercial licences,

361
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:04,590
each year the two native tribes can

362
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,777
each collect as much as
40 tonnes of eggs on kelp.

363
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,248
What is merely food for otters

364
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,380
is big business for humans.

365
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,294
Such commercial harvests

366
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,779
can be worth millions of dollars.

367
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:35,365
Egg-laden kelp fronds are salted,

368
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:38,125
packed and shipped by air to Japan today.

369
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,827
Though the industry arose in the 1970s,

370
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,149
such trading actually began a century ago,

371
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,876
when Japanese entrepreneurs obtained

372
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:50,311
herring eggs from tribes father north

373
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:52,093
along the coast and sailed with

374
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,407
them all away across the Pacific.

375
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,366
Yet the commercialism is mixed

376
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,740
with an ancient respect

377
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,272
for the cycles of nature.

378
00:30:04,455 --> 00:30:05,345
When the harvest ends,

379
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:08,438
the nets walling the inclusion are opened,

380
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:09,999
permitting the herring to escape

381
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:11,860
in the hope they will return

382
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:14,211
and spawn again next spring.

383
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:18,939
Though killer whales nibble

384
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:20,155
at the spawning schools,

385
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:23,381
herring make up less than 5% of their diet.

386
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:28,328
They are awaiting a spawning

387
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,284
event still to come that will bring

388
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,400
their favourite prey into these waters.

389
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:41,391
Yet as the killer whales mark time,

390
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,143
the greatest exploitation

391
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,443
of the herring is about to begin.

392
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,784
It dwarfs the hunting by ocean animals

393
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:53,939
and the harvesting by natives

394
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,738
and Vancouver Island Harbours

395
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,557
commercial fishing boats await

396
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,849
the start of a different kind of herring frenzy.

397
00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:16,004
The opening of the herring season

398
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:18,662
is the beginning of an ocean goldrush.

399
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:20,285
To prevent overfishing,

400
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,411
authorities stringently limit

401
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,955
the commercial herring season,

402
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:26,524
often to only a single daily each year.

403
00:31:27,963 --> 00:31:30,189
Sometimes to only one hour.

404
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:32,349
One hour in which many fishermen

405
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:34,081
must haul-in most of their fishing

406
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,064
income for the entire year.

407
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,616
So valuable is the fishery that luck

408
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:42,161
can bring boat owners a near-

409
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,100
fortune in a day and failure

410
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,434
can mean bankruptcy.

411
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,816
It's a high-stakes drama in

412
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,817
which not a second can be lost.

413
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,225
After racing to find a

414
00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:10,628
school using sonar,

415
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:12,520
they must quickly encircle it

416
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:13,663
with the same net,

417
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,911
then draw the net tight,

418
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,194
often catching more than herring.

419
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,634
Making money on herring
requires spending it.

420
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,831
A seiner and its complement of equipment

421
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:58,490
can cost a million and a half dollars.

422
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:05,920
But, depending on luck and skill,

423
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,079
in their brief window of opportunity,

424
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,662
they may pull in anywhere

425
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,578
from 20 to 200 tonnes of herring.

426
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:17,612
The only market is Japan,

427
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,131
and prices fluctuate with

428
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:20,444
the Japanese economy.

429
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:25,695
There have been years

430
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:27,261
when the catch of a single boat

431
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,308
brought in a quarter of million dollars.

432
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,543
An unintended catch of large

433
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,217
mammals can mean damaged

434
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,011
nets and panicked animals.

435
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,430
The fishermen give the sea lions

436
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:58,510
every opportunity to escape.

437
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,093
And one by one, they all do.

438
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:15,096
Herring return to the same

439
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:17,157
waters each years to spawn.

440
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:18,785
If too many are caught,

441
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,045
those waters will be

442
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:21,858
barren in future years.

443
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:23,729
Already, some areas no

444
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,356
longer support a fishery

445
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:26,749
and there are debates over

446
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,386
whether the herring population

447
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:31,094
is being jeopardised by too much fishing.

448
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,545
So intense is the rush to haul in fish,

449
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,004
captains can imperil both their boats

450
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,763
and crews by overloading.

451
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:02,907
Even large vessels can be

452
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:06,236
overturned by 200 tonnes of fish in their net.

453
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,483
The catch of herring for their eggs

454
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:16,998
is one of the main drivers

455
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:19,717
of British Colombia's fishing economy.

456
00:35:20,156 --> 00:35:21,312
But unlike the harvest by

457
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,154
marine animals and native tribes,

458
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,517
no herring survive to return to the sea.

459
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,021
The eggs will be taken from dead

460
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:31,154
females for sale to Japan.

461
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,313
The tonnes of remaining herring carcasses

462
00:35:35,453 --> 00:35:37,455
will be sold not as human food,

463
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:40,875
but for the most part, as fertiliser.

464
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,748
As Spring turns to summer,

465
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,304
the flood of life awaited

466
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,396
by the killer whales approaches
from the open sea.

467
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:03,290
Salmon by the millions in wave after wave.

468
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,898
The killer whales residing along

469
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:13,499
this coast prefer salmon

470
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:14,781
above all other foods.

471
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,337
To catch them, pod-members

472
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,565
spread out and comb the area.

473
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:26,232
They send out sonar like high
frequency clicks that echo off

474
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:27,681
objects in the sea,

475
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:32,418
giving them an acoustic means of detecting

476
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,791
their prey through murky waters.

477
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,683
Through summer and into Fall,

478
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,194
those salmon that survive seek out

479
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,809
their natal streams and
begin a difficult journey

480
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,584
against currents and rapids.

481
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,829
Having survived killer whales,

482
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,202
they now meet a terrestrial equivalent.

483
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:25,039
But survival is not their purpose.

484
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,585
After spawning, all the salmon will die.

485
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,087
Adult grizzlies and their cubs shun

486
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,773
the dead fish in search of those still alive.

487
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:44,484
In the meantime,

488
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,182
they snack on the salmon eggs

489
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:47,376
that are in the bottom.

490
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:54,983
When more salmon arrived,

491
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:57,118
the bears feast relentlessly.

492
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,496
Grizzlies face a deadline
as fall approaches.

493
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,607
To survive the long sleep of winter,

494
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:05,946
they must pack on
as much fat as possible.

495
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,553
Some gain 300 pounds or more

496
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,178
most of the weight coming

497
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:24,635
from long days of eating salmon.

498
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:31,794
It can be both filling,
and exhausting.

499
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,864
For John Ford, salmon season

500
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,646
provides an opportunity to learn

501
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,679
more about killer whale feeding

502
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:44,303
techniques and preferences.

503
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,371
An experienced eye sees

504
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,075
a capture in a quick lunge.

505
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:51,622
Time has shown that the
killer whales hunt all six

506
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,077
of the salmon species found here.

507
00:38:57,889 --> 00:38:59,981
It looked to me like a chum,
about the right size.

508
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:06,578
And it was quite a prolonged
chase there, huh?

509
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,880
We saw them take a chum salmon,

510
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,413
very likely there is
a big run of chum

511
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:18,900
salmon coming through

512
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:21,334
this strait today and we managed

513
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,629
to get a scale sample from that kill.

514
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,182
And we will be able to identify

515
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:33,680
what species it is from the

516
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,943
unique quality of the scale.

517
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,068
As if from nowhere,

518
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,695
a pack of white-sided
dolphins appears,

519
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,669
interrupting the
killer whale hunt.

520
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,641
The dolphins rocket about,

521
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:58,877
bothering the whales

522
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,086
like a gang of rowdy youngsters.

523
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:04,296
It's an odd mingling

524
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:05,690
of two marine mammals.

525
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:07,687
But Ford sees it often.

526
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:10,438
Those dolphins like to pester the whales.

527
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,094
We see them doing it to
humpback whales, as well.

528
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,620
Where they will chase them
around and smack them with

529
00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:24,914
their tails and just generally
be kind of pesky,

530
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:26,121
for whatever reason.

531
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,313
Suddenly, and inexplicably,

532
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,579
the dolphin pack disappears.

533
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:44,507
Other sea mammals in the

534
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:46,541
vicinity seem to be on alert,

535
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,073
as if some kind of menace approaches.

536
00:40:58,188 --> 00:40:59,370
The menace is real,

537
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:02,433
a pack of aggressive
killer whales passes through,

538
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,541
driving harbour seals ashore

539
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:08,781
More nomadic than the resident
whales of the region

540
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:11,129
and travelling in smaller families,

541
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,179
these transients also prefer

542
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:16,502
the meat of sea lions
and dolphins to fish.

543
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:22,406
Distinguished by tall,
pointed dorsal fins,

544
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:24,219
these mammal eaters don't seem

545
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:26,615
to mingle with their
fish-eating cousins.

546
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,514
Evidence of the often violent

547
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:36,764
ways of transients can be graphic.

548
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:38,810
Biologist Cathy Heisey

549
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,454
examines the body of
a dead dolphin found

550
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:43,125
at sea by a boater.

551
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,625
Like the pack that interrupted the hunt,

552
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,723
it is a white-sided dolphin.

553
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:51,513
I can tell you for certain that

554
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:53,077
it was killed by a killer whale

555
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,686
just judging by the teeth rake

556
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,015
marks on its body.

557
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:59,234
And whether it was killed
by transient killer whales

558
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:01,952
or resident killer whales
I can't tell you, but my guess

559
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,943
is that it is transients,
because they are the only

560
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:07,156
ones that we have seen
fatally attacking animals,

561
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:09,889
and what is surprising to
me is that they didn't eat

562
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:14,254
it because they obviously
injured it and perhaps

563
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,577
played with it even for a
while after they killed it

564
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:21,040
just judging by the different
types of rake marks that are on its body

565
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,889
they are all different angles
and are all quite deep.

566
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,940
Until the early 1970s,

567
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:38,131
the realm of killer whales

568
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,990
in British Colombia lay mostly

569
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,437
beyond the interests of humanity.

570
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:45,600
But the curiosity of scientists

571
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,986
and film-makers has since fuelled a

572
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:49,411
popular fascination with

573
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,039
these intelligent creatures.

574
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:55,718
People come from around the world,

575
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:59,392
hoping to catch a glimpse of wild orcas.

576
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:05,703
Identification catalogues enable

577
00:43:05,862 --> 00:43:07,360
them to learn the name and family

578
00:43:07,486 --> 00:43:09,019
history of the creatures they watch.

579
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:13,922
Some learn for the first time that

580
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,582
the swimmers before them are

581
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:18,376
travelling families whose social relationships

582
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,640
are among the most complex

583
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,547
of any mammals on earth.

584
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:28,789
A family like this is led by a mother

585
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,643
and all of her young will remain

586
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,568
with her as long as she lives.

587
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,615
Approaching the boat is

588
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,227
not just a juvenile whale

589
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:48,815
it's someone's daughter,
sister, granddaughter.

590
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,346
But no matter how close observers get,

591
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:15,785
they see only that tiny fraction of

592
00:44:15,924 --> 00:44:17,630
the killer  whales existence that

593
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:20,378
takes place in our world of air.

594
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:40,222
Pitcairn and his friends have
devised a plan to peer,

595
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,524
at least briefly into the hidden
part of killer whale existence,

596
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:48,004
by going where other visitors cannot.

597
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:00,565
In these undisturbed waters,

598
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,114
we come upon a family bound

599
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:03,130
somewhere through the

600
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:04,704
morning mist and cold.

601
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:06,351
For a moment they don't seem

602
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,723
like mighty predators

603
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,145
just a family on a lonely journey.

604
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:35,667
Pitcairns destination
appears unremarkable.

605
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:38,564
A beach covered by a bed of smooth

606
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:40,900
pebbles that extends out into the shallows.

607
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:45,920
But, in fact, it is a special place where

608
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:48,816
killer whales may let down their guard.

609
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:54,640
In hopes of capturing a few moments of

610
00:45:54,812 --> 00:45:56,294
killer whale behaviour here,

611
00:45:56,642 --> 00:45:59,481
the team arrives with an
arsenal of equipment.

612
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:15,509
Pitcairn and his team have secured

613
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:17,384
special permission to film in this

614
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:20,158
ecological reserve a whale sanctuary

615
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,700
off-limits to whale watchers.

616
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:26,309
To avoid disturbing the whales,

617
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,232
no diver will enter the water,

618
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,623
only a remotely controlled camera.

619
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:33,596
The underwater cameraman

620
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:35,200
must learn to practise his craft

621
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,263
sitting on dry land before a

622
00:46:37,386 --> 00:46:39,109
miniature steering wheel.

623
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:43,797
The team will set up camp,

624
00:46:43,983 --> 00:46:46,420
then wait to see if any whales show up.

625
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:52,309
As they prepare, killer whales sounds

626
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,535
arise just offshore - an auspicious sign.

627
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:02,797
They toss a hydrophone into the water.

628
00:47:07,484 --> 00:47:09,450
Pitcairn's worry is that the effort

629
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,500
will turn out to be a waste of time.

630
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:14,264
This is his second attempt.

631
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:17,913
The previous year,

632
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:19,326
the team waited three weeks

633
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:20,987
and no whales ever showed up.

634
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:32,608
Every precaution has been taken

635
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,008
to avoid disrupting killer whale behaviour,

636
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:36,922
but there is no way to know

637
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,423
if the wary animals will shy away,

638
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:41,638
even from an untended camera.

639
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:51,512
The wait begins.

640
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,193
On only the second day,

641
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,872
they sight a killer whale family,

642
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,628
rounding the point headed toward them.

643
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:29,414
The underwater microphones

644
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:30,954
pick up the raspy sound of a

645
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,953
whale scraping against the bottom.

646
00:48:34,797 --> 00:48:36,656
The area is called a rubbing beach

647
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,403
because killer whales frequently

648
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:40,182
seek it out to rub their bodies

649
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:41,904
against the bed of pebbles.

650
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,806
No one is sure why.

651
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,617
Their markings show them

652
00:48:47,735 --> 00:48:48,850
to be a family well-known

653
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:50,275
to scientists in the area.

654
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:54,806
A 52-year-old matriarch named Stripe,

655
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,366
her three children and a grandson.

656
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,475
The tallest fin belongs to

657
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:04,056
her 28 year old son Okey-solo

658
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:06,799
the most enthusiastic among them

659
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:08,433
when it comes to rubbing.

660
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,643
Her 18-year-old daughter Ripple

661
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:22,821
has a two year old son of her own,

662
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:25,742
Midsummer, who seems reluctant to rub,

663
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:28,884
but follows his mother

664
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,132
when she makes a pass across the bottom.

665
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,663
Children at play,

666
00:49:48,008 --> 00:49:50,223
adults enjoying a relaxing swim,

667
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,308
it seems the undersea equivalent

668
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,497
of a family day at the beach.

669
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,245
Though Stripe also rubs occasionally,

670
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,086
the matriarch stays close to be her

671
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:31,946
grandson and youngest son,

672
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,600
seven year old Fife.

673
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:36,678
Stripe knows how quickly
tragedy can strike.

674
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:41,057
Over the years, she has
lost three of her young:

675
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,636
One captured for a marine park,

676
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,139
one struck by a ferry,

677
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:48,743
one to unknown causes.

678
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,747
Little Midsummer continues

679
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:57,085
to frolic of the beach,

680
00:50:57,274 --> 00:50:59,584
but he won't dare descend
to rub the bottom.

681
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:13,872
His uncle, on the other hand,
can't get enough.

682
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:16,176
An adult male like Okey-solo

683
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:18,143
may have fathered young of his own,

684
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:21,897
but they remain with their
mothers in other family groups.

685
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:36,618
Okey-solo will not leave his

686
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:38,146
own mother all of her life.

687
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:45,741
Some males simply disappear

688
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,175
when their mother dies.

689
00:51:52,244 --> 00:51:53,568
No killer whales in the world,

690
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,951
other than the 200 living around northern

691
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:59,196
Vancouver Island, are known to rub like this.

692
00:52:19,545 --> 00:52:21,914
We are as puzzled as other observers

693
00:52:22,492 --> 00:52:23,617
why do they rub?

694
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:29,194
Some believe it is a way of
scraping away parasites.

695
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:33,247
But if so, wouldn't killer whales

696
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:35,082
elsewhere do the same thing?

697
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:38,281
Perhaps we try too hard to find

698
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,737
practical explanations for

699
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,047
behaviour in the wild.

700
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,309
Maybe the killer whale families here

701
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:49,172
have simply found a way to have fun,

702
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:50,622
something that just feels good.

703
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:55,609
And across generations

704
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:57,406
they have passed on
this little tradition

705
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,061
of pleasure and the whereabouts

706
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,559
of these pebble beaches.

707
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:05,265
It's their secret.

708
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:13,611
And we are peeking into the place

709
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:15,200
in their world where they can

710
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:17,312
escape the labours
of daily survival

711
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,998
for an occasional hour
of amusement.

712
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,706
As the others watch from offshore

713
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:47,926
Okey-solo returns for one last rub

714
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:07,000
Perhaps inspired by his uncle,

715
00:54:07,473 --> 00:54:09,344
little Midsummer finally descends

716
00:54:09,598 --> 00:54:12,185
for his first pass over the pebbles,

717
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:15,438
rubbing and blowing bubbles
at the same time.

718
00:54:31,997 --> 00:54:34,364
Watching their last pass
across the stones,

719
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:35,859
I am reminded yet again,

720
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:38,177
hat we can't really comprehend

721
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:40,869
the minds of creatures
who dwell in a liquid world,

722
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:42,557
so different from our own.

723
00:54:44,768 --> 00:54:46,018
And yet we share with them,

724
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:47,323
the concerns of parenthood

725
00:54:47,683 --> 00:54:49,141
and the devotion to family

726
00:54:50,202 --> 00:54:52,091
and maybe also a need for sheer fun.

727
00:54:53,279 --> 00:54:54,956
At least that's what
I would like to believe.

728
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,704
It is one thing to observe

729
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,372
anonymous animals in the wild,

730
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,119
quite another to know them by name,

731
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:04,891
to know their ways of relaxing,

732
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:07,997
to know even their family tragedies.

733
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:12,862
As they leave,
they no longer seem

734
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,268
to us strangers in an alien realm,

735
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,748
but a family, heading home from

736
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:20,246
the diversions of a
summer afternoon.
