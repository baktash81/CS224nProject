1
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,721
Asking someone
why they love to fly

2
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,957
is almost like asking someone

3
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,392
why they like Picasso.

4
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,928
The beauty is the tact
that you can't really describe it.

5
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,693
It's something you have to behold.

6
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,068
Flying takes you
into another dimension-literally.

7
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,699
As ground-based people,
we walk this way, we drive that way.

8
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,204
But in the airplane, we go this way.

9
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,076
And we add an entire dimension.

10
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,206
We see, feel,
and experience things

11
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,616
that people who don't fly
will never know.

12
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,252
And yet, here, at Van Nuys Airport
and other airports like it,

13
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:44,255
the price of admission
is an interest in aviation.

14
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,224
If you like airplanes,
and you like to fly,

15
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:49,061
you're welcome here
nothing else counts.

16
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,265
My mother would take me
out to the airport

17
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:58,036
and park in a viewing area
and watch airplanes.

18
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,871
And as a little kid,

19
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,174
just stand with my hands
up against that fence,

20
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,310
and looking out,
watching the planes,

21
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,747
and nagging my mother
to let me go up in an airplane.

22
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,116
My mom used to say
that when I was a little baby,

23
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,284
my dad would be holding me
and I'd see an airplane and say,

24
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,083
"Airplane!"

25
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,485
It was kinda like, you know...
We're going to do this now.

26
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,293
I think I started thinking
about flying

27
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,795
when I was a young child.

28
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,060
I used to dream about it
all the time.

29
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,502
When I grew up,
I had a lot of dreams,

30
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,304
like, dreams of flying
that I could just fly.

31
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:36,307
As a little kid, I just always knew
that was something I wanted to do,

32
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:39,310
whether I became a bird somehow

33
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,680
and that was just the closest thing
to being a bird.

34
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,549
I know I compared
with Desiree a little bit.

35
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,917
I had a barn out in the back.

36
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,819
And I used to jump off the barn
with my brother,

37
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,622
the same thing she used to do,
thinking, "Oh, yeah!"

38
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,223
You can fly a little bit
off the barn."

39
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:56,327
Soaring with my hands out,
building the little crates

40
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,298
with the wings on them,
trying to imagine myself flying.

41
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,633
Thought, wouldn't it be nice

42
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,796
to be up there, all alone
in an airplane...

43
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,336
Doing what I want to do,

44
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:06,801
see what I want to see?

45
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,307
And that's what prompted me.

46
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:15,137
There're some feelings about flying
that dety description.

47
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:19,811
Only the best poets in the world
can probably do that properly

48
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:25,654
Robert Louis Stevenson's verse
of poems for children said...

49
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:30,659
<i>How I love to go up in a swing,
Up in the air so high.</i>

50
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,628
<i>It is the loveliest thing
that ever a child could do.</i>

51
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:39,204
<i>Up in the air and over the sky,
so I can see so wide,</i>

52
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,836
<i>Rivers and trees and valleys,
all over the countryside.</i>

53
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,389
Oh, my parents sent me
to my grandparents back East.

54
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,892
And during this flight
I looked out at the wings.

55
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,796
I knew they kept the airplane in the air,
but they weren't doing anything.

56
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,064
They weren't moving.

57
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,399
And, I couldn't understand
how that happened.

58
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,236
All this iron around me
was being suspended.

59
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,238
And, when I got
to my little hometown

60
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,405
in New Jersey,

61
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,574
I went to the library
and I began reading

62
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,910
about aerodynamics
and aeronautics.

63
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,311
And it seemed so intriguing

64
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,647
that I couldn't wait
until I got back home.

65
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,583
And I'd go to the local airport,
and my first airplane ride

66
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:29,087
was literally hitchhiking this way
instead of that way.

67
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,656
Many people think the local airport,

68
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,425
the <i>local</i> airport...
Which may be some distance away,

69
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,427
is the one in which
there's airline service

70
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,096
or commuter service.

71
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,433
And yet, in this country,
there are less than 600 airports

72
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,602
with any air-carrier service.

73
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:49,941
There are 17,000 landing facilities
for General Aviation airplanes,

74
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,411
helicopters and seaplanes.

75
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,779
I wish I'd been around
when they invented these

76
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,683
two most misunderstood words:
General Aviation.

77
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,018
What in the world does that mean?

78
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,453
From the jets that you see
flying in and out of here,

79
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:05,857
to the people that fly
for the tire department

80
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,792
and the police department,
to the little airplanes...

81
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:10,319
That's all considered
General Aviation.

82
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,698
The General Aviation airport
it's where you can park an airplane.

83
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,068
You can learn to fly,
without having to be concerned

84
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,204
too much
about the scheduled aircraft

85
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,371
or the commercial aircraft.

86
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,707
The small general aviation airplane,

87
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,211
those powered by piston engines
and twirling propellers,

88
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,080
is the fundamental basis
for all of aviation.

89
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,015
It's the bedrock.
It's the foundation.

90
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:34,782
Without it, the entire infrastructure
of aviation collapses.

91
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,822
We have to have little airplanes
to get to the big airplanes.

92
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,992
Everybody driving a big airplane
started in a little airplane.

93
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,494
<i>SpiritJet One-Twenty-Four,
keep it climbin' to four-thousand</i>

94
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,054
<i>and contact Departure now, g'day.</i>

95
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,861
<i>Up to four-thousand, we'll see ya,
Spirit-One-Twenty-Four.</i>

96
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,836
But the problem that the United States
faces with airports today,

97
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,464
is that too many of them
are closing,

98
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,940
and once an airport's closed,
that's the end.

99
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,909
You can never reopen it.

100
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,708
Because the land is recycled
into some other use.

101
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,848
Airports are not being replaced,
and as we lose them,

102
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,251
we're losing centers of commerce,
centers of recreation.

103
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,317
All kinds of things happen
at airports that we suddenly lose.

104
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,326
I know that airports
are never popular in a community,

105
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,428
particularly in a residential area.

106
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,496
They're almost like NASA
in that regard.

107
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,934
Nobody had any respect for NASA
until they got a PR man

108
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,302
to tell people what they were doing.

109
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,001
You've got to explain to them
what you're all about,

110
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,508
why the airplanes make noise.

111
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,505
How much money
is the airport generating?

112
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,547
What's good about the airport?

113
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,216
And then, when they find out

114
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,657
what's really good
about the airport,

115
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,520
they'll partner with you.

116
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,555
<i>Van Nuys Airport'
Information Mike...</i>

117
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,285
<i>Two-three-flve-zero Zulu weather.</i>

118
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,518
<i>Wind, two-five-zero at nine.
Visibility one-zero.</i>

119
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,865
Well, Van Nuys is unique
because it's the world's

120
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,925
busiest General Aviation airport.

121
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,803
Controls more traffic,
has more activity

122
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,572
than any other
General Aviation airport

123
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,041
anywhere in world.

124
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,576
As a matter of fact,
it's busier than London Heathrow.

125
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,179
It's busier than any airport
Europe can throw at us,

126
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,705
or the Orient, for that matter.

127
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,584
It is true, that we do have
one take off and landing

128
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,920
about every forty-five seconds
during the day.

129
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,923
And we probably have
the world's greatest controllers.

130
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,552
At this airport,
you can be working 30 airplanes,

131
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,059
and it's a huge mix.

132
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,931
Everything from Piper Cubs
to MD-80s,

133
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,833
and you're working them
at the same time.

134
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,834
It's a little town.

135
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,063
And we have everything
that a little town should have-

136
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:36,404
police department,
the engineering department.

137
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,910
We're the largest employer
in the Valley.

138
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,779
We hire more people and pay
more people on this airport,

139
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,449
than any other industry
in the Valley.

140
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,384
When I think
about Van Nuys airport,

141
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,121
I think about
the historic significance

142
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,123
of that airport.

143
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,292
It's famous-One Six Right.

144
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,928
When you see those numbers,
and you hear the controller say,

145
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,629
"You're clear to land,
One Six Right,"

146
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,131
you know you're home.

147
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,998
You're at the greatest airport.

148
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,143
What's incredible about this airport
is what's behind the closed doors.

149
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,341
You know, what you see
when you open the doors.

150
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,150
The Van Nuys Airport
is very special

151
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,610
because of the diversity
of the airplanes here.

152
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,621
World War ll airplanes, warbirds,

153
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,961
privately owned, you know
P-51s and biplanes, Pitts.

154
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,030
Just all kinds
of different airplanes

155
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,031
flying on the weekend.

156
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:40,004
Most of my job is talking to pilots
all the time.

157
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:43,674
And I get to know all the pilots,
by name and numbers.

158
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:47,475
They recognize my voice
when they come into the area.

159
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,180
And instead of saying
"Van Nuys Tower,"

160
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,082
they'll call Phil's name.

161
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,060
They hear him on the radio.
I love to hear Phil's voice.

162
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,246
I can't remember
when Phil wasn't in the tower.

163
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,088
The most relaxed guy
there can be.

164
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,523
Coming in from Europe

165
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,824
when you've been up
14, 16 hours,

166
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,195
there's nothing
like hearing Phil say,

167
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,721
"Welcome back to Van Nuys."

168
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,423
<i>How's everything gain'?</i>

169
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,420
<i>Gain' alright, Phil, how're you doin'?</i>

170
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,162
<i>I got the, uh, late shift, tonight.</i>

171
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,404
<i>Once you get some years on,
and then you can get a day shift.</i>

172
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,444
It's my own personal history
that makes the airport special

173
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,213
for me in the sense
that it's my home airport.

174
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,081
It's where I learned to fl y,
it's where I had my first airplane.

175
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,776
Now, I'm addicted.

176
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,344
I can't imagine
not having an airplane.

177
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,390
<i>Gulfstream Five-Quebec-Sierra,
Runway One Six Right...</i>

178
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,689
<i>clear for takeoff.
Wind two-four-zero at eight.</i>

179
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,260
<i>Clear for takeoff, One Six Right,
Five-Quebec-Siena.</i>

180
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,865
This airport has more
corporate jet airplanes on it

181
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,595
than any airport in the world.

182
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,864
And, the people that come
to Los Angeles to make the deals,

183
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,475
they come to Van Nuys Airport.

184
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,844
This airport is so perfectly set here,

185
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,645
in the middle
of the San Fernando Valley.

186
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:56,646
I mean, we've got Hollywood.
We've got Los Angeles.

187
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,750
We've got... The business districts
here are tremendous.

188
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,515
Van Nuys is
an international airport.

189
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,681
Typically we'll leave here
and go nonstop to Nice, France,

190
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,257
Paris, Amsterdam.

191
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,387
We can get customs, here,
and immigration here.

192
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,660
And when we come in from Europe
it's nonstop right to our destination.

193
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,434
<i>Five-Tango-Sierra,
begin your tum,</i>

194
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,234
<i>and contact departure,
one-twenty-eight, seventy-five.</i>

195
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,599
<i>See ya later, Phil, thanks.</i>

196
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,943
One of the most important things
we have here at Van Nuys,

197
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:28,572
are the students,
the people learning to fly.

198
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:33,184
And this airport has provided
an arena for people to learn to fly

199
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,219
for seventy-five years.

200
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,622
<i>You have information Whiskey.</i>

201
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,625
I was like a little kid
when I was learning how to fly.

202
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,118
I mean, I would actually go out

203
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,796
and sit as close as I could get
to One Six Right

204
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,767
and watch planes come in...
for hours.

205
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,669
<i>Van Nuys Tower Premier
Four-Eight-Eight Papa-Charlie...</i>

206
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,230
During the initial time
that I started training,

207
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:57,332
someone suggested
that I take a hand-held radio

208
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,436
and go sit at the redline.

209
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,680
And, I found a place,
parked my car, got out

210
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,012
and used my radio and listened,

211
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,616
and I kind of put myself

212
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,818
in the place
of each of the radio calls

213
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,921
so that I could begin to understand
what they're talking about.

214
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,689
<i>To</i> learn <i>the language.
One Six Right, clear to land...</i>

215
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,125
It took on
a tremendously special meaning

216
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,388
and to this day, I'm admitting
that I need my redline fix.

217
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,498
Now, that means I just go out
and I'll sit there for a halt-an-hour

218
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,699
and I'll watch operations.

219
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,735
I'll be right at the edge
of the runway or the taxiway,

220
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,261
as far as they'll let a civilian go.

221
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,802
And just being there
is being a part of the airport.

222
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,678
If someone is going up
for their first solo,

223
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,112
they usually tell us-

224
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,148
because then we can give them
a little extra room.

225
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,349
We give them a wind check,

226
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,785
and I just take care of them
a little bit better...

227
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,687
Not push them.

228
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,922
Because I did my first solo
at Van Nuys Airport, as well.

229
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,325
You help square them away,
keep them safe,

230
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,960
and then you kind of cut them loose.

231
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,294
Like, "Alright,"
you've seen them solo.

232
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,055
And they're always,
"That was my first solo."

233
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,527
And we're always telling them,
"Good job! Keep it up."

234
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,701
Or maybe give them some numbers,
"Alright, that was a 'six'.

235
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,965
Try it again."

236
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:02,940
All of the sudden,

237
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:05,103
the guy that taught you
isn't there anymore.

238
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,110
You don't know
when it's going to happen.

239
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,648
They just got outta the airplane
and stood there on the ground

240
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,846
and looked at you and said,
"Okay, fly."

241
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,752
And he sort of monitors you,
but he's sure that you can do it.

242
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,886
He's sure that you're ready.

243
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:19,290
And, when I took off, I thought,
"My God!

244
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,125
There's nobody in front, there.
I'm all alone!"

245
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,494
And, he said, "I'm here."
He had his walkie-talkie,

246
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,860
"I'll be listening to you.

247
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,062
You just do what
you've been taught to do."

248
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,633
But something comes over you,

249
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:36,302
and it's the realization
that it's up to you.

250
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,973
Everything that you're
about to do... is you.

251
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:45,042
So you remember
everything you've been taught.

252
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,854
You take oft and sure enough,
it's the greatest feeling in the world.

253
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,323
Because when you land,
you've just done

254
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,125
what so very few
people have done.

255
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,585
And, not for that reason,
but, because you were able to do it.

256
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,958
And, it's an incredible feeling
of, "Look Ma - No Hands!"

257
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:14,305
Then after the license,
of course, comes the plane.

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,906
I was in a position then,
where I could afford an airplane.

259
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,314
And I bought a brand new Bonanza
in about 1975.

260
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,512
I had my own airplane,
my own Bonanza.

261
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,392
And, the day that I got it,
or a couple of days after that,

262
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,461
my wife and two kids and I
were going out to a movie.

263
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,697
And I said, "No, we gotta
go by the airport first."

264
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,860
And we went
to where this airplane was,

265
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,771
and I forced them all
to get in the plane, to sit down,

266
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,671
and I kind of showed them
what it was like to fly it.

267
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,936
I was so excited
to have this airplane.

268
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,375
So, my family sat there like,

269
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,876
"You know, Dad,
we gotta get to the movie."

270
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,845
But, you know,
we had to go see the plane, first.

271
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,878
I hung on the fence
for about four or five years

272
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,743
trying to figure out
how you buy an airplane.

273
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:58,013
It is as it was in 1944
when it come out of the factory.

274
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,625
You won't find one in the country
that is equipped the way this one is.

275
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:10,801
Well, the DC-3, I painted it up
in 1952 United colors,

276
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,503
which is what I flew.

277
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,064
We fixed it up really nice.

278
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,744
My family had a history with A-26s.

279
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,748
My grandfather bought some A-26s
after World War ll.

280
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,549
He owned A-26s
and my father owned A-26s.

281
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,688
But then, my dream always
was to have something

282
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,990
like what I have now,
which is this Citation X,

283
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,825
which is the fastest
non-military jet in the world.

284
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,824
I save an hour with this plane,
coast-to-coast, both directions.

285
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,702
There was a period where the Pitts
was down for six months

286
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,728
for some repair work
being done to it.

287
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,997
I found myself
still coming up to the airport,

288
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,633
when I didn't have an airplane,
just to see my friends

289
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,044
and to hang outwith my friends
and talk about airplanes.

290
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,740
I'm up here on days
where it's raining,

291
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,817
and I'm just working on some things
in the hangar with my airplane,

292
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,853
because I enjoy coming here
on the weekends, or my Fridays.

293
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,879
It's a place where
you just like to hang out,

294
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,889
because of the size of it,
the number of people there,

295
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,860
and the different mix of airplanes.

296
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:15,027
They're all there, in that spot.
And it's been there a long time.

297
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,897
There's nothing like it on the planet.

298
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,165
It's not just about an airport,
it's about a community.

299
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,206
It's about a community of flyers

300
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,576
and people that are dedicated
to the special art of flying.

301
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,312
I would just go there,

302
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,924
not knowing what the hell
I was going to do.

303
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,849
Just to walk around,
see who I could meet-hang out.

304
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:36,086
Paul Meyer, he used to come in
a lot to the office

305
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,556
and do a lot of hangar flying.

306
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,392
Tell lies about all these
different flights that I never took and...

307
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,495
Hangar flying, the way I see it,

308
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:49,764
is a bunch of pilots talking
about their experiences

309
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,971
and I used to like to ask them
if they logged it.

310
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,346
I wrote in my logbook,
"This is a love story."

311
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,520
"Please... call,"
and my phone number,

312
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,579
"if you find it."

313
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,859
It was a cherished log.
Every little airplane, I flew.

314
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,695
And in those days,
things weren't as strict.

315
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,963
Somebody would come along
and say,

316
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,232
"Could you fly this airplane?
Have you flown it?"

317
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,235
"Of course, I can.
Yes, I have," right?

318
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,703
But, it went into my logbook.

319
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,138
I log every flight
every time I go up

320
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,173
in every airplane.

321
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,610
It's my record of what I've done

322
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,278
and I'm very proud of it.

323
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,440
Well, it's part of your life.

324
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,882
It tells what you did,
and when you did it.

325
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,220
My best memories
of the Van Nuys Airport

326
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,953
were in my early days...
Were in the Fifties and Sixties.

327
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,185
It was the best time of my life.

328
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:54,365
I came here in 1959, January.

329
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,800
The same year that the FAA
became into existence.

330
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,293
And have been here
most of my career.

331
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:04,241
In 1938, when I first went
to the Van Nuys Airport,

332
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,844
and I just fell in love
with airplanes.

333
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:11,146
Probably my first real memory
of the airport would be 1934.

334
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,254
Aviation was just starting
to be popular

335
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,356
after the first World War.

336
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,926
You know, there were a lot
of barnstormers around

337
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,827
and little small dirt strips.

338
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,498
And I think maybe the thing
that really got to me...

339
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,199
It got to millions of people...

340
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,465
Was Lindbergh, 1927.

341
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:36,907
And, of course,
he became a god, an idol.

342
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:40,936
And, we all wanted-everybody
wanted to learn to fly then.

343
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,380
I was probably six years old,

344
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,449
my mother took me down
to Los Angeles.

345
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,648
And I sat on a curb and watched
Charles Lindbergh go by.

346
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:55,552
And... he's always been my hero.

347
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,689
I was ten years old
when he made his flight to Paris.

348
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:04,792
I immediately sent for a kit
of the Spirit of St. Louis.

349
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,971
It flew very badly

350
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,464
It was unstable
about all three axes.

351
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,669
And I had the pleasure
of meeting Lindbergh years later.

352
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,313
I mentioned this model I'd built
of the Spirit of St. Louis,

353
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,648
and how badly it flew.

354
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,583
And, he laughed, he said,

355
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,211
"Must've been a good model.
The airplane flew that way, too."

356
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,159
Most people focus on aircraft.

357
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,595
But airports are somewhat
the unsung hero.

358
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,565
Aircraft always need a place
to rest or nest,

359
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,667
and without the airports being there
and understanding

360
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,602
how they function,
how they grow over time,

361
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:41,438
the whole aviation industry
wouldn't really exist.

362
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:41,839
<i>One Six Right, clear to land
Wind variable at six...</i>

363
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,537
<i>One Six Right, clear to land
Wind variable at six...</i>

364
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:01,426
<i>advise on initial contact
you nave information Bravo.</i>

365
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,626
<i>Roger that.</i>

366
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:12,903
<i>Two and a half months ago,
this port was just a bean field.</i>

367
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,307
<i>But, we're not only building
a permanent location for an airport,</i>

368
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:22,746
<i>but an airport city with industries,
with homes for employees</i>

369
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:25,717
<i>with stores for their wants,
with a hotel...</i>

370
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,592
<i>Los Angeles Metropolitan Airport</i>

371
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,896
<i>is being built where
the visibility is unlimited</i>

372
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,026
<i>by a group of men
with unlimited vision.</i>

373
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,834
<i>It's designed for present</i>

374
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,737
<i>and future permanency
of the aircraft industry,</i>

375
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,239
<i>with two smooth,
all-weather runways</i>

376
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,210
<i>and emergency landing
fields on all sides.</i>

377
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,546
<i>If you are identified
with the aircraft industry</i>

378
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,484
<i>you are interested in the
Los Angeles Metropolitan Airport.</i>

379
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,817
Well, the idea
for a Metropolitan airport, originally

380
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,557
typical southern California thing
called a real estate development.

381
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,702
Three fellows...
Heffron, McCray and St. John,

382
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:23,197
got together and decided
to promote and develop an airport

383
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,333
in San Fernando Valley.

384
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:30,341
The San Fernando Valley, then
was dry, barren crops,

385
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,176
but very, very few people.

386
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,894
It was originally conceived

387
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,559
to be the best airport
in the Los Angeles area.

388
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,527
And, in its inception,
its location,

389
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,764
the way they laid out its runways,
the size and width of its runways

390
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,768
were the best in the West,

391
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,703
and possibly the best
in the whole United States.

392
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:03,447
What they did, is they invested
in this planned community.

393
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,716
They brought in
aircraft manufacturers

394
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,651
such as Bach Aircraft Company,

395
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,787
which was a major investor
in the airport.

396
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,990
Just about every realm of aviation
was to be addressed here,

397
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,187
and they were all
supposed to live together

398
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:18,591
and contribute to each other
and the advancement of aviation.

399
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:22,394
That's what really was the vision
of the founders of Metropolitan Airport.

400
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,972
It opened on October first of 1928.

401
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:32,543
But because
of the twenty-fifth anniversary

402
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,680
of the Wright Brothers first flight,
17 December, 1928,

403
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,912
they decided to make
the formal dedication that day.

404
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,119
Waldo was the General Manager.

405
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,789
And he was as well-known
a pioneer pilot

406
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,624
as there was
in the United States.

407
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,026
He put that good face
upon the airport.

408
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:53,431
Waldo was a thinker
and a challenger.

409
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,399
And he was a guy,

410
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,969
that the status quo
could always be improved.

411
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,204
Of course, he was in an era

412
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,040
when the airplane
was being improved.

413
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,376
Every day there were
better and better airplanes

414
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:07,538
and more challenges.

415
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:10,313
Well, Waldo was part
of that process

416
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,747
and this is where
aviation really began

417
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,616
on a modem basis
in Southern California.

418
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:21,322
My first ride in an airplane
was at Metropolitan Airport.

419
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:25,829
And I, thereafter,
became quite interested in flying.

420
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,600
We used to get our bikes
and ride out to Van Nuys

421
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,366
and Burbank, Glendale...
And watch the airplanes.

422
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:35,138
It was about twenty miles,
that's a pretty long ride.

423
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,674
But we were young kids
and we didn't care what we seen

424
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,276
as long as
we seen some airplanes.

425
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,644
And well, that was about 1928.

426
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,282
To promote the airport
they had a number of events,

427
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,251
to highlight its availability

428
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,152
to its great flying
and weather conditions.

429
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,121
Early in 1929,

430
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,524
the United States Army Air Corps
had an endurance flight here,

431
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,826
<i>the Question Mark flew between</i>

432
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,929
Metropolitan Airport and San Diego.

433
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,963
Back and forth,

434
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:02,194
over a period of a week
day and night.

435
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,536
Basically they had a hose
and five-gallon cans of gas

436
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:07,537
that went into the hose

437
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:08,733
and down to the plane.

438
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,209
The procedure we use today
is really no different.

439
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,272
Except the hose hooks up
to a hookup on the plane.

440
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:18,514
But basically
that's the only difference.

441
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,020
It took some very,
very careful flying, though.

442
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,721
'Course during that particular flight,

443
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:27,057
there was a young woman aviator
that decided

444
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,925
she was going to get up
and establish a record.

445
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,663
Her name was Bobbi Trout.

446
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,398
And when Spatz found

447
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,767
that she was flying around
in his airspace,

448
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,702
he told Waldo,
"Get her outta there!"

449
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,771
You know, and the only way
they could communicate

450
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,298
was by notes that were attached
to the hoses.

451
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,876
And Waldo replied,
"What do you want me to do?

452
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,877
Shoot her down?"

453
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:50,180
Of course, Waldo knew
most of the women pilots.

454
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,450
He helped run
their Powder Puff derbies

455
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,751
and was a factor

456
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:57,153
in virtually everything
they tried to do.

457
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:01,214
Amelia Earhart came to set
a new speed record.

458
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,328
Metropolitan had
a three-kilometer course

459
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,063
spread out from East to West.

460
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,666
And, she was able to clock
a speed of a 181 MPH

461
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,736
to set a new speed record
on a closed-course.

462
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,238
That was followed and broken
about a month later

463
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,470
by Pancho Barnes who capped
Amelia's speed record.

464
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,311
All of that activity was very exciting

465
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,613
for the folks
in the greater Los Angeles area,

466
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,049
and attracted a large crowd,
got a lot of press.

467
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,782
Everybody was very excited
about flying in Los Angeles.

468
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:30,187
Unfortunately, all that
sort of came to a swift end

469
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:33,223
Unfortunately, all that
sort of came to a swift end

470
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,693
with the crash of the stock market
in 1929.

471
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,529
The airfield really went
into disrepair.

472
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:44,295
Most of the major investors
lost their investment in the airport.

473
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,670
The only use of the airport

474
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,272
was for illegal contraband,
during the Depression.

475
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:53,143
The airport was utilized
as a moonshine landing facility

476
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,246
for illegal alcohol
that was manufactured in MÃÂ©xico.

477
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,781
The reason they selected it here,

478
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,546
because there was
absolutely no activity

479
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:09,489
My family first acquired
the airport grounds in 1933

480
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,763
in payment of a bad debt
to my great-grandmother.

481
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,035
And, as a kid, I would
be around the airport

482
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,971
primarily because
this was my dad's vocation.

483
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:28,538
He acted as General Manager
from about 1933 to about 1941.

484
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:28,746
Dean Daily, Senior,
had basically taken the airport

485
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,783
Dean Daily, Senior,
had basically taken the airport

486
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,652
and was trying to find a new market
or a new avenue

487
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,486
to introduce money
into the operation of the airport.

488
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:40,991
He did that by allowing
the motion picture industry

489
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,586
to come in and actually shoot
a number of movies.

490
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,466
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

491
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,956
Hollywood sustained the airport

492
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:17,794
and really allowed the airport
to revitalize itself and prosper

493
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,296
with a whole new generation

494
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,598
of folks who were interested
in learning how to fly

495
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,033
at Metropolitan Airport.

496
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,201
The first time I flew here,
was with gas models.

497
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:32,142
We used to go out on the runway,
and just fly at our hearts content.

498
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,474
Was no problem at all.

499
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,980
We'd see a plane taxiing out
or one in the pattern

500
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,483
and we'd just wait
until they were finished,

501
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:43,250
and, then we'd continue flying.
It was great.

502
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,322
My first memories of the airport

503
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,385
were of seeing an awful lot
of fellows out here learning to fly.

504
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,460
My father and I coming out
from Hollywood,

505
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:55,298
and he said, "You oughta be thinkin'
about what you're going to be"

506
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:56,066
when you grow up."

507
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,934
And, I said,
"You know what I'd like to be

508
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:58,935
is an airline pilot."

509
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,271
He said, "I know a guy
with an airplane",

510
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,472
Let's go over to the airport."

511
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,166
So, we went over there
and I had my first lesson that day.

512
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:08,545
I had to sit on that parachute
and two cushions

513
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,014
to see out of the back cockpit.

514
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,417
And after flying for ten hours,
I finally soloed.

515
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,427
What we'd do occasionally
is go out to a small field

516
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:28,098
about midway between here and
Reseda... just a farmer's pasture.

517
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,133
And we'd land and load up

518
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:34,171
with rubber boots and shoes
and anything we could drop

519
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,241
and have bombing practice.
And, also, toilet paper.

520
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:41,344
We'd get up there,
and let a toilet paper roll stream

521
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,545
and see how many times
you could cut it with your wings.

522
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:47,050
It was all sorts of tun.
And you know, at that time,

523
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,085
there was nothing
between here and Reseda.

524
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:52,147
And nobody seemed to care.
It was fun.

525
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,758
Well, we used to take off, here,

526
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,061
about ten minutes to five,
because about ten after five,

527
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:01,331
the Lark train would go
up these tracks right here,

528
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,401
and then we'd see the train coming
and so we'd come along

529
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,996
and get down low
right on top of the train.

530
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,905
When we got over the engineer,
you know, it would scare him.

531
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:16,705
You know: here's this big noise
right up over his head.

532
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:19,645
And, you know, we'd peel off
and that was fun!

533
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,752
So, I can remember
another time we did this

534
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,983
and he was waiting for us.

535
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,325
So, when we got
right over his engine,

536
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,660
he pulled the whistle
and scared the hell out of us!

537
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,333
The day I soloed
was a year after

538
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,632
the day I'd hoped to have soloed.

539
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,073
I came out here and
went around the patch one time.

540
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:54,272
And the instrucfor got out, and
gave me a few words of instruction.

541
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,946
And he started to walk away
from the plane,

542
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,248
he says, "Hey, wait a minute."

543
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,483
"Somebody's pulled a red flag
up on the pole.

544
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:01,618
Somethin's wrong."

545
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,154
They came out like this, you know...

546
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,556
I figured, "What the hell
they're wavin' at?!"

547
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,527
So, I made another round or two,
they come out...

548
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,496
So about the third time I thought,
"I better stop.

549
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:14,864
It looks like emergency."

550
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:16,199
Dean Daily runs out,

551
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,769
With the red flag,
and flags all the airplanes down

552
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,971
and says, "Put 'em in the hangar"

553
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:25,141
and leave 'em there
until you hear further from us."

554
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:28,144
Went in the office, and
here's about a half-a-dozen guys,

555
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:30,480
hovering around a little radio.

556
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:33,817
And right then, Roosevelt
is addressing Congress

557
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,719
on this day of infamy

558
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,256
So, all of the aircraft in Pacific coast
were grounded-no flying.

559
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:43,326
And the next morning,
I went out to the airport

560
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:44,861
and there was no use
opening the hangar,

561
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,163
because you couldn't
get any airplane out.

562
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,223
And if you did, you couldn't use it.

563
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,302
The field had closed
while I was in the pattern.

564
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,364
So obviously
I didn't get a chance to solo.

565
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,672
That happened a year later
in the Navy Cadet program.

566
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,614
After December <i>7,</i> 1941,

567
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,983
the United States Government
acquired

568
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,180
what was then Metropolitan Airport.

569
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,122
That resulted in a name change
of the facility

570
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,023
to the Van Nuys Army Air Base.

571
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,725
The United States Army Air Force

572
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:19,185
invested in the creation
of two large concrete runways.

573
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,432
It really changed the landscape
and the permanency

574
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,095
of the Van Nuys Airport
as we know it today.

575
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,707
Around the periphery of the airport,
we had aircraft manufacturers

576
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,443
that were supporting the war effort
with the production

577
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,147
of Navy trainers
as well as Army gliders.

578
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,607
There was a lot of activities
directly supporting the war effort.

579
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,287
I'm very fortunate,

580
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,589
by being a member
of the Eighty-Third Squadron,

581
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,124
and did this flying, here.

582
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:53,029
We were over in August
and September of '43.

583
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,532
When we first arrived the first day,

584
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,299
I had our squadron commander
walk in with a lieutenant.

585
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,604
The squadron commander says,

586
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:03,573
"A-Flight, I want you to meet
your commander.

587
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,006
"He just bailed out of a P-38
over Los Angeles.

588
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:08,812
"He got a engine afire

589
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,114
"so he trimmed it up
for out to the sea

590
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,115
and he bailed out."

591
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,118
That was my introduction
to Van Nuys, however.

592
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,920
Our nation needed women.

593
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,491
We needed women to help,

594
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,660
because the men
were all sent overseas.

595
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,220
There weren't any men left

596
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:31,367
to ferry airplanes from the factory
to the military schools.

597
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,036
The war was still on.

598
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:36,039
It was 1945, and I was based
in Portland, Oregon.

599
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,601
And, I took a P-38 and flew down
to Van Nuys one afternoon.

600
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,046
And I was on our initial approach
to make my break,

601
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,516
and all of the sudden,
here comes a Navy fighter.

602
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,318
And, that guy was all over me.

603
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,520
Really, all I wanted to do
was get on the ground

604
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,955
and go to the latrine.

605
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,657
But, this guy really gave me a time.

606
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:57,861
And we went at it for maybe five,
ten minutes up there.

607
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,160
And finally he left me alone
and I went in and landed.

608
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,166
Some of the other fellows
were there to meet me.

609
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,235
And they said, "Gosh, Jim!"

610
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,337
They were really going after you
up there."

611
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,539
And, I said, "Yeah!
Who on the Earth was doin' it?"

612
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,075
And he said,
"Well, that gal just left here.

613
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,377
She was ferryin' that airplane
for the Navy."

614
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,144
And, so, I don't think that was true.

615
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:21,349
And if it was true,
she was a heck of a pilot!

616
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,288
<i>Radioplane Company
in Van Nuys, California,</i>

617
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,724
<i>was located in an environment</i>

618
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,888
<i>favorable for the procurement
or qualified personnel.</i>

619
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,400
In 1942, the Radioplane Company
moved into Metropolitan Airport.

620
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,969
And they produced
radio-controlled airplanes.

621
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,563
Basically toy airplanes.

622
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,641
The Army and the Navy
ended up purchasing

623
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,177
these little radio-controlled planes
for use in target practice.

624
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,914
One interesting aspect of that was

625
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,182
Army Air Force photographer,
David Conover,

626
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,019
was sent on assignment
to shoot women war workers.

627
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,555
His commanding officer
was Ronald Reagan.

628
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,024
And David Conover
went onto the line

629
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,059
and he photographed
a woman worker.

630
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,154
And she was actually
very attractive.

631
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,330
This was really a defining moment,

632
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,199
as it transitioned her
into a modeling career,

633
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,136
and ultimately,
a career as a Hollywood film star

634
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,162
who would be known
as Marilyn Monroe.

635
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,578
When the war ended in 1945,

636
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,813
the federal government
no longer had an interest

637
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,949
in the Van Nuys Army Airfield.

638
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,218
And so the airfield really lacked
any sort of sponsorship.

639
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,588
It sort of meandered
and was intermittently closed

640
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,251
because it was essentially
running of money to operate.

641
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,126
The War Assets Administration,
sold the airport

642
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,228
to the city of Los Angeles
for one dollar.

643
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:42,565
The facility actually changed names
as part of the purchase

644
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:45,335
<i>and became Known as We
San Fernando Valley Airport</i>

645
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,638
with the only constraint being
that Air National Guard operations

646
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,006
had to continue
through about 1985.

647
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,743
The Guard primarily
served a reserve function

648
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,712
for the regular Army Air Force.

649
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,015
And they operated
P-61 Mustangs at this time.

650
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,118
Civilian operations
were coming back to the airport.

651
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,387
General Aviation was prospering.

652
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,624
They had this wonderful facility
that had this huge investment

653
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,253
by the Army Air Force
to take advantage of.

654
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,822
That was really
the glory days of the airport.

655
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,236
Flying was just for the fun
of getting off the ground.

656
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:34,851
So, it was pretty cool.
A lot of fun.

657
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,686
When I arrived at Van Nuys
in 1952, it was busy.

658
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,251
There was a lot
of student training going on.

659
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,892
The instruction that you got,

660
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,294
back after World War ll,
was marvelous.

661
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:48,865
Because these guys
are bumming around these airports,

662
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,800
just trying to make a buck
on the weekend.

663
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,369
They had a job,
but they wanted to fly.

664
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,706
And they're probably working
for a couple dollars an hour

665
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,908
But they had a chance
to fly airplanes.

666
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,177
I got my license with Roger Clarke

667
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,847
in the jungle off of Stagg Street
in 1951.

668
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:07,116
Got a job as a lineboy

669
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,851
at a little place called
Valley Pilots

670
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:09,786
across the field.

671
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
And after I started-had a license,
I started flying with Fred Murphy

672
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,694
And he had Cessna 120s
and Ercoupes.

673
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,796
And it was pretty cheap back then.

674
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,427
You could rent
for about $3.50 an hour.

675
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,708
In the era that I learned how to fly
and did my solo,

676
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:37,280
the Van Nuys National Guard
had P-51 Mustangs to start with.

677
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:41,309
And then they eventually graduated
up into the F-86 Jet.

678
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,288
And that was the first jet airplanes
anybody had ever seen.

679
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,790
So, I'd be peering
through the chainlink fence,

680
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:53,196
like everybody else,
watching these military jets take off.

681
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,997
The meeting place
for that community

682
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,262
was the Skytrails Restaurant.

683
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,402
It was like the, the gathering place

684
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,498
of literally some of the most famous
people in aviation.

685
00:39:03,006 --> 00:39:05,608
Of course all
of the professional pilots

686
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,877
flying for the companys
would be over there

687
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,046
telling war stories,
sitting around the table.

688
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,782
Good old Mr. Tarver
would run everybody a tab.

689
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,785
He became a lot of us
in the Guards bankers.

690
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:20,156
If we needed money, cash checks,
do anything, we could sign the tab.

691
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,391
I understand
by the time he did pass away,

692
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:27,897
he had some ridiculous $30,000
in bad checks, and what have you.

693
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:28,699
The story was,

694
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,168
that one of our friends
paid part of his bill.

695
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,968
And Mr. Tarver couldn't survive it.
It killed him.

696
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,413
I was still Lockheed at that time.
And, I just decided I'd like to build,

697
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:47,817
what they were called in those days
was Goodyear Racers.

698
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:51,521
The Cosmic Winds are very
historical Formula One raceplanes.

699
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,822
There were several of them.

700
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,691
The aircraft were actually assembled
right here at Van Nuys.

701
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:59,128
They were a great little airplane,
and they participated at Reno.

702
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:02,198
And, for that matter,
at the Cleveland Air Races

703
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,462
for many years.

704
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:08,396
When Mr. Smith bought the airplanes
from Tony Levier and Associates,

705
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,174
he come over to me
and he asked me

706
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,810
if I'd like to fly one
of his airplanes for him.

707
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,012
And I says, "Yeah",

708
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,181
"But I'll have to
think about it a little bit.

709
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,383
And I'll go home
and talk to my wife."

710
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,552
And I didn't even
get through the gate.

711
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,783
I turned around, went back,
and says, "It's a deal."

712
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,588
I was pretty lucky.
I flew one of the Cosmic Winds.

713
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:36,799
Jack Conroy
was a fellow guardsman

714
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,601
and he was about ten years older
than me.

715
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,205
He was a World War ll pilot,
got shot down in a B-17

716
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,538
and spent some time
in a prison camp.

717
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:46,142
Conroy was the first guy

718
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,477
to ever fly from Los Angeles
to New York and back.

719
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:52,108
And he did it
on Armed Forces Day, 1955.

720
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:56,786
The flight of the Boomerang
was unique

721
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,954
in that it demonstrated

722
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,356
that coast-to-coast jet flight
was feasible.

723
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,124
Jack Conroy demonstrated that

724
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,894
by flying his F-86
from Van Nuys to New York,

725
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,429
and then returning back
to Van Nuys,

726
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,898
all within daylight hours.

727
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,766
The flight was historic
in that it was the first time

728
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:13,202
that anyone had ever
accomplished this teat.

729
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,637
And it became the predecessor

730
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,471
of coast-to-coast airline travel
as we know it today.

731
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,018
Back in that era,
the only requirement

732
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,521
to fly in and out of Van Nuys airport
was you had to have a receiver.

733
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,123
And they didn't work very well.

734
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,826
We'd go to the tower,
the guys were very good about it.

735
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,262
They'd come out,
and they'd yell down at us.

736
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,830
And we'd yell back up at them.

737
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,899
And we'd figure out some way
to communicate

738
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,834
in a one-way direction.

739
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,402
They only had one frequency

740
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,638
So there was a lot
of frequency congestion as well.

741
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,375
And, so, it would get very busy.
And usually a controller

742
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,144
would stay on position
for no more than an hour

743
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,480
because of the heavy volume
of traffic.

744
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,950
The tower would say,
"The aircraft downwind..."

745
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,152
Or maybe he'd call you
by your type airplane,

746
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:07,181
"If you hear the tower, acknowledge
by rocking your wings."

747
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,619
And the tower would finally say
"Okay, we, we gotchya,"

748
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,522
Because I would do that
all the way around the pattern.

749
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:16,833
In 1957,

750
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,735
the San Fernando Valley Airport
received its final name change.

751
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:22,433
It became known
as the Van Nuys Airport.

752
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,473
Also in that year,
the Air National Guard

753
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,943
had a need for a larger
and faster aircraft,

754
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,878
which necessitated
a longer runway.

755
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,014
The Air National Guard
increased the runway at Van Nuys.

756
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:35,007
And in doing so they created
the Sherman Way Tunnel.

757
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,889
I remember the construction
going on there.

758
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,925
And I remember that tunnel
being built,

759
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:44,794
and then
when they extended that runway.

760
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,560
I guess it's the only tunnel
in the whole valley.

761
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,033
It was such a novelty.
It was all lit-up inside.

762
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:54,737
And its shiny, gleaming tiles
in there, and all the lights.

763
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,539
And you drove down underground,

764
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,740
and came up the other side.

765
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,175
And I mean there was
nothing else like it.

766
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,270
That was a big deal back then.

767
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,512
It made Van Nuys unique.

768
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:06,615
And it had a runway
that was essentially twice as large

769
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:09,418
as the majority
of the commercial airports

770
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:10,419
across the country.

771
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,989
It was a whole lot longer
than it needed to be

772
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,457
for the kind of airplanes
I was flying.

773
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,359
Because it had increased in length

774
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,394
from six thousand feet
to eight thousand feet.

775
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,696
It's got darn near
the longest runway

776
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:21,892
in Southern California.

777
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,700
Sturdy, it was made hard
and made right.

778
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,335
And that made it unique.

779
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:30,295
And its uniqueness collected pilots
by the hundreds.

780
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:22,458
The Guard picked up the C-97s,
which we flew and flew and flew.

781
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,959
They really were the mothership.

782
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,561
Weekends and holidays,

783
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,463
whenever the Guard
would have some event,

784
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,633
they would organize
great marching bands on the ramp

785
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,734
up there at the Guard base.

786
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:35,535
The background was C-97s,
and great airplanes.

787
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,040
The Air Guard had a motto.

788
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,806
They said,
"It's people helping people."

789
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:43,913
The community,
other Air Force units,

790
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,949
whatever was necessary,
those people would do it.

791
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,510
On the civilian side
was a lot of mercy stuff.

792
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,855
The big quake in Alaska,
we hauled

793
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,391
I don't know how much goods
in there for those people.

794
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,394
And there've been a lot
of other missions around the world.

795
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:02,696
And we had a logo in the front
that said the sun never set

796
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,093
on any of our aircraft,
because they went everywhere.

797
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,512
In the early 1960s,

798
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,448
NASA had a requirement
for a heavy transport

799
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:22,714
to move around the Moon Rocket,
or segments of the Moon Rocket.

800
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,721
Jack Conroy developed
the Pregnant Guppy

801
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,223
for this very reason.

802
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,458
Basically a C-97.

803
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:32,261
And they took
the whole top-end of it off,

804
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,697
and put a new
superstructure on there,

805
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,932
that made it look more
like the Goodyear Blimp

806
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:38,901
than an airplane.

807
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:41,904
It was all predicated
on the fact,

808
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,941
that it they're going to build
the missiles on the West Coast,

809
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:48,644
and fire them off in Florida,

810
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,005
you had to get them
there some way.

811
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,348
Most of the bridges
in the United States

812
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,684
are built to fourteen-feet
seven-inch es clearance.

813
00:45:55,685 --> 00:46:00,089
So you couldn't put it on a truck
and drive it from here to Florida.

814
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,126
Jack Conroy
was one of these thinkers

815
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:05,961
who said,
"We can fly 'em there."

816
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:08,664
Some pretty smart people,
some engineers and things

817
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,366
were predicting bad things.

818
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,402
And it was probably
one of the biggest days

819
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,236
around this airport...
To watch that first test-flight.

820
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:19,275
And, they took the airplane
around the pattern

821
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,744
and landed it
for a press conference.

822
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,079
And Jack Conroy,
who was always up,

823
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,349
first words he says
to the press-corps,

824
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,484
"Well, this is nothin', yet.

825
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,920
"Wait'll you see us build
a really big one," he says.

826
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,250
Which they ultimately did.

827
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:38,761
Wernher von Braun
gave Jack a letter in 1969

828
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:44,233
that said he felt that the Guppy
was the single most important thing

829
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,998
for putting a man on the moon
that decade.

830
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:58,514
Back in 1965, I exposed
literally hundreds of people

831
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,109
to their first ride
in a corporate jet.

832
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,852
That was very fun days.

833
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:07,489
I can remember back in the 60s
when I first came here,

834
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,585
if you came out on Saturday
and saw a Learjet-wow!

835
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:15,231
That was something, you know?
If you saw a Gulfstream I... wow!

836
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,733
That was something...
That was an old turboprop airplane.

837
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:18,867
In fact this Learjet...

838
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,636
I keep pointing to this
little Learjet behind us, here.

839
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,471
That little Learjet
has a lot of history.

840
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,207
It was the first corporate jet
to land at Van Nuys Airport.

841
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,734
I brought it here
in November, 1964.

842
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,747
Jack Conroy and I set
a record to New York and back

843
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,113
in June of '65.

844
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:36,752
People that flew out of this airport
in the Learjet,

845
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,421
that I'm familiar with,
were people like Frank Sinatra,

846
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:42,691
and Dean Martin,
and Sammy Davis, and...

847
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,893
I have a guest log

848
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,895
that practically
everybody in Hollywood

849
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:49,024
flew in that airplane in 1965.

850
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,672
In 1970, the Air National Guard
transitioned to the C-130.

851
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,541
The C-130 was
a much more modem aircraft

852
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,444
that would allow them
to have a much larger reach

853
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:06,006
at supporting our troops overseas
or within the United States.

854
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,317
Once we transferred over,

855
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,820
we had people
making nonstop flights

856
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:14,657
from Japan to the United States,

857
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,593
when before
that was a three day trip.

858
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,063
So, things moved rather fast.

859
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,027
And our people
moved right along with it.

860
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,734
In the early to mid-70s,

861
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:28,871
when I first became aware
of Van Nuys

862
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,172
and moved to Southern California,

863
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,108
this was the heyday of aviation
throughout the country.

864
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,412
Small planes being built
almost as frequently

865
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,747
as some of the models of cars
that you could buy.

866
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,550
And, it was populated by many
many flight schools

867
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:45,954
and a host of the normal kind
of General Aviation airplane...

868
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:49,425
A single-engine, fixed-gear,
four-place airplanes.

869
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,660
And the propeller airplane
and the piston engine

870
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:53,662
were just a part of Van Nuys

871
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:55,631
as they were for most
General Aviation airports

872
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:56,632
in that era.

873
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,282
<i>Lear Five-Five-Four
Six-Alpha, Roger...</i>

874
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:51,279
This airport grew, though,
steadily every year,

875
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,322
bigger and bigger and better.

876
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,258
And, today, it's really
an amazing place to visit.

877
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,227
It's like a dream come true

878
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,458
for the people
that originally put it together.

879
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,630
It's actually answering everything
that they said it would do.

880
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:11,173
<i>But, we're not only building
a permanent location for an airport,</i>

881
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:16,445
<i>but an airport city with industries,
with homes for employees</i>

882
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,541
<i>with stores for their wants,
with a hotel...</i>

883
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,217
<i>sky three-zero thousand scattered...</i>

884
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,787
<i>Temperature two-four,
dewpoint zero-five.</i>

885
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,055
<i>Altimeter two-niner-niner-six...</i>

886
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,591
<i>'LS Run way One Six Right
approach in use,</i>

887
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:32,861
<i>Landing Runways
One Six Right and One Six Left.</i>

888
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:37,197
<i>Advise on initial contact
you have Information Juliet.</i>

889
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:41,670
The one problem
that aviation enthusiasts have

890
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,274
is they talk to themselves
about how wonderful aviation is-

891
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,942
how wonderful airports are,

892
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,911
how valuable they are
to the community.

893
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,106
The problem is,
they don't talk to the neighbors.

894
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,016
And the neighbors
don't comprehend and understand

895
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,319
what a wonderful resource
a local airport is.

896
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,588
How much it contributes
to the economy.

897
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,523
Thousands, millions of dollars.

898
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:04,493
Hundreds and thousands of people
being employed as a result.

899
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,195
The airport is a center

900
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,530
for not only interstate commerce
as it used to be,

901
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:10,132
but global commerce.

902
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,700
Flights are taking off
from Van Nuys

903
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,692
going to all four corners
of the world.

904
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:15,468
And we benefit by that.

905
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:19,071
Almost every airport I've flown into,

906
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,412
you can see petitions
of nearby residents

907
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,182
wanting to ban certain aircraft
or close the airport down.

908
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:30,085
If you want further information
to defend the airport,

909
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,553
you can till out the petition

910
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:33,555
with your name and e-mail
and things like that.

911
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:37,893
So, several airports
are experiencing this problem.

912
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,729
People that live
in airport community areas,

913
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,699
they all have the same problems
all the way across the country.

914
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,267
What they are concerned about,

915
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,636
they are watching
Van Nuys Airport for.

916
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,637
Because we have it all.

917
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,331
And as they watch us develop,
they learn.

918
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,409
And as they learn, hopefully,
we can keep these airports

919
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,645
from closing
all the way across the country.

920
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,880
Our members tell us

921
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,282
what the most important issue
in General Aviation is.

922
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,984
And that's the concern

923
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:06,183
for preserving our infrastructure
of GA airports.

924
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:12,294
We lose about one private airport
every single week in this country.

925
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,964
Reasons for losing these airports...
The land values.

926
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,033
As the urban sprawl
begins to happen,

927
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:22,404
as it has so dramatically
in the Los Angeles basin,

928
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,441
the land that these airports are on
begins to be worth more

929
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:30,279
used for homes, used
for shopping centers, et cetera.

930
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,616
Grand Central in Glendale,
all that's left today is the terminal,

931
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:37,986
and a street says "Airway Drive"
or something like that.

932
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:39,454
The terminal is still there.

933
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,657
It's still, you know,
it's being used

934
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,191
as a warehouse
or something today.

935
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:47,329
But, you can go back and look
and see all the airports

936
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,031
that have closed,
that used to be here.

937
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,898
Fifty-percent of the airports
are gone now.

938
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:53,467
It was kind of fun
to go to these different places.

939
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:57,773
I'll bet there was fifteen airports
in San Fernando Valley

940
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:58,969
when I was a little kid.

941
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,970
Now, there's only two or three left.

942
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:02,377
In my lifetime,

943
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:05,177
I've seen three local airports
just disappear.

944
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,645
And they're never
going to come back.

945
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,552
And Van Nuys
is one of those airports

946
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:13,589
that someday, it the politicians
get their way with it,

947
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,059
it'll be a shopping mall
or a housing project,

948
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:18,792
or an industrial park.

949
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:20,562
People by and large,

950
00:53:20,563 --> 00:53:25,057
do not realize
that it is not a renewable resource.

951
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,734
You can't lose it
and then bring it back again.

952
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:31,686
For more than twenty-five years,

953
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:35,744
mayors have wanted to close
Chicago's Meigs Field,

954
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,079
for various reasons.

955
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,680
The latest one, Mayor Daley,

956
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:42,050
for wanting to put in a park
named after his wife.

957
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:44,586
In the spirit of cooperation,
our organization said,

958
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:46,989
"Let's rename the airport
after your wife,

959
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,992
and leave it an airport and
put in a parklike setting there, too."

960
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,257
Because it was
such a valuable airport

961
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:54,863
for people who wanted
to do commerce

962
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,298
in the loop area of Chicago.

963
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,333
In the middle of the night
on March 30th, 2003,

964
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:04,172
bulldozers were sent in
by the mayor

965
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:06,267
in a dramatic thing
that we'd never seen before.

966
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:10,212
Instead of painting "X" s on a runway
to indicate that a runway is closed...

967
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,546
That's the official marker...

968
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:14,783
The bulldozers
actually dug trenches

969
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:19,085
two-feet deep in the cement so
the airport could not be used again.

970
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:21,957
The airport that had struggled

971
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,825
to be the little airport that could
for almost twenty-five years,

972
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:27,786
now was closed forever.

973
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,199
Most of us were kind of shocked

974
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,968
that somebody
could just go in there,

975
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,637
dig up the field and nobody
did anything about it.

976
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,265
And now the airport's gone.

977
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,375
It's scary, because what it says is,

978
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:43,744
somebody can go anywhere
and do that, and that's that.

979
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,880
And there was no warning,
no nothing.

980
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,616
Guys go out the next morning

981
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,176
to go flying
and the runway's plowed.

982
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,381
The airport's gone,
it's done, it's over.

983
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,353
So, when people do things
like they did at Meigs Field,

984
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,226
everybody goes,
"How did they get away with it?

985
00:54:58,227 --> 00:54:59,895
"How come nobody
did anything about it?

986
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,496
Isn't there anybody there
protecting it?"

987
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,599
It shouldn't've happened.
It just shouldn't've happened.

988
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,570
And that airport was sacrificed
for the wrong reasons.

989
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:09,905
It's another reason, though,

990
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:14,242
why I think that we need
to be constantly vigilant

991
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:15,904
of taking care of Van Nuys.

992
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,618
We've lost many, many
of our airports,

993
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,020
particularly in California,

994
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,055
which has a richness
of pilots and airports.

995
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:29,157
It's the number one state for both.

996
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:29,425
We lose a private airport,
we lose access.

997
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:32,527
We lose a private airport,
we lose access.

998
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:34,896
And it would be like
closing the off-ramps

999
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:37,165
on an interstate highway.

1000
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:41,069
Here was a network of runways
throughout the country

1001
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,061
that began to dwindle in number.

1002
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:44,774
It's a shame.

1003
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,075
Because we've been losing airports
through the years

1004
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:48,310
to the real estate developments.

1005
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,311
And it seems like

1006
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,846
there're no new ones being built.

1007
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,347
And every time
we lose an older one,

1008
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,579
it hacks away at our airport system.

1009
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,986
<i>Van Nuys Airport
Information November now current.</i>

1010
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,479
<i>Wind two-three-zero at niner.
Altimeter two-niner-seven-niner.</i>

1011
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,192
When people built houses
around Van Nuys Airport

1012
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:08,096
and the majority of traffic
were propeller driven airplanes,

1013
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:13,401
it was a totally different noise factor
than there is now,

1014
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:16,138
with a jet taking oft from the airport.

1015
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,233
When the runway ended
at the tunnel,

1016
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:23,011
the National Guard was flying,
the F-86 Sabre Jet.

1017
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,277
And they would take off in flights
of three or tour.

1018
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:30,619
Talk about noise...
They were noisy!

1019
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,854
And yet most people
didn't complain about it.

1020
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:36,525
Later the real estate people
came in and sold property

1021
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,654
South of the airport
and North of the airport.

1022
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:42,821
And then eventually,
which happens in a lot of cases,

1023
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,734
the airport became an obstacle.

1024
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,433
In other words, the homeowners
were complaining about the noise.

1025
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,001
They're loud.

1026
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:53,875
You know, they go
and they try to get up

1027
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,241
and they cut across.

1028
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:59,447
And you have to stop
your phone conversation

1029
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:00,649
or listening to someone

1030
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,348
it they're right at your patio
in the back or something.

1031
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,822
So you shut your mouth
for a few minutes

1032
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,018
and wait'll they go by

1033
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,851
We do have the community
around the airport that...

1034
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:20,336
That's what I meant.

1035
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:23,704
But it didn't used
to be that way, used to be...

1036
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,834
Now there goes one now.

1037
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:33,248
Sounds like an airplane.
And it should!

1038
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,480
Noise is a huge issue
around so many airports.

1039
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:41,022
And especially in California

1040
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:43,058
where the towns are just
growing and growing.

1041
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,026
And the traffic
around the airport

1042
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,052
and at the airport
is just increased.

1043
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,957
So, on both sides,
the population is growing,

1044
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,765
so are the airports.

1045
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,328
Sure, the Valley was very nice
before all the influx of people.

1046
00:57:57,773 --> 00:57:59,674
And they came here
because of Aerospace

1047
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:01,473
and all the jobs available here.

1048
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,636
And there's no way you're
going to stop a city from growing.

1049
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:07,148
Several of us
do get noise complaints

1050
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:08,617
over certain areas.

1051
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,685
Many times, though,
they don't know

1052
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:13,188
the circumstances
for that flight.

1053
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,991
We do mercy flights, Toys-for-Tots.

1054
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,094
We have the flying physicians
that fly outta here.

1055
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,662
Angels Flight,
where we're moving

1056
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,463
cancer patients from one city
to another for treatment.

1057
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,859
Flying children
in the Young Eagles program,

1058
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:29,471
where these kids are learning
about aviation...

1059
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,140
And having an opportunity
to really see what goes on

1060
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,775
from the front seat of an airplane.

1061
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,108
And thinking about careers
in aviation.

1062
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:38,377
This airport, as do many others,

1063
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:42,076
bring a lot of revenue
to the surrounding city.

1064
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:45,477
And a lot of the aircraft
do a lot of good.

1065
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,722
There's a lot of people
that are alive, today,

1066
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:49,291
and their houses are intact

1067
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,994
because of what we've done
with the helicopters

1068
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:56,331
and the airborne aspects
of firefighting and public safety

1069
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,934
Fires don't seem to have any logic.

1070
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,199
They don't break out
during eight-to-five hours.

1071
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,638
And pretty much at night,

1072
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:07,409
we have a good possibility
of locating the fire early on...

1073
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,477
Getting initial attacks started,

1074
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,379
so we keep a one-acre fire

1075
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,149
from becoming
a fifty-thousand acre fire,

1076
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,085
and causing death
and destruction and loss of homes.

1077
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,654
When I had my little house,
I was one of the complainers.

1078
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:21,423
Because they had a traffic pattern

1079
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,091
with helicopters
right over my house.

1080
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,293
And I was working two jobs
at nights and stuff like that.

1081
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:27,062
So I complained and they fixed it.

1082
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,197
You know, and everybody's
always tried to do that...

1083
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:29,999
Make it work.

1084
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,991
We change our approach and
departure routes for the helicopters

1085
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:36,805
so we don't continually fly
over the same neighborhood.

1086
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,307
And we try to fly
as high as possible

1087
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:42,744
within the realm of safety,
to not be a nuisance

1088
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,770
to the surrounding
residents of Van Nuys.

1089
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,682
And the industry itself
is correcting it.

1090
00:59:47,683 --> 00:59:49,684
Engines are being built quieter.

1091
00:59:49,685 --> 00:59:50,852
Airplanes are being built

1092
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,914
to conform with
environmental controls better.

1093
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,584
The things that a lot
of people've complained about,

1094
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,362
the coming of the jet airplane
to Van Nuys Airport,

1095
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,822
are going to disappear
with modern technology

1096
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,633
and new manufacturing.

1097
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:06,701
<i>Van Nuys Airport'
Information Motor.</i>

1098
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:07,636
<i>Van Nuys Airport'
Information Motor.</i>

1099
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,672
<i>Zero-two-zero-zero Zulu weather.</i>.

1100
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,341
Aviation has evolved
in a short hundred years

1101
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:16,878
from small kites
and a twelve-second flight

1102
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:19,147
to around-the-world flight
to spacecraft.

1103
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,412
No, we're not going to stop
the future of aviation.

1104
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:23,018
But at the same time,

1105
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,020
if they're taking away
all these airports,

1106
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,150
how is this other reality
and technology going to happen?

1107
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:29,858
It's important for us

1108
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,861
to safeguard
the General Aviation airports,

1109
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,388
like Van Nuys Airport,
like Meigs Field.

1110
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:39,067
Above all else,
the future of aviation

1111
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,934
requires airports like this.

1112
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,505
We can't handle all the types

1113
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,907
of activity that we want
in our aviation future

1114
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,610
at airports like
Los Angel es International.

1115
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,636
It just can't happen.

1116
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,690
<i>Cub, Four-Seven-Eight,
Runway One Six Right,</i>

1117
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:04,557
<i>from Ten Golf,
cleared for takeoff.</i>

1118
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:08,660
The United States is defined
by its industrialization,

1119
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:12,333
and the crown jewel
of the industrial age is aviation.

1120
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,969
It's a complex adventure
that you take

1121
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,105
into not only engineering aircraft,

1122
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,141
providing facilities for aircrafts
in the form of airports,

1123
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,770
and being able to take part
in the adventure of flying.

1124
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,713
Those airports
really serve as a monument

1125
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:29,184
to us achieving this realm
of industrialization.

1126
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,985
There's a lot of history
in us being able to achieve this.

1127
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,124
But, it would be nice
if we were able to preserve airports

1128
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,093
and their history
and their significance

1129
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,529
and impacts that it's made
to our day-to-day society

1130
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,230
If somebody had told me,

1131
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,833
the day I went to work
for United Airlines,

1132
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,103
"Before you retire,
you will be flying

1133
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:51,106
"an airplane that'll
hold almost 300 people.

1134
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:55,340
"You'll go 600 miles-an-hour
through the sky.

1135
01:01:56,145 --> 01:02:00,309
You'll be six miles up,
and you won't have any propellers,"

1136
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,712
I'd say, "Put that guy
in a straight jacket!"

1137
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,846
But that's exactly what happened.

1138
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,201
I think it's a vital part
of our community.

1139
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,302
I really do.

1140
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,838
I see kids go to
that viewing area,

1141
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,506
and they just sit there
and they watch airplanes.

1142
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:03,144
And that, to them, is a dream.
And it all starts

1143
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:05,807
in a gasoline-driven aircraft.

1144
01:03:06,615 --> 01:03:07,916
You gotta start somewhere.

1145
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,477
And to somehow think
that that isn't going to continue

1146
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,589
would be a very, very sad day.

1147
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:21,621
Because so many dreams begin
and end with the promise of flight.

1148
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:49,257
When I was growing up,
I had already soloed

1149
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,259
before my parents
even knew I was flying.

1150
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,887
They wouldn't even let me
drive the car.

1151
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,764
So I'd ride a bicycle out there.
But it was accessible.

1152
01:03:56,765 --> 01:03:59,067
I could get right up on the airport

1153
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,833
and ride that bicycle
right up to the hangar.

1154
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,097
There were a whole bunch of us,
and we all wanted to fly.

1155
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,541
And we did.

1156
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:37,539
I kind of wish

1157
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,871
they could subtract
about forty of my years,

1158
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,237
and I'd be out there
just having a ball.

1159
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,171
I'll guarantee you that.

1160
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,178
I've done a little
buzzing around here,

1161
01:04:47,816 --> 01:04:50,308
but, they can't prove it anymore.

1162
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:57,223
But yes, you learn to fly,
and you fly the way you feel.

1163
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:03,163
There's nothing like single-engine,
single-seat flying.

1164
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,034
When you got the power,

1165
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,526
you can get in and around
those white things up there.

1166
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,601
And, man,
it is just out of this world.

1167
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,302
They call 'em clouds.
