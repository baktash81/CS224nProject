1
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>"In the decade of the 1930s,
even the great city of Metropolis...</i>

2
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,132
<i>...was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.</i>

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>In the times of fear and confusion,
the job of informing the public...</i>

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>...was the responsibility
of the</i> Daily <i>Planet...</i>

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:02,396
<i>...a great metropolitan newspaper,
whose reputation for clarity and truth...</i>

6
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,526
<i>...had become a symbol of hope
for the city of Metropolis."</i>

7
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,154
This is no fantasy...

8
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,991
...no careless product
of wild imagination.

9
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,827
No, my good friends...

10
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:58,084
These indictments
I have brought you today...

11
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,506
...the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

12
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,303
...their acts of treason,
their ultimate aim of sedition...

13
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,937
...these are matters of undeniable fact.

14
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:24,194
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

15
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,197
...on those accused.

16
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,372
On this...

17
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,876
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

18
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,253
...are wanton violence and destruction.

19
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,883
On the woman, Ursa...

20
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,595
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

21
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,641
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

22
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,652
Finally, General Zod.

23
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,072
Once trusted by this council...

24
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,826
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

25
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,245
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

26
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:21,251
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

27
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,963
...with himself as absolute ruler.

28
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,759
You have heard the evidence.

29
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,096
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

30
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,597
<i>Guilty.</i>

31
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,684
<i>Guilty.</i>

32
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,936
<i>Guilty.</i>

33
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,191
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

34
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,653
It has therefore
now become your decision.

35
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,156
You alone
will condemn us if you wish...

36
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,284
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

37
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,461
Join us.

38
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,632
You have been known to disagree
with the council before.

39
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,469
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order...

40
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,512
...second only to my own.

41
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,224
I offer you a chance
for greatness, Jor-El!

42
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,519
Take it! Join us!

43
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,814
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

44
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,232
I swear it.

45
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:31,321
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

46
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,822
Both you...

47
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,990
...and then one day...

48
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,493
...your heirs!

49
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,822
No!

50
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,450
- Let us out of here!
- Help me!

51
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,584
- Forgive me!
- I shall return!

52
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,085
Forgive me!

53
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,754
I shall return!

54
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,760
You cannot ignore these facts.

55
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,472
It's suicide. No, it's worse.

56
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,849
It's genocide.

57
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>Be warned, Jot-EL.</i>

58
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:29,480
The council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

59
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,944
My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

60
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:40,116
I am not given to wild,
unsupported statements.

61
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,786
And I tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately.

62
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,291
It isn't that we question your data.
The facts are undeniable.

63
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,465
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

64
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,722
This planet will explode
within 30 days, if not sooner.

65
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,475
I tell you, Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

66
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,520
Jor-El, be reasonable.

67
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,857
My friend...

68
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,027
...l have never been otherwise.

69
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,321
This madness is yours.

70
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,241
This discussion is terminated.

71
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,328
The decision of the council is final.

72
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:50,019
Any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace...

73
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,232
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

74
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,527
You would accuse me of insurrection?

75
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,780
Has it now become a crime
to cherish life?

76
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,871
Will you abide by the council's decision?

77
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,962
I will remain silent.

78
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:22,051
Neither I, nor my wife
will leave Krypton.

79
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,438
Have you finished?

80
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,610
Nearly.

81
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,200
It's the only answer, Lara.

82
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:32,622
If he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will.

83
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,123
But why Earth, Jor-El?

84
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,959
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

85
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,796
He will need that advantage to survive.

86
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:46,636
Their atmosphere will sustain him.

87
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,687
He will defy their gravity.

88
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,315
He will look like one of them.

89
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,818
He won't be one of them.

90
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,694
No.

91
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,490
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

92
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,829
He'll be odd. Different.

93
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,084
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

94
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,004
Isolated, alone.

95
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,510
He will not be alone.

96
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,518
He will never be alone.

97
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:28,279
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

98
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,949
But we will never leave you...

99
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,745
...even in the face of our deaths.

100
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:41,918
The richness of our lives,
it will be yours.

101
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,797
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

102
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,800
...all this and more...

103
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,138
...l bequeath you, my son.

104
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:02,647
You will carry me inside you
all the days of your life.

105
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:09,779
You will make my strength your own,
see my life through your eyes...

106
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,990
...as your life
will be seen through mine.

107
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,705
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

108
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,337
This is all l...

109
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,800
All I can send you...

110
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,177
...Kal-El.

111
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,223
<i>which Einstein called...</i>

112
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,557
<i>...his theory of relativity.</i>

113
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,771
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

114
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,774
<i>...and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...</i>

115
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,236
<i>...spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

116
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:24,844
<i>Early Chinese writings
point out the complex relationships...</i>

117
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,599
<i>By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...</i>

118
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,273
<i>Chief among these powers
will be your sight...</i>

119
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,316
<i>...your strength, your hearing...</i>

120
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:44,321
<i>...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.</i>

121
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:49,493
<i>The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.</i>

122
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,621
<i>Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...</i>

123
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,624
<i>...contain their own individual law,
space and time.</i>

124
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,962
<i>It is forbidden for you
to interfere with human history.</i>

125
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,788
What was that?

126
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,105
Now, wouldn't that beat all get-out?

127
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,941
Will you--? You...

128
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,909
Pa...

129
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,745
Oh, my.

130
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,405
All these years,
as happy as we've been...

131
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,407
...how I've prayed the good Lord...

132
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,118
...see fit to give us a child.

133
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,122
Honey, will you hand me
that rag up there?

134
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,790
You take things easy, Jonathan.

135
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,501
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

136
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,428
Now, the first thing we've got
to do when we get home is find out...

137
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,596
...who that boy's proper family is.

138
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,767
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

139
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,190
Martha, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

140
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,487
We could say he's the child
of my cousin in North Dakota.

141
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,989
And just now orphaned.

142
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,952
- Oh, Martha.
- Jonathan, he's only a baby.

143
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,914
Martha...
Now, you saw how we found him.

144
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,171
Martha Clark Kent, are you
listening to what I'm saying?

145
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,923
Jonathan!

146
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,081
Come on, gang.

147
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,833
Come on.

148
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,711
- Great game, huh?
- Next week we'll knock them out.

149
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,047
All right.

150
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,674
Come on, gang, hustle. Let's go.

151
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,384
Stack your helmets neatly.

152
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,554
Remember about those uniforms.
Cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

153
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,765
...and looking like a football team.

154
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,892
Clark, have the clothes
washed and ready...

155
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,685
-...for tomorrow's game.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,229
Got to beat Mount Vernon High!

157
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,357
- Can you give me a lift?
- Home early!

158
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,698
Lana? Don't bother with these, huh?

159
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,576
I'll take them in with
the other equipment.

160
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,538
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

161
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,083
Listen, a whole bunch of us
are going up to Mary Ellen's...

162
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,876
...play some records...

163
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,045
Would you like to come?

164
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,716
Sure. Sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.

165
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,553
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

166
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,764
What are you talking about?
I just finished stacking all the--

167
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,307
- All that?
- Oh.

168
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,768
Oh, Brad.

169
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,897
- Hey, come on, Lana.
- Come on, Lana.

170
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,732
Come on, let's go.

171
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,943
- He's got to clean up.
- Bye, Clark.

172
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,779
- Yeah. Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

173
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,490
- Let's go.
- Bye, Clark.

174
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,285
- We're off to Mary Ellen's.
- See you, Clark.

175
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,453
All right.

176
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,248
- Bye, Clark.
- Bye, Clark.

177
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,626
Bye, Clark. See you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

178
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,645
Whoo-hoo!

179
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,854
Hey, look. There's Clark.

180
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,357
How come he's here?

181
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,526
Clark.

182
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,361
How'd you get here so fast?

183
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,031
- I ran.
- Ran, huh?

184
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,285
Told you he's an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

185
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,794
Been showing off a bit,
haven't you, son?

186
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,053
Uh...

187
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,392
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

188
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,274
It's just that, guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

189
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,318
Yeah. I know.

190
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,611
- Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
- Yeah, I know...

191
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,780
...you can do all these amazing things...

192
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,658
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

193
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,618
...unless you can tell people about it.

194
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,621
Yeah. I mean, every time
I get the football...

195
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,666
-...l can make a touchdown. Every time.
- That's for sure.

196
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,336
I mean, is it showing off
if somebody's doing...

197
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,131
...the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

198
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,468
No. No, now you listen to me.

199
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,803
When you first came to us,
we thought people...

200
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,639
...would come take you away
because when they found out...

201
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,477
...you know, the things you could do,
and that worried us a lot.

202
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,521
Then a man gets older,
and he thinks very differently...

203
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,441
...and things get very clear.

204
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,443
And there's one thing I do know, son...

205
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,030
...and that is you are here for a reason.

206
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,616
I don't know whose reason,
but whatever the reason...

207
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,785
...maybe it's because...

208
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,290
I don't know, it's...

209
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,835
But I do know one thing:

210
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,671
It's not to score touchdowns.

211
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,256
Huh?

212
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,509
Thanks, Dad.

213
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,804
I'll race you to it. Dad.

214
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,972
- You Will, huh?
- Come on. Come on, Pop, run.

215
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,225
Come on. Move. Move.
Yeah, go, go, go. Come on, run.

216
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,813
Hey, Baron! Hey, Baron. Hey, boy.

217
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,655
Oh, no.

218
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,548
Jonathan.

219
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,718
Jonathan!

220
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,851
Dad.

221
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,354
No!

222
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,693
Jonathan!

223
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,572
No!

224
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,653
All those things I can do...

225
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,240
All those powers...

226
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,245
And I couldn't even save him.

227
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,349
I have to leave.

228
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,649
I knew this time would come.

229
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,152
We both knew it...

230
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,487
...from the day we found you.

231
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,876
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday...

232
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:39,382
...and he said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

233
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,184
Mother...

234
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,187
I know, son.

235
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,565
I know.

236
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,781
Do you know where you're headed?

237
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,077
North.

238
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,418
Remember us, son.

239
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,088
Always remember us.

240
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,718
My son...

241
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,561
<i>...you do not remember me.</i>

242
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,230
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

243
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,732
<i>I'm your father.</i>

244
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,280
<i>By now, you will have reached
your 18th year...</i>

245
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,116
<i>...as it is measured on Earth.</i>

246
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,744
<i>By that reckoning,
I will have been dead...</i>

247
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,165
<i>...for many thousands of your years.</i>

248
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,793
<i>The knowledge...</i>

249
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,589
<i>...that I have,
matters physical and historic...</i>

250
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,926
<i>...l've given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.</i>

251
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:44,557
<i>These are important matters, to be sure,
but still matters of mere fact.</i>

252
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,853
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

253
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,773
<i>And it is time for you to do so.</i>

254
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,444
<i>Here in this...</i>

255
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,698
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

256
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,160
...we <i>shall try to find
the answers together.</i>

257
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,539
So, my son...

258
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,291
<i>...speak.</i>

259
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,085
Who am I?

260
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,671
<i>Your name is Kai-El.</i>

261
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:20,176
<i>You are the only survivor
of the planet Krypton.</i>

262
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,054
<i>Even though you've been
raised as a human being...</i>

263
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,139
<i>...you are not one of them.</i>

264
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,975
<i>You have great powers...</i>

265
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:32,230
<i>...only some of which
you have as yet discovered.</i>

266
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,234
<i>Come with me now, my son...</i>

267
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,237
<i>...as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement.</i>

268
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,907
<i>Traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions.</i>

269
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,494
<i>Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.</i>

270
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,747
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.</i>

271
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,668
<i>Rather, let your leadership
stir others to.</i>

272
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:59,840
<i>In this next year, we shall
examine the human heart.</i>

273
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,718
<i>It is more fragile than your own.</i>

274
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,095
<i>For the past two years--</i>

275
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:08,766
<i>As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...</i>

276
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,352
<i>...we'll enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...</i>

277
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,105
<i>...source of your strength
and nourishment...</i>

278
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,024
<i>...cause of our eventual destruction.</i>

279
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,028
<i>The planet Krypton, my son.</i>

280
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,532
<i>Your home, as it was.</i>

281
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:29,745
<i>This year, we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...</i>

282
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,707
<i>...and their basis in actual fact.</i>

283
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:37,545
<i>The total accumulation of all knowledge,
spanning the 28 known galaxies...</i>

284
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,090
...is <i>embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.</i>

285
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,301
<i>Study them well, my son...</i>

286
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,304
...and <i>learn from them.
We've reasoned out logical judgments.</i>

287
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,890
<i>By the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy...</i>

288
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,768
<i>...twelve of your years
will have passed.</i>

289
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:57,898
<i>For this reason, among others,
I have chosen Earth for you.</i>

290
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,402
<i>It is now time for you
to rejoin your new world...</i>

291
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,281
<i>...and to serve its collective humanity.</i>

292
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,908
<i>Live as one of them, Kal-El...</i>

293
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,620
<i>...to discover where your strength
and your power are needed.</i>

294
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:17,501
<i>Always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage.</i>

295
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>They can be</i> a <i>great people, Kai-El.
They wish to be.</i>

296
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,717
<i>They only lack the light
to show the way.</i>

297
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,972
<i>For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

298
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,725
...l have <i>sent</i> them you...

299
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,145
...my only son.

300
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,892
Okay, this is it, Mac, the <i>Daily</i> Planet.

301
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,144
Fresh fruit. Hey, lady,
how about a tomato?

302
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,188
Fresh fruit.
Hey, baby, how's it going?

303
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:23,651
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
They're so fresh...

304
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,987
Fresh fruit and vegetables.
Get them while they're hot.

305
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,657
Look at these tomatoes.
Aren't they beautiful?

306
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,089
He did a great job.
You see his article this morning?

307
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,558
Smile.

308
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,604
- How many T's in "bloodletting"?
- Two.

309
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,029
- What are you writing, Miss Lane?
- An ode to spring.

310
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,198
- How do you spell "massacre"?
- Uh...

311
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,703
- M-A-S-S-A-C-R-E.
- A...C...

312
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,580
...R-E. Thank you.

313
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,957
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

314
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,376
A good reporter doesn't
get great stories, Jimmy.

315
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,378
- A good reporter makes them great.
- Makes them great.

316
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,213
Here's that story
on the East Side murder.

317
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,467
I see it as a banner headline,
front page, maybe my picture--

318
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,761
There's only one P in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

319
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,222
- Told you one P.
- Hello, Miss Lane. How are--?

320
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,725
Remember my expose
on the sex and drug orgies...

321
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,477
...in the senior citizens' home?

322
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,645
How you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

323
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,732
- Oh, hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

324
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,943
It's got everything. It's got sex,
violence, the ethnic angle--

325
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,571
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

326
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,990
- Kent, can you open this?
- Oh, sure, Mr. White.

327
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,825
This could be a series of articles:

328
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,078
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings,"
by Lois Lane.

329
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,748
We get psychologists, sociologists--

330
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:04,502
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

331
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,296
- The <i>Daily Planet</i> has a tradition--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,091
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to shake it up like that.

333
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,177
Oh, of course not, Lois.

334
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,931
Why would anyone want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

335
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,602
<i>-L'll</i> take that.
- Oh, thank-- I'm sorry, Mr. White.

336
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,439
Olsen, why am I paying you when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

337
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,191
- Go get Mr... A towel.
- Kent.

338
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,817
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, chief.

339
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,861
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, chief.

340
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,447
- And don't call me sugar.
-"Blood is in Metropolis...

341
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,699
- Right, sugar.
-...while the crocuses bloom."

342
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,994
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

343
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,831
Lois, why don't you take Kent
out to meet everybody, huh?

344
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,210
Just introduce him around.
He's starting with the paper today.

345
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,795
I'm giving him the city beat.

346
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,799
Chief, that's my beat.

347
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:56,303
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just
a mild-mannered reporter, but listen...

348
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,848
...not only does he know how to treat
his editor in chief with respect...

349
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,560
...not only does he have a snappy
punchy prose style...

350
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,647
...but he is, in my 40 years in this
business, the fastest typist I've seen.

351
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,399
- That's great.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

352
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,859
Here, you forgot my article.

353
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,072
Oh, excuse me, Mr. White?

354
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,492
I was wondering if perhaps
you could arrange for half my salary...

355
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,579
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

356
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,330
- Your bookie, right?
- My what?

357
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,585
Don't tell me, he sends a check every
week to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

358
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,753
Actually, she's silver-haired.

359
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,674
I'll see what I can do.

360
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,385
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

361
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,220
Excuse me.

362
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,765
Well...

363
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,351
Any more at home like you?

364
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,687
Not really, no.

365
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,191
I didn't think so.

366
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,779
- Well, get yourself a desk over here.
- Over here?

367
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,907
Yeah, right here.
There are some papers in a pile--

368
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,286
Sorry. Excuse me.

369
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,546
- Yeah. It's fantastic.
- So you--?

370
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,215
- I met this really great guy.
- Hey, fabulous.

371
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,384
Yeah, fabulous.
I met him at this dude ranch.

372
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,471
- Did--? I used to ride.
- Yeah, I haven't been since I was 7.

373
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,724
- Oh, I gotta mail these letters.
- Okay, bye. Good luck tonight.

374
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,392
- Oh, hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

375
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,394
How did you like your first day?

376
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,065
Well, frankly, the hours
were sort of longer than I expected...

377
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,735
...but on the whole, I mean, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

378
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,487
...gosh, I'd say it's been swell.

379
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,239
- Swell?
- Yeah.

380
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:44,745
You know, Clark, there are
very few people left in the world...

381
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,081
...who feel comfortable
saying that word.

382
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,582
- What word?
-"Swell

383
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,293
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

384
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,087
Ooh!

385
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,631
-L'm sorry.
- Clark.

386
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,424
It's all right.

387
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,927
- Sorry, Lois.
- Oh, hi, Rex.

388
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,762
- Oh, Lois.
- See anything good today?

389
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,472
- Not until you came along.
- Lois?

390
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,349
- Oh, Rex, this is--
- Clark Kent.

391
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,976
- Yeah, hi, see you around.
- Bye.

392
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,648
- Lois?
- Hey, where you going?

393
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,484
- Can I help you with your coat?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

394
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,445
- So you like Mr. White.
- I thought he was a nice guy.

395
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,281
- Jimmy Olsen was fantastic.
- Hey, come here.

396
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,867
Come on, come on. Get in here.
Hurry up. Come on.

397
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:27,121
- We'd better get out of here.
- I think we'd better do what he says.

398
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,457
- Come on, come on. Get in here.
- Don't do anything.

399
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,000
- That's it.
- We're coming.

400
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,294
- Come on.
- We're coming. Excuse me.

401
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,671
- Go on, back there.
- Here?

402
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,798
Please don't point that at me, sir.

403
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,300
- You could hurt somebody with that.
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,303
- Okay, okay, hold it there.
- Just a minute, mister.

405
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,473
I realize of course that times
are tough for some these days...

406
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,142
...but this isn't the answer.

407
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:52,479
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

408
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,734
You know something, buddy? You're
right. I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

409
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,070
Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anybody.

410
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,321
Uh-huh.

411
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,324
- Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
- Of course.

412
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,493
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

413
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,246
Lois, I think maybe you better...

414
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,836
Lois, what are you doing?

415
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,227
Clark! Clark.

416
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:35,606
Clark, are you all right? Clark!

417
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,649
What happened?

418
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,027
Golly. I guess I must have fainted.

419
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,862
Fainted?

420
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,656
- You fainted?
- Sorry.

421
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,711
Swell.

422
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,464
Really, Lois, supposing that man
had shot you?

423
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:04,885
Is it worth risking your life over $10, two
credit cards, a hairbrush, and a lipstick?

424
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,388
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

425
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,476
You just described the exact contents
of my purse.

426
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,561
<i>Hm.</i>

427
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,815
Um, wild guess.

428
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,402
Taxi!

429
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,117
- Hey.
- Hi, Otis.

430
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,631
- So, what's happening, partner?
- Look what we got.

431
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,259
- Let's take him.
- Wait a minute.

432
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,262
Maybe he'll lead us
to the big man himself.

433
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,807
- Lex Luthor?
- You got it, Armus.

434
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,768
We'll make captain by midnight.

435
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,938
Hey, what do you read?

436
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,691
XK-101 rocket to be used.

437
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,442
Hey, what do you read?

438
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,152
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, hey, Otis.

439
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,530
<i>Just getting the Daily Planet</i> here.

440
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,532
Hey, what do you read?

441
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,951
Down, down.

442
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,619
<i>Okay , OWN-</i>

443
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,456
Okay. All right. See, I'm paying him.
I got a pretzel too.

444
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,168
Thanks, Otis. Okay.
How many did he take, Shutzy?

445
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,883
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

446
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,634
Let's go.

447
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,141
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

448
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,976
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

449
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,563
<i>The Metropolis Flyer is now
ready for departure...</i>

450
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,984
<i>...on the upper level, track six,
stopping at New Rochelle.</i>

451
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,321
All right, he's going down to the
train platform. I'm going after him.

452
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,907
Okay, Harry. I'll call for backup.
Be careful, now.

453
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,492
- All right, Armus, all right.
- All aboard, please.

454
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,830
<i>Now boarding on the lower level--</i>

455
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,249
Ten minutes, folks.
Come on, air-conditioned cars.

456
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,835
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie,
Glen Corners.

457
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,504
Aboard now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation.

458
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,175
Metropolis Transportation.
Buffalo, Syracuse.

459
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,178
Smoking cars are forward.
Move along, now.

460
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,721
Put your luggage up the top.

461
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,558
Smoking cars forward.
All aboard. Boarding.

462
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,964
Armus, Armus, make it track 22.

463
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,968
I seen him, and I'm right on him.
Lower level, track 22.

464
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,755
So that's it.

465
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,942
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

466
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,017
Ah!

467
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,444
Harry.

468
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,324
Harry, where are you? Harry.

469
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,666
Oh, no.

470
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,008
Harry...

471
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,762
Sick.

472
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:10,565
- Sick. You're really sick.
- Sick, Miss Teschmacher?

473
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,027
Sick, when I'm mere days from
executing the crime of the century?

474
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,114
No,no,no.
Step away from that, please.

475
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:22,202
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

476
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,038
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, no.

477
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,541
That would be too obvious, I grant you.

478
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,378
Charismatic. Fiendishly gifted.

479
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,296
Try "twisted."

480
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,721
Get away from there.
Get away, get away, get away!

481
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,724
Tell me something, Lex.

482
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,769
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

483
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,729
Why? You ask why?

484
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,899
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

485
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:58,113
Why is the most brilliantly
diabolical leader of our time...

486
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,407
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

487
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,450
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

488
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,245
Yes, I was just talking about you.

489
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,414
You were followed again.

490
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,421
In spite of those catlike reflexes.

491
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,260
Mr. Luthor. Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

492
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:21,928
Otis.

493
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,056
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

494
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,100
Yeah.

495
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,769
Why am I not reading it?

496
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,315
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

497
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,941
Right.

498
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,615
At last, it's official.

499
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,285
Thanks to the government,
we will pull off...

500
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,288
...the greatest real-estate swindle
of all time.

501
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,832
Lex, what is this obsession
with real estate?

502
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,959
All the time, "land, land, land."

503
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,129
Miss Teschmacher, when I was
6 years old, my father said to me--

504
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,505
"Get out."

505
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,802
Before that. He said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall.

506
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,305
Utilities and transportation systems
may collapse.

507
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,350
People are no damn good.
But they will always need land...

508
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,810
...and they'll pay through the nose
to get it."

509
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,812
"Remember," my father said...

510
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,856
- Land.
- Right.

511
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:20,153
It's a pity that he didn't see
from such humble beginnings...

512
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,988
...how I've created this empire.

513
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,657
An empire? This?

514
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,993
Miss Teschmacher,
how many girls do you know...

515
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,496
...who have a Park Avenue address
like this one?

516
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,414
Park Avenue address?

517
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,333
Two hundred feet below.

518
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,169
Do you realize what people
are shelling out up there...

519
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,339
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator?

520
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,175
What more could anyone ask?

521
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,349
- Olsen!
- Yeah?

522
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,519
Get this Loch Ness update
right into Composing.

523
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,564
Yeah? No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

524
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,776
- What are you standing around here for?
-l'm not--

525
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,529
- I wasn't gonna say it.
- Go.

526
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,202
- Ah, the sex maniac profile.
- Right.

527
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,038
Look, 9-5 it's a Pulitzer Prize winner.
What do you bet?

528
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,915
There's no Z in "brassiere."

529
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:16,376
Hey, nice job
on that union scandal, Kent.

530
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,712
Well, gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

531
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,716
Uh...

532
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,384
Oh, hi, Clark. Good night.

533
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,262
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

534
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,472
Lois, have you got a minute?

535
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,891
Excuse me, please. Lois?

536
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,395
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

537
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,481
Lois, I was wondering if you
would like to have dinner with me?

538
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,276
- Gosh, Clark, I'm sorry. I'm booked.
- Oh.

539
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:44,321
Air Force One's landing at the airport
and this kid's there...

540
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,158
...to make sure you-know-who answers
a few questions he'd rather duck.

541
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,785
- My goodness, don't you ever let up?
- What for?

542
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,913
I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.

543
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,083
Three kids, two cats,
and one mortgage. Yech!

544
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,752
I would go bananas in a week.

545
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,587
Oh, can I take you to the airport?

546
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,964
Not unless you can fly.

547
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,092
- Clark? Ladies.
- Sorry.

548
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,596
- Change my clothes. Thank you. Bye.
- Hey, Lois, maybe we could--?

549
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,309
Um...

550
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:16,811
Lois?

551
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:21,775
- Would you be a pet and mail that?
- Oh, sure-- Good night.

552
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,866
Oh. Going down, please. Going down.

553
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:35,205
- Going down?
- Going up, up, up.

554
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,792
Good night.

555
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,472
<i>MAN".
Daily Planet Copter One, this is ground.</i>

556
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,140

01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,427
A malfunction. Can't get liftoff.

563
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,971
- You hooked the <i>tail.</i>

564
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,223
<i>- Ah!
- Set it down.</i>

565
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,727
Oh, my God! We've lost stabilizer
rotor control, I can't hold it!

566
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,151
I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

567
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,253
Wake up!

568
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,008
Help!

569
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,094
Help! Help!

570
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,945
Come on, step back. Step back, folks.

571
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,281
All right, let's get back a little.
Move over across the street.

572
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,953
Bring the cameras over here. Okay.

573
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,622
Okay, you see the helicopter up there?

574
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,630
Help me!

575
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,807
All right, move back.
Let the ambulance through.

576
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,809
There's somebody in there!

577
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,814
Help me!

578
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,571
Okay. Come on, hold it. Get back.

579
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,160
Come on. Come on, get off the streets.
Come on, get back.

580
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,163
Move, let the firemen through.

581
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,583
Boys, come on, now. Make a line.

582
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,007
Move to the other side of the street.

583
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,176
Come on. Get along.

584
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,678
Get away from the building.

585
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,474
Hold these crowds back. Move. Move.

586
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,353
Help me!

587
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:46,039
- Say, Jim, whoa!
- Excuse me.

588
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,999
That's a bad outfit.

589
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:51,127
- Whoo!
- Okay, Bresslaw, move these people out.

590
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,597
Oh, God, look up there.

591
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,266
What the hell's that?

592
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,811
- Oh!
- Easy, miss. I've got you.

593
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,730
You-- You've got me?

594
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,899
Who's got you?

595
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:17,737
I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

596
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,450
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

597
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,289
Well, I certainly hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

598
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:15,628
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

599
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,339
Right. Wait.

600
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,637
Who are you?

601
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,806
A friend.

602
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,646
Bye.

603
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,054
Hi there. Something wrong
with the elevator?

604
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,722
Ah!

605
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,938
Going down.

606
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,404
Nah...

607
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,284
Officer.

608
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:16,415
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

609
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:19,418
Well, they say confession
is good for the soul.

610
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,755
I'd listen to this man.

611
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,757
Take him away.

612
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,262
Come on. Let's get out of here.

613
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,649
Move your ass. Come on. Come on.

614
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,319
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

615
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:30,489
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons.

616
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,408
Come on, let's get out of here.

617
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,327
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

618
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,495
- Freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot.

619
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,289
Be cool. You got us.

620
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,690
Bad vibrations?

621
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,027
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear, flying.

622
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,446
With a big red cape
and bright red boots, as well.

623
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,782
- Watch the desk.
- Quick as a wink, he was gone.

624
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,868
Flew up in the air again, he did,
like a big blue bird.

625
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,745
- A blue bird...
- You don't believe me.

626
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,705
-...with bright red boots.
- Flying.

627
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,415
Take off, go back to Murphy's bar.

628
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,709
- Continue what you started.
- Don't believe me.

629
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,546
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there myself.

630
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,392
Mooney, the first bottle's on me.

631
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:40,977
Let me get my hat.

632
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,614
Hey, Frisky,
will you come down from there.

633
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,910
Hi. I'll get him.

634
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,458
Come on. It's all right.

635
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,253
Here you go, miss.

636
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,089
- Gee, thanks, mister.
- Well...

637
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,134
...goodbye, Frisky. So long, now.

638
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:20,266
- Bye.
- Bye.

639
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,769
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

640
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,939
This man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

641
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,151
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies?

642
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,199
Metropolis Airport,
this is Air Force One.

643
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,952
- Could we have the weather report?
- Roger, Air <i>Force</i> One.

644
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,329
<i>Metropolis, currently
ceiling 500 overcast.</i>

645
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,457

Roger.

648
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,464
Well, it doesn't look too good.
What do you think?

649
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,301
- What the hell was that?
- What happened?

650
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,804
- You lost power in number one.
- Lost power? We lost the whole engine.

651
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,557
- Shut down one.
- Pull one throttle closed.

652
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,310
- Bring up 2 and 3.
- There's not enough pressure...

653
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,982
Mayday, mayday, Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

654
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,402
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

655
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,322
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

656
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,365
Ten miles southwest
of Metropolis Airport.

657
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,993
- Notify them the president's onboard.
- Position...

658
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,996
...10 miles southwest
Metropolis Airport.

659
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:27,958
Heading 3-0-5. Height, 6000 feet.

660
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,855
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

661
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,024
What the hell's going on out there?

662
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,402
Fly. Don't look. Just fly.

663
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,530
We got something.

664
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:02,535
I ain't saying what it is. Just trust me.

665
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,045
<i>Reports are coming in of

667
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:19,301

Your guess is as good as anybody's.</i>

670
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,108
<i>True or false, miracle or fraud?</i>

671
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,443
<i>- The answer to that...
- Miss Teschmacher!</i>

672
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,029
Turn it off.

673
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,790
Lex, what's the story on this guy?

674
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,834
Do you think he's the genuine article?

675
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,254
- If he is, he's not from this world.
- Why?

676
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,507
If any human being were gonna
perpetrate such a fantastic hoax...

677
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,593
...it would have been me.

678
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:12,438
Otis! My robe!

679
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,067
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

680
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,530
It all fits somehow,
his coming here to Metropolis...

681
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,116
...and at this particular time.

682
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,830
There's kind of a cruel justice about it.

683
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,957
To commit the crime of the century...

684
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,502
...a man would just naturally want to
face the challenge of the century.

685
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:41,342
Listen, Mr. Luthor, maybe this guy that
flies is just sort of passing through.

686
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,969
- You know?
- Passing through?

687
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,888
Not on your life, Otis...

688
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,557
...which I would gladly sacrifice,
by the way...

689
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:52,895
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

690
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,191
And, Otis, by the way, the next time
put my robe on...

691
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:59,318
...after I'm out of the pool.

692
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,822
Now look. The <i>Post:</i> "It flies."

693
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,242
The <i>News:</i> "Look, Ma, no wires."

694
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,369
The <i>Times:</i> "Blue bomb buzzes
Metropolis."

695
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,578
<i>The Planet:</i>

696
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,831
We have the story of the century here.

697
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,875
I want the name of
this whatchamacallit...

698
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:17,211
...to go with the <i>Planet</i>
like bacon and eggs...

699
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,339
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

700
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:24,677
I don't think he would lend himself to
any cheap promotion schemes, Mr. White.

701
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,887
Exactly how would you know that,
Kent?

702
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,514
Um...

703
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:31,100
Just a first impression.

704
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,852
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him partner if I have to.

705
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,562
- Right?
- Right, chief.

706
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,607
I want the real story.

707
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,193
I want the inside dope on this guy.

708
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,030
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the S stand for...

709
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,533
<i>"Tonight at eight. Your place.
Hopefully. A friend.</i>

710
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,784
How does he fly?

711
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,452
<i>A friend."</i>

712
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,250
Tony, who is he?
Mike, what's his name?

713
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,752
What's he got hidden under
that cape? Batteries?

714
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,296
Why did he show up last night?

715
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,715
Dick, where does he come from?

716
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,091
Does he have a girlfriend?

717
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,304
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

718
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,307
Now, listen to me.
I tell you, boys and girls...

719
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,475
...whichever one of you
gets it out of him...

720
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:16,562
...is gonna wind up with
the single most important interview...

721
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:20,482
...since God talked to Moses.

722
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,154
What are you standing around about for?

723
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,699
Move. Get on that story.

724
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,011
"Eight o'clock," he says. 8:00, 8:00.

725
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,721
Some friend.

726
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:54,725
The story of my life.
Cinderella bites the dust.

727
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,364
Good evening, Miss Lane.

728
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,327
Uh, hi.

729
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:15,454
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you have plans this evening?

730
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,040
Oh. Oh, this old thing-- No.

731
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,458
-It's no trouble...
- No.

732
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,043
-...to come later.
- Don't move!

733
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,463
Um... Or...

734
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,174
Sure, you can move.

735
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,510
Just don't fly away, all right?

736
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,554
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
Miss Lane...

737
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:35,140
...but there must be a lot
of questions about me...

738
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,685
-...that people would like answers to.
- Of course, yes.

739
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,485
You really shouldn't smoke,
you know, Miss Lane.

740
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:50,280
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

741
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,410
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

742
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,248
Would you like a glass of wine?

743
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,583
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

744
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,253
Nice place.

745
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,589
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

746
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,676
Should we get started
with the interview?

747
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,847
Oh. Thank you.

748
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:18,725
Well, let's start with your vital statistics.

749
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,686
Are you married?

750
01:22:20,853 --> 01:22:22,438
No. No, I'm not.

751
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,107
Do you have a girlfriend?

752
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:29,319
No, I don't, but if I did, Miss Lane,
you'd be the first to know about it.

753
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,035
Um, how old are you?

754
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,621
- Over 21.
- Oh, I get it.

755
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,623
You don't want anyone to
know how old-- Okay.

756
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:44,543
How big are you? How tall are you?

757
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,045
- About six-four.
- Six-foot-fou r.

758
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:51,133
- And how much do you weigh?
- Around 2, 225.

759
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,136
TWO-- 225?

760
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,973
<i>Hm.</i>

761
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:03,437
Well, I assume, then, that...

762
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:07,858
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

763
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,860
Sorry. I beg your pardon?

764
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,155
Well, putting it delicately...

765
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,077
...do you...

766
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:26,502
-...eat?
- Yes. Yes, I do. When I'm hungry.

767
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,172
You do. Of course you do.

768
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,425
Well. Well, then, is it true...

769
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:37,763
...that you can see through anything?

770
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,432
Yes, I can. Well, pretty much.

771
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:44,186
And that you're totally
impervious to pain?

772
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,271
Well, so far.

773
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,691
What color underwear am I wearing?

774
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,652
<i>Hm.</i>

775
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,614
-I'm sorry. I embarrassed you, didn't I?
- No.

776
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,324
- I did.
- No, no. Not at all.

777
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,702
It's just that this planter must be
made of lead.

778
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,121
- Yes, it is. So?
- Oh, you see, I...

779
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,499
...l sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

780
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,126
Oh, that's interesting.

781
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,212
"Problems seeing through lead."

782
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:14,007
- Do you have a first name?
- What, like "Ralph" or something?

783
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:15,884
- No. I mean like--
- Pink.

784
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,428
- Huh?
- Pink.

785
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,016
I'm sorry, Miss Lane.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

786
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,852
You didn't embarrass me.

787
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,063
Um... Uh...

788
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,440
What's your background?
Where do you hail from?

789
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,152
Well, that's kind of
hard to explain, actually.

790
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,864
You see, I'm from...
Well, pretty far away.

791
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,825
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.

792
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:42,452
- I come from a planet called Krypton.
- Huh?

793
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:44,246
Krypton.

794
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:49,751
Oh, Cripton. With a C-R-
...? No.

795
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,547
No, actually, it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

796
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:58,594
K-R-Y... Do you like pink?

797
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:06,184
I like pink very much, Lois.

798
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,691
'Why are you--?
-l'm sorry?

799
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,945
I mean, why are you here? There
must be a reason for you to be here.

800
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:21,116
Yes. I'm here to fight for truth
and justice and the American way.

801
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,120
You're gonna end up fighting
every elected official in this country.

802
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,289
I'm sure you don't really mean that, Lois.

803
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:28,540
I don't believe this.

804
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:29,750
- Lois?
- Hm?

805
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,127
I never lie.

806
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,088
Oh.

807
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:37,924
Um...

808
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,052
Uh-- Oh.

809
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:43,472
- Just how fast do you fly, by the way?
- I don't know, really.

810
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:46,224
You know, I never actually
bothered to time myself.

811
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,560
- No?
'Say...

812
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,480
...why don't we find out?

813
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,066
And how do you propose we do that?

814
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,817
Take a ride with me?

815
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,402
You mean I can fly?

816
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,988
Actually, I'd be handling the flying,
if that's okay.

817
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,325
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

818
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,661
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

819
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:08,121
What's the matter, don't want to go?

820
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,415
Okay. You don't need these.

821
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,751
I need a sweater.
It must be kind of cold.

822
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:14,753
You'll be warm enough.

823
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,261
- Ready?
- Clark...

824
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:27,683
...said that you're just a figment
of somebody's imagination...

825
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,351
...like Peter Pan.

826
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:32,104
Clark. Who's that, your boyfriend?

827
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,356
Clark? Oh, Clark. No, he's nothing.

828
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,774
- He's just a--
- Peter Pan, huh?

829
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,150
Uh-huh.

830
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:42,447
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

831
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,455
Ah!

832
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,396
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

833
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:08,653
<i>Do you know what it is
that you do to me?</i>

834
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,783
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

835
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,791
<i>Just a friend from another star.</i>

836
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:28,673
<i>Here I am, like a kid out of school...</i>

837
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,302
<i>...holding hands with a god.</i>

838
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,013
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

839
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:40,101
<i>Will you look at me, quivering.</i>

840
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:43,104
<i>Like a little girl, shivering.</i>

841
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,941
<i>You can see right through me.</i>

842
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,239
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

843
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,578
<i>Can you picture
the things I'm thinking of?</i>

844
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,210
<i>Wondering why you</i> are...

845
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,214
<i>...all the wonderful things you are.</i>

846
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:13,969
<i>You can fly.</i>

847
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:16,930
<i>You belong in the sky.</i>

848
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,558
You and I...

849
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:24,646
<i>...could belong to each other.</i>

850
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,275
<i>If you need a friend...</i>

851
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,781
<i>...l'm the one to fly to.</i>

852
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,996
<i>If you need to be loved...</i>

853
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,582
<i>...here I am.</i>

854
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,585
<i>Read my mind.</i>

855
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,151
Oh, we forgot to time ourselves.

856
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,360
Uh-huh.

857
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,821
Oh, well, maybe next time.

858
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,948
Oh.

859
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,166
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

860
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,336
Well, good night.

861
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,006
Oh, good night.

862
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:40,221
What a super man.

863
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,979
"Superman."

864
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:52,150
Lois? Lois?

865
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:56,988
Anybody home? Hello? Lois?

866
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,205
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

867
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:08,416
Lois, for goodness' sake,
did you even hear me knocking?

868
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,709
Uh-huh.

869
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:13,213
Lois, we did have
a date tonight, remember?

870
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,839
Oh.

871
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:19,552
- Lois? You haven't been:
- Oh, no, no.

872
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:24,265
Well, I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

873
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:25,767
-I'd better get a coat.
- Okay.

874
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,895
It might be kind of cold out.
No, I mean...

875
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:32,690
...l need a purse, and I have to
fix my hair, and...

876
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,859
...put some blush on...

877
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,293
Lois...

878
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:56,005
...there's something I have to tell you.
I'm really--

879
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:03,221
Urn, I mean, I was, at first,
really nervous about tonight.

880
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:07,600
But then I decided, well, darn it, I was
gonna show you the time of your life.

881
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,811
That's Clark, nice.

882
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:14,899
I was thinking maybe we could
go for a hamburger, or...

883
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,324
Now, then...

884
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,912
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

885
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:32,167
...and the proximity to our
own solar system...

886
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,920
...it's amazing.

887
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,840
Amazing. Too good to be true.

888
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:41,801
It's too good to be true.
He's 6'4", has black hair...

889
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:45,138
...blue eyes, doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke and tells the truth.

890
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,807
Miss Teschmacher, some people
read War and Peace...

891
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,852
...and come away thinking
it's a simple adventure story.

892
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,813
Others can read the ingredients
on a chewing gum wrapper...

893
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,815
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

894
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:01,279
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

895
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,451
Right. Right, Miss Teschmacher.

896
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,497
N, N, N...

897
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:14,375
M. You want M, Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

898
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,503
So there you go. M.

899
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,381
M, as in "moron," Otis?
No, no, no. It's N!

900
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,843
N, as in "Neanderthal,"
"nincompoop," "nitwit."

901
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,888
- And L, as in "ladder"!
- Ladder, Mr. Luthor. Coming right up.

902
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,474
I didn't see, because l...

903
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:32,518
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor. I-- Ooh!

904
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:36,898
In the interview, he says that
the planet Krypton...

905
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,568
...exploded in 1948.

906
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:45,740
Ridiculous little freak took three years
in a rocket ship to get to Earth.

907
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:51,371
- Ergo...
- Ergo. Ergo, 1948, three years...

908
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:52,914
He's 6'4", you know that?

909
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:56,751
Do you know why the number 200
is so vitally descriptive...

910
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,712
...to both you and me?
It's your weight and my IQ.

911
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,131
Now, think, people, think.

912
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,760
Deductive reasoning,
that's the name of the game.

913
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:12,392
Fragments from the planet Krypton
exploded and went into outer space.

914
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:16,604
It is reasonable to assume
that some of those particles of debris...

915
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,648
...drifted to Earth.

916
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:21,567
Meteorites.

917
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,781
Voilé!

918
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:32,954
Voilé.

919
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:35,290
Voilé.

920
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,752
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

921
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:44,882
Uh, I know I'm gonna get rapped
in the mouth for this, but so what?

922
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:48,803
So what? You mean, to us
they are just meteorites.

923
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:53,933
Fair enough. But the level
of specific radioactivity is so high...

924
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,687
...to anyone from the planet Krypton,
this substance is lethal.

925
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,315
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

926
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:04,610
You mean fire and bullets
can't hurt this guy, but this stuff here...

927
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,113
Will kill him.

928
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,656
- Oh.
- Oh.

929
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,325
Yeah, wow...

930
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,243
Doesn't it give you kind of a...

931
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:16,497
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

932
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:20,752
Not like the one you'll get
when you try to lay that rock on him.

933
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:24,172
He can see you coming from miles
with those super peepers of his.

934
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:28,259
Oh, Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see.

935
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:30,762
Nor can Superman, through lead.

936
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,183
He can't see through lead.

937
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,518
And kryptonite will destroy him.

938
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:42,815
- Any questions, class?
- Wow.

939
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:46,361
Wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa.

940
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:50,198
- Looks like a burnoose, a wraparound.
- There's gold, 24 karat...

941
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:53,743
- Are we going to Addis Ababa?
- ...not 18 karat gold.

942
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:56,537
<i>Mother Bird to missile convoy. Over.</i>

943
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:59,207
<i>Missile convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.</i>

944
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:02,168
<i>Everything looks good. See you at base.</i>

945
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:06,506
- Over <i>and out.
- Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.</i>

946
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,344
- Man, look at this.
- Whoo-wee. Looks pretty bad.

947
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,100
- Think she's dead?
- Better check her pulse.

948
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,778
All right, get an ambulance down here.

949
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,614
I don't wanna hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

950
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:16,868
She's having trouble breathing, sir.
What do you think?

951
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:19,454
Well, I suggest
vigorous chest massage.

952
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,290
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

953
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:23,916
Yes, sir.

954
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:27,628
Sergeant, I won't have one of my men
doing anything I wouldn't do myself.

955
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,922
- Yeah, but, sir--
- Get an ambulance.

956
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:32,091
All right, men. Gather around.

957
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:34,886
About face!

958
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:03,498
Hi.

959
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,082
Somebody hurt?

960
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:20,973
Ah.

961
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:25,520
I did it. I did it, Mr. Luthor,
Miss Teschmacher.

962
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,981
- I did it, just like you told me.
- All right, Otis. All right.

963
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:32,985
All right, Otis. Listen,
it isn't that I don't trust you, but...

964
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,530
I don't trust you, Otis.
What did you do?

965
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:38,950
Well, I-- I set the first...

966
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,161
...directional vector to 38...

967
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:46,374
...the second one to 67,
and the third one to 117.

968
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:49,627
- What about the fourth one?
- What fourth one?

969
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:53,047
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The third one to 117?

970
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,633
Yes. See? I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
I wrote it--

971
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,969
Otis. Otis!

972
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:01,806
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, seven.

973
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:05,685
Oh. Well, gee, Mr. Luthor.

974
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:08,396
Oh, I see. I guess my arm
wasn't long enough, see?

975
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:11,148
Otis, would you like to see a long arm?

976
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,193
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very long arm?

977
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:17,572
- Oh, no, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis. Otis!

978
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:18,990
Ah!

979
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:33,713
- All right, get it right, will you?
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

980
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:38,843
McDonald, I thought you told me
this road was blocked off.

981
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:42,388
- Jablonski, you said it was blocked.
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.

982
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:46,225
All right, follow me. Follow me, men.

983
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:50,271
- Back that thing off the road.
- Back that thing up out of here.

984
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:56,527
You fellas get back into that thing
and back it off the road.

985
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,904
We got a convoy coming through here.

986
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,618
Listen, you're gonna have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

987
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,369
Heck of a day, isn't it?

988
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:12,627
We took the wrong turn.
We were looking for Route 12.

989
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:16,297
- Route 12? That's back there, isn't it?
- No, sir. It's up there.

990
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:22,011
- Sergeant, we took the wrong route.
-l'm a lieutenant, a naval officer.

991
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,895
Shut up!

992
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,813
Route 12 is back that way.

993
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:41,155
This man is a diabetic.

994
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:54,418
As you know, my newspaper,
the <i>Daily</i> Planet...

995
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,005
...is very interested in that darn,
but what I don't understand...

996
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,758
...is why you'd sell out
to a person you've never met.

997
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:03,177
I mean, you don't even
know his name. Oh, yeah.

998
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:08,849
At the stupid- high price he offered...

999
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:13,688
...for this worthless piece of desert,
I hope it's Custer.

1000
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:18,025
Perfect.
That's just what I need, thank you.

1001
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:22,613
<i>Reporting live from the launch site,
ground zero.</i>

1002
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:26,117
<i>Well, today marks an historic occasion.</i>

1003
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:31,372
<i>Two XK 101 rockets
will be launched simultaneously...</i>

1004
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:34,208
<i>...one by the Army and by the Navy.</i>

1005
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:36,711
Hi, everybody. Has anybody
seen Lois around today?

1006
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,046
No, I haven't, but the chief
wants to see you.

1007
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,632
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1008
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:45,720
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today, okay?
Good? Great.

1009
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,680
- Excuse me, Mr. White?
- Come in, Kent.

1010
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:50,725
You wanted to see me?
Sir, have you seen Lois anywhere today?

1011
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,894
She's out west looking into
a land fraud deal.

1012
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:56,731
Sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1013
01:43:56,897 --> 01:44:00,067
Some unidentified clown out there
is buying up thousands of acres...

1014
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,570
...of worthless desert
at incredible prices.

1015
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:04,321
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1016
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:07,324
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that by now.

1017
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,827
Look at this dispatch
from Addis Ababa.

1018
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,997
People break into a museum
at night, kill two people...

1019
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:15,833
...and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.

1020
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,543
- How do you figure that?
- Well...

1021
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:20,921
...frankly, I've never been able
to understand violence in any form.

1022
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:25,217
I know that about you, Kent. That's one
of the reasons I wanted to talk to you.

1023
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:29,013
I've been in this news game 40 years,
man and boy.

1024
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:32,516
And I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

1025
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:36,437
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1026
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,773
- Humility?
- No, not humility.

1027
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:40,733
You got bags of humility.

1028
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:43,360
Aggression, confidence,
that's the ticket.

1029
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,446
Take charge. Let people know
who you are.

1030
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,123
<i>This</i> is <i>Lex</i> Luthor.

1031
01:44:56,290 --> 01:45:01,086
<i>Only one thing with less than four legs
can hear this frequency, Superman: You.</i>

1032
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:03,881
<i>In approximately five minutes,
a poison gas pellet...</i>

1033
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,759
<i>...containing propane-lithium
compound...</i>

1034
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:09,720
<i>...will be released through
the city's air ducts...</i>

1035
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:13,224
<i>...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.</i>

1036
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:16,769
I was a reporter before
most of my friends were copy boys.

1037
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:19,772
I want you to do that.
Get Lois to introduce you to Superman.

1038
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:23,150
Find out who he is. What's he like?
Where'd he get that blue suit?

1039
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:26,487
Did he have it made?
ls it silk? ls it plastic?

1040
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:30,324
<i>I know it all seems a bit much,
but how else was I going to meet you?</i>

1041
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:34,995
<i>I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.</i>

1042
01:45:35,704 --> 01:45:41,293
<i>But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...</i>

1043
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:46,257
<i>...well, I just knew you couldn't resist
the chance to sort cf pitch in.</i>

1044
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,217
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

1045
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:07,236
It's Superman.

1046
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:18,956
- Look.
- Oh, my God!

1047
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:25,045
<i>There's a strong streak of good
in you, Superman...</i>

1048
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:28,048
<i>...but then, nobody's perfect.</i>

1049
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:32,344
<i>Almost nobody.</i>

1050
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,896
- What the--?
- Oh, Superman.

1051
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:44,315
- Gee.
- Stand back, please. Stand back.

1052
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,275
Nothing to get worried about.

1053
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,782
Well, don't just sit there. Get out.

1054
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:55,659
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1055
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,222
He's definitely coming, Mr. Luthor.

1056
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:30,611
It's open. Come in.

1057
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:35,908
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1058
01:47:36,075 --> 01:47:37,952
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1059
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:47,127
- I don't think he wants me to, Mr. Luthor.
- Luthor, where's the gas pellet?

1060
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,046
Somewhere...

1061
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:55,719
...in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1062
01:47:55,886 --> 01:48:00,099
Is that how your warped brain gets its
kicks? Planning the death of innocents?

1063
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:03,978
No, by causing the death
of innocent people.

1064
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,729
Fire.

1065
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:10,818
<i>Navy Bird, we have a launch.</i>

1066
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:14,405
<i>Navy missile, XK 101.</i>

1067
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:15,990
<i>Angle of attack is perfect.</i>

1068
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:20,327
<i>- Climbing fast.
- Hydraulics, general function.</i>

1069
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:24,581
Now, as you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1070
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:27,167
...very heavy into real estate.

1071
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:31,755
To make money in that game, you have
to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1072
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:34,258
- Right.
- Right.

1073
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:37,177
So the problem:

1074
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:40,180
How to make land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1075
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,391
...and the time you sell it.

1076
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:47,438
Now, this is California, the richest,
most populous state in the union.

1077
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:50,691
I don't need a geography lesson
from you, Luthor.

1078
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:55,112
Oh, yes, of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1079
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:57,448
- Where was I?
- California.

1080
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:01,118
California, right. The San Andreas Fault.
Maybe you've heard of it?

1081
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:05,039
Yes. It's the joining of two land masses.
The fault line is unstable...

1082
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:07,833
...which is why you get earthquakes
in California.

1083
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,919
Wonderful.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1084
01:49:11,128 --> 01:49:15,466
Everything west of this line
is the richest real estate in the world.

1085
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:18,302
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1086
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:23,223
Everything on this side is just hundreds
of miles of worthless desert land...

1087
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:24,975
...which happens to be owned by...

1088
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,979
Lex Luthor, Incorporated.

1089
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:33,567
Now, call me foolish,
call me irresponsible...

1090
01:49:33,734 --> 01:49:37,029
It occurs to me
that a 500-megaton bomb...

1091
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:40,032
“planted at just the proper point,
would...

1092
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,576
Would destroy most of California.

1093
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:47,164
Millions of innocent people would die.
The West Coast as we know it would--

1094
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:51,668
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1095
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:55,047
Hello, new West Coast.
My West Coast.

1096
01:49:57,466 --> 01:50:00,969
Costa del Lex, Luthorville,
Marina del Lex, Otisburg--

1097
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:06,266
- Otisburg?
- Miss Teschmacher...

1098
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:08,769
-...she's got her own place, Mr.--
- Otisburg?

1099
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:11,939
-It's a little-bitty place.
- Otisburg?

1100
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:15,109
Okay. I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
It's a little town.

1101
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:18,529
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A sick, twisted dreamer.

1102
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,948
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1103
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:26,203
I'll admit there were a few problems.
Adjusting the trajectory of the missile...

1104
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:30,082
...finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself.

1105
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:34,002
Which, by the way,
is target zero, right...

1106
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,629
...here.

1107
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:37,047
Ooh.

1108
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:08,162
- What's happening, lieutenant?
- Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1109
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:13,167
- Then abort.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,007
Function negative, sir.

1111
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:23,010
- Can't you knock them down?
- Absolutely impossible, sir.

1112
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:25,846
They have the new B-20 low-level
avoidance systems.

1113
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:27,764
Get me the Pentagon.

1114
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:37,691
Well, what do you think, Supe baby?
Interesting?

1115
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:42,446
- Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
- Otis, would you go to the viewing room?

1116
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:46,033
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1117
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,203
Fantasy? No. No.

1118
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:52,372
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1119
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:54,208
Miss Teschmacher!

1120
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:01,965
- Yes, Lex?
- Where's the rocket now?

1121
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:05,886
It's going like a bat over the
Grand Canyon. So is the other one.

1122
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:09,097
The other one? There's two of them?

1123
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,561
Yeah, Superman. Double jeopardy.

1124
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:17,689
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1125
01:52:17,856 --> 01:52:21,360
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1126
01:52:21,526 --> 01:52:25,113
All right, Luthor. Where is it?
Where's the detonator?

1127
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:40,504
You diseased maniac.

1128
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:43,882
Did you really think you could hide it
from me by encasing it in lead?

1129
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,930
<i>-L'll</i> mold this box into your prison bars.
- Don't touch that.

1130
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:01,775
I told you. It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

1131
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,279
I've spared no expense
to make you feel right at home.

1132
01:53:12,244 --> 01:53:16,873
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason...

1133
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,251
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1134
01:53:19,418 --> 01:53:23,088
...this old, diseased maniac...

1135
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:25,424
...would be your banker.

1136
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:30,721
Mind over muscle.

1137
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:42,899
You don't even care where
the other missile's headed, do you?

1138
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:47,487
Certainly, I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.

1139
01:53:47,696 --> 01:53:49,323
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1140
01:53:55,203 --> 01:53:57,914
I have to leave you now.
No hard feelings.

1141
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:02,085
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.

1142
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:20,354
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1143
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:32,741
Miss Teschmacher!

1144
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:52,552
<i>Both birds uncontrolled.</i>

1145
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:54,012
<i>Impossible to reset.</i>

1146
01:55:00,185 --> 01:55:01,645
Otis.

1147
01:55:20,163 --> 01:55:22,165
Miss Teschmacher.

1148
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:24,292
Miss Teschmacher.

1149
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:28,505
Please, you can't...

1150
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,006
You can't just stand there.

1151
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:32,175
Shh.

1152
01:55:33,552 --> 01:55:35,053
You can't just stand there...

1153
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:38,056
...and let innocent people,
millions of innocent people, die.

1154
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:40,809
Maybe.

1155
01:55:41,726 --> 01:55:44,229
Please. Please help me to save them.

1156
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:48,817
If I help you, do you promise
to save my mother first?

1157
01:55:50,026 --> 01:55:52,070
But Lois and Jimmy...

1158
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:53,613
Oh, but my mother comes first.

1159
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:57,325
If you promise me, I'll believe you,
because you always tell the truth.

1160
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:02,330
I promise. I promise.

1161
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:59,262
Why did you kiss me first?

1162
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:03,642
It-- I didn't think you'd let me later.

1163
01:57:04,643 --> 01:57:06,603
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1164
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:10,815
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1165
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:17,155
Stand aside, now.

1166
01:57:17,322 --> 01:57:18,990
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1167
01:57:37,551 --> 01:57:39,219
<i>Army bird still heading due east.</i>

1168
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:42,847
<i>- Navy bird still heading due west.
MAN 2". Losing radar contact.</i>

1169
01:57:43,014 --> 01:57:45,058
<i>Next radar contact in 3 seconds.</i>

1170
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:46,977
<i>--Intercept both birds.</i>

1171
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,707
Army bird still headed east, sir.

1172
01:59:03,595 --> 01:59:05,930
<i>- Army bird gaining altitude.</i>
- Miss <i>Teschmacher.</i>

1173
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:09,142
<i>- Radar contact strong.
- We have straight climb.</i>

1174
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,311
Miss Teschmacher!

1175
01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,813
<i>Radar report,
Navy bird, San Andreas area.</i>

1176
01:59:14,022 --> 01:59:16,399
<i>Heading down.
Fifteen seconds to impact.</i>

1177
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:19,027
<i>Navy bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.</i>

1178
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:21,112
<i>Fifteen seconds and counting.</i>

1179
01:59:38,672 --> 01:59:40,757
<i>- Impact: San Andreas.
- God!</i>

1180
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,954
Oh.

1181
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:19,504
<i>We interrupt the program for a <i>newsflash.</i></i>

1182
02:00:19,671 --> 02:00:23,007
<i>A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.</i>

1183
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:26,553
<i>The force of the explosion
has activated the San Andreas Fault.</i>

1184
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:29,389
<i>California is suffering
a major earthquake.</i>

1185
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:51,661
Ah!

1186
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:53,913
What's going on?

1187
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:56,833
It's a quake. Look!

1188
02:01:10,847 --> 02:01:12,140
Look out!

1189
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:24,694
Get to the back of the bus!

1190
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,778
Okay, kids. It's all right now.

1191
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:08,613
Thank God, we're back on the bridge.

1192
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:11,241
- Hey, it's Superman.
- It's Superman!

1193
02:02:18,206 --> 02:02:20,291
Holy mackerel!

1194
02:02:21,251 --> 02:02:22,335
Going off the tracks!

1195
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:26,339
Hang on!

1196
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:31,219
I can't hold her!

1197
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,623
<i>All personnel, evacuate the dam.</i>

1198
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,500
<i>All personnel, evacuate the dam.</i>

1199
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:04,627
Ah!

1200
02:03:12,468 --> 02:03:14,178
Watch that cable!

1201
02:03:14,345 --> 02:03:15,889
MY eyes! I can't see!

1202
02:03:21,519 --> 02:03:23,229
Someone try and pull the main!

1203
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:25,648
It's impossible, it's red-hot!

1204
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:36,492
- Gentlemen, is that man all right?
- Yeah.

1205
02:03:59,682 --> 02:04:02,518
- Ah--!
- Hang on, Jim.

1206
02:04:12,236 --> 02:04:13,529
The dam burst!

1207
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:16,950
Forget the car! Come on, come on!

1208
02:04:21,204 --> 02:04:23,206
You're safe here, son.

1209
02:04:24,374 --> 02:04:26,542
That's okay!
Miss Lane will be driving by soon.

1210
02:04:36,386 --> 02:04:38,388
- Come on, George.
- Make for the hill.

1211
02:04:45,395 --> 02:04:48,648
<i>There's been major
quake damage to Southern California.</i>

1212
02:04:48,856 --> 02:04:51,401
<i>The San Andreas Fault
has miraculously sealed itself...</i>

1213
02:04:51,567 --> 02:04:56,072
<i>...yet Southern California is suffering
major aftershocks of a major earthquake.</i>

1214
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,241
<i>The population is warned
to be aware of...</i>

1215
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:01,744
Please, come on, turn over.

1216
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,788
<i>-...which in some areas has--
- Come on'.!</i>

1217
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:33,276
Help me. Help me.

1218
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:28,766
<i>Lois.</i>

1219
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:27,737
No,no,no““

1220
02:10:28,738 --> 02:10:31,574
No... No...

1221
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,339
<i>My</i> son.

1222
02:10:46,589 --> 02:10:49,592
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
in human history.</i>

1223
02:10:49,759 --> 02:10:54,972
<i>JONATHAN". One thing I do know, son,
and that is you are here for a reason.</i>

1224
02:10:55,139 --> 02:10:58,267
<i>- It is forbidden for you to...
- Those things I can do...</i>

1225
02:10:58,434 --> 02:11:01,771
<i>...all those powers,
and I couldn't even save him.</i>

1226
02:11:01,937 --> 02:11:03,606
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1227
02:11:05,983 --> 02:11:08,235
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1228
02:12:33,195 --> 02:12:34,613
Hi.

1229
02:12:36,031 --> 02:12:37,450
Don't bother, I think it's dead.

1230
02:12:39,368 --> 02:12:41,412
Sure it's dead.

1231
02:12:42,538 --> 02:12:45,958
The problem with Men of Steel, there's
never one around when you want one.

1232
02:12:46,125 --> 02:12:48,461
Know what happened to me
while you were off flying?

1233
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:50,212
I was almost in an earthquake...

1234
02:12:50,379 --> 02:12:52,381
...l had this gas station blow up...

1235
02:12:52,548 --> 02:12:54,884
...there's telephone poles
falling all over...

1236
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:57,887
...l'm almost killed,
and to top the whole thing off...

1237
02:12:58,053 --> 02:12:59,638
...this stupid car runs out of gas!

1238
02:12:59,847 --> 02:13:01,724
I'm sorry about that, Lois...

1239
02:13:01,891 --> 02:13:04,059
...but I've been kind of busy for a while.

1240
02:13:06,604 --> 02:13:09,064
I'm sorry. That's all right.

1241
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:20,367
Hey!

1242
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:22,161
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1243
02:13:22,578 --> 02:13:25,164
You put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1244
02:13:25,372 --> 02:13:27,416
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.

1245
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:30,252
- I had no idea if you were coming back--
- Jimmy.

1246
02:13:31,587 --> 02:13:34,924
Listen, there's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1247
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:39,678
He can't stay still for a second.

1248
02:13:40,804 --> 02:13:42,932
Oh. Golly, Miss Lane...

1249
02:13:43,098 --> 02:13:45,142
...it's too bad
Mr. Kent didn't see all this.

1250
02:13:45,309 --> 02:13:46,810
Yeah, poor Clark.

1251
02:13:46,977 --> 02:13:48,979
He's never around when S--

1252
02:13:49,396 --> 02:13:50,773
Clark-- Wait a minute.

1253
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:52,691
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1254
02:13:54,276 --> 02:13:56,487
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea ever.

1255
02:13:56,654 --> 02:14:00,449
Let me tell you something, Miss Lane,
I think he really cares about you.

1256
02:14:00,616 --> 02:14:02,660
- Clark? Of course he does.
- No, not Clark.

1257
02:14:05,287 --> 02:14:09,833
Oh, well, Superman cares
about everybody, Jimmy.

1258
02:14:10,292 --> 02:14:14,630
<i>But, who knows, someday,
you know, if he's lucky...</i>

1259
02:14:26,934 --> 02:14:28,519
You're messing up my suit.

1260
02:14:28,686 --> 02:14:30,479
You big lummox, you.

1261
02:14:30,646 --> 02:14:32,690
Come on, stop it, will you?

1262
02:14:32,856 --> 02:14:35,484
Otis, it's your fault.
Watch the ground!

1263
02:14:36,193 --> 02:14:37,528
Good evening, warden.

1264
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:39,488
These two men should be safe here...

1265
02:14:39,655 --> 02:14:42,032
-...until they can get a fair trial.
- Who is it?

1266
02:14:44,493 --> 02:14:46,036
Lex Luthor!

1267
02:14:46,203 --> 02:14:48,998
- The greatest criminal mind of our time!
- Of our time!

1268
02:14:49,164 --> 02:14:50,708
- I hereby serve notice...
- Notice.

1269
02:14:50,958 --> 02:14:52,668
...that these walls--
- These walls here...

1270
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:54,003
Will you shut up, please?

1271
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:55,671
All right, take them away, boys.

1272
02:14:55,838 --> 02:14:58,215
- You nitwit. Nincompoop!
- Guard, guard...

1273
02:14:58,382 --> 02:15:02,511
This country is safe again, Superman,
thanks to you.

1274
02:15:02,678 --> 02:15:04,680
No, sir. Don't thank me, warden.

1275
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:07,516
We're all part of the same team.

1276
02:15:07,683 --> 02:15:09,184
Night.
