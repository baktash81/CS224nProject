1
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,889
All right, all right. All right, all right.

2
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,529
Never

3
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,928
say

4
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,124
no.

5
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,545
Well, this is Kingman's
defining moment, Marv.

6
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,282
If they win, they guarantee themselves
a spot in the playoffs.

7
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,721
Everybody get on the King's back

8
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,520
and I'm going to lead you
to the promised land.

9
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,822
- All right? On one, on one. Ready?
- Break!

10
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,089
Go deep.
Watch your left!

11
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,164
Let's go!

12
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,960
Pick him up. Pick him up.

13
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,766
Sanders. Sanders.

14
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,493
Go wide!

15
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,800
Hut-hut!

16
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,896
Hut!

17
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,109
<i>All right, here's
Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.</i>

18
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,339
<i>He's got Sanders wide open
in the end zone.</i>

19
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,408
<i>Kingman is on the run.
He's inside the five.</i>

20
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,148
<i>He stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.</i>

21
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,414
<i>And he is in! Touchdown, Rebels.
They've won it.</i>

22
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,322
<i>What a
tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.</i>

23
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,792
<i>But I have to wonder,
yesterday he was...</i>

24
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,760
The King does it again!

25
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,160
- Go Joe!
- Go Joe!

26
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,136
- Never say no!
- Never say no!

27
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,209
Yeah!

28
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,657
<i>WZPZ FM.</i>

29
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,987
<i>Hey, Boston. Happy New Year.
And a special shout out to our Rebels.</i>

30
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,561
<i>Don't party too hard, boys.</i>

31
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,497
<i>You're going to need all your strength
to bring home that championship.</i>

32
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,066
- Enjoy your drink.
- To us.

33
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,194
Hope it's okay.

34
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,637
I'm telling you guys,
these aren't the normal onion rings.

35
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,609
They got garlic and mint leaves.
I mean, like, beluga caviar.

36
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,942
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.

37
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,142
- See the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,843
I think she said
you have a killer smile, bro.

39
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,214
I do.

40
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,685
You should go talk to her.

41
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,781
- You think so?
- I know so. Come on.

42
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,988
Get in there. Get in there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.

43
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,859
Use some of this. Chicks dig it.

44
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,398
- Webber, you got a pen?
- Why?

45
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,264
Because you might want
to take some notes.

46
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,171
What's up?

47
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,414
Webber!

48
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,655
I told you, they bumped up shoot.
I have to catch last flight to Paris.

49
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,618
But Tatianna will miss you.

50
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,165
The King doesn't want his queen
to miss him too much.

51
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,391
So I got you a little something special.

52
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,229
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

53
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,934
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one?
Which one?

54
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,407
No peeking.

55
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,206
Dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.

56
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,847
Happy New Year.

57
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,475
- Channel?
- Or Chanel.

58
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,185
Whoa, Sanders.
Where you going?

59
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,854
Just past your bedtime?

60
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,228
Yeah, well, you know,
it's New Year's Eve.

61
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,494
Want to go home,
hug the wife, kiss the kids.

62
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,127
All right, thanks for coming.
Happy New Year.

63
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,998
- All right, Happy New Year.
- All right, see you at practice.

64
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,540
All right, see you.

65
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,971
All right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.

66
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,409
Now, just give me back the wallet,
all right?

67
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,539
I'm looking to confiscate
Sanders' man card,

68
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,015
but his wife, Maria,
has already done it.

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,083
- Yes, really...
- Come on. Get a life, Sanders.

70
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,855
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

71
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,521
Oh, you call this "life"?
That ain't life, Joe.

72
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,759
- Whatever.
- He's mad. That was funny, man.

73
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,296
- Who's ready to party?
- I am.

74
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,766
Party!

75
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,234
Yeah!

76
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,598
Where can I get a man card?

77
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,180
- Why? The night is still young!
- We can walk Spike.

78
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,875
- Play the guitars, Joe. Come on.
- We were just bonding.

79
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,383
- I love that idea.
- We're starting to jell.

80
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,976
- Call me.
- Joe...

81
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,946
We were doing so good.

82
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,421
Hey, Spike. There's my boy.
Haven't seen you all night.

83
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,599
Do you know who the greatest
quarterback of all time is?

84
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,829
Just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!

85
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,203
Can you feel it? Can you smell it?
Do you believe it?

86
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,369
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready?
Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!

87
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,844
Come on, Spike.
We need a football biscuit.

88
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,139
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, this is a good one.

89
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,842
Kingman drops back, he's...
Oh, defenders are coming around.

90
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,211
Post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.

91
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,753
He throws.

92
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,553
Touchdown! They're going crazy.

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,622
Crazy.

94
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,439
<i>Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.</i>

95
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,539
What do you want to do, Spike?
What do you want to do today?

96
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,208
It's a new year.

97
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,277
You want to play football?
You want to go for a walk?

98
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:49,352
You want to watch the new ESPN
special profile on Joe Kingman?

99
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,861
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch.
Here we go.

100
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,399
Attaboy.

101
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,835
<i>Blessed with crazy strength and
ridiculous agility...</i>

102
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,229
Ridiculous.

103
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,034
<i>...Joe Kingman could have succeeded
on talent alone.</i>

104
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,871
<i>But what really sets
this future hall-of-famer apart</i>

105
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,535
<i>is his passion for the game.</i>

106
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,410
<i>And no one sums it up better
than Joe himself.</i>

107
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,608
<i>- Wait a minute, that's not what I said.
- Listen, listen.</i>

108
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,742
<i>- What I said was this. Life...
- Life...</i>

109
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,844
<i>...holds many pleasures for me.
... holds many pleasures for me.</i>

110
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,445
<i>- But...
- But...</i>

111
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,081
<i>...nothing...
... nothing...</i>

112
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,022
<i>...nothing beats the thrill...
... nothing beats the thrill...</i>

113
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,992
<i>...of playing on that field...
... of playing on that field...</i>

114
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,062
<i>...every Sunday.
... every Sunday.</i>

115
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,631
<i>- Football is my life.
- Football is my life.</i>

116
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,126
<i>- Beyond the field...
- Beyond the field...</i>

117
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,533
<i>...nothing else matters.
... nothing else matters. Watch this.</i>

118
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,604
<i>Nothing.</i>

119
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,071
<i>If nothing else really matters,</i>

120
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,541
<i>why does that championship ring
elude Kingman?</i>

121
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,045
<i>Some of the experts say
it's because he's too selfish.</i>

122
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,376
<i>I mean, think about it...</i>

123
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,311
How does that sound, Stuey?

124
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,753
<i>Joe, you're a 30-something now,
not a 20-something.</i>

125
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,516
<i>The clock is ticking, Joe.
Ticking on your career.</i>

126
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,995
Blah, blah, blah...

127
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,990
You come talk to me when you have
your own action figure, Stuey.

128
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,673
<i>- Yeah?
Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.</i>

129
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,443
I have a visitor here at reception.

130
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,612
<i>- A Peyton Kelly, sir.
- I don't know any Peytons.</i>

131
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,314
A young lady.

132
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,448
- Is she cute?
- Oh, exceedingly so, sir.

133
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,716
Well, what are you waiting for, Larry?
Send her up.

134
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,684
He never says "no. "

135
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,088
I am the king. Thank you very much.

136
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,756
Hmm.

137
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,426
Look out.

138
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,699
Hello.

139
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,335
- Goodbye.
Hey!

140
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,943
Look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies,
okay?

141
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,313
You don't get abs like these

142
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,979
eating Peanut Butter Patties,
you know?

143
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,990
Go ahead, hit me. Come on!
Give it a shot. Come on.

144
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,724
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

145
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,129
Bye-bye.

146
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,234
It's ridiculous.

147
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,108
I don't know what it is you're selling.
Look what I have, here's a hundo.

148
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,377
I don't want any money. I want...

149
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:30,216
I know. I know what you want. I get it.
It's what the world wants.

150
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,689
An autograph of Joe Kingman.
They all want it, eight to 80.

151
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,387
You'll probably go sell it,
but I'm going to give it to you for free.

152
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,520
Because I'm Joe Kingman,
humanitarian.

153
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,861
Happy New Year. I'll be right back.

154
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,666
You have a bulldog. Come here, boy.

155
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,399
You're so cute.

156
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,700
Easy, easy.
He's a very vicious attack dog.

157
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,777
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.

158
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,007
Listen, you just can't come walking
into strangers' homes like this.

159
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,382
There are a lot of weirdos out there
in the world.

160
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,452
- Didn't your mom ever teach you that?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,987
- Well, where is she?
- On an airplane.

162
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,250
On an airplane?
Well, who are you here with?

163
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,381
My father.

164
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,256
Well, you better go get him,
because I'm sure he's looking for you.

165
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,421
- He's not looking for me.
- How do you know?

166
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,591
Because he's looking at me.

167
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,101
What?

168
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:23,164
Hi, we've never met before.
You were married to my mom, Sara.

169
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,606
Sara Kelly?

170
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,078
My name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.

171
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,278
No. No. Nope. No!

172
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,185
No. Time out.
Sara and I never had a kid.

173
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,357
- She wrote you a note.
- Wrote me a note.

174
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,903
"Joe, I know this is a big surprise,
but Peyton is your daughter.

175
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,603
"I need you to watch her for a month.
It's an emergency.

176
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,908
"I'll explain everything
when I get back. Sara. "

177
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,378
You sure got a lot of pictures
of yourself in here.

178
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,613
You expect me to believe
you're my kid, based on this?

179
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,780
- Anybody could have written this.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,452
I've also got this.
It's my birth certificate.

181
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,257
Birth certificate?

182
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,231
- Your name is on it.
- My name is...

183
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,672
My name?

184
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,899
Awesome!

185
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,202
<i>Ready? Break!</i>

186
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,375
My name's not on this.

187
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,306
"Joseph Kingman. "

188
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,109
<i>Hut! Hut! Hut!</i>

189
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,613
<i>- We've got a situation.
- Touchdown!</i>

190
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,620
Fix it.

191
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,587
Oh!

192
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,956
Don't you think
you should have told me about this?

193
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,331
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know you had an ex-wife?

194
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,462
That was a long time ago.
We were crazy in love, but too young.

195
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,440
Didn't even last longer than a year,
and we never had a baby.

196
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,170
Okay, but for argument's sake,

197
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,442
is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility
that this child could be yours?

198
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,608
Think hard.

199
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,083
I don't know.

200
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,120
We got the separation,
the divorce was final,

201
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,554
she came by to pick up
a few of her things and then we...

202
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,750
We...

203
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,226
Is anyone else hungry?

204
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,323
- Hungry?
- Joe...

205
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,631
When did this, "We... We...
Is anyone else hungry" happen?

206
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,905
About eight, nine years ago.

207
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,998
- How old are you, kid?
- Eight.

208
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,477
Congratulations, Joe.

209
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,008
This isn't happening to me.

210
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,482
Muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.

211
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,643
Hmm?

212
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:25,013
It says here that your mom
is not coming back for a month.

213
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,524
She's on her way to Africa.

214
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,424
What kind of a selfish,
self-centered person dumps their kid...

215
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,932
She's on a water sanitation project
bringing fresh drinking water

216
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,901
to the drought-ravaged children
of the Sudan.

217
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,404
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that one.

218
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,031
So on her way to save the world,

219
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,610
your mom just suddenly decided
to leave you here?

220
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:50,444
I begged her. I said,
"Well, why don't I stay with my father?"

221
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,815
And she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't
know about you yet. " And I said...

222
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,583
I get it. I get it.
So, who else can you stay with?

223
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,953
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.

224
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,458
Sara has a sister.

225
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,090
Goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!

226
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,397
- Karen.
- Karen. What about her?

227
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,637
She's...

228
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,038
She's dead.

229
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,006
Oh, that's convenient.

230
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,971
What?

231
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,240
How do we get in touch
with your mom?

232
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,376
- Her cell won't work in Kassala.
- Email?

233
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,283
They don't have Internet there.

234
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,912
How did you get here again?

235
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,720
We flew to Boston together,
and then she put me in a car.

236
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,730
And the car just magically
dropped you off at some man's house?

237
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,962
- Not some man. My father.
- So you say.

238
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,937
- Want a paternity test?
- Yes. That's a great idea.

239
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,940
Let's do that. No problem.

240
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,670
I don't like needles.
So if they don't take blood, no problem.

241
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,872
Not in the middle of negotiating
our Fanny's deal, it's not.

242
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,176
These things never stay quiet,
trust me.

243
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,443
If she does turn out to be yours,

244
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,382
you'll look like a guy
who had a kid and ditched her

245
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,978
and you can
kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.

246
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,523
- Stella.
- Hmm.

247
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,551
We don't even look alike.

248
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,625
Oh, no. Not at all.

249
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,968
- Thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry.
- Hey, I told you she was cute.

250
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,246
I'm late.

251
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,359
Let's go. No huddle.

252
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,657
- No back seat.
- So what? Get in the car.

253
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,096
If you get in an accident,
the air bag will hurt me.

254
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, come on, I don't have time
for the safety lesson, please!

255
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,771
Come here.

256
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,823
So late.

257
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,399
I've got four weeks
to make up for eight years,

258
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,593
so let's get started, shall we?

259
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,101
I'm going to ask you some questions

260
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,435
and you're going to give me
some answers, okay?

261
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,064
Now, for example,

262
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,578
if you asked me what my favorite thing
to do was, I would say ballet.

263
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,648
So what's your favorite thing to do?

264
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,841
That's easy. Play football.

265
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,940
Football.

266
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,381
Come on!

267
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,889
If you could only save one thing
in a fire, what would it be?

268
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,960
My Heisman.

269
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,858
No, wait... I know.

270
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,063
My limited edition
Joe Kingman sneakers.

271
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,507
Come on, horseradish.
No more questions.

272
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,440
Just one more question.

273
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,707
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

274
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,216
Listen, I got a question for you.

275
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,014
Why didn't your mom
just bring you here herself?

276
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,517
Want a cookie?

277
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,923
No, I don't want a cookie.
Stop trying to change the subject.

278
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,892
But you said you were hungry.

279
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,523
- And I made them special for you.
- Fine, fine.

280
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,127
- Now, about your mom.
- I told you, it was last-minute.

281
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,503
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew

282
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,339
would just let her daughter
show up at my doorstep alone.

283
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,318
I know what happened.

284
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,717
- You do?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,285
- She's gained a lot of weight.
- No.

286
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,828
What's she pushing now? About 180?

287
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,056
Deuce?

288
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,768
Let's go.

289
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,372
What do you think, you're some
roaming free safety or something?

290
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,911
This is "cover-two," little lady,
so stay close.

291
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,002
Are you okay?

292
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,675
Do I sound okay?
What did you put in those cookies?

293
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:24,222
- Milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon...
- Cinnamon!

294
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,883
Cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.

295
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,552
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?

296
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,562
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"?
Cinnamon!

297
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,731
I'm allergic to nuts.

298
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,066
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that
publicity shoot set up for you today.

299
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,265
- You have to be there this time.
- I'll be there.

300
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,864
What do you think,
I'm stupid or something?

301
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,603
Stop touching me.

302
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,670
Stop eating so much.

303
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,181
- You're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine.
- Start a tab.

304
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,776
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

305
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,524
King's here, Danville. I got it.
King's here.

306
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,651
Get a submarine sandwich
and a diet soda.

307
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,875
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

308
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,989
All right, let's go. Sixty-six seam,
slot left on three, on three. Ready?

309
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,766
Suffering succotash,
Sylvester,

310
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,396
something seems to be wrong
with your mouth.

311
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,272
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three.
On three. Ready?

312
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,611
Hey, Joe.
Looks like you got a rogue fan.

313
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,445
- I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter.
- What's everybody staring at?

314
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,745
I didn't know Joe had a kid.

315
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,220
Yo, I don't think Joe knew
Joe had a kid.

316
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,488
- Stay here.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,096
Hat.

318
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,199
Give me this!

319
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,242
Here's what you got to read right there.
You all set?

320
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,904
Here we go. And three, two, one... Go!

321
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,346
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!

322
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,620
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.

323
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:09,290
Boston Rebels! Feel the...
Wait a minute. Who writes this?

324
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,588
Hey, let's get Joe.
He won't be expecting it.

325
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,600
We'll put ice in his bath.

326
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,364
Coop, look. Look real close.

327
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,999
Joe is in an ice bath.

328
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,135
- Well, we'll put colder ice in it.
- Glove.

329
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,640
Yeah.

330
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,544
Webber, think about this.

331
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,543
Big surprise, eh, Kingman?

332
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,087
More like a safety blitz.

333
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,316
Yeah, well, you should be happy.

334
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,621
I remember how happy I was
when my kids were born.

335
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,956
Yeah, but you knew
they were coming.

336
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,622
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.

337
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,528
What's your name, sweetheart?

338
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,398
- Peyton.
- Peyton, that's cute.

339
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,028
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi.

340
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,233
Oh, that's cool.
Like... Like, Peyton Manning?

341
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,572
No, dude.
It's like Walter Payton, right?

342
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,305
No. Peyton Rous.

343
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,549
- Who's that?
- He won the Nobel Prize.

344
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,141
For what team?

345
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,816
In medicine.

346
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,529
He's not even a football player.
That's stupid.

347
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,860
"Stupid" is a mean word.

348
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,627
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,758
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

350
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,858
- Isn't.
- Is!

351
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,937
- Isn't.
- Is!

352
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,868
Quiet. Both of you.

353
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,416
Step away from my pants.

354
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,786
Awkward.

355
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,421
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

356
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,856
See, those are Monroe's
very special underwear.

357
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,824
You see,
he needs to wear them every game,

358
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,691
- or he thinks we won't win.
- Oh.

359
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,059
<i>Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.</i>

360
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,234
I'm hungry.

361
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,998
Please don't touch anything.
Stand right here.

362
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,634
Tonight's Tuesday.
We're going to carbo-load.

363
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,111
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.

364
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,239
What?

365
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,843
Hey, do you have any Jell-O?
I want some Jell-O.

366
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,715
Like I said, please don't touch.
Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.

367
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,813
Stand right here, don't do anything.

368
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,393
I'm not giving you 28 grams
of empty carbohydrates.

369
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,463
We do not do simple sugars
in this house.

370
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,523
But I'm a kid and kids love sugar.
I mean, the simpler the better.

371
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,465
Well, my dad never let me have sugar.

372
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,334
Oh, is that why you never smile?

373
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,266
Mmm.

374
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,876
Listen, you better eat your food
before it gets cold.

375
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,955
But it's as big as a mountain.

376
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,452
Listen, if you're going to make the pros,
you have to get your appetite up.

377
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,027
Let's go. Eat.

378
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,592
You got a little...

379
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,896
- A little something right here.
- What?

380
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,795
I got what?

381
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,342
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.

382
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,973
You can eat.

383
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,086
And finish eating.

384
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,056
I don't have a guest room
because I don't like guests.

385
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,860
But you can sleep here.

386
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,492
- What's this?
- That is a universal remote.

387
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,037
It controls the world.
And you don't need to touch it.

388
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,164
What's the "romance" button for?

389
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:48,110
The romance button
is for a little Valentine's Day magic.

390
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,947
Turn... Turn this off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.

391
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,456
Turn it off. Press the button.
Turn it off.

392
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,259
Stop touching things.

393
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,634
Aren't you going to tell me
a bedtime story?

394
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,964
Bedtime story... Bedtime story.

395
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,803
Yeah.

396
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,083
The Big Bad Wolf

397
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,778
blew down the Grammy's house

398
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,856
and ate the Goldilocks

399
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,154
and then there was something
about the porridge.

400
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,454
The end.

401
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,789
Good night.

402
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,364
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.

403
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,336
A bedtime story is supposed
to make you feel peaceful.

404
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,338
I'll show you.

405
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,307
Lean back, relax,
and listen to the story.

406
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,178
Fine. Fine. I'm going to listen
to this one time, then that's it.

407
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,148
Then you go to sleep.
Do you understand me?

408
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,380
Once upon a time there was a princess

409
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,388
and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.

410
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,186
She had a pink dress, a red dress,

411
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,729
a blue dress, a green dress,
a purple dress,

412
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,889
- an orange dress, a yellow dress...
- I get it. I get it. I get it.

413
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,230
A lot of dresses, a lot of colors.
So what?

414
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,029
So each dress had a secret power.

415
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,574
The pink dress,
which had pink sparkles all over it,

416
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,668
could make her fly.

417
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,580
And the blue dress,
which had blue sparkles all over it,

418
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,879
could make her tiny.

419
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:40,149
And the green dress,
which had green sparkles all over it,

420
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,419
could make her sleep.

421
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,508
Whoa!

422
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,484
Hey, baby.

423
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,688
Why didn't you answer me
when I called?

424
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,882
I was starting to get worried.

425
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,992
I'm sorry. I forgot I had
my phone turned off from the flight.

426
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:21,064
Well, I'm just happy that you got
there safely. So, how's it going?

427
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:26,827
Great. Well, the food's not so hot,
but my room is huge.

428
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,996
Well, that's very cool,
but how's the ballet?

429
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,405
I mean, is it as good as they promised?

430
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,976
Too soon to tell.

431
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:37,037
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost
time for my flight to take off,

432
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,276
but I will call you
as soon as I can, okay?

433
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,649
I miss you so much already.

434
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,952
E- mail me lots of pictures.
And Peyton, I love you.

435
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,422
I love you, too. Bye.

436
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,229
Is there a ballet school close by?

437
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,967
Spike?

438
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:09,237
Why is my dog in a dress
with pink nail polish?

439
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,474
<i>He's learning Swan Lake.</i>

440
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,646
Do you know how to fix
a ballerina bun?

441
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,246
Do I look like I know
how to fix a ballerina bun?

442
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:31,026
My mom says we're not supposed to
pop our knuckles.

443
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,468
Well, your mom
didn't sleep on a hard sofa

444
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,598
instead of her specially designed
$ 10,000 orthopedic bed

445
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:42,009
made by Dr. Johan Gustavo,
of Switzerland.

446
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:50,052
- What's... What's with the Beethoven?
- It's Tchaikovsky.

447
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,453
- Do you listen to this every morning?
- No.

448
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,526
Sometimes I listen to Bach,
or Rachmaninoff...

449
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,555
Do you have an iPod?

450
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,329
Because I'm going to buy you one.
Immediately. Right now.

451
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,460
I'm going to buy you an iPod.

452
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,006
Until then...

453
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,598
Whoa...

454
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,737
What is this?

455
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,908
My Bedazzler.
Doesn't Camille look pretty?

456
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,246
A Bedazzler?

457
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,516
And that's why I use
tuna for protein and flavor.

458
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,715
Mmm.

459
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,626
- Gross.
- Little liquid chickens.

460
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,827
Yeah, that's my favorite.

461
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,903
Joe's juice.

462
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,875
Okay. That's enough.

463
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,432
I'm gonna need you to drink up.

464
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,877
You'll be running the 40
in under 4.5 in no time.

465
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,684
That smells worse than school food.

466
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,846
You know, speaking of school,
why aren't you in it?

467
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,053
- I'm on break.
- In January? No you're not.

468
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,597
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school,
so I have January off.

469
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,393
Really? Well, guess what?
I'm not on break.

470
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,763
As a matter of fact,
I'm on the opposite of break.

471
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,995
So I'm gonna need you
to come over here,

472
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,832
put some hustle in it,
and drink your breakfast.

473
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,405
- Peyton, stop messing around.
- What?

474
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,495
Peyton!

475
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,597
No!

476
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:30,878
Nice.

477
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,548
That's real nice.

478
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:47,564
- You know what a playbook is?
- I'm guessing it's a book with plays?

479
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,442
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses
and the Os for hugs.

480
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,604
Wrong! The X's mean
"stay out of these areas of the house. "

481
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,375
The O's mean "open access. "

482
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,543
For example, you want to go
to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.

483
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,451
But now you go to the kitchen, big X.

484
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,682
Off limits. No access.

485
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,487
Can't go there, because you made
a mess in the kitchen.

486
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,891
Do you understand?

487
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,429
No trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?

488
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,192
Got it. No flea-flickers.

489
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,768
This is your game plan.
Learn it. Live it. Love it.

490
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,939
That's it, boys.
Practice is over.

491
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,972
Pick a nanny, Joe.

492
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,513
- I'll take the one at...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

493
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,283
Don't you think
you should ask some questions first?

494
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,689
I've got great instincts.

495
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,555
The one on the end, Stella.

496
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,718
Edna.

497
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,966
The other end, Stella.

498
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,698
Blondie, you're up.

499
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,473
Oh, no. No.

500
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,474
The King picked me!

501
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,779
We are going to be just like sisters!

502
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,653
Oh, my goodness.

503
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,023
You start tomorrow.

504
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,994
Hey. You're going
to the opening tonight, right?

505
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,928
It's my restaurant.

506
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,459
Oh.

507
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,437
Well, what are you
going to do with her?

508
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,575
I don't know.

509
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,345
Hi. Hello.

510
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,815
Welcome, Mr. Kingman.

511
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,387
- The Maloofs!
- About time, there, Joe.

512
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,725
You made it. Have fun.

513
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,798
- Yeah.
- Enjoy yourself.

514
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,435
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, man.

515
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,765
- How you doing?
- Hey.

516
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,033
- Jo Jo!
- Hey, nice to see you.

517
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,800
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.

518
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,676
And that's exactly what I said.
I told them.

519
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,578
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest. "

520
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,382
The purple or the yellow?

521
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:17,821
Hmm.

522
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,493
Mmm?

523
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,188
Mmm.

524
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,862
That's what I was thinking, too.

525
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,767
I'll be back.

526
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,907
Water the lawn. Water the lawn.

527
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,207
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.

528
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,647
Indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.

529
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,616
Hey, Joe! This way!

530
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,052
Number one on the field
and number one in your heart.

531
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,828
<i>I've got sunshine</i>

532
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,924
<i>On a cloudy day</i>

533
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,024
Yes, I do.

534
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,571
<i>When it's cold outside</i>

535
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,736
<i>I've got the month of May</i>

536
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,978
<i>I guess you'd say</i>

537
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,883
<i>What can make me</i>

538
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:22,982
<i>What can make me</i>

539
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,112
<i>feel this way</i>

540
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,247
<i>My girl</i>

541
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,381
Joe?

542
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,218
<i>My girl</i>

543
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,727
<i>Talking about my girl</i>

544
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,820
My girl... Peyton!

545
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,831
Joe?

546
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,106
Joe. Joe, where are you?

547
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,041
There you are.
Joe, I thought you forgot about me.

548
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,082
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!

549
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,707
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter?
- Peyton!

550
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,615
Hey, Joe, you forget something?

551
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,153
Father of the year!

552
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,828
Yesterday, Fanny's Burgers
agreed to hand out

553
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,762
your action figure
with every order of fries.

554
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,765
But do you think
they're going to want a spokesman

555
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,836
who forgot his child in a bar?

556
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:13,926
Hmm?

557
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:17,769
My mom says that Fanny's
makes kids fat and gives them gas.

558
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:23,345
Well, your daddy's agent says
Fanny's makes him fat with cash.

559
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,479
Now, I have to put together
a press conference, do some cleanup.

560
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,713
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop,
and Peyton's the mess.

561
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,718
What?

562
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,862
- Something funny, Larry?
- Just a little throat tickle, sir.

563
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,728
Well, get it fixed.

564
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,801
Right here. Chop-chop.

565
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,305
You got a station wagon, Stella?

566
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,773
No, you did.

567
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,202
Say "bye-bye" to being
the Big Bad Dad of Boston.

568
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,114
Oh, no.

569
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,720
Oh, yes.

570
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,030
You want me to sign that?

571
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:19,297
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl
and cooperate with your daddy

572
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,169
and Auntie Stella will get you a nice
new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.

573
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,544
And an upgrade
on your next international flight.

574
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,705
I'm eight.

575
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,283
Listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt,

576
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,648
you will do whatever it takes
to help your father.

577
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,955
I'll pay for the therapy.

578
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,494
Listen, Peyton,
what Stella's trying to say here is

579
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,028
this right now is crunch time.

580
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,893
So, if something's bothering you,
then all you got to do...

581
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,627
Let's keep it bottled up
until after the playoffs.

582
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,793
Fine.

583
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,929
On one condition.

584
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,966
No nanny.

585
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,472
No way.

586
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,114
Hey...

587
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,244
- Let's go. Come on.
- I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.

588
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,484
Everything's all...

589
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,916
- Dizzy?
- I think it might be

590
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:20,430
from that funny yellow soft drink
Joe gave me last night.

591
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,692
What was it called again?

592
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,930
Margarita?

593
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,735
- You wouldn't.
- You wouldn't.

594
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,533
Try me.

595
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,233
Good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!

596
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,108
Hey, Cindy!

597
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,746
You're fired.

598
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,409
Bye.

599
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,121
Joe! Joe!

600
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,779
Hey, Joe,
how can you remember the plays

601
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,381
when you can't remember
you have a daughter?

602
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,553
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing
in a nightclub at 3:00 in the morning?

603
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,455
<i>Thank you. Thank you guys
so much for coming out.</i>

604
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,033
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

605
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,123
<i>thank you so much for coming.</i>

606
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,499
<i>Great questions, by the way.
Thank you.</i>

607
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:06,176
<i>As you all know by now,
I've recently learned I'm a father.</i>

608
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,309
<i>And clearly,
I'm still getting the hang of things.</i>

609
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,911
That's not an excuse, Joe.

610
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,384
<i>But you better believe that Peyton's
nightclub evenings are behind her.</i>

611
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:24,325
<i>Because from now on, we're both
going to be going to sleep early, right?</i>

612
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,358
<i>Now, who's number one on the field
and number one in your heart?</i>

613
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,000
<i>Let's go.</i>

614
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,139
<i>Can I say something, please?</i>

615
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,437
No. Let's go.

616
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,813
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton,</i>

617
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,079
<i>the one who'll be going to bed early
from now on.</i>

618
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,258
<i>My dad didn't have much of
a heads-up on this whole father thing</i>

619
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:02,128
<i>and he is still
getting the hang of things.</i>

620
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,498
<i>But it's like everything else in his life.</i>

621
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,332
<i>He never says "no. "</i>

622
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,037
<i>I mean, he's teaching me
that you can do anything</i>

623
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,873
<i>if you've got motivation
and determination.</i>

624
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,780
<i>And the place where that starts</i>

625
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,984
<i>is right here, in the heart.</i>

626
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,980
<i>You're the world's greatest father.</i>

627
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,860
That was good.

628
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,495
- That was really good.
- It's going to cost you.

629
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,835
...two, three, four, grand plié...

630
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,912
There you go, there you go.

631
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,040
And...

632
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,340
Come on, this isn't a sport.

633
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,784
Football. Football's a sport.

634
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,447
Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?

635
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,388
Hello. This is Peyton.

636
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,254
- Hi.
- And she's here for this.

637
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,091
So, I guess I'll be back
in a couple of hours. Bye.

638
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,190
Well, class started 15 minutes ago,

639
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,326
and we don't accept students
without an audition

640
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,405
and that happened last month,
so I'm really sorry.

641
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,803
I'm sure maybe we can
work something out?

642
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,242
Money's no object,
as you probably know.

643
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,913
Okay, the thing is
that this is a professional school, and...

644
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,920
- That's very nice.
- Thank you.

645
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,613
Go change, go on, go change.

646
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,691
Let me see how she does today. Okay?

647
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,123
All right.

648
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,902
Maybe I'll... I'll try and...
We'll get somebody...

649
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,373
The moms sit over there.

650
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,479
Excuse me. Thank you.

651
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,987
And one, two, three, very long...

652
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,991
Come on, come on.

653
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,496
And one, two, three, four.

654
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,327
Open up, like a princess, chin up.

655
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,730
Thank you.

656
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,132
Beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.

657
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,853
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

658
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:25,303
Peyton, come here.
Can I tell you that that was so, so good.

659
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,376
Thank you.

660
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,502
Our next big performance
is in three weeks.

661
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,639
But if you promise me that you're going
to work extra, extra, super, super, hard,

662
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,115
we'd love to have you.

663
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,177
- I'll come every single day.
- All day, every day.

664
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,315
Well, it is a ballet school,
not a childcare facility.

665
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,256
And when we make a commitment
to a student,

666
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,760
we ask that the parents
make a commitment to the school.

667
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,887
Can you do that?

668
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,864
Well, I think you can make
a little exception for me.

669
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,800
- And why is that?
- You don't know who I am?

670
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:54,962
No.

671
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,700
I'm Joe Kingman, baby!
The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.

672
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,038
Number one on that field

673
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,774
and number one
in your pretty little heart.

674
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,248
"The King of the Gridiron. "

675
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,216
"Never-Say-No Joe?"

676
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,883
No? Nothing?

677
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:16,852
Odd.

678
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,328
- Well, don't you know who I am?
- No.

679
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,730
I'm Monique Vasquez,
the lady with the ballet school,

680
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,234
the one that doesn't accept
any new students full-time

681
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:30,398
unless she knows for a fact
that the parents are going to help out.

682
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:35,239
That's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever.
Let's go.

683
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,937
Who doesn't know
who Joe Kingman is?

684
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,141
She must be living under a rock.

685
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,682
<i>Raef will take it this time.
- He shoots! Come on!</i>

686
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,809
<i>- Got it.
- Yeah!</i>

687
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,180
<i>I didn't see what happened
to Paul Pierce.</i>

688
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,289
<i>We'll be right back</i>

689
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,379
<i>- after a word from our...
- Let's go, Paul!</i>

690
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,482
I can't believe they came from 10 down.

691
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,994
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.

692
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,622
Don't look at me like that.
Use a napkin.

693
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,998
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike.
Mean old Daddy.

694
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,730
Let's get Webber.

695
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,908
Webber, you want a soda?

696
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,039
Huh?

697
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,844
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

698
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,316
Oh...

699
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,218
- That's refreshing.
- Good one.

700
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,796
What's up, Joe?

701
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,956
I don't know, Coop. What do you think?
That's a $40,000 couch.

702
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,091
I asked you to be careful!

703
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,931
- Which bathroom should I use?
- The one off the trophy room.

704
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:36,764
Come on, Pierce!

705
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,035
Paul Pierce comes down
with the board.

706
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,543
The man's a beast.
You saw that, Joe. You saw that.

707
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,340
That's why the Celtics
are my team for life.

708
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,778
Celtics got this one locked up.

709
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,315
Hold on, hold on...

710
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,713
Wait a second. Wait a minute.
Little bit more.

711
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,784
Stop growling. Hold on.
One, two, three.

712
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,602
What did I do?

713
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,137
Let's go, Paul Pierce.
Time to come through.

714
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,366
- Okay, here we go, baby. Here we go.
- Three seconds left.

715
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,344
<i>Welcome to
the Magical World of Ponies.</i>

716
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,740
What happened?

717
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,108
Get it back! Get it back!
Get the game back!

718
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,378
Get the mechanicals!

719
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,716
The mechanicals.
The mechanicals, Joe!

720
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,619
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

721
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,389
It's right there. See?

722
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,485
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

723
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,392
We missed it!

724
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,832
<i>- You gotta celebrate.
- Peyton.</i>

725
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,573
What did I do?

726
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,610
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.

727
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,906
Wait. Where are you going?

728
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,138
You don't have to leave.
Where are you guys going?

729
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,911
- I got to get home to...
- Where?

730
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:55,985
Nothing.

731
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,147
What did I tell you
about touching the remote?

732
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,419
Bath. Bed. Now.

733
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,825
Just got to add a little bit
of bubble bath.

734
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,123
Not too much. That's good.

735
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,759
Perfect.

736
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,807
This could take a while.

737
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,749
<i>But what really sets
this future Hall of Famer apart...</i>

738
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:29,910
Passion for the game.

739
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,090
Spike, you know the rule,
no barking when I'm on TV!

740
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,249
Spike!

741
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,585
Spike?

742
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,985
What happened?

743
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,465
Spike.

744
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,661
Peyton?

745
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,759
Peyton! Peyton!

746
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,541
Peyton!

747
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,525
I'm not going to yell.

748
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,695
We're going to have a very calm

749
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,399
And rational discussion

750
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,306
about all...

751
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,910
You Bedazzled my football.

752
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,700
You guys comfortable? My pillow.

753
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,707
King on the couch!

754
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,088
This is ridiculous.

755
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,190
Never

756
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,786
say...

757
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,828
No! No!

758
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,561
I have to warm up.

759
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,131
I have to practice.

760
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,344
I have a playoff game this weekend.

761
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,005
Do you...
Do you know what that means?

762
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,351
My guess is that it means
you have a playoff game this weekend.

763
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:49,222
My dog, my bed, my car, my TV,
my stereo...

764
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,987
Is nothing sacred?

765
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,029
My towel! My towel.

766
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,226
This is all mine! It's all me!

767
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:03,465
It's all mine! This is all me!
This is my towel.

768
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,471
<i>Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert,
along with Boomer Esiason.</i>

769
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:10,273
<i>We're here in the Mile High City
where Denver hosts Boston</i>

770
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,541
<i>in the first round of the playoffs.</i>

771
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,617
In what should be
a tremendous showdown.

772
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,982
<i>We have a rematch
of last year's Conference Final</i>

773
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,545
<i>in which Denver narrowly escaped
with a 34-30 victory.</i>

774
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,217
<i>He has the tight end screen,
he side-arms it.</i>

775
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,158
<i>The catch made by Cooper.</i>

776
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,890
<i>Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.</i>

777
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,393
<i>And now, directing traffic...</i>

778
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,265
<i>Nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!</i>

779
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,630
<i>And he's bounced out of bounds!</i>

780
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,602
Yeah! I did it again!

781
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,574
Oh, our boy looks great today.

782
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,909
He's going to look even greater
lounging poolside

783
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,173
at the new Blake resort.

784
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,648
Let's just see how many Fanny's
kiddie meals he sells first.

785
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,378
Fanny.

786
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,285
Do you work at Fanny's Burgers?

787
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,826
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.

788
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:58,986
My mom says...

789
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:07,530
I mean, my dad says
your chili cheese fries rock.

790
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,902
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on!
Kick it!

791
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,867
<i>Kingman out of the gun,
takes a look.</i>

792
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,744
<i>He has Sanders wide open.
He's not going that way.</i>

793
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,476
<i>Marv, I've never
seen a quarterback</i>

794
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,108
<i>who doesn't trust his wide receivers</i>

795
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,618
<i>with a game on the line like this.</i>

796
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,654
<i>Touchdown! It's all over!</i>

797
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,849
<i>Boston has defeated Denver.</i>

798
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:28,982
<i>All on the legs of Joe Kingman,</i>

799
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,889
Boston advances
to next week's divisional playoffs

800
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,054
for the second year in a row.

801
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,065
Now, will this be the year the King
takes them all the way?

802
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,711
Peyton, are you okay?
Why are you still here?

803
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,908
I guess Joe's running a little bit late
from practice.

804
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,451
What, two hours late?
That's unacceptable.

805
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,111
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

806
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,846
Hey, King.

807
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,047
No, I'm the king. You're the king.

808
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,127
Don't do it, Elvis!
Don't jump.

809
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,128
Mr. Kingman?

810
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,090
Oh, no. Peyton.

811
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,490
Hey.

812
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,538
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little
longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.

813
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,767
- Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about...
- You know what?

814
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,605
Why don't you just call me Joe?

815
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,472
Stop it. Stop it.

816
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,607
Mr. Kingman,
I informed you from the start

817
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,083
that we are a ballet school,
not a daycare center.

818
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,417
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.

819
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,424
I'm glad you told me. Now I know.
Ballet school, not a daycare facility.

820
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,584
Sure, let me hook you up
for your time, though.

821
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,392
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag.
It's in my wallet, around the corner.

822
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,030
I just knew
you were one of those parents.

823
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,125
One of what parents?

824
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:54,410
The kind who thinks that his life is
more important than anybody else's.

825
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,071
Look, lady.
I don't know what kind of parent I am.

826
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,011
All I know is I have an entire team...

827
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,347
Scratch that,
an entire city depending on me.

828
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,716
Yeah, you also have a daughter
depending on you

829
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,518
not to only take care of her,
but to care about her. Okay?

830
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,025
- Listen, I care about Peyton.
- Then prove it!

831
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,596
- I got it.
- Hey, sweetie!

832
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,358
Your father here was telling me
how excited he is

833
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,923
to finally fulfill the commitment
he made to support the school.

834
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,970
And guess what?
I've got the perfect job for him.

835
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,039
Cool.

836
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,303
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
You're completely insane.

837
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,378
You're a freakishly large man

838
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,847
and you're telling me you're incapable
of playing a tree? Come on.

839
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,441
No, what I'm telling you is
I am a serious athlete.

840
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,077
Not a ballerina.

841
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,719
<i>You do me a favor, mamita?
Can you please hold this for me?</i>

842
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,791
Thank you so much.

843
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,020
Trust me, no one is ever going to
confuse you with a ballerina, okay?

844
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:47,824
And now,
I need you to be an enchanted tree...

845
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,762
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree.
I'm a quarterback!

846
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,663
I'm the only one that talks.

847
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,152
Up!

848
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,230
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no...
Please, come over here.

849
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,962
Wasn't so bad.

850
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,308
We're just warming up, so come on.

851
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:52,756
Hey, so what were you saying about
ballet not being a real sport?

852
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,556
Hmm?

853
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,357
It wasn't... It wasn't so bad.

854
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,935
You see, ballerinas can leap
as high as you can,

855
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,506
but when they go down,
they go down in plié.

856
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,701
And they hold and hold.

857
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,576
And then they go en pointe
for hours and hours.

858
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,241
So, if ballet were easy,
they'd call it football.

859
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,288
Yeah. Right.

860
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,754
Yeah, right.

861
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,282
Listen, Mr. Kingman,

862
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,123
your daughter has all the makings
to be a professional dancer.

863
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:29,198
She has passion, talent, discipline.

864
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,961
I guess she inherited more
than just your charm.

865
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,906
You see?

866
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,044
Let's try that one again.

867
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,353
Where were you last night?
You missed a great fight.

868
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,889
Hey, man,
you look like you were in a fight.

869
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,050
I was doing some stuff.

870
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,951
Well, you could've called.
You never call anymore.

871
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,293
Dude, stop being such a chick.

872
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,299
Never thought someone so little
could be so much work, huh?

873
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,836
You don't know the half of it.

874
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,507
<i>- Hello?
Hi!</i>

875
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,777
Listen, I finally got to a phone.
I want you to tell me everything.

876
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,548
I don't know where to start.

877
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,679
How about those pictures
you promised me?

878
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,519
E- mail me right now.

879
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:29,717
I have to see you.

880
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,157
Okay, hold on.

881
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,625
I just sent them.

882
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,329
You're breaking up. I love you.

883
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,029
Wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...

884
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,630
I love you, too.

885
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,105
We need to talk. Follow me.

886
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,181
I need my bed back.

887
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:06,260
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!

888
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,594
Love it. I love this room.
This is awesome.

889
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,962
It's beautiful.

890
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,369
- Thanks, Joe.
- You're welcome.

891
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,645
Look, P, you know the whole
"playbook for the house" thing?

892
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,014
No more buttonhooks in the kitchen.

893
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,848
Right. No more buttonhooks.

894
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,616
You see, the quarterback
is supposed to know the playbook

895
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,281
better than anybody.

896
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,489
But you and I,
you've been playing kid your entire life.

897
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,130
I just joined the dad team,
and I'm still learning all these plays.

898
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,599
No kidding.

899
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,333
All right.

900
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,134
Listen, sometimes a quarterback
has got to think on his feet

901
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,801
and call an audible, okay? And...

902
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,244
Here, this.

903
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,113
When the linebackers
are creeping up to blitz

904
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,886
And all of a sudden
you've got to call an audible

905
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,921
to change the play,
and you go around and you score!

906
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,656
He scores.

907
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:16,120
All right, it's kind of like, just like in life.

908
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,529
Sometimes things
get thrown at you unexpectedly.

909
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,964
Then you got to call an audible.

910
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,031
You got to learn on the go.

911
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,636
- Just like us. Okay?
- Okay.

912
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,285
<i>Number one on the field,
and number one in your heart.</i>

913
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,015
<i>- Now, number one on your toothbrush.
- That's funny.</i>

914
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,988
My teeth are really white.

915
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,059
Ding!

916
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,694
That's ridiculous.

917
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,130
No, that's not. That's awesome.

918
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,833
- Joe?
- Yeah?

919
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,036
What's the best thing
that's ever happened to you?

920
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,640
Well, I...

921
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,444
<i>You have one incoming message.</i>

922
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,114
Hold that question, all right?

923
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,724
<i>This is the King. Do your thing.</i>

924
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:21,520
<i>Hey, baby, it's Tatianna.
I'm in Boston. I be there 6:00.</i>

925
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,897
Tatianna!

926
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,935
Tatianna's coming at 6:00.
I got plenty of time! It's 5:45!

927
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,805
Who's Tatianna?

928
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,237
I got 15 minutes.

929
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,715
- Who's Tatianna?
- 5:45. 5:45. 5:45.

930
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,717
Listen, she's a friend.
I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.

931
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:46,721
Take all this, take it down, and...
Hide it in your room.

932
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:47,881
And you go, too.

933
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,824
And you play hide-and-seek with that,
and just make sure they're all gone.

934
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,132
Is Tatianna your girlfriend?

935
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,807
Do you mind?

936
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,714
No, no, no, no, maybe, yes.

937
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:27,961
Hi, you must be Melanie.
Joe has told me so much about you!

938
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,830
- I'm Tatianna. What are you?
- Peyton. Joe's daughter.

939
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,593
Joe's daughter?

940
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,761
Mmm-hmm.

941
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,136
- How old are you anyway, four?
- How old are you, 40?

942
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,007
- I'm 21.
- Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?

943
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,100
Joe!

944
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,510
<i>Bonsoir, Tatianna.
Baby, welcome back!</i>

945
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:51,109
<i>You look très... Gorgeous!</i>

946
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,918
- I know.
- I see you've already met...

947
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:58,952
Peyton.

948
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,088
Peyton, yes.
I don't know what she's told you.

949
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,359
'Cause she has
such a wild imagination.

950
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,868
Either way,
we have a lot to discuss over dinner.

951
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,233
Where are we eating?

952
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,308
You are going to eat
over at the Jensens', across the hall.
