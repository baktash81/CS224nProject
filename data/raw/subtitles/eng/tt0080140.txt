1
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:13,004
I don't remember this here interstate.
Weren't nothin' but a dirt road once.

2
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,800
It ain't been here about a year.

3
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,220
just long enough
for everybody to drive off on it.

4
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:25,392
There ain't practically nobody left
in Eastrod or Melsy.

5
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,727
They all done took out
for the city.

6
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,898
Let me off here.

7
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:47,892
I'm obliged.

8
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,696
...before he casts you down
into the burning pit of hell...

9
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,449
like stones into a lake of fire.

10
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:46,411
Like stones. You're all like stones.
But Jesus died to redeem ya.

11
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:51,500
Can you understand that Jesus
was so soul hungry that, for each soul...

12
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,782
Are you fixin'
to work the farm, Haze?

13
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,160
Uh, no. No, I ain't.

14
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,454
What you gonna do?

15
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,539
I'm gonna do some things...

16
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,877
I'm gonna do some things
I ain't never done before.

17
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,591
Hardly anyone
left around here anymore.

18
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,113
Everybody done left or... died.

19
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:28,117
- Can you cash this army check for me?
- Sure.

20
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,376
Was you wounded, Haze?

21
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,378
Yes, I was.

22
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,714
How come you wasn't wearin'
no Purple Heart?

23
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,841
Well, I got one, but...

24
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:48,783
I didn't want people to know
where I was wounded.

25
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,215
Oh.

26
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,629
Well, there's no place
quite like home, is there?

27
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:49,007
<i>Are you going home?</i>

28
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,885
I'm goin' to the city... Taulkinham.

29
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,429
I don't know nobody in Taulkinham.

30
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:56,556
I'm gonna do some things there.

31
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,413
I know George Sparks in Taulkinham.

32
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,458
I'm gonna do some things
I ain't never done before.

33
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,834
Oh.

34
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:11,341
Well, time does fly, don't it?

35
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:14,677
I haven't seen my sister's children
in about five years now.

36
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,098
<i>I don't know
if I'd know 'em if I saw 'em.</i>

37
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:22,060
<i>There's Roy and Jimmy Jay
and John Wesley.</i>

38
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:25,208
Oh, they call me "Mama doll"...

39
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,752
<i>and they call my husband "Papa doll."</i>

40
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:34,759
I reckon you think you been redeemed.

41
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,517
Why... Why, yes.

42
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,256
Life is an inspiration,
don't you think?

43
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,107
Sixty Buckley Road.

44
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,345
- You ain't no friend of hers, are you?
- I never saw her before.

45
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,223
<i>She don't usually have no preacher
for company.</i>

46
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:10,809
I ain't a preacher.

47
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:13,645
<i>I only seen her name on...
in a toilet.</i>

48
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,482
Well, you look like a preacher.
Your hat looks like a preacher's hat.

49
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:20,944
It ain't. It's... It's just a hat.

50
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,677
Well, it ain't only the hat.
It's the look on your face somewheres.

51
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,429
Look a-here, I ain't no preacher.

52
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,642
Now I understand it ain't anybody perfect
on this green earth...

53
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,186
<i>not preachers, not nobody.</i>

54
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:38,231
And you can tell folks better
how terrible sin is...

55
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,275
if you know
from your own experience.

56
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,318
Listen, get this.

57
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:45,655
<i>There ain't but one thing
that I want you to understand...</i>

58
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,344
and that's that I don't believe
in anything.

59
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:52,306
<i>- Nothin' at all?
- Nothin'.</i>

60
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:55,059
<i>Well, that's the problem
with you preachers.</i>

61
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:58,271
You've all got too damn good
to believe in anything.

62
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,951
You huntin' somethin'?

63
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:22,455
- Somethin' on your mind?
- The usual business.

64
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,979
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

65
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:29,732
Uh, the thing that I mean
to have you know is...

66
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:33,653
is that I ain't no goddamn preacher.

67
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,948
That's okay, son. Mama don't mind
if you ain't no preacher...

68
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:38,950
as long as you got four dollars.

69
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,706
Okay, folks, gather round.
Look at this miracle peeler here, folks.

70
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:48,146
I'm gonna give away a half a dozen...
a half a dozen peeled potatoes...

71
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:50,231
to the first one that buys
one of these here miracle machines.

72
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:52,316
Who's gonna be first now?
Okay, folks, who's gonna be number one?

73
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,736
What about you back there?
You can't afford to pass up a bargain like this.

74
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,198
- What's your name, boy?
- Name? Enoch Emory.

75
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:02,535
<i>Oh-ho. A boy with a pretty name like that
oughta have one of these machines.</i>

76
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:05,121
<i>Okay, folks, let's go.
Who'll be the first one here?</i>

77
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,123
<i>Who'll be the first one
to get one of these?</i>

78
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,125
- Jesus calls.
- Help a blind preacher.

79
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,730
<i>- Help a blind... Thank you, Jesus.
- He's talkin' to you. He's talkin' to you.</i>

80
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:16,402
Help a blind preacher and his daughter
spread the word of Jesus here.

81
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,363
<i>- Who'll be first now?
- Give up a dollar. I'm gonna start preachin' here.</i>

82
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:23,492
<i>What the hell do you think
you're doin'? I got this crowd together.</i>

83
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,370
Who the hell do you think you are?

84
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:30,416
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
I got these people together.

85
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:33,836
Help a blind, unemployed preacher.
I need it worse than you all do.

86
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,194
<i>Help a blind, unemployed preacher here.</i>

87
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:42,948
These goddamn communist foreigners!
I got this crowd together!

88
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,784
<i>Pay no attention to him, folks.
Who'll be number one?</i>

89
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,911
Who'll be the first one
to buy one of these?

90
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:51,081
- I seen you.
- Folks, step up here.

91
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,751
<i>No use savin' your money
when your soul ain't saved.</i>

92
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,586
<i>$ 1.50. $ 1.50.</i>

93
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,277
Come on. Give up a dollar for Jesus.
A dollar for Jesus.

94
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,654
<i>Is it too much to ask
for a dollar for Jesus?</i>

95
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,656
Give me one of those.
I got a dollar.

96
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:08,285
just add 50 cents to that dollar
and you got yourself a deal, okay?

97
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,454
Okay, folks,
who's gonna be the first one?

98
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,041
<i>Any more quarters? Any more dollars?
- Don't crowd in, folks.</i>

99
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,834
<i>- Help a blind preacher.
- Okay, folks, who'll be first?</i>

100
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,919
<i>- Come on, Papa.
- Help a blind preacher here.</i>

101
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:20,338
<i>Free potatoes to the first one buyin'
one of these here miracles.</i>

102
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:23,236
<i>Who's gonna be the first one to buy
one of these here machi... Thank you, sir.</i>

103
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,321
There goes the first sale, folks.
Next sale.

104
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,116
Who'll be the next one to buy
one of these here miracles?

105
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:39,294
See? All they wanna do
is knock you down.

106
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,005
I ain't never been
in such a unfriendly place before.

107
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,300
There's too many people
on the streets.

108
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,114
- How long you been here?
- Two days.

109
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,450
I been here two months.

110
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,578
I work at the zoo.

111
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,039
- I didn't catch your name good.
- Hazel Motes.

112
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,250
Hazel Motes. You look like you might
be follerin' them hicks.

113
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,252
<i>Stop! Don't you see that...</i>

114
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,588
Now, what do you think that thing
is up there for?

115
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,300
Maybe you thought that red was for white folks
and green ones was for niggers, huh?

116
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,950
- That's what I thought.
- You tell all your friends about these lights.

117
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:14,744
Red is for stop.
Green is for go.

118
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:19,957
Men and women, white folks and niggers...
all go on the same light.

119
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,251
Now, you tell all your friends
about that now, you hear?

120
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,712
So that when they come to town,
they'll know.

121
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,506
I'll look after him.
He ain't been here but two days.

122
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:32,303
- I'm obliged.
- Wasn't nothin'.

123
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,789
I reckon I'll go alone
and keep you company for a while.

124
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:39,747
Sure wouldn't wanna get messed up
with no hicks...

125
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,249
particularly the Jesus kind.

126
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,960
I know. I done a lot of that myself.

127
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:49,590
I was 12 years old, and I could sing
some hymns good I learned off this nigger.

128
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:52,593
So this here welfare woman
traded me from my daddy...

129
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:55,054
took me off to Boonville
to live with her.

130
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:58,505
She had a brick house,
but it was Jesus all day long.

131
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:02,289
Reckon she was 40 years old,
and she was ugly.

132
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:06,376
Her hair was so thin, it looked like
ham gravy tricklin' down her skull.

133
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,224
I got out though.
Wanna know how?

134
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,248
I scared the hell out of that woman.
That's how.

135
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,417
I studied and I studied on it.
I even prayed.

136
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:31,212
I said, " Jesus, show me a way
to get outta here. "

137
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,632
Durned if he didn't.

138
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:37,802
I got up one mornin' just before daylight.

139
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,221
I went into her room
without my pants on...

140
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,307
and pulled up the sheet
and give her a heart attack.

141
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:49,000
<i>Your jaw just crawls, don't it?
Don't you never laugh?</i>

142
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,093
It's that boy, Papa.

143
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,473
I can smell the sin on his breath.

144
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,560
- What'd you foller me for?
- I never follered you.

145
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,812
- She said you was follerin' me.
- I ain't follered you nowheres.

146
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,376
<i>I follered her.</i>

147
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:15,922
I don't want that thing.
Take it. I don't want it.

148
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:17,965
You take it and you shut up
before I hit you.

149
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,967
I won't have it.

150
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:22,094
You take it like I told you!

151
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,889
He never follered you.

152
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,891
I got it, but it ain't mine.

153
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:30,519
I follered her to say I wasn't beholdin'
to none of her fast eye...

154
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,522
like she give me back there.

155
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:36,337
What do you mean?
I never looked at you with no fast eye.

156
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,714
<i>I only watched you tearin' up
that tract.</i>

157
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,133
Papa, he tore it up in little pieces.

158
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:44,178
- He tore it up and sprinkled it all over the ground...
- Shut up!

159
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:49,350
He follered me.
Nobody could foller you.

160
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:52,353
I can hear the urge of Jesus
in his voice.

161
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:55,481
Jesus.

162
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:59,838
<i>Now you listen to me, boy.
Jesus is a fact!</i>

163
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,424
- You can't run away from Jesus.
- No. You listen.

164
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,762
I come a long way
since I believe in anything.

165
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,931
I come halfway around the world.

166
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:15,312
You ain't come so far that you could keep
from follerin' me, though, have you, boy?

167
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,859
Some preacher's left his mark on you.

168
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:25,133
Did you follow me for me to take it off
or to give you another one?

169
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:29,971
I hear 'em
scrapin' their feet inside.

170
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,015
Get out the tracts.
They're fixin' to come out.

171
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,603
<i>- What we gonna do? What's inside that there building?
- Program lettin' out.</i>

172
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:39,105
Here, take this, boy, and go up
to the other side and give out.

173
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,107
I'll stay here with the one
that follered me.

174
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:46,596
Now you go to the top of them stairs
and repent, boy, and renounce your sins...

175
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,010
and distribute these tracts
to the people.

176
00:19:50,345 --> 00:19:53,097
I'm as clean as you are.

177
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,558
Fornication, blasphemy.
What else?

178
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:59,270
If I was in sin, I was in it
before I ever committed any.

179
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:01,272
There ain't no change come in me.

180
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:03,817
I don't believe in sin!

181
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,487
Nothin' matters
but that Jesus don't exist!

182
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:10,107
Go distribute them tracts
to the people.

183
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,554
I'll take 'em up there
and throw 'em in the bushes.

184
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:15,890
You be watchin'.
See can you see.

185
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,521
Jesus calls you.
Jesus calls you.

186
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,981
Hey! Lookee down yonder.

187
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:26,484
Do you see that blind man
down there?

188
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,196
He's givin' out tracts and benign.
Jesus! You ought to see him.

189
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,281
And he's not this here ugly child.

190
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,394
Now you better get
on the other side, lady.

191
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:37,223
There's a fool down there
givin' out tracts.

192
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,517
Don't pay no attention
to that fanatic up there.

193
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:43,312
<i>Don't I know what exists
and what don't?</i>

194
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:45,731
Ain't I got eyes in my head?

195
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:47,900
Am I a blind man?

196
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,902
Let me tell you somethin'.

197
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:55,241
Maybe you think that you ain't clean
because you don't believe.

198
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:59,598
<i>Every one of you are clean,
and I'll tell you why.</i>

199
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:05,521
If you think it's because
of Jesus Christ crucified, you're wrong.

200
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:09,441
I ain't saying he wasn't crucified,
but I say it wasn't for you.

201
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,652
<i>I'm gonna start a new church...</i>

202
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:16,532
<i>the Church of Truth
Without Jesus Christ Crucified.</i>

203
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:19,618
And it won't cost you nothin'
to join my church.

204
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:23,975
<i>- Blind preacher here, folks.
- It ain't started yet, but it's gonna be.</i>

205
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,977
I don't need Jesus.

206
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:29,523
What do I need Jesus for?
I got Leora Watts.

207
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:33,735
Hawks. Asa Hawks's the name
when you go to follerin' me again.

208
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,323
Sin is a trick on niggers.

209
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:40,325
Sin ain't on my books.

210
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,327
Hey.

211
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,143
Now we got shut of them, why don't we
go someplace and have us some fun?

212
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:50,689
Heard about there's this house we can go
and have us some fun.

213
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,691
I could pay you back next week.

214
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:56,277
I got business of my own.
I seen just about all of you I want.

215
00:21:57,946 --> 00:22:00,824
I been here two months,
and I don't know nobody.

216
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:02,826
People ain't friendly here.

217
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:04,828
I think I seen you
someplace before.

218
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:07,455
- You ain't from Stockwell, are you?
- No.

219
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,605
Looked like you had
a kind of familiar face.

220
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,605
Good-bye.

221
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:15,984
I'm goin' this way too.

222
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:21,990
My daddy made me come.

223
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,450
I ain't but 18 years old,
and he made me come here.

224
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:28,329
And I don't know nobody, and nobody
here will have nothin' to do with me.

225
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,331
They ain't friendly.

226
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,319
Look a-here. You want a woman, you don't
have to go follerin' nothin' ugly...

227
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:36,482
like that kid you give a peeler to.

228
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,484
Look, get away from me.

229
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,738
People here ain't friendly.

230
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:45,950
You ain't from here,
but you ain't friendly neither.

231
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,202
And you don't know nobody neither.

232
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:52,456
I knew when I first seen you that you
didn't have nobody or nothin' but Jesus.

233
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,084
I seen you. Yeah, I knew it.

234
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,877
That's right.

235
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:59,608
Standin' around actin' like you got
wiser blood than anybody else.

236
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:03,195
But you ain't, 'cause I'm the one that has it.
Not you. Me.

237
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,322
What are you talkin' about?

238
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:08,200
About I know things
I ain't never learned...

239
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,577
how I can see signs.

240
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:13,789
It's somethin' that just happens,
and I got to do some things sometimes.

241
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:17,418
I got to do some things
sometimes I don't even wanna do.

242
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,420
And sometimes inside me,
I can feel it.

243
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:22,322
I can feel it pullin' and tunnin' at me
and pushin'...

244
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:26,530
and I can feel my blood beatin',
and I got to do this thing right now.

245
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,658
It's... It's wise blood.

246
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,036
It ain't everybody has it.
See, it's a gift.

247
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,497
It's a gift like, uh,
the gift of the prophets.

248
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,626
Now, I ain't sayin' I'm a prophet.
No, it ain't like that, but it's like that.

249
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,878
You're crazy, boy.

250
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,172
You get away from me,
and you stay away.

251
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,283
<i>I'm goin' where I'm goin'.</i>

252
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,863
I got a woman.
I got a woman, see?

253
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,949
And that's where I'm goin'...
to visit her.

254
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:00,917
<i>She told me where they live.</i>

255
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:06,423
<i>That girl you give a peeler to...
she said to visit 'em and to bring you there.</i>

256
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:31,342
Ray.

257
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:24,621
<i>This way out. This way out.</i>

258
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:27,499
<i>Eighty-five cents.
Don't buy nothin' for the lady.</i>

259
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:31,420
<i>Exclusive show. Miss Eve herself In person.</i>

260
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:33,547
<i>Only 15 at a time.</i>

261
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:36,133
<i>Only 15 at a time.</i>

262
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:40,888
<i>So "sinsational,"
it'll cost you 85 cents to see it.</i>

263
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:45,100
<i>Exclusive show.
Miss Eve herself In person.</i>

264
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:47,289
<i>Only 15 at a time.</i>

265
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:50,625
<i>So sinsational, it'll cost you
85 cents to see it.</i>

266
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:02,596
<i>So sinsational.</i>

267
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,879
<i>...repent to the Lord and burn your eyes clean.</i>

268
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,673
<i>You'll see yourselves
for what you was... filth.</i>

269
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:44,469
<i>A generation of blasphemers
and whoremongers, every one of you.</i>

270
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:48,556
<i>There ain't one of you is a clean man
or woman or child.</i>

271
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:51,517
<i>I tell you there ain't no finer act
than God's judgment.</i>

272
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,229
<i>Repent before he casts you down
into the burning pit of hell...</i>

273
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,474
<i>like stones into a lake of fire.</i>

274
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,317
You don't just walk in here like that.

275
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,361
I'll show you
what we've got to show.

276
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:32,572
- Let me see Slade.
- What you want to see him for?

277
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:34,385
I want to see him about this here car.

278
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,263
- I'm him.
- Well, how much it cost?

279
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:41,434
How much do you figure?
Give us an estimate.

280
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,187
<i>- What do you want?
- I want this here car.</i>

281
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:48,691
- I might take $300 for it.
- I wouldn't pay no more than 200 for it.

282
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:51,861
That car, you can't buy like that every day.
It's got new tires on it.

283
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:57,070
They was new when it was built.

284
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,265
They built good cars several years ago.
They don't build good cars no more.

285
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,768
- You wanna get underneath it and look at it?
- No.

286
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:06,771
Told you you wouldn't bust them tires.

287
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:11,067
What'll you give me for it?

288
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:13,277
I'll take two and a half.

289
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:16,364
That wouldn't be worth
what it'd cost to cart it off.

290
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,366
I won't argue with you about that.

291
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,701
This car wasn't built
by a bunch of niggers.

292
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:24,183
If you don't want this one, there's plenty more
you can look at just the same price.

293
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,185
What do you want for it?

294
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:29,063
I'll take two and a quarter,
and you can pay me when you leave.

295
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:32,650
- Two and a quarter and some gas.
- Tank's full.

296
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:37,571
I wanted this car mostly
to be a house for me.

297
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:39,657
I ain't got no place to be.

298
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,535
You got to switch it on
with them two wires right there.

299
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,895
<i>You gotta let the hand brake down.</i>

300
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:24,276
<i>He would die 10 million times...</i>

301
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,280
<i>have his arms and his legs
stretched out on the cross and nailed...</i>

302
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,408
<i>10 million times for just one soul.</i>

303
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:35,412
Even for that boy there,
he would die 10 million times.

304
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:37,873
<i>He will chase him
over the waters of sin.</i>

305
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:40,960
<i>If you doubt that Jesus
walks over the waters of sin...</i>

306
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:45,162
<i>This boy has been chastened,
and he will be redeemed.</i>

307
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:47,194
<i>Jesus will never leave him ever.</i>

308
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:50,489
<i>Jesus will have you in the end.</i>

309
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:55,410
What are you doin' parked
in the middle of the road, son?

310
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:58,080
Take your hand off my shoulder.
I'm readin' that sign.

311
00:31:59,373 --> 00:32:03,377
<i>There ain't a person or whoremonger
who wasn't somethin' worse first.</i>

312
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,380
<i>That ain't the sin nor the blasphemy.</i>

313
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,370
The sin came before 'em.

314
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,197
Jesus is a trick on niggers.

315
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,118
Well, will you get this goddamn outhouse
out of the middle of the road?

316
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:21,248
I don't have to run away from anything,
'cause I don't believe in anything.

317
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,835
- What direction's the zoo in?
- Back the other way.

318
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,920
That where you escaped from?

319
00:32:57,332 --> 00:32:59,367
<i>You're so ugly, I can't stand it.</i>

320
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:03,955
Shoot! Shoot, if I had a face like that,
I'd sit on it and never get up.

321
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,509
Hi, Haze. How are you?

322
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:19,679
Guard said I'd find you here.
Said you liked to talk to the monkeys.

323
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:21,664
Well, just look at 'im.

324
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:24,495
He acts like he thinks
he's as good as me or you.

325
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,497
just like some niggers I've seen.

326
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,000
Shoot! I had a face like that,
I'd put a paper ban on it.

327
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:34,755
Look. I'm lookin' for that blind preacher
named Hawks.

328
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,299
Now, do you know where they live?

329
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,301
- Hawks?
- Hawks.

330
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,303
Yeah, him and his girl.

331
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,881
Right. Now, did she tell you
where they live?

332
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:49,623
Hazel, listen here.
I got to show you somethin'.

333
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:51,625
Oh, look, I got to see that man.

334
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:55,004
This thing, Hazel, I got to show it to you.
Now. Here. This afternoon.

335
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:57,006
What thing?
I don't want to see any thing of yours.

336
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:00,175
- I want that-that address.
- Come on.

337
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,554
"Muv-se-vum. "

338
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,556
Walk easy. I don't wanna
wake the old guard.

339
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:29,641
He ain't very friendly with me.

340
00:34:57,299 --> 00:34:59,210
You see that there notice?

341
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:02,213
It says he was once as tall
as you or me.

342
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:04,632
Some A-rabs done it to him
in six months.

343
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:08,261
<i>Took all the blood out of him.
Then they done it to him.</i>

344
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:12,890
Must've sewed up his mouth to keep him
from yellin' while they was doin' it.

345
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:14,892
<i>You can count his eyelashes.</i>

346
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:17,937
- Is this what you wanted to show me?
- Yeah.

347
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:20,641
Well, I seen it.
Now, where do they live?

348
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:22,753
Do you know where they live?

349
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:25,423
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I know where they live.

350
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:36,267
<i>All right, where is it?
Which one of them houses is it?</i>

351
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:40,146
Well, she... she said it was
on Plum Tree Drive.

352
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:43,357
Wait. I... I know where it's at.
I remember the number she give to me.

353
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:45,839
You're lyin'.
You don't know where they live.

354
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:47,840
- You're lyin' to me.
- No, I couldn't lie.

355
00:35:47,923 --> 00:35:50,467
It's one of these here houses.
I swear to you.

356
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,346
Wait. I think that's it.

357
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,528
<i>I'm trying to help you find it, Hazel, but...</i>

358
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:35,385
I can't use none of your help!
You lied to me.

359
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,430
You ain't not any better idea
where they live than I do.

360
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:41,808
- No, it ain't true. She told me...
- You lied to me!

361
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:43,810
You been runnin' up and down this city...

362
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,314
just to show me some kind
of dried-up dead man...

363
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,942
and a cane of monkeys
and a... and a hoot owl.

364
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:55,987
And now you can't find 'em because
you don't know where they live.

365
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:39,316
Uh, if a room's free,
I'd like to rent it.

366
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:43,528
Room's for rent, all right.

367
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,530
What do you do?

368
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,282
I'm a preacher.

369
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,829
- What church?
- Church of Truth Without Christ.

370
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,985
Protestant... or-or somethin' foreign?

371
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,230
Oh, no, ma'am. It's Protestant.

372
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:03,735
You can look at the room.

373
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:12,410
It's $20 a week, in advance.

374
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:18,917
Man named Hawks lives here,
don't he?

375
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,939
Downstairs in the front room...
him and his child.

376
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:47,234
It used to be a fire escape there,
but I don't know what happened to it.

377
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:52,073
Well, I'll take the room.

378
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:13,739
It's that boy, Papa...
that one that keeps follerin' me.

379
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:21,538
Get away.

380
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:23,582
What do you want?

381
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:25,209
I live here now.

382
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,796
I thought if your girl
give me so much eye back there...

383
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:31,090
I just might return some of it.

384
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:34,071
What I give you the other day
was of a look of indignation...

385
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,073
for what I seen you do.

386
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:38,408
<i>It was you give me the eye.</i>

387
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:41,620
You should've seen him, Papa.
He looked me up and down.

388
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:44,873
<i>I started my own church.</i>

389
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:48,126
I'm gonna be preachin' it
on the streets.

390
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,879
You can't leave me alone,
can you, boy?

391
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:53,882
I didn't ask you to come here,
and I ain't askin' you to hang around.

392
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:01,868
What the hell kind of-of a preacher are you
not to see if you can save my soul?

393
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,049
Goddamn Jesus hon.

394
00:41:16,132 --> 00:41:18,051
Well, look what you used to be.

395
00:41:18,134 --> 00:41:21,783
<i>Look what you tried to do.
You got over it.</i>

396
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:24,410
<i>So will he.</i>

397
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:30,124
I don't want him around here.
He makes me nervous.

398
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,044
Listen here. You help me to get him.

399
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:35,838
Then you go away and do what you please,
and I can live with him.

400
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,926
He don't even know you exist.

401
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,470
Even if he don't, that's all right.

402
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:45,701
That's how come
I can get him easy.

403
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:49,330
I want him, and you oughta help.
Then you can go off like you want to.

404
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:56,087
All right, but you better make it work
if you want to eat after I'm gone.

405
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:59,048
I'll get him.

406
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:01,342
That might be just fine.

407
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,136
Might be the oil on Aaron's beard.

408
00:42:04,262 --> 00:42:07,429
Listen here. It would be the nuts.

409
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,578
I'm just crazy about him.

410
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,873
I never seen a boy
I liked the looks of any better.

411
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:15,668
<i>Don't run him off.</i>

412
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:19,505
Tell him how you blinded yourself for Jesus
and show him that clipping you not.

413
00:42:19,588 --> 00:42:21,507
The clipping.

414
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:31,720
<i>My church is the Church Without Christ.</i>

415
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:34,748
I am a member
and a preacher to that church...

416
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:39,670
where the blind don't see
and the lame don't walk...

417
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:42,506
and what's dead stays that way.

418
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:46,093
What church you belong to?
You, boy. There.

419
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:49,304
<i>- I said, what church you belong to?
- Church of Christ.</i>

420
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,266
Well, ask me about my church,
and I'll tell you...

421
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,958
it's the church that the blood of Jesus
don't foul with redemption.

422
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:01,753
<i>Listen here. I'm gonna take the truth
with me wherever I go.</i>

423
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:04,172
<i>I'm gonna preach it
to whoever will listen.</i>

424
00:43:04,256 --> 00:43:06,633
<i>I'm gonna preach
that there was no fall...</i>

425
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:10,011
'cause there was nothin'
to fall from.

426
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:12,889
No redemption
'cause there was no Fall...

427
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:16,768
<i>and no Judgment
because there wasn't the first two.</i>

428
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:20,633
Nothin' matters
but that Jesus Christ was a liar!

429
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:24,879
- Hazel? Listen here, Hazel. I found it.
- What do you want?

430
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:28,925
I found it... the house where they live.
You shouldn't have oughta hit me, Hazel.

431
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:31,052
<i>It weren't nothin 'I done
that you should've hit me.</i>

432
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:34,931
I only thought it was a three. But I found it,
and I'll take you there if you want.

433
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:37,308
I know where they live.

434
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:41,062
- I live there now, see?
- You know where they live?

435
00:43:41,187 --> 00:43:44,263
But if you didn't know and I told you,
then you'd know now.

436
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,462
Oh, get outta here.

437
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:50,216
<i>All he can do is hang around
and make a fool out of himself.</i>

438
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,260
<i>He don't know whether
he's comin' or goin'.</i>

439
00:43:52,385 --> 00:43:55,471
<i>He-He ain't nothin'
but a shiftless, crazy boy.</i>

440
00:43:57,014 --> 00:44:01,602
<i>If Jesus Christ had redeemed you,
what difference would it make to you?</i>

441
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:04,480
What difference would it make
to that crazy boy?

442
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,732
There's no peace for the redeemed.

443
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:09,713
<i>If there was three crosses there...</i>

444
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:13,259
and Jesus Christ
hung on the middle one...

445
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:18,013
that wouldn't mean no more
to you or me than the other two.

446
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:23,936
What you need is somethin'
to take the place of Jesus...

447
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:27,565
<i>somethin' that would speak plain.</i>

448
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:31,770
Now, the Church Without Christ
don't have a Jesus.

449
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:36,760
<i>But it needs one.
It needs a new Jesus...</i>

450
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:40,597
one that's all man,
without blood to waste...

451
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:44,893
<i>that don't look like any other man,
so you'll look at him.</i>

452
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,438
<i>- Give me such a Jesus.
- I got him!</i>

453
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,524
I mean, I can get him.
Him... you seen him yourself.

454
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,734
<i>Him that I showed to you...
the new Jesus.</i>

455
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:54,778
I'll get him.
I'll get him for you, Hazel.

456
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:59,511
<i>You look at me
and you look at a peaceful man...</i>

457
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:03,890
<i>peaceful because
my blood has set me free.</i>

458
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:20,476
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me.</i>

459
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:25,432
<i>Come in.</i>

460
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,604
What do you want?

461
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,775
If Jesus Christ cured blind men...

462
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,404
how come you don't get him
to cure you?

463
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,072
He blinded Paul.

464
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,437
Where did you get them scars
under your eyes?

465
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,431
Get me that clipping.

466
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:01,738
Here. Read that.
That's how I got the scars.

467
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:06,743
<i>He done it with lime.
And there was hundreds converted.</i>

468
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:12,935
Anybody that blinded hisself
for justification oughta be able to save you...

469
00:46:14,562 --> 00:46:16,439
or even somebody of his blood.

470
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:20,693
Nobody with a good car...

471
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,903
needs to be justified.

472
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:33,976
The bastard not away with my clipping.
Go get it.

473
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:37,896
Well, you not another clipping,
ain't ya?

474
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,774
The one that says,
"Evangelist's Nerve Fails. "

475
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:58,411
Thief! Thief!

476
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:21,245
I been here all the time,
and you never known it.

477
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:29,795
What do you want to hide
in my car for?

478
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:32,862
I got business before me.
I ain't not time for any foolishness.

479
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:34,945
Let's drive a bit.

480
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,411
My name is Sabbath...
Sabbath Lily Hawks.

481
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:06,497
My mother named me that
just after I was born...

482
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:08,582
because I was born on the Sabbath.

483
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:11,460
And then she turned over in her bed
and died, and I never seen her.

484
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:13,712
- Uh-huh.
- Him and her wasn't married.

485
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:16,632
And that makes me a bastard,
but I can't help it.

486
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:19,004
It was what he done to me
and not what I done to myself.

487
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:21,865
- Bastard?
- A real bastard.

488
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:23,867
Do you know what?

489
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,369
"A bastard shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven. "

490
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,538
- How could you be a bastard when...
- Do you read the papers?

491
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:29,748
No.

492
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:31,833
Well, there's this woman in it
named Mary Brittle...

493
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:33,919
that tells you what to do
when you don't know.

494
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:36,338
You couldn't...
- I wrote her a letter and asked what I was to do.

495
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:40,425
- You couldn't be a bastard when...
- I said, "Dear Mary, I am a bastard...

496
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,123
"and a bastard shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven, as we all know.

497
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:47,744
"But I have this personality
that makes boys follow me.

498
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:49,871
"Do you think I should neck or not?

499
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:51,873
"I shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven anyway...

500
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,875
so I don't see what difference it makes. "

501
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,378
- Listen here. If your daddy was...
- Then she answered my letter in the paper.

502
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:01,800
She said, "Dear Sabbath,
light necking is acceptable...

503
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:05,970
"but I think your real problem
is one of adjustment to the modern world.

504
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,248
"Perhaps you ought to reexamine
your religious values...

505
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,620
"to see if they meet
your needs in life.

506
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:13,539
"A religious experience can be
a beautiful addition to living...

507
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:17,001
"if you put it in the proper perspective
and do not let it warp you.

508
00:50:17,126 --> 00:50:19,086
Read some books on ethical culture. "

509
00:50:19,212 --> 00:50:22,757
You couldn't be a bastard when...
You must be mixed up.

510
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:24,801
Your daddy blinded hisself
for Jesus Christ...

511
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:26,803
Then I wrote another letter.

512
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:29,931
I says, "Dear Mary,
what I really want to know...

513
00:50:30,056 --> 00:50:32,416
"is should I go
the whole hon or not.

514
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:36,624
That's my real problem.
I've adjusted okay to the modern world. "

515
00:50:36,749 --> 00:50:41,504
- But your daddy blinded hisself forJes...
- He wasn't always as holy as he is now.

516
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:44,381
She never answered my second letter.

517
00:50:44,465 --> 00:50:47,635
You mean in his youth, your daddy
didn't believe, but he come to.

518
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,429
- Is that what you mean, or ain't it?
- That's right.

519
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:53,516
You quit feelin' that...
my leg with yours.

520
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,915
Can you turn down that dirt road?

521
00:51:04,505 --> 00:51:06,423
Ho-How did he come to believe?

522
00:51:06,507 --> 00:51:09,259
What changed him
to a preacher of Jesus?

523
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:12,971
Why don't we get out and sit under the trees
where we can get better acquainted?

524
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:16,767
Was he always such an evil-seemin' man
before he came to believe...

525
00:51:16,892 --> 00:51:18,888
or just part-way evil seemin'?

526
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:21,666
All-the-way evil.
Stop the car.

527
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:27,839
Let's get out here.

528
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,473
Let's sit down for a while.

529
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:03,478
I gotta be goin' back to town.
I ain't not time to set in any woods.

530
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:08,133
I suppose, before he came to believe,
he didn't believe at all.

531
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:10,129
I can save you.

532
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:13,591
I've not a church in my heart
where Jesus is king.

533
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:17,679
I believe in the new kind of Jesus...

534
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,599
the one that can't waste his blood
redeeming people with it...

535
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:26,104
'cause he's all man
and ain't not any God in him.

536
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,106
<i>My church is the Church Without Christ.</i>

537
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:30,976
Well, can a bastard be saved in it?

538
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:35,967
They ain't any such a thing as a bastard
in the Church Without Christ.

539
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,844
<i>Everything is all one.</i>

540
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,098
Bastard wouldn't be any different
from anybody else.

541
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:43,182
That's good.

542
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:49,605
<i>There was this child once
that nobody cared if It lived or died.</i>

543
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,651
Its kin sent it around
from one to another of them...

544
00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:58,092
and finally to its grandmother,
who was a very evil woman.

545
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,094
<i>And she couldn't stand
to have it around...</i>

546
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,263
<i>'cause the least good thing
made her break out in these welts.</i>

547
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:07,309
She'd get all itchin' and swole.

548
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,104
Even her eyes would itch her
and swell up.

549
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,399
And there wasn't nothing she could do
but run up and down the road...

550
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,193
shakin' her hands and cursin'.

551
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,441
<i>And it was twice as bad
when this child was there...</i>

552
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,760
<i>so she kept the child locked up
in a chicken crate.</i>

553
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:26,056
It seen its granny in hellfire...

554
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:28,225
swole and burnin'...

555
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,811
and it told her everything it seen.

556
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:34,648
And she not so swole
until finally she went to the well...

557
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:37,150
and wrapped the well rope
around her neck...

558
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:40,654
and let down the bucket
and broke her neck.

559
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,470
Would you guess me to be
17 years old?

560
00:53:45,553 --> 00:53:51,184
Wouldn't be any sense to the word
"bastard" in the Church Without Christ.

561
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:54,646
Ain't my feet white though?

562
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:02,487
Why don't you lie down and rest yourself?

563
00:54:25,822 --> 00:54:29,033
Don't make any difference to me
how much you like me.

564
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:38,437
I see you.
I see you.

565
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:40,481
Get away from me!

566
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:52,994
Come on, if you don't want to get left.

567
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:20,065
What'd you do to my car?

568
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,950
What's wrong in there?

569
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,035
It's a good car, ain't it?

570
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,828
Look, mister.
That's a good car.

571
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:40,616
<i>That car'll get me
anywhere I want to go.</i>

572
00:56:58,237 --> 00:57:00,948
I told you this car'll get me
anywhere I want to go.

573
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:05,828
She may stop every once in a while,
but she won't stop permanent.

574
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:07,872
- How much do I owe you?
- Not a thing.

575
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:09,957
<i>- What about the gas?
- Nothin'.</i>

576
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,127
- Not a thing.
- All right. Thank you.

577
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,796
Told you this car'll get me
anywhere I want to go.

578
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:27,953
It's a grand auto.
Goes as smooth as honey.

579
00:57:28,037 --> 00:57:31,874
Wasn't built by a bunch of foreigners
or niggers, nor one-armed men.

580
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:34,668
It was built by people
with their eyes open...

581
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:36,962
who knew where they was at.

582
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:58,336
<i>Some folks
is- is- is always disputin' everything.</i>

583
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:02,632
<i>Some folks thinks that they...
that they owe...</i>

584
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:07,249
everything that they not
to Jesus Christ crucified.

585
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:13,788
Well, in my economy, there ain't
nobody that owes nothin' to nobody.

586
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,709
Are you gonna stay and listen,
or you...

587
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:21,171
are you gonna walk away
like everybody else?

588
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:23,298
<i>Well, go on and go.</i>

589
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:26,468
But remember, the truth
don't lurk around every street corner.

590
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:28,845
Folks. Folks Come on. Come on.
Come on, you folks.

591
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,334
Stay now. Come back here.
Come on. Come on back here.

592
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:34,370
<i>Yes, ma'am. Just come on.</i>

593
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:37,040
<i>Come on now. Stay.
I was just fixin' to tell you all about me.</i>

594
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:41,336
I wish I had my guitar.

595
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:44,005
Somehow it's just easier for me...

596
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:48,009
to say something sweet with music,
rather than just... just plain.

597
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,262
Listen to me, friends.

598
00:58:52,513 --> 00:58:55,833
Before I met this prophet here...

599
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:59,373
<i>I didn't have a friend in this world.</i>

600
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,459
Do any of you know what it means...

601
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,502
not to have a friend in the world?

602
00:59:03,628 --> 00:59:06,881
<i>Ain't no worse than nobody who wouldn't stick
a knife in your back when you wasn't lookin'.</i>

603
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:08,966
You said a mouthful
when you said that, friend.

604
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,094
Everybody, friends,
I want to introduce myself to you.

605
00:59:12,178 --> 00:59:14,388
My name is Onnie Jay Holy...

606
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,390
and I am a preacher.

607
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:19,462
I don't... I don't mind you knowing that.

608
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,334
But I don't...
I don't want you to believe anything.

609
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,461
And I wouldn't ask you
to believe anything...

610
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:28,464
that you did not feel
right in your own hearts.

611
00:59:28,547 --> 00:59:32,843
<i>Friends, everybody that's born
onto this earth...</i>

612
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:35,638
<i>is full of sweetness and love.</i>

613
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:37,681
You know that
when a child gets bigger...

614
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:39,683
that sweetness just doesn't
show so good, does it?

615
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:41,931
I mean, troubles come
to perplex him, folks.

616
00:59:43,256 --> 00:59:46,668
I mean, the sweetness nets driven inside.

617
00:59:46,752 --> 00:59:51,715
<i>Then he becomes miserable
and lonesome and... and sick...</i>

618
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,176
<i>and, you know, he starts to say...</i>

619
00:59:54,259 --> 00:59:56,219
<i>"Now, where's my sweetness gone?"</i>

620
00:59:56,345 --> 01:00:01,058
If somebody's sweetness, friends,
they might just despair completely.

621
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:05,269
Huh? I mean, despair.

622
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:09,419
Now that... that's the way it was
with me, friends.

623
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,965
I know what of I speak here.
Before I met the prophet.

624
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:17,135
Before I found out
he was out here to help me.

625
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:21,181
I mean, he's out here preaching
the Church of Christ Without Christ.

626
01:00:21,306 --> 01:00:23,266
Now I want you all to listen to him.

627
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,145
I want you to listen to him and to me,
and I want you to join our church.

628
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:29,189
The holy Church...

629
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:31,384
of Jesus Christ Without Christ.

630
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,340
That... That man ain't true.

631
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,425
- I never seen him before tonight.
- I wasn't true, friends.

632
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:41,346
I wasn't true before I met this prophet here.
I want you to know that. I wasn't true.

633
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,682
I didn't preach the truth. But I'm
gonna give you some reasons right now...

634
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,310
why you can join this church,
why it's best for you.

635
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,104
The first thing is
there's just nothing foreign about it.

636
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,440
- No. Nothing foreign about it.
- No. No, listen.

637
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:55,759
Blasphemy ain't the way to the truth,
whether you understand it or not.

638
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:58,466
- Hear the prophet! Hear the prophet!
- This... This man is a liar.

639
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:01,177
- I never seen him before tonight.
- I lied before I met this prophet.

640
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:04,305
I'm gonna give you some more reasons
why you ought to join this church, friends.

641
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:07,183
Some more reasons are
is this church is right up to date.

642
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:09,185
Now you hear me. It's up to date.

643
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:13,189
You belong to this church, nothin' or nobody
is ever gonna be ahead of you, right?

644
01:01:13,314 --> 01:01:15,191
Nothin' or nobody will be ahead of you.

645
01:01:15,316 --> 01:01:17,813
Nobody's gonna know something
that you don't know.

646
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:21,091
No, sir! I mean, all the cards right out
on the table, friends. That's a fact.

647
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:24,637
That's a natural fact. Now, it's gonna cost
each and every one of you here a dollar.

648
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,223
<i>- What's a dollar? A dollar's a few dimes.
- Here's my dollar.</i>

649
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:30,184
That's not too much to unlock
the little rose of sweetness inside you.

650
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:33,479
- Just one dollar.
- It don't cost you any money...

651
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:35,773
- Hear the prophet!
- to know the truth.

652
01:01:35,856 --> 01:01:37,775
You can't know it from money.

653
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:39,944
You see?
A dollar's not too much, friends.

654
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:42,851
You see? The prophet
don't care nothin' about money.

655
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:45,636
It's not too much to know the truth,
just one dollar.

656
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:48,847
Uh... Uh, folks,
I'm gonna have to leave you now.

657
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:51,558
But we're gonna meet here again
tomorrow night in this very same spot.

658
01:01:51,683 --> 01:01:55,854
Right in this same place. I gotta
catch up with the prophet right now.

659
01:01:57,189 --> 01:01:59,775
Where you goin'?
There must be at least $10 out there.

660
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:01,777
What's the bin hurry, friend?

661
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,488
Now listen. You and me
have not to get together on this thing.

662
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:07,847
You know what you put me in mind of
when I first seen you?

663
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:10,347
Jesus Christ and Abraham Lincoln.
You're...

664
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,808
- Get out.
- What are you sayin', friend?

665
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:14,851
Hey. I've been on the radio
for three years.

666
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:17,395
I'm a real preacher, friend.
You better listen to me now.

667
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:20,857
- Get out!
- Listen, you want to get anywhere in the religion business

668
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,984
you've not to keep it sweet.

669
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:25,028
Listen, friend!

670
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:27,614
Listen. You got some good ideas.
You got good ideas.

671
01:02:27,697 --> 01:02:30,524
All they need is a little promotion.
That Jesus idea is a good one.

672
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:32,514
- All we gotta do is promote it.
- Look. Look.

673
01:02:32,597 --> 01:02:36,810
There ain't any such a thing
as any new Jesus.

674
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:40,563
That wasn't nothin'
but a way of sayin' something, Holy!

675
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:44,651
My name ain't Holy.
My name is Hoover Shoates.

676
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:48,488
And you better remember it, friend,
because I'm about to run you out of business.

677
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:51,199
I mean, I'm gonna be back here
tomorrow night with a new prophet.

678
01:02:51,324 --> 01:02:53,489
I can find prophets for peanuts, friend.

679
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:56,224
I'll do my own preachin',
you understand me?

680
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:00,978
You better watch it, 'cause what you need
is a little competition. You understand?

681
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:03,831
Now, then, you can get out.
Now you can leave me alone.

682
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:23,120
<i>Hi, Hazel.</i>

683
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:28,375
<i>I don't care if you hit me.</i>

684
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,573
I'm staying with you.
I'm not goin'.

685
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:35,443
He ain't blind.

686
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:39,239
Your daddy ain't blind.

687
01:04:39,364 --> 01:04:41,533
I thought anybody
could have seen that.

688
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,535
He's just a crook.

689
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:47,330
I seen him. Just now.

690
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:49,499
<i>Without his glasses. A nd...</i>

691
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:51,876
And he saw me too.

692
01:04:52,002 --> 01:04:54,658
Listen.

693
01:04:54,741 --> 01:04:57,318
The minute I set eyes on you...

694
01:04:57,402 --> 01:04:59,862
I said to myself...

695
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:02,240
that's what I gotta have.

696
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,325
just give me some of him.

697
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:09,163
I said, "Look at those pecan eyes
and no crazy, girl.

698
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:12,875
<i>"That innocent look don't hide a thing.</i>

699
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,085
"He's just pure filthy...

700
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:20,695
"right to the nuts, like me.

701
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,322
"The only difference is...

702
01:05:23,406 --> 01:05:25,366
"I like being that way...

703
01:05:26,534 --> 01:05:28,494
and he don't. "

704
01:05:29,704 --> 01:05:32,164
Yes, sir.

705
01:05:32,248 --> 01:05:36,377
I like being that way,
and I can teach you how to like it.

706
01:05:36,502 --> 01:05:38,671
Don't you want to learn
how to like it?

707
01:05:38,754 --> 01:05:42,040
Yeah. Yeah, I want to.

708
01:05:42,164 --> 01:05:45,489
Take off your hat,
king of the beasts.

709
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:54,290
Gonga! Come shake the giant paw!

710
01:05:54,373 --> 01:05:56,875
The royal paw of
the monarch of the jungle.

711
01:05:57,001 --> 01:05:59,503
Gonga! The mighty Gonga!

712
01:05:59,628 --> 01:06:02,298
Before each showing,
the great star himself...

713
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:04,466
<i>will shake your tiny hand.</i>

714
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,161
<i>Come see Gonga live.</i>

715
01:06:07,244 --> 01:06:11,034
<i>A personal appearance by the frightful beast
before each presentation.</i>

716
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:14,621
<i>A free pass to the first 10
brave enough to shake his hand.</i>

717
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:19,751
<i>At 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, 6:00 and 8:00.</i>

718
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,008
- Hazel Motes live here?
- He does.

719
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:28,093
Is he around?

720
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,541
Upstairs.

721
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:32,576
First door.

722
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:45,171
My man is sick today and sleepin'...

723
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,215
'cause he didn't sleep none last night.

724
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,217
What do you want?

725
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:51,219
I done brought him
this here thing he needs.

726
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:54,295
He knows what it is.
I run a awful risk, but I did what I had to.

727
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,870
You just give it to him.
He'll know what to do with it.

728
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:59,414
- I'll take care of it.
- For him, not you, hear?

729
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:03,043
You just tell him I got it, now it's his,
and I'm glad to get shut of it.

730
01:07:03,068 --> 01:07:06,170
- What's in it?
- Something he gotta have.

731
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:08,548
Something that'll save
those that sees it.

732
01:07:08,673 --> 01:07:12,510
And he'll do something with it,
'cause it don't look like no other Jesus.

733
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,722
You just give it to him.

734
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,965
Well, I declare.

735
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,594
You're right cute, ain't ya?

736
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,016
Who's your mama and daddy?

737
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,311
Oh!

738
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,753
Well, let's go give him a jolt.

739
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,388
Call me mama now.

740
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:28,097
<i>You've broken him, and he was mine!</i>

741
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,896
You didn't have to do that.
I might have fixed him.

742
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:39,108
I knew when I first seen you
you were mean and evil.

743
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:42,888
I knew you were mean enough
to slam a baby against the wall.

744
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,217
I seen you wouldn't have no fun
nor let anybody help you...

745
01:09:45,342 --> 01:09:47,428
because you didn't want
nothin' but Jesus!

746
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:34,181
- Gonga is comin' here now?
- Yeah.

747
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:37,142
- The real Gonga?
- Yeah. He's comin'.

748
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:39,645
- You gonna shake his hand?
- Yeah.

749
01:10:39,728 --> 01:10:44,149
- Can... Can anybody shake his hand?
- Yeah. You gotta get in line first.

750
01:10:57,682 --> 01:11:00,185
Roaring Gonga, the great star.

751
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:02,854
Shake the great Gonga's hand
for a free pass.

752
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:06,691
A free pass to the first 10
brave enough to shake his hand.

753
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,733
Easy now.
Back off. Back off. Back off.

754
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:41,196
Get back. Get back.

755
01:11:43,353 --> 01:11:46,687
<i>Hang on. Please back up.
You see him? You see him?</i>

756
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:48,481
Have you ever seen...

757
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:54,403
Stay back children. Stay back.

758
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:57,448
<i>- Stay in line now.
- How old are you anyhow?</i>

759
01:11:57,573 --> 01:11:59,575
<i>Make it snappy.
Okay. There's your pass.</i>

760
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,203
Make it snappy.
Okay. There's your pass.

761
01:12:02,286 --> 01:12:04,534
Shake his hand and keep movin'.

762
01:12:04,617 --> 01:12:07,023
There's your pass.
Keep movin'.

763
01:12:07,106 --> 01:12:09,730
<i>Come on. Keep movin'.
Keep movin'. Let's go.</i>

764
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:15,236
<i>There's your pass.
Come on. Come on.</i>

765
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:18,239
Here you go.
There's your pass.

766
01:12:18,322 --> 01:12:20,532
<i>All right. Come on.</i>

767
01:12:20,658 --> 01:12:23,786
- My name's Enoch Emory.
- I can't hear you.

768
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:25,871
My... My name's Enoch Emory.
I work at the...

769
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:29,034
Okay. Keep it movin'.
Keep it movin'.

770
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:46,537
<i>I'm comin'!</i>

771
01:12:50,624 --> 01:12:54,404
There's a leak in the gas tank
I want you to plug up...

772
01:12:54,488 --> 01:12:57,567
and, uh, make the starter work smoother.

773
01:12:57,692 --> 01:12:59,778
Okay, open the hood.

774
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:04,991
Start it up.

775
01:13:07,077 --> 01:13:09,704
Where's...

776
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:13,458
Give it some gas!

777
01:13:24,697 --> 01:13:26,950
How long you figure
it'll take you to fix it up?

778
01:13:31,746 --> 01:13:33,706
Can't be done.

779
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,709
Oh, look, mister.
This is a good car.

780
01:13:36,793 --> 01:13:40,252
I knew, when I bought this car,
it was a good car.

781
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:43,403
Now I got a place to be
I can always get away in.

782
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:48,032
Plan on going someplace
in this here car?

783
01:13:48,115 --> 01:13:50,618
Yeah.

784
01:13:50,743 --> 01:13:52,703
Another garage.

785
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:16,330
- How much we gonna owe you?
- Seven dollars.

786
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,586
All right, sir. Hmm.

787
01:14:22,711 --> 01:14:25,756
He won't hurt you,
as long as I hold him by the chain.

788
01:14:25,881 --> 01:14:28,047
Shake hands with the star of the show.

789
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,578
Shake hands with Gonga.

790
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:32,574
<i>- Come on. Shake hands.
- Stay in line.</i>

791
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:37,121
Fourth goddamn time this idiot showed up.
Been following us around all goddamn day.

792
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:39,790
<i>- Stay in line there.
- Shake hands with Gonga.</i>

793
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:45,712
Hi, Gonga. I'm only 18 years old,
but I already work at the city zoo.

794
01:14:45,796 --> 01:14:48,257
You idiot. Go to hell. Get lost.

795
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:52,091
<i>Shake the mighty Gonga's hand.
Shake hands with the star himself.</i>

796
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:56,118
Shake hands with Gonga. He won't hurt you
as long as I hold him by the chain.

797
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:59,371
Where you come from is gone.

798
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:02,374
Where you thought you were going to...

799
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:04,543
weren't never there.

800
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,711
And where you are...

801
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:10,048
ain't no good
unless you can get away from it.

802
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:14,886
Your conscience... is a trick.

803
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:19,869
It don't exist.
And if you think it does...

804
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:23,123
<i>then you had best get it out
in the open...</i>

805
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:25,750
<i>hunt it down...</i>

806
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,752
and kill it.

807
01:15:27,877 --> 01:15:32,215
Friends, I want you to meet the
new prophet, the true prophet here.

808
01:15:32,298 --> 01:15:34,259
I want you to listen to what he says.

809
01:15:34,342 --> 01:15:36,386
<i>Listen here!</i>

810
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,762
I want you to listen to what he says,
'cause I think...

811
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:42,128
he's gonna make you as happy
as he has made me.

812
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:46,874
<i>The unredeemed are redeeming theirselves...</i>

813
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:50,044
and the new Jesus is at hand.

814
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,380
Watch for this miracle.

815
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:55,842
Help yourself to salvation...

816
01:15:55,925 --> 01:15:58,219
in the Holy Church of Christ...

817
01:15:58,302 --> 01:16:00,263
Without Christ.

818
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:03,723
- Amen! Amen! The prophet.
- Amen.

819
01:16:03,806 --> 01:16:06,959
<i>Amen. Amen.</i>

820
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:22,930
- Those kids were murder today.
- No kidding.

821
01:16:23,014 --> 01:16:24,974
- Brat kids.
- Shut up, man.

822
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:28,305
I'm pooped.

823
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:32,292
<i>There you go.</i>

824
01:17:41,929 --> 01:17:44,924
The prophet blesses ya! Yes.

825
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:47,218
<i>Come back tomorrow night, folks.
Bring your friends.</i>

826
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,060
You just earned yourself...

827
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,730
three dollars, friend.

828
01:17:58,813 --> 01:18:01,274
Let's make it four.
I want you back here tomorrow night.

829
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,885
Come on, Josie.

830
01:19:08,108 --> 01:19:10,068
Shake hands with Gonga.

831
01:19:12,196 --> 01:19:14,907
Watch it. Keep away.

832
01:19:16,774 --> 01:19:18,766
Do you want to shake hands with Gonga?

833
01:19:59,032 --> 01:20:01,701
<i>Now, what you done that for?</i>

834
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,815
What you want?

835
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:10,062
What you want?
I ain't done nothin' to you.

836
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:28,240
How come you done that?

837
01:20:28,364 --> 01:20:31,645
<i>Knocked my car in a ditch!</i>

838
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:43,157
Quit just lookin' at me.

839
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:46,118
Say what you want.

840
01:20:46,202 --> 01:20:50,372
How come you stand on that car...

841
01:20:50,456 --> 01:20:54,899
and say you don't believe
in what you do believe in?

842
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:59,943
What's it to you what I do?

843
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:02,321
Well, how come you do it
is what I asked.

844
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:07,951
Well, a man has to take care of hisself.

845
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:11,747
Take off the hat...
and the suit.

846
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:16,119
Now look here.
I ain't tryin' to mock you!

847
01:21:16,244 --> 01:21:19,357
He bought me this suit...

848
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,443
and I thrown my other one away.

849
01:21:21,568 --> 01:21:23,737
Take it off!

850
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,781
Take it all off!

851
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:02,253
Two things that I just can't stand...

852
01:22:02,379 --> 01:22:05,700
a man that ain't true
and one that mocks what is.

853
01:22:05,784 --> 01:22:10,990
You should never have tempered with me
if you didn't want what you not.

854
01:22:11,115 --> 01:22:13,951
I gave my mother...

855
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:15,953
a lot of trouble.

856
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:18,581
Never gave her no rest.

857
01:22:19,749 --> 01:22:23,169
And I stole that there car.

858
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:28,084
And I never told the truth to my daddy.

859
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:32,281
I told them where his still was...

860
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,408
for five dollars.

861
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:41,916
Jesus.

862
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,959
Help me.

863
01:23:08,045 --> 01:23:10,965
Shake hands with Gonga.

864
01:23:15,755 --> 01:23:18,744
<i>I don't wanna hurt you.</i>

865
01:23:20,744 --> 01:23:23,163
I only wanted to shake hands.

866
01:23:26,959 --> 01:23:29,294
I only wanted to shake hands.

867
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,220
What are you doin'?

868
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,257
I'm goin' somewheres.

869
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,914
What do you mean
you're going somewheres?

870
01:24:06,996 --> 01:24:08,915
Where are you goin'?

871
01:24:08,998 --> 01:24:12,460
I'm goin' to another city
to preach the truth.

872
01:24:17,382 --> 01:24:19,592
Hazel!

873
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:21,678
Hazel Motes!

874
01:24:28,839 --> 01:24:30,791
<i>Hazel.</i>

875
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:57,920
Okay. I want you to fill the car with nas...

876
01:24:58,003 --> 01:25:01,340
I want you to check the oil
and the tires and the water.

877
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:03,425
I'm goin' on a trip.

878
01:25:07,096 --> 01:25:09,932
- Where you goin'?
- To another city.

879
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:12,184
In this car?

880
01:25:12,309 --> 01:25:14,270
Look.

881
01:25:14,353 --> 01:25:17,715
Nobody with a good car needs to worry
about nothin'. You understand?

882
01:25:17,799 --> 01:25:19,711
Yep.

883
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:21,797
You got two leaks in the radiator.

884
01:25:22,798 --> 01:25:26,635
This here tire will last
maybe 20 miles if you go slow.

885
01:25:28,303 --> 01:25:32,599
This car is just beginning its life.
A lightning bolt couldn't stop it.

886
01:25:32,724 --> 01:25:35,185
Ain't no use putting water in.
It won't hold it.

887
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,980
Well, put it in there just the same.

888
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,592
I wasn't speedin', was I?

889
01:26:30,676 --> 01:26:32,635
No. You wasn't speedin'.

890
01:26:32,718 --> 01:26:35,138
Well, I was drivin'
on the right side of the road.

891
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:37,515
Yes. You was on the right side
of the road.

892
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,517
That's right.

893
01:26:39,642 --> 01:26:42,228
What'd you stop me for then?

894
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:44,605
I just don't like your face.

895
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:46,441
Well, I don't like yours either.

896
01:26:46,566 --> 01:26:49,861
- Where is your license?
- I don't need a license.

897
01:26:51,024 --> 01:26:54,304
No. I don't reckon you do need one.

898
01:26:54,429 --> 01:26:57,430
Well, I ain't not one if I do.

899
01:26:57,513 --> 01:27:02,435
Look. Would you mind following me
down the road just a little ways.

900
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:04,937
There's a view
I want to show you there.

901
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,106
<i>Prettiest view you ever did see.</i>

902
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:09,316
Follow me.

903
01:27:57,571 --> 01:27:59,489
I think you'd better get out.

904
01:27:59,573 --> 01:28:02,034
You'll see the view better
if you were outside.

905
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:49,740
What you gonna do with that,
Mr. Motes?

906
01:30:33,865 --> 01:30:37,660
<i>He's done it!</i>

907
01:30:37,785 --> 01:30:40,705
He's blinded hisself!

908
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:46,669
<i>He blinded himself.</i>

909
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:59,660
He blinded himself!
He gone and done it. He blinded himself!

910
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:55,964
<i>Just t-take it easy.</i>

911
01:31:58,967 --> 01:32:02,633
That girl is gone, Mr. Motes,
I'm happy to say.

912
01:32:02,758 --> 01:32:06,121
She left right after
you did what you did.

913
01:32:06,205 --> 01:32:09,164
Said she hadn't counted on
no honest-to- Jesus blind man...

914
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:12,459
and she run off
to catch up with her daddy.

915
01:32:12,584 --> 01:32:15,045
Real trash, Mr. Motes.

916
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:19,633
I run a orderly house,
and that girl was trash if I ever saw it.

917
01:32:20,675 --> 01:32:22,594
Now...

918
01:32:22,677 --> 01:32:24,971
here we are.

919
01:32:25,096 --> 01:32:29,168
Everything is just the same
as before.

920
01:32:30,538 --> 01:32:34,125
Tomorrow I'll bring your chair back up.

921
01:32:34,209 --> 01:32:36,294
I'm obliged.

922
01:32:36,377 --> 01:32:40,924
Not at all, Mr. Motes.
I want you to be comfortable in my house.

923
01:32:41,007 --> 01:32:43,885
Oh, here. Let me help you
get out of these clothes.

924
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:47,347
Oh, no, no.
I can... I can take off my own clothes.

925
01:32:47,472 --> 01:32:49,349
Uh, I don't need no more help.

926
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,962
Well, all right.

927
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,502
You just call me if you need me.

928
01:33:04,342 --> 01:33:07,303
Welcome back, Mr. Motes.

929
01:33:19,919 --> 01:33:23,547
Why don't you start preaching again,
Mr. Motes?

930
01:33:23,672 --> 01:33:27,426
Being blind wouldn't be a hindrance.
People like to see a blind preacher.

931
01:33:29,011 --> 01:33:32,473
Could get you one of them seeing dons.

932
01:33:32,598 --> 01:33:35,017
You and him could get up quite a crowd.

933
01:33:35,101 --> 01:33:37,477
People always pay to see a don.

934
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,969
<i>Certainly ought to start it again.</i>

935
01:33:40,052 --> 01:33:42,503
<i>Give you something to do.</i>

936
01:33:42,628 --> 01:33:45,381
You haven't done a thing
for months but walk.

937
01:33:47,549 --> 01:33:49,593
Why don't you start preaching again?

938
01:33:49,676 --> 01:33:51,678
I can't preach.

939
01:33:51,762 --> 01:33:53,680
<i>Why?</i>

940
01:33:53,764 --> 01:33:57,059
<i>I ain't not time.</i>

941
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,220
<i>Mr. Motes.</i>

942
01:35:18,344 --> 01:35:20,304
<i>That wire.</i>

943
01:35:20,388 --> 01:35:22,556
<i>What's that wire around you for?</i>

944
01:35:22,682 --> 01:35:24,266
What you do these things for?

945
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,604
<i>- To pay.
- Pay? Pay for what?</i>

946
01:35:28,688 --> 01:35:32,358
Mr. Motes, what do you
walk on rocks for?

947
01:35:32,483 --> 01:35:36,195
It don't make any difference what for.

948
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,643
<i>- I- It's not natural.
- It's... It's natural.</i>

949
01:35:40,726 --> 01:35:42,680
Well, it's not normal.

950
01:35:43,681 --> 01:35:46,684
I- It's like one of them gory stories...

951
01:35:46,767 --> 01:35:49,895
<i>that some people have quit doin'.</i>

952
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:55,276
<i>Like boiling in oil
or being a saint or walling up cats.</i>

953
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:58,279
Th-There's no reason to it.
People have quit doin' it.

954
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:01,488
They... They ain't quit doin' it...

955
01:36:01,613 --> 01:36:03,815
as long as I'm doin' it.

956
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:07,015
People have quit doin' it.
What do you do it for?

957
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,434
I ain't cl-clean.

958
01:36:11,103 --> 01:36:13,689
I know it.

959
01:36:13,814 --> 01:36:16,608
You got blood on that shirt...

960
01:36:16,692 --> 01:36:18,610
and in the bed.

961
01:36:18,694 --> 01:36:20,988
That ain't the kind of clean.

962
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:26,113
There's only one kind of clean,
Mr. Motes.

963
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:28,190
You can't see.

964
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:33,895
I wouldn't be surprised
if you wasn't some kind of a...

965
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,981
<i>agent of the pope or...</i>

966
01:36:37,065 --> 01:36:40,569
<i>g- got some connection
with somethin' funny.</i>

967
01:36:42,028 --> 01:36:44,489
The way you live,
Mr. Motes, is terrible.

968
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:47,993
You-You might as well be
one of them monks.

969
01:36:48,076 --> 01:36:50,406
You might as well live in a...
in a monkery.

970
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:52,981
<i>It's not good for you, Mr. Motes.</i>

971
01:36:53,064 --> 01:36:56,813
I ain't arguing with you about this.

972
01:37:36,873 --> 01:37:39,032
Hear that wind, Mr. Motes?

973
01:37:41,608 --> 01:37:44,817
It's fortunate for you to have this...

974
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:47,736
warm place to be and...

975
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,864
somebody to take care of you.

976
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:57,121
Every blind and sick man
isn't so fortunate as to...

977
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,540
have somebody that cares for him.

978
01:38:01,415 --> 01:38:03,325
Let me tell you, Mr. Motes...

979
01:38:03,409 --> 01:38:05,860
few men are as fortunate as you.

980
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:11,113
But I... I can't keep climbin'
up and down those stairs.

981
01:38:11,196 --> 01:38:13,198
<i>It wears me out.</i>

982
01:38:14,366 --> 01:38:16,827
<i>I've been thinkin' of what
we could do about it.</i>

983
01:38:18,162 --> 01:38:21,623
I know you like it here,
and you don't want to leave this house...

984
01:38:21,748 --> 01:38:26,496
and you're a sick man and need somebody
to take care of you, beside being blind.

985
01:38:27,577 --> 01:38:31,653
So I been thinkin'
how we could arrange it so...

986
01:38:31,736 --> 01:38:36,992
you could have a home
and somebody to take care of you and...

987
01:38:37,075 --> 01:38:39,536
I wouldn't have to
go up and down those stairs.

988
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:41,913
<i>I've been thinkin; and...</i>

989
01:38:43,999 --> 01:38:47,502
I see only one thing
for you and me to do.

990
01:38:48,712 --> 01:38:50,622
Get married.

991
01:38:52,825 --> 01:38:55,321
<i>I- I cannot allow you...</i>

992
01:38:55,447 --> 01:38:58,283
to stay under no other circumstances.

993
01:39:08,835 --> 01:39:10,795
<i>Mr. Motes?</i>

994
01:39:12,963 --> 01:39:15,165
<i>What are you d-dressing for?</i>

995
01:39:15,248 --> 01:39:17,284
You don't want to go out
in this weather.

996
01:39:20,032 --> 01:39:23,536
<i>Nobody should be without
a place of their own, and...</i>

997
01:39:24,996 --> 01:39:27,290
I'm offering you a home...

998
01:39:27,373 --> 01:39:29,333
a place here with me...

999
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:31,419
a place you can always
stay, Mr. Motes...

1000
01:39:31,544 --> 01:39:33,588
and never worry yourself about.

1001
01:39:40,704 --> 01:39:44,243
I got a place for you in my heart,
Mr. Motes.

1002
01:39:44,368 --> 01:39:46,245
I don't want a thing
but to help you...

1003
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:49,331
and if we don't help each other,
there's nobody to help us.

1004
01:39:49,457 --> 01:39:51,876
Nobody.

1005
01:39:52,001 --> 01:39:55,004
The world's a empty place, Mr. Motes.

1006
01:39:57,381 --> 01:40:00,676
You got nobody
to take care of you but me.

1007
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,542
Nobody care if you live or die but me.

1008
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,910
No place to be but mine.

1009
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:16,128
Or were you thinking about finding you
another rooming house?

1010
01:40:16,211 --> 01:40:19,048
Maybe you were thinking about
going to some other city.

1011
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:23,052
No. That ain't where I'm goin'.

1012
01:40:23,177 --> 01:40:26,007
There ain't no other house.

1013
01:40:26,132 --> 01:40:28,499
There ain't no other city.

1014
01:40:28,583 --> 01:40:30,537
There's nothin', Mr. Motes.

1015
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:37,502
And time goes forward.
It don't go backward.

1016
01:40:37,586 --> 01:40:39,504
Unless you take what's offered you...

1017
01:40:39,588 --> 01:40:43,467
you'll... you'll find yourself
out in the cold pitch black, and...

1018
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:45,761
just how far you think you'll get?

1019
01:40:49,552 --> 01:40:53,665
You needn't return to a place
you don't value, Mr. Motes.

1020
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:56,166
The door won't be open to ya.

1021
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:36,974
I want the police.
Get me the police.

1022
01:41:57,975 --> 01:41:59,936
Hey. What's that over there?

1023
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:19,433
<i>Aren't we looking for one
in a blue suit?</i>

1024
01:42:19,558 --> 01:42:21,518
Blind and not a blue suit.

1025
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:28,800
His suit ain't blue.

1026
01:42:28,883 --> 01:42:31,215
Yes, it is blue.

1027
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,217
You think he's dead?

1028
01:42:33,342 --> 01:42:35,219
Ask him.

1029
01:42:35,344 --> 01:42:39,014
Hey, you. No, he's not dead. He's movin'.

1030
01:42:39,097 --> 01:42:41,099
Maybe he's just unconscious.

1031
01:42:42,893 --> 01:42:46,021
Uh, is it day or night?

1032
01:42:46,104 --> 01:42:49,312
It's day. We've gotta
take you back to pay your rent.

1033
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:55,675
I'm... I'm goin' where I'm goin'.

1034
01:42:56,885 --> 01:42:58,803
We not to take you back anyway.

1035
01:42:58,887 --> 01:43:01,139
Got to pay your rent first...
every bit of it.

1036
01:43:20,887 --> 01:43:22,889
Oh.

1037
01:43:30,897 --> 01:43:33,733
<i>- Is this your man?
- That's him.</i>

1038
01:43:33,858 --> 01:43:36,110
<i>We found him down by
the railroad trestle.</i>

1039
01:43:36,236 --> 01:43:38,188
In here.

1040
01:43:47,934 --> 01:43:50,603
I thank you.

1041
01:43:57,735 --> 01:44:01,027
Well, Mr. Motes,
I see you've come home.

1042
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,263
I knew you'd be back,
and I've been waitin' for ya.

1043
01:44:07,848 --> 01:44:10,309
You can have it any way you like...
upstairs or down...

1044
01:44:10,392 --> 01:44:14,396
just however you want it...
and me to wait on you.

1045
01:44:16,732 --> 01:44:19,819
If you want to go on somewhere...

1046
01:44:19,902 --> 01:44:21,904
we'll both go.

1047
01:44:23,113 --> 01:44:25,070
Won't we, Mr. Motes?

1048
01:44:27,687 --> 01:44:29,641
Mr. Motes?

1049
01:44:35,104 --> 01:44:37,064
Mr. Motes?

1050
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:49,529
Mr. Motes?
