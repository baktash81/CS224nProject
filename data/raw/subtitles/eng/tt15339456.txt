1
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,334
<i>Okay, are you ready?</i>

2
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:40,368
<i>I guess.</i>

3
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,072
<i>And speeding.</i>

4
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,942
<i>What's that?</i>

5
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,384
<i>I want to start
with some questions.</i>

6
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:47,409
<i>Oh, got it.</i>

7
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,146
<i>Is it hard for you?</i>

8
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,448
<i>Has it been hard
for you since...</i>

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,784
<i>Mmm...</i>

10
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:57,686
<i>Not in the way that I think you
would think it would be, but...</i>

11
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,626
<i>Uh, it's pretty much
common knowledge</i>

12
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,561
<i>that it takes at least 20 shells</i>

13
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:06,662
<i>to have a community.</i>

14
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:11,835
<i>That that's about the minimum
that you need to survive, so...</i>

15
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,169
<i>Yeah.</i>

16
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,271
<i>I think at first</i>

17
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:16,671
<i>I was thinking
we're not gonna make it.</i>

18
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:25,782
<i>But sometimes you just have
to disregard those rules</i>

19
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,092
<i>and think, "Well, actually,
the rule is</i>

20
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,951
<i>"that I want to be
having a good life</i>

21
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,519
<i>"and stay alive, and...</i>

22
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,057
<i>And not just survive,
but have a good life.</i>

23
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,695
Tell me about
what's life like now?

24
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,200
It... Me? Uh...

25
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,468
<i>I appreciate
its different beauties,</i>

26
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:49,472
<i>but it... it's not the way
I would've done things</i>

27
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,873
<i>if I was still in the group.</i>

28
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:55,610
<i>But they're not here.</i>

29
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:59,049
<i>So, that's why I have
the electric mixer.</i>

30
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,549
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

31
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,929
Ta-da!

32
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,472
I mean,
I don't want my voice in it.

33
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,729
Well, that's up to you.

34
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:15,974
So, stop asking me
questions is what I'm saying.

35
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:17,834
Oh! Oh, okay.

36
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,870
Do your parents work?
Have you ever met a chef?

37
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:20,979
What happens if you break this?

38
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,247
Have you ever eaten a raspberry?

39
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,108
Um, and what was that like?

40
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,776
Are you gonna ask me questions?

41
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,080
Hello?

42
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,817
Oh, man, this is weird.

43
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,685
I don't want my voice in it.

44
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:37,253
How am I supposed
to ask you questions?

45
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,891
<i>There are actually
only two of us now.</i>

46
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,627
<i>Myself...</i>

47
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:48,663
<i>...and my grandmother,
Nana Connie.</i>

48
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,813
<i>Back when the man
and the woman lived here,</i>

49
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:56,272
<i>there were a lot of us.</i>

50
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:59,241
<i>More sounds and smells</i>

51
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,111
<i>and, uh, things to say</i>

52
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,114
<i>'cause there were
more people to talk to.</i>

53
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,719
- There... A stage.
- All right!

54
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,155
Ah! Up.

55
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,858
<i>These days, it's quieter.</i>

56
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,973
Rolling.
Give me some levels.

57
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:33,641
Give... Give you some levels?
Like...

58
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:36,947
Just, like, talk
a little bit. Like, oh, uh...

59
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,581
- Hello, my name is...
- Darn it.

60
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:41,317
It's not the first time
I've done that.

61
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,451
My name is Marcel,

62
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:46,322
and I'm partially a shell
as you can see on my body,

63
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:50,761
but I also have shoes,

64
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,963
and, um, a face.

65
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,901
So, I like that about myself,
and I like myself,

66
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,903
and I have a lot of
other great qualities as well.

67
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,670
That was perfect.
Okay.

68
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,144
Is this the wild tone right now?

69
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,211
- Yes.
- Ugh.

70
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,113
Just stay still for 30 seconds.

71
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,684
How long you gonna...

72
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,262
What are you trying to do
with all this?

73
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:18,822
Um...

74
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:20,266
I'm making, like,
a little documentary

75
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,824
that I might put online.

76
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,194
- Online?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,762
Eh, you lost me.

78
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:28,165
Ugh.

79
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,701
Are you okay?
Itchy. Are you recording?

80
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:33,769
Yeah.
Right now?

81
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:34,937
Yeah.
Oh.

82
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,672
Well, what should I be doing?

83
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,941
Just, well, don't do anything.

84
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,384
Just do whatever
you'd normally be doing,

85
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:40,709
like if I weren't here.

86
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,093
Where'd you get the rope?

87
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,362
This?
Uh, It... I... I'll show you.

88
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,798
I come to the bathroom,
I get these curly hairs.

89
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:03,399
They're the strongest

90
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,168
'cause you have to uncurl it,

91
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,838
but, um, then you can see
it's really long and strong.

92
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,839
But...

93
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,673
Hey, what are you laughing at?

94
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,112
We call 'em hardy hairs.

95
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,980
<i>This is the arboretum,</i>

96
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:21,250
<i>a collection of trees
that a community keeps alive,</i>

97
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,427
but I do like to talk to them,

98
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:23,685
and plants like to have

99
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,355
classical music played for them.

100
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:28,425
<i>Mozart and Brahms,
it helps them grow faster.</i>

101
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,293
This is my bread room.

102
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:32,129
Uh, it's a bedroom,

103
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,029
but I sleep on a piece of bread,

104
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,298
so I...

105
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,899
Whoa, sorry.
He's just saying hi.

106
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:38,401
<i>I actually</i>

107
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:40,745
<i>like the concept of having a dog.</i>

108
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,906
Oh, God, I can smell his face.

109
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,009
But I just tie a hair
to a piece of lint,

110
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,377
and I drag it around.

111
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,911
I love you.

112
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:51,848
Come on. Come on.
That's it.

113
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,382
<i>Sometimes, people say</i>

114
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:56,086
that my head is too big
for my body.

115
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:59,021
And then I say,
"Compared to what?"

116
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,824
Sometimes, if I don't have
a way to itch my itch,

117
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,959
the only thing I can do is
I just stand there.

118
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:06,694
I just let it get me
and I just...

119
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:08,165
I just have to scream it out.

120
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,446
He's your best friend?

121
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,682
Don't you know any other

122
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,886
guys or...

123
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,788
Cool.

124
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,096
Hmm. I never get it
the first time.

125
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,036
Nope.

126
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:50,973
Oh, dang it.

127
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,947
Oh! Go, go, go!

128
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,083
Boom! There it is.

129
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,221
You miss a 100% of the shots
you don't take.

130
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,156
Wow.
That's a quote.

131
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,156
I didn't make that up.

132
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:10,492
It's by a famous sports player
named Wayde...

133
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,362
Wayde Gansdy...

134
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,463
What is it?

135
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:15,831
Ways...

136
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,367
Way... Whale...

137
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,103
Whale Gensky.

138
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,904
Are you thinking of Wayne...
Gensky. Whale...

139
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,281
Wayne...
Could that be his name?

140
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:24,440
Whale Jetski?

141
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:25,809
No.
No?

142
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:29,178
- Wake... Lake... Jake?
- Well...

143
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,815
Wayne Jet... Jet... Get...

144
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,017
This is my stockpile.

145
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,152
All right,
so, we got your basics here.

146
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,322
I got couple of almonds.
I have a dozen peanuts.

147
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,789
It's basically your dry goods.

148
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:42,558
You got a craisin
with the raisins,

149
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,360
but the craisin sits to the side

150
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:46,895
because it is a treat. Uh...

151
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,298
Is...
Is this an inhaler?

152
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,534
It's like... It's like a slide
or something...

153
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:53,879
Like, I don't even actually
know what it this is.

154
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,014
Where did you get that from?

155
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,941
From one of the people
that stayed here for a night.

156
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,210
Why?
Did you take anything from me?

157
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:01,244
Mmm...

158
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,249
What is wrong with you?

159
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:07,450
I didn't know.

160
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,561
<i>Give me that.
I didn't know what it was.</i>

161
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,428
So, these are
all the parts put together.

162
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,322
Mmm-hmm.
And then now what?

163
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,399
I'm gonna put it
on the Internet,

164
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:14,923
and people can watch it.
Oh.

165
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,028
Oh, no.

166
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,962
Your soda can is almost empty.

167
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:22,831
Whoa.

168
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,167
Sorry.
Hold on one second.

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,835
All right.

170
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,013
I don't know why you would...

171
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:28,280
What... What is
cleaning the house

172
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,873
if all she does is
move things around,

173
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,441
and disturb
the entire environment?

174
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,385
She doesn't.
She's doing dishes right now.

175
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:36,145
She's the harbinger
of the vacuum.

176
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,222
I can't tell her to go home.

177
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,456
I mean, that's her
scheduled cleaning.

178
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,581
But why?
She was hired

179
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:43,052
by the lady that is, like,
the Airbnb host.

180
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:46,056
What? The...
Airbnb?

181
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,091
Mmm, what is Airbb?
To clean.

182
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:50,225
Oh, that's you! Oh, who's she?

183
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,028
Oh... I don't...

184
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:53,363
Oh, wow, wait, what?

185
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,532
That's outside of here.
Yeah.

186
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,200
Somehow, this has kind of turned

187
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,201
into like a computer hotel?

188
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,104
Sort of, yeah.
Why did you decide...

189
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:02,339
Why are you here?

190
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:03,916
I had to move
out of my old place,

191
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,875
so I'm staying here
until I find a new one.

192
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,110
Why did you have to move out?

193
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:08,378
Uh, that's personal.

194
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,580
Okay.

195
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,390
You never talked to anyone
who stayed here before?

196
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,950
Eh...

197
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:15,250
People don't usually notice us.

198
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,120
Aw, dang it.

199
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:18,520
I got to go check on Nana Connie

200
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,322
if this lady's gonna
be running the vacuum.

201
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,360
This is the rover. Ow!

202
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,895
It's a good thing I don't,
like, "care" care

203
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:29,499
about this car because I can't

204
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:30,576
figure out
where I'm going in this thing.

205
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,568
Oops, what was that? Sorry.

206
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:35,138
No, no, no. Arthur.

207
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:37,407
Hopefully, she's right
around the corner here.

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,610
And there she is.

209
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,212
That's a load off.

210
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,980
Can you just wait here
for one sec

211
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,549
because I do think that
with you and with the camera,

212
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,085
- it's just I... That I...
- Okay.

213
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,552
I just want to warn her. Yeah.
Okay.

214
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,688
Brown head-hair,
and he has glasses.

215
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,799
You want me to leave?

216
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,225
No, no, no, no, no! I want you
to stay is what I...

217
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,092
- Yeah.
- Just careful

218
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,303
- where you step.
- Yeah, I know.

219
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:00,505
- I just brought him by.
- You're making what?

220
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,663
A documentary.

221
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:05,510
It's like...
Oh, it's like a movie,

222
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:06,602
but nobody has any lines,

223
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,071
and nobody even knows what it is

224
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,105
while they're making it.

225
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,640
Mmm...
No?

226
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:13,052
That's sort of a way
to put it, yeah.

227
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,445
No, I just am making
a little video portrait.

228
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:17,179
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.

229
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,981
- A... A film?
- Uh, yeah.

230
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,150
It's like the truth, kind of.
It's a...

231
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,585
And it's the truth about Marcel?

232
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:23,662
I mean, I hope so.

233
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,120
I guess he could really spin it,

234
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,655
and make me look like a total...

235
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:28,067
So, this is your garden
out here, huh?

236
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,259
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

237
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,161
Thank you.
Thank you for the aromas.

238
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,363
<i>My house was very popular.</i>

239
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:35,731
<i>I had lots of friends.</i>

240
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,600
<i>And if you told me then,</i>

241
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:39,302
<i>many years ago,</i>

242
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:42,438
<i>that I would've spent
so much time in a garden,</i>

243
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:44,106
<i>I would've said,
"Are you kidding?"</i>

244
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,542
Okay, you see these ones?

245
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,476
You can feel them.

246
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,544
They're not quite ripe,

247
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,979
but in a few days,
they would be.

248
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,480
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

249
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,517
<i>I didn't know anything
about farming.</i>

250
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,587
<i>Because when the couple
still lived here,</i>

251
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,456
<i>there was always food.</i>

252
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,591
<i>In the pantry, in the kitchen,</i>

253
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,660
<i>there were stacks
here and there.</i>

254
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,349
<i>But when they went away</i>

255
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:11,634
<i>the food disappeared.</i>

256
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:16,272
<i>So, I had to taught myself
how to farm.</i>

257
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,144
"Planting, harvesting..."

258
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,212
<i>She's always been
a pretty tough cookie.</i>

259
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,315
<i>Everything has a function
with her.</i>

260
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:28,786
<i>There's no one button
that's there for decoration.</i>

261
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:29,830
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

262
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,321
<i>She's just like a backhoe.</i>

263
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,759
<i>But I will say you can
really see her tender side</i>

264
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:38,293
<i>when she's working
with the bugs.</i>

265
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,096
<i>Is she okay?</i>

266
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,297
Yeah, she's okay,

267
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,198
she's a little loopy.

268
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,769
She had a little bit too much,
uh, nectar.

269
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,639
<i>Vino Fiore,</i> right, Franny?

270
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:51,808
<i>My community found the bugs</i>

271
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:55,177
<i>to be deeply unlikeable.</i>

272
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,279
Okay, we'll put her
here in the sun.

273
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:58,691
And in a few seconds,
she'll be dry.

274
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:01,116
<i>But Connie's
made friends with many of them,</i>

275
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,686
<i>and in return, they actually
help her with the gardening.</i>

276
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,063
...at first,
found them a little yucky

277
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,355
but now I see their beauty.

278
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,356
I cannot stand this thing.

279
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,359
Because they turn the soil,
they break it...

280
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,126
It's wonderful to have them.

281
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,328
His whole body looks
like his pants are off.

282
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:17,066
<i>It reminds me</i>

283
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,302
<i>of Whoopi Goldberg</i>
<i>in</i> Sister Act,

284
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,070
<i>how she helps them
to do graffiti</i>

285
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,438
in a meaningful way
or something, and...

286
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,640
Oh, there she goes.

287
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:27,586
- Oops!
- Ow, ow, ow.

288
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,511
She's gone.

289
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,548
Uh, sort of.

290
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:33,383
Oh, wow.

291
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,052
What is, uh...
What is this?

292
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:39,355
- Hmm?
- What's that?

293
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,724
What are you doing now
with Marcel?

294
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,625
Oh, I'm making a movie.

295
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,798
Uh...
A documentary.

296
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:49,432
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.

297
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,835
A documentary? Uh, a film?

298
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,469
Yeah.

299
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:54,871
Ah, Marcel.
You remember, Nan,

300
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:56,338
we were just talking about it.

301
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:57,407
It's a movie,

302
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,484
and we're doing it
together, but...

303
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:00,219
- what I just said before.
- That's what you...

304
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,245
And we just joked about it.

305
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:03,589
- Yes.
- It's the truth,

306
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:04,847
<i>but it's the truth about me...</i>

307
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:14,323
<i>She has lost a small piece...</i>

308
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,392
<i>...of a very large puzzle.</i>

309
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:19,227
Nan!

310
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:23,365
Nana!

311
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,400
<i>Once or twice a week,
I'll find her in here,</i>

312
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,403
<i>snoozing in
the laundry basket and...</i>

313
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,782
Is it bad for her to be in here?

314
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,874
Yeah, it's not
the safest place to be.

315
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,779
You know, my cousin
fell asleep in a pocket,

316
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:39,315
and that's why
I don't like the saying,

317
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:41,149
"Everything comes out
in the wash,"

318
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,820
because sometimes it doesn't.

319
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:43,953
Or sometimes it does,

320
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:46,422
and they're just like
a completely different person.

321
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,759
'Cause after that,

322
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,201
my cousin would
just sit by the window

323
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:52,161
and wait for fire trucks
to go by.

324
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,802
<i>Guess what I use
to tie my skis to my car.</i>

325
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:01,537
<i>What?
A hair.</i>

326
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,605
<i>Guess what my...</i>

327
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,538
MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON

328
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,375
<i>Guess...
Guess what my skis are.</i>

329
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:07,778
<i>What?
Toe nails from a man.</i>

330
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,345
Wait, hold on.

331
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,849
So, you're telling me that
84 different people have

332
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:12,950
just watched?

333
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:14,317
Yeah, isn't that cool?
Yeah.

334
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,686
I mean... Geez.

335
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,754
What?

336
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:20,556
Just... Wow.

337
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,934
<i>What do you
do when you get bored?</i>

338
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,493
<i>Uh, I move around.</i>

339
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,546
<i>I could tell he's
performing</i> a little bit for you,

340
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,572
- you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

341
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:38,975
Da, da, da, da.
You're giving him a stage.

342
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,586
It's good for him.

343
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,730
<i>One, two...</i>

344
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,932
The stage makes him feel good.

345
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:55,457
Playful. He needs that.

346
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,370
He hasn't been able to get that

347
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:09,205
since the others
were taken from us.

348
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,738
Okay, so do you just want me
to start at the beginning?

349
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,352
<i>I don't actually know
how it started,</i>

350
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:27,758
<i>but the man and the woman
started to yell at each other</i>

351
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,860
<i>more often than they would
talk to each other.</i>

352
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:37,365
<i>You'd just hear
these big noises from the sky,</i>

353
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,571
<i>and my cousin's house
fell down this one time</i>

354
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:43,907
<i>when the office door
got slammed.</i>

355
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:53,850
<i>We started
to have a shelter plan.</i>

356
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:55,952
<i>We all go to the sock drawer,</i>

357
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,056
<i>and so everyone
will be safe there.</i>

358
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,291
<i>This was a Sunday,</i>

359
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,558
<i>and everybody gets together,</i>

360
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:06,797
<i>and we all watch</i> 60 Minutes
<i>as a community.</i>

361
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,065
60 Minutes, <i>the...</i>

362
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,665
Yeah. So, this is
where we were...

363
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,420
<i>- And...
- Every week, all of you?</i>

364
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:14,537
Yeah. We love it.

365
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,582
We just call it "The show."
That's how much we love it.

366
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,673
Lesley.

367
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:19,509
Who's Lesley?
Lesley Show.

368
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,676
She likes Lesley Stahl.

369
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:22,612
<i>I'm Lesley Stahl...</i>

370
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:23,923
<i>She blows cases wide open,</i>

371
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,681
<i>and she's got class.</i>

372
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:26,784
<i>...tonight on</i> 60 Minutes.

373
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,317
<i>But...</i>

374
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,997
<i>We could tell
that something was the matter</i>

375
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,955
because the clock
started ticking...

376
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:35,835
<i>...and it was just
the two of us there.</i>

377
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,693
<i>It was a big one.</i>

378
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,030
<i>And we had...</i>

379
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,465
<i>We had no warning.</i>

380
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,971
<i>What we think is that</i>

381
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,007
<i>everybody scooted</i>

382
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,508
<i>into the sock drawer, and, uh...</i>

383
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,811
<i>And the man just...</i>

384
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,546
<i>...dumped all the drawers
into a suitcase.</i>

385
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,419
<i>And then he left.</i>

386
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:13,461
<i>And that's...
That's how they got moved.</i>

387
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:16,699
<i>I...</i>

388
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,000
<i>Oh...</i>

389
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,795
Do you want a tissue?

390
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:21,537
Yeah.

391
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:26,042
Do you mind if I just
plop into it real quick?

392
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,076
Sure.

393
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:35,818
Shoot.

394
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,385
This can be our last thing.

395
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,122
Okay.

396
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:43,861
<i>It's always what they say
on the days</i>

397
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:44,927
<i>when you have</i>

398
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,999
<i>a really keen sense
of being lost</i>

399
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,834
<i>or losing something,</i>

400
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,903
<i>that it...</i>

401
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,637
<i>It often feels like
the sun shines the brightest.</i>

402
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,440
<i>And then the next day,</i>

403
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,409
<i>there was a really sunny day
with a good breeze.</i>

404
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,012
<i>And I just remember thinking,</i>

405
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:04,882
<i>"if I was somebody else,</i>

406
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,782
<i>"I would really be
enjoying this."</i>

407
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:07,817
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

408
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:23,866
Whoa! Geez.

409
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,076
Okay, here it is.

410
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,028
So, tell me a little bit
about who you put on here.

411
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,686
I put, first and foremost,

412
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,023
my parents, Catherine and Mario,

413
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:48,590
next to each other with a heart.

414
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:53,163
My brother is here and here...

415
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:56,598
...and I put my music teacher,
The Maestro.

416
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,973
Wow!
Yeah!

417
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,651
I love that one,
it sounds like Taps.

418
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:06,910
Do you know that?

419
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,744
Yeah. Do you want
to hear Taps?

420
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,780
Sure.

421
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,025
<i>Do you feel angry?</i>

422
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:24,369
<i>Uh, I just feel angry</i>

423
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,028
<i>that we didn't have
a better goodbye.</i>

424
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,999
<i>Who would you say goodbye to?</i>

425
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,499
<i>I'd like to say goodbye</i>

426
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,667
<i>to my neighbors, the Costas.</i>

427
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,871
Goodbye, the Costas,

428
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:37,140
even though we had
a language barrier.

429
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:38,540
You were my neighbors.

430
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,911
You always liked to garden.

431
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:44,114
Goodbye, Richard, you were
the worst singer in our class,

432
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,615
but I loved how you let me
cut you in line.

433
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,584
Goodbye, Anka,

434
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:51,188
your sense of timing
is one of the worst.

435
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:54,090
Bye, Sandra,
you were my favorite author.

436
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:55,791
Goodbye, Mrs. Kim.

437
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,894
The time that you ate
a pepper flake

438
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,930
and it made you fly
into the wall

439
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:03,066
was one of the funniest
yet most serious accidents

440
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,800
any of us ever witnessed,

441
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,903
and you bore it
with great grace and bravery.

442
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,306
Goodbye, Brad.

443
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:10,307
Thank you so much

444
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:13,309
for rolling that marble
into my bread room.

445
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,244
<i>I still keep it to this day.</i>

446
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:24,221
Yep. And that...
And there they all are.

447
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:36,565
- Guess why I smile a lot.
- Why?

448
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,234
Uh, 'cause it's worth it.

449
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,028
Um...
Uh, whatcha doing?

450
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:08,030
Looking for apartments.

451
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:13,036
So, do you have
any plans tonight?

452
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,838
No.

453
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:23,212
I'm gonna...

454
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:25,681
- Give me that.
- No! No!

455
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:37,660
<i>Whoa.
Marcel, look at this.</i>

456
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,066
It... Aren't I...
Wait. Is this normal for you?

457
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,242
No, this never happens.

458
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,868
- It's so cool.
- 22 million?

459
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:47,336
It's wonderful.

460
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,638
Yeah, it's, uh, broad...
Broad spectrum of emotions.

461
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,976
I didn't even know
there were that many people.

462
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,052
Okay, now jump really hard.

463
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:56,246
<i>Have you guys seen
Marcel the Shell?</i>

464
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:57,279
<i>It's a YouTube video.</i>

465
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,048
<i>My name is Marcel,</i>

466
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,648
<i>and I'm partially a shell.</i>

467
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,060
<i>My name is Marcel,</i>

468
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:04,887
<i>and I'm a shell as you can see
on my body, but...</i>

469
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,690
Oh, so nice.

470
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:08,768
<i>...as a beanbag?</i>

471
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,094
<i>A raisin.</i>

472
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,663
<i>The wildly popular
online character,</i>

473
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,098
<i>Marcel the Shell
With Shoes On...</i>

474
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,166
<i>Marcel...</i>

475
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,135
Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.

476
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,904
"When the kush hit..."

477
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,840
"Kush"? What is kush?

478
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:29,179
I...
It goes so deep, and...

479
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:30,247
They got tattoos.

480
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,757
It's just so many people, I...

481
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,383
<i>I kind of regret this tattoo.</i>

482
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:35,251
<i>Here it is.</i>

483
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:38,188
<i>It's like a snail.</i>

484
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,323
<i>Um, I just saw it online,</i>

485
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:43,226
<i>but it was like super puffy
the day after,</i>

486
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,294
<i>and I don't know why,</i>

487
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,096
<i>and the tattoo guy
couldn't say why.</i>

488
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:47,864
<i>And then,
a couple of months later,</i>

489
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:49,031
<i>I found out that I...</i>

490
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:50,933
<i>Today, I'm going to be
popping popcorn</i>

491
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,744
<i>with a magnifying glass.
So right now we have...</i>

492
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:53,980
<i>There's all these people,</i>

493
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,906
<i>and... And we're all
looking at the same thing,</i>

494
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,041
<i>and we're all doing
the same thing.</i>

495
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:01,144
<i>We're watching the guys...</i>

496
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,445
<i>It's beautiful. And...
And it feels like...</i>

497
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,980
<i>I don't even know
how to describe it.</i>

498
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:07,116
<i>It feels like something.</i>

499
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:13,190
Move, move, move!

500
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,959
<i>It's really lovely.</i>

501
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:18,260
Are you okay?
Yes, yes. I'm okay. I'm okay.

502
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:20,239
So, are you going to eat it?

503
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:21,163
You can eat this stuff?

504
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,866
Yeah, dude!
What does it taste like?

505
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,220
Oh, my gosh,
you're gonna love it.

506
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,307
So good, isn't it?

507
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:33,876
<i>It's all been really fun,</i>

508
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,979
<i>and having
all this happen, and...</i>

509
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:38,048
<i>And, uh...</i>

510
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,951
<i>You know, it's so big feeling,
and it's so nice.</i>

511
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,986
<i>Um...</i>

512
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:50,227
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

513
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:54,006
<i>The other part of it
is I think I find</i>

514
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,300
<i>my mind wandering a bit
just thinking,</i>

515
00:24:58,335 --> 00:24:59,803
<i>what would my family think,</i>

516
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:02,939
<i>and really noticing</i>

517
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:04,613
<i>that they're not here
to share it with me.</i>

518
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:12,781
<i>I do wonder what...</i>

519
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,351
<i>What my dad would say,</i>

520
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:17,886
<i>what my mom would say,
and, yeah...</i>

521
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:21,090
<i>I think they'd like it a lot.</i>

522
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,904
Oh! There she goes.

523
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,848
Oh, beautiful.

524
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:47,916
Hmm.

525
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:50,452
There must be
so many others like me.

526
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,132
It's impossible
that there wouldn't be,

527
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:54,324
and not just my family.

528
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,193
They're out there.

529
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:00,028
Somewhere out there.

530
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:10,472
Every time I do this,
that dog goes totally crazy.

531
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:17,480
He sees something
truly elegant in the sky,

532
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:19,082
and this is his reaction?

533
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:26,221
What a sad type of idiot.

534
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,105
Wow, this is...

535
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:44,317
Well, yeah, I don't
think that's gonna yield much.

536
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,109
No. Right, but...

537
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,186
- Probably.
- You know...

538
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,211
What's the matter?

539
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,016
Do you think
they could be out there?

540
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,552
Uh, I mean...

541
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,422
Maybe.

542
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:07,339
All right, I think that's it.

543
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,932
We are live streaming.

544
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:09,834
And do I look at you,

545
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,567
or should I look
right into the thing?

546
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:13,336
Me.
Quick, uh, no, the camera.

547
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,446
It's gonna take a picture.

548
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,605
Okay, well...

549
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,211
<i>Hi, everybody.
It's Marcel from before,</i>

550
00:27:22,244 --> 00:27:24,381
<i>and I'm recording this video</i>

551
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:26,316
<i>because I'm looking
for my family.</i>

552
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,250
<i>They were last seen
with this man.</i>

553
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:29,219
<i>His name is Mark.</i>

554
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,287
<i>They disappeared from the house</i>

555
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,124
<i>owned by a woman named Larissa.</i>

556
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:35,157
<i>Here it is.</i>

557
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,496
<i>What we do is manage properties</i>

558
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:41,197
<i>that are on the short-term
rental market,</i>

559
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,999
<i>so if somebody's
out of town for a long time</i>

560
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,710
<i>and just wants to rent a place
for a while, we do that.</i>

561
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,435
So would you give me her number?

562
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:47,579
<i>If there's a problem
with the property,</i>

563
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:48,806
<i>I can send someone out,</i>

564
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:49,849
<i>but I can't give you
any personal information.</i>

565
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:53,209
Uh-huh. Hey, have you
ever eaten a raspberry?

566
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,612
Hello?

567
00:27:58,347 --> 00:27:59,682
Darn it.

568
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:02,317
<i>Just go for it.</i>

569
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:04,487
<i>This is what they
look like. Uh, right here,</i>

570
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,455
<i>and here and here.</i>

571
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:08,357
<i>Um, I made this
just to give you a sense</i>

572
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:10,192
<i>of who to be on the lookout for.</i>

573
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:16,196
Sorry. I think I need
a little help here.

574
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,603
Dean?
Hmm?

575
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,147
Oh, Dean, come on.
Because of what you're doing.

576
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,138
It's exciting.
It's a good scene.

577
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:24,073
You could...
You could still film it.

578
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:27,109
You can just put
the thingy on the thing.

579
00:28:27,143 --> 00:28:28,621
How would you do it
if I wasn't here?

580
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:30,145
There's a lot of times

581
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,449
where I just don't get stuff
that I need.

582
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:34,226
You are here. That's actually
what the truth of it is.

583
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,184
Yeah, but I don't
want to be in it.

584
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:37,018
That's, like, defeats
the whole point of this.

585
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:40,990
You know, Dean,
have you ever thought that...

586
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,761
your life might be
a bit less lonely

587
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:45,762
and a bit more integrated

588
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:48,064
if you took the time
to connect with somebody

589
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:49,699
and not just make videos
about them?

590
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:57,973
Thank you.

591
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,009
<i>And lastly, this picture here</i>

592
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:04,047
<i>shows the car
that Mark drove away in.</i>

593
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,282
<i>It is a teal Mishibibi.</i>

594
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:09,352
<i>- Mitsubishi.
- Mitsi-ibitsy.</i>

595
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:10,653
<i>- And...
- Mitsubishi.</i>

596
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:11,798
<i>What is it?
Mitsubishi.</i>

597
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,190
<i>Mitsubatbitsubisy.</i>

598
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:17,093
<i>Please leave any tips
or any helpful comments</i>

599
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,428
<i>in the section below.</i>

600
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,096
<i>Thank you. Have a great day.</i>

601
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:29,571
<i>Update, guys,
I think we found it.</i>

602
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:35,478
<i>It's Marcel's house.
It's Marcel Shell's house.</i>

603
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:37,231
<i>Do you think you can
get in there right now?</i>

604
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:44,596
<i>- Oh, someone' s coming.
- Go.</i>

605
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,422
<i>We got to go.
Follow for more</i>

606
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:48,391
<i>- celebrity homes.
- Just keep going.</i>

607
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,461
Huh.

608
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:55,531
Are they...

609
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:58,233
Are they here to help?

610
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:00,502
Mmm...

611
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:03,238
Uh...

612
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,746
Don't feel that
this is the task force

613
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:10,380
I was hoping for.

614
00:30:15,484 --> 00:30:17,319
There's so much nothing.

615
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,455
"She's the best."

616
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,592
"She"? What?

617
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,127
But my dad has pink shoes.
So did my grandfather.

618
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:28,498
So cute.

619
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,300
Ugh. Peace.

620
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,702
Uh, yeah. Obviously peace.

621
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,371
Like...

622
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:37,240
What a weird thing
to try to test

623
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:38,416
to see if someone else is into.

624
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:40,343
Like, of course I'm into peace.

625
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,545
No, sorry,
I'm a real war person.

626
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:45,248
No, war actually.

627
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,451
I sign all
my personal letters, "war."

628
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:51,086
"Let the battle begin.
Marcel."

629
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,656
Ugh!

630
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:57,760
You know, there's...

631
00:30:57,795 --> 00:31:00,730
There is nothing in here
about finding them.

632
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,702
It's still a group of people,

633
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:08,771
but it's an audience.
It's not...

634
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,640
It's not a community.
There's...

635
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:14,744
Man.

636
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:19,715
Oh! What about the car?

637
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,317
What do you mean?

638
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:23,886
Mark drove away in a teal car.

639
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:28,625
So we can go look for it.
Like, if we find the car...

640
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,803
Yeah,
I don't think that's like...

641
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:30,894
That's not the way to...

642
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:34,197
Wow! Okay, so it actually
doesn't even seem that big.

643
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,164
I mean, it's big
but what we just need to do

644
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,101
is get up high,

645
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,902
and then maybe
we'll be able to spot his car.

646
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:41,904
Mmm...
What's, like, your mantel?

647
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:44,374
Like, when I need to
look out over the whole rug,

648
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:46,342
I get up high.
I get up on the mantel.

649
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:49,488
Do you see what I'm saying?
'Cause I can see...

650
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:50,588
Yeah, no, I got it.
Yeah.

651
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,257
Great, so we'll just head up
to the top of this thing,

652
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,349
and then
we'll be able to see it.

653
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:55,461
I don't think
we'll necessarily be able

654
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:56,719
to see it.
I actually disagree.

655
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,491
I don't think
it's a good idea because

656
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,493
if we're... if we don't
have, like, a plan,

657
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,394
then we're just,
sort of, flying blind.

658
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:06,395
And we might just
waste a lot of time

659
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:07,705
going around in circles.
Just put that there...

660
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,532
What's that for? It's
just in case we get in a fight.

661
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,501
We're not
gonna get in any fights.

662
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:14,336
You said it was dangerous
out there.

663
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:16,248
It's dangerous in a different way,
so... And you know what else?

664
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,583
I should probably
bring this match.

665
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,241
You don't need that.

666
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,710
Uh, just give me
one more minute.

667
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,310
I need some sort of a helmet.

668
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:23,846
All right,
so you've got the book.

669
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:25,314
You've got
a little bit of a raisin,

670
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:26,458
which I really don't think
you're gonna finish,

671
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:27,826
but you can go to town.
Go to town.

672
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:28,894
Also, you have

673
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:29,952
two drips of...

674
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:31,220
Look over here.
What?

675
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,387
You have two drips of water.

676
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,892
You got an LED flashlight
in case the power goes out.

677
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:36,960
You just got to step on it
like this. See?

678
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:37,961
See how it... Whoa.
What?

679
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:39,505
Sorry. But don't stand
right in front of it.

680
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:41,631
Finally, this is the sparkler.

681
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,432
What you do is you light
this end on fire,

682
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:44,534
and then you step back.

683
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,501
This can act
as a flare, all right?

684
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:48,847
Why would I need it? That's
if you need to signal for help.

685
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:51,339
And Dean's gonna leave you
his phone just in case.

686
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,384
What? No, I'm not.
Who will see the flare?

687
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,410
You know what? Now that
I'm thinking about it,

688
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,284
why don't we just
put the colander over you now

689
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,346
if you want?

690
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,950
All right, how's that?

691
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:02,518
You must let me out of here.

692
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,832
Do you want
Alan in there with...

693
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:20,303
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

694
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:22,505
I'm so sorry.
It's not a big deal. It's tiny.

695
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,744
Whew.

696
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:29,679
I think I'm okay.

697
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,050
God, I am so sorry.

698
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:38,386
Oh, my God.

699
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,923
How many times a day
do you throw up in your car?

700
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:41,991
There's a car. That...

701
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:45,728
That's a teal, but, uh,
but that's more like, mmm...

702
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:48,698
I've never seen a lake
except for in a picture.

703
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,799
Let's do it.

704
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:55,637
Uh, I think I'm gonna cry.

705
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:56,773
It's very beautiful.

706
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:58,875
There's fountains in the lake.

707
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:05,749
And another car. And a car.
And a car. And a...

708
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:08,384
There's a lot of places
to get tattoos.

709
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:12,588
"Psychic love expert."
Wow, I bet... Wow.

710
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,766
I could use one of those.

711
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,458
What would you want her to say?

712
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,492
Uh, I don't know.

713
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:19,829
There's more fish in the sea.

714
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:21,563
Yeah.

715
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:22,597
Yeah.

716
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:26,411
Look, you got a lot of
smoocheroonies in your future.

717
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,570
- I can see it now.
- Yeah.

718
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:29,043
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:30,773
Ooh, baby, baby.

720
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:33,943
Ooh, baby.

721
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,713
I've seen people kiss
on television.

722
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,786
I'm so sorry.

723
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:46,588
Up here, yeah?

724
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,057
Oh! Is it?
Oh, this is it!

725
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,860
- This is it.
- Let's check it out.

726
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,596
Whoa, we're really going up.

727
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:55,597
Up, up, up.
This is gonna get high.

728
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,766
Mmm-hmm.

729
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Wow.

730
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,539
What are all the little dots
on the hills?

731
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:06,943
Those are houses.

732
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:08,376
All?

733
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:09,880
Yeah. Those are houses
like yours.

734
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:12,849
Really?

735
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,358
What's all that?

736
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:25,494
That's the rest of the city.

737
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:29,664
Oh, right.
Right, right.

738
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:43,847
I...

739
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,449
I had no idea.

740
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:56,893
Is this all there is
for out there?

741
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:59,028
Mmm-mmm.

742
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:03,632
This is like one part
of one big city.

743
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,534
And the...
But, uh...

744
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:07,170
But there are many big cities.

745
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:10,873
There's lots of them. I mean,
you've seen, like, you know,

746
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:14,110
in movies and when it says,
like, "Tokyo" and...

747
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:17,079
Uh-huh..."Antarctica,"
those are all different places.

748
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:21,150
Oh. Right.

749
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:43,472
There's so many places
that they could be.

750
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:48,778
Do you think it's impossible?

751
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:49,889
I don't think it's impossible.

752
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:51,480
I think that's just, uh...

753
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:55,918
Look at that lady's dress.

754
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:57,820
I know.
It's really nice.

755
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:07,264
Thanks for the ride.
Yeah. It was fun.

756
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:08,898
Oh. Look at this.

757
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,900
They're right on the...
They're on the lawn.

758
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,601
- They came right up.
- Stop it!

759
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,713
You wouldn't get it.

760
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:16,248
Hey, guys. Guys.

761
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:17,940
I wanna be first.

762
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,018
- Hey.
- Stop it!

763
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,576
No, no.

764
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,211
Um...

765
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,621
Would you mind
just moving a little bit

766
00:37:23,646 --> 00:37:25,514
so we can pull the car in?

767
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:32,121
Arthur.

768
00:37:32,155 --> 00:37:35,057
Nan! Nan!

769
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:38,594
Nan!

770
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,766
- Nan!
- Yes.

771
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,969
Oh, my God.
Nan, are you...

772
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,780
I'm just hurt a little bit...
- Oh, my God.

773
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:49,239
- ...but I'm okay.
- You are?

774
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,172
Please just...

775
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,751
Just lean your whole self on me.

776
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:54,911
Put all
your weight. Don't worry, I can take it.

777
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:56,612
And I guess... Okay.

778
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:58,782
Uh, let's just take it easy.

779
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:12,762
<i>I'm really not sure
exactly of what happened</i>

780
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:15,331
<i>because she won't tell me.</i>

781
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,067
It could just be
that she doesn't remember,

782
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,869
and I think
that's probably the case.

783
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,237
Do you want me to stop?

784
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,679
<i>But what I've been able
to piece together</i>

785
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:25,976
<i>is that she did get startled,
then she fell off the dryer.</i>

786
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,177
No! No! Arthur!

787
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,711
Sorry.
Arthur, come here.

788
00:38:29,746 --> 00:38:30,780
- Arthur!
- Dean...

789
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:32,081
Arthur! Come here.

790
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,851
He... He... He has got to go.

791
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:38,054
I cannot have him here
with Connie like this.

792
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,623
It's not that
I don't like Arthur.

793
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,759
Stop, Dean. I'm not kidding.

794
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:43,860
Stop that.

795
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:45,896
No! Oh, my God!

796
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,130
- No! No. Off!
- Arthur! Arthur!

797
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,800
All right.
A little bit more.

798
00:38:53,804 --> 00:38:54,804
Okay.

799
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:01,643
<i>What's he, uh...</i>

800
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,146
What's he being charged with?

801
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,083
What?

802
00:39:06,115 --> 00:39:07,326
Is he going to the jail?

803
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,885
No.

804
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,987
Oh. Oh, phew.
'Cause I'm sorry. I thought...

805
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm going to take him
to my wife's house.

806
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,092
Uh... You...

807
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:18,128
What?

808
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,338
Well, we got separated recently,

809
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:20,405
so that's why I'm staying here.

810
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,864
I've been looking
for a new place.

811
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:23,800
That's why I'm here.

812
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,034
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

813
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:28,414
Uh, I don't know.
I didn't think to.

814
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:30,373
Okay.

815
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:32,208
I told you so much. I...

816
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:34,277
So...
I'm making a movie about you.

817
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:36,378
I'm not making a movie about me.

818
00:39:36,413 --> 00:39:38,949
But you're also here.
And I was sharing.

819
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,715
You didn't also think to share?

820
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,163
And then you're just
pointing that around. No.

821
00:39:44,186 --> 00:39:45,922
I do think about it.

822
00:39:45,956 --> 00:39:47,891
It's not...

823
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:50,159
Why do you... Do you
always need to be filming?

824
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:51,626
No.

825
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:57,009
I think you'll be glad

826
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:59,101
I have it, though. We have it.

827
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:00,202
Uh-huh.

828
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:09,278
Hold on.

829
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,081
Can we pause
the videos that we made

830
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:12,648
so people can't see them,
please?

831
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:16,853
Yeah, I can take 'em down.

832
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,068
I just can't have more
people coming to the house

833
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,793
like... Like how
it happened today.

834
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,130
I can't believe
I let this happen.

835
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:44,914
<i>Well, you know,
she sleeps a lot.</i>

836
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:50,253
<i>And she hasn't been eating
very much.</i>

837
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,925
<i>It's looking good.
You just gotta keep on moving.</i>

838
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,068
<i>You're just one more little...</i>

839
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,427
Let me do...
I can do it.

840
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,797
<i>She's just not able to do</i>

841
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:05,101
<i>a lot of the things that
she used to be able to do.</i>

842
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:06,211
- Yeah, that's...
- Hurts.

843
00:41:06,235 --> 00:41:08,213
Sorry, did you shut the window?

844
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:10,206
Yes, I shut the window.

845
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,942
Don't help me here.
I don't need help.

846
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:14,210
Nana,
I'm not even doing anything.

847
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,387
Uh!

848
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,489
<i>The skater rink,</i>

849
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:29,326
<i>you know, is usually
just for the holidays.</i>

850
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:33,128
- Want to try...
- How am I looking?

851
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:35,998
You need, uh,
maybe once or twice more.

852
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,067
Okay.

853
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,934
<i>But I set it up just to...</i>

854
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:42,806
<i>...try to cheer her up a bit.</i>

855
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,010
Pump it. Pump it up.
Come on, Nan.

856
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:48,478
Up.

857
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:50,079
All right!

858
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,313
Nana, pump it up.

859
00:41:51,347 --> 00:41:53,349
No, no.
No, no, I don't think so.

860
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:55,818
Don't you wanna pump it up?
No, no.

861
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:59,054
When I say "jam,"
you say "Nan." Jam.

862
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>Well, she won't skate with me
anymore, that's for sure.</i>

863
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,027
<i>Get into it, a little bit.</i>

864
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,528
Stop it.

865
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:09,032
<i>But you know what?</i>

866
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:11,300
<i>She... She really
does like the dust.</i>

867
00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:15,038
<i>For her, it's special.
She's not from here.</i>

868
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,340
<i>She's from the garage.
That's why she has the accent.</i>

869
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,909
It's this wonderful smell.

870
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:22,579
<i>She traveled here by coat pocket</i>

871
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,581
<i>when she was really little.</i>

872
00:42:24,614 --> 00:42:26,815
I just feel...

873
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,085
<i>And so I think
it reminds her of home.</i>

874
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:33,556
Nan, look at this. Ready?

875
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,934
Oh!

876
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,471
Grandma Connie, we need to move!

877
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:49,838
Not that way. This way!

878
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:51,574
Get it out!
I'll get the rover!

879
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:56,012
Did I hit it?

880
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:57,322
Not coming over here?
Come follow my voice.

881
00:42:57,347 --> 00:42:59,882
- Your left or my left.
- Your left.

882
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:00,884
<i>At this point, the good days</i>

883
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:04,019
<i>are harder to come by with her.</i>

884
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,121
I mean, he's right here.
He's on the couch.

885
00:43:06,155 --> 00:43:07,590
Yeah, I'm looking right at him.

886
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:11,161
<i>And then the bad days
are just actually astounding.</i>

887
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,561
Oh! He can jump.

888
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:14,898
There he... There he goes!

889
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:17,266
Ah, all right, all right.
- Yay!

890
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,003
<i>I'm trying not to
treat her any differently,</i>

891
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:22,572
<i>but it's, uh, keeping me on
my toes, I'll tell you that.</i>

892
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:24,007
Wait, I'm gonna close this.

893
00:43:31,246 --> 00:43:32,648
Wow, look at this.

894
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:37,525
- You might be interested.
- Right?

895
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:39,389
Oh, my gosh.

896
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:41,523
I know.

897
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:44,159
With Lesley Stahl.

898
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:46,396
Oh, my gosh.

899
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,632
Ugh. This is a...

900
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,135
This is...

901
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:56,405
Oh, my God.

902
00:43:56,438 --> 00:43:58,559
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Mmm, yeah, yeah.

903
00:44:00,143 --> 00:44:01,143
It's really...

904
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:07,916
We can't show this
to Nana Connie.

905
00:44:09,452 --> 00:44:10,652
Absolutely not.

906
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:11,697
I mean, I could ask them to keep

907
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:13,199
the crew really small,
then they wouldn't make

908
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:15,592
a big footprint.
No. No, no, no.

909
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,329
Can I ask them
how many people would come in?

910
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:20,697
No.
What?

911
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,199
I'm not taking the risk.

912
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:24,543
- There are a lot...
- What is the risk?

913
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,103
The risk? Look what
already happened to Nana Connie.

914
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,641
"We're wondering
if you might be interested

915
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:34,510
"to discuss doing an interview
piece with Lesley Stahl."

916
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:36,545
We can't do it, Nan.

917
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:37,748
The real Lesley?

918
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:39,358
Yeah, it's the real Lesley.
- Don't do that.

919
00:44:39,382 --> 00:44:41,717
"Please let me know
if you're interested.

920
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:43,596
"We'd love to make it work."

921
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,989
This recovery
is not happening fast enough,

922
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,958
and now she has attitude,
and I feel bad.

923
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:50,693
We'll just do it
once she's feeling better

924
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:51,795
and moving around better.

925
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:54,264
How many of those
do you take? Don't take a lot.

926
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:56,532
I'm not taking,
'cause I don't know how...

927
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:57,744
when I'm gonna get another one.

928
00:44:57,768 --> 00:44:59,735
This is how I live.

929
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:04,407
We just had to work so hard
just to do this,

930
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,753
just to find
new ways of doing things

931
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:08,411
and learning
how to survive on our own.

932
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:09,579
And I guess it's...

933
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:16,286
I don't wanna end up
with less... than what I have.

934
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:17,764
I can't make
this decision for you, but...

935
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:19,130
No, you're not. I've already
made it for myself.

936
00:45:19,155 --> 00:45:21,795
...this is a really good way to find them.
- I said no.

937
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:54,423
He's no fun to be around, is he?

938
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:01,063
Do... Do you have
any corner pieces over there?

939
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,565
I want you to do it.

940
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,202
No. Nan, no. And we already...
We told them no.

941
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:10,706
But don't you want
to meet Lesley Stahl?

942
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,242
We need quiet, Nana.

943
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:15,778
We don't need a lot of people
coming in here and...

944
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:17,713
You don't...
You don't need quiet for me.

945
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:19,681
I don't want quiet.
Oh.

946
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,389
Nope.
I think you should do it.

947
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,400
You know, we're just
flying blind. I don't...

948
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:31,625
I don't even know what we're
supposed to be making here.

949
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,730
What is this even a picture of?

950
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:37,432
Do you have any blue pieces?

951
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:40,068
<i>He seems...
He's bound up, isn't he?</i>

952
00:46:41,637 --> 00:46:43,172
Mmm.

953
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:45,708
I think he's afraid of

954
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:48,177
change.

955
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:50,045
Scary.

956
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:54,250
Especially after
what we went through.

957
00:46:57,755 --> 00:47:00,523
But life's not
gonna go on unless...

958
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:03,458
if you don't.

959
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:05,628
If you don't open up, right?

960
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:09,231
Do you know that, Dean?

961
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,168
Heh, heh, heh.

962
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:15,380
<i>Who among us hasn't wished...</i>

963
00:47:16,472 --> 00:47:18,407
<i>...we could read
someone else's mind?</i>

964
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,643
<i>Know exactly
what they're thinking.</i>

965
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:22,846
<i>Well, that's impossible,
of course...</i>

966
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,112
<i>I want him to...</i>

967
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,550
<i>I want him to dive in life,
you know?</i>

968
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,485
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

969
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:33,121
<i>I'm not gonna
be here forever. Hmm.</i>

970
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:36,358
You know what I mean?

971
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,538
Uh, yeah, I think
he's just worried that...

972
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:40,597
Maybe he'll feel...

973
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,670
He'll sort of lighten up
when you're feeling better.

974
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:45,300
Better?
Yeah.

975
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:47,536
Feeling better.

976
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:52,442
Better. Better. Better. Hmm.

977
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:55,244
T-t-t-t-t-tch. Better.

978
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:01,416
Connie?

979
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:03,452
Nan?

980
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,190
Huh.

981
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:10,293
It's weird because I did think
I heard her up. Listen...

982
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:13,563
What the...

983
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:17,934
Nan.

984
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,445
Are you...
Look how fun this is. Look.

985
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,347
- You're just out here?
- Look, I had forgotten how fun...

986
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,514
Yeah, how long
have you been out here?

987
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:24,539
Look, I can...

988
00:48:24,574 --> 00:48:26,809
Oh! What is going on right...

989
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:27,878
Nan, you're really...

990
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,722
I have to work on my aim,
but look, look, look.

991
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:30,679
Yeah, I see that.

992
00:48:30,713 --> 00:48:32,916
I've been trying to get it.

993
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:41,666
I never understood the words,
but I could do it with...

994
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,869
DEAN: Yeah.

995
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:45,128
<i>I don't wanna
get ahead of myself,</i>

996
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:49,731
<i>but she seems to suddenly
have a lot more energy.</i>

997
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:51,233
Do you know what that is?

998
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:52,235
- It's the...
- They play that

999
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:52,969
- before the sports.
- Yeah, before sports.

1000
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:54,704
It means
the sports are starting.

1001
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:55,914
What kind of sports
do you watch?

1002
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:58,909
They like running after balls
or squash them.

1003
00:48:58,942 --> 00:48:59,943
Kicking.

1004
00:48:59,976 --> 00:49:02,846
Put them over, like, a net
sometimes, they do that.

1005
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,858
But the net is a hole, so
it comes right out.

1006
00:49:04,882 --> 00:49:06,893
Right, so it's just like,
why do you put it back in?

1007
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:08,393
- It's really strange.
<i>- I do notice,</i>

1008
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:11,755
<i>I think, that she's definitely
been eating better.</i>

1009
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:13,791
Mmm. My favorite.

1010
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:15,391
Nope, not for you.

1011
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:20,295
Bup. Nan, you really...

1012
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:21,798
Did you just eat
that whole thing?

1013
00:49:21,831 --> 00:49:24,434
Oh, yes, of course.
I love shish kebab.

1014
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:26,235
- Wow.
- No, we're still friends.

1015
00:49:26,268 --> 00:49:28,438
Why did you
divorce her? Was your wife...

1016
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:29,951
She's great.
We just grew apart.

1017
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:34,086
You okay?
I'm totally fine.

1018
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,155
Are you sure?
Maybe you should be resting or...

1019
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,313
Nan, maybe we'll think of...
Who decided to leave?

1020
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:40,751
- You or her?
- It was pretty mutual.

1021
00:49:40,784 --> 00:49:43,987
You don't fool me.
It's never mutual.

1022
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:48,391
And she's... she's got
some of her color back.

1023
00:49:48,423 --> 00:49:49,802
You're broken.
You're making

1024
00:49:49,827 --> 00:49:51,469
- this documentary to...
- Oh, my...

1025
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:52,670
So you don't
have to think of her?

1026
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,831
Is that why?
'Cause he's heartbroken.

1027
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,699
Are you heartbroken, Dean?

1028
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,635
He's laughing, so maybe
he's not so heartbroken.

1029
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:00,847
Look at her.
She's just completely

1030
00:50:00,871 --> 00:50:02,704
bounced back. It's like...
Completely.

1031
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:05,273
- 100%.
- Wow.

1032
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:07,543
I hope I get that...
those genes.

1033
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:13,692
Because... I
mean, that's not part of the deal.

1034
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,650
Do you want me to be happy?

1035
00:50:15,684 --> 00:50:17,519
- Yeah.
- Do the interview.

1036
00:50:18,588 --> 00:50:20,858
She got you there.

1037
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:22,925
All right. For you.

1038
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,027
I like you brave.

1039
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:26,394
Come on.

1040
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:27,898
Two...

1041
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:30,465
Uh, six...
Over to the left, yeah.

1042
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:34,369
Eight.

1043
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:37,740
And now just the green button.

1044
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:43,746
Boom, baby.

1045
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,315
You got this.

1046
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:49,485
<i>CBS.</i>

1047
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:51,789
Oh, uh... hello?

1048
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,932
Put it on speaker.
<i>Hello?</i>

1049
00:50:53,956 --> 00:50:55,291
Hello, is this...

1050
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:57,726
<i>Hello?</i>
Is this Shari?

1051
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,030
<i>Yes, it is! Is this...</i>
Hi, Shari, uh, this is Marcel.

1052
00:51:01,063 --> 00:51:02,565
This is Dean.
I'm also on the line.

1053
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,567
<i>Hi, nice to speak with you guys.</i>

1054
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,635
Nice to speak with you.
<i>Um...</i>

1055
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:08,436
<i>Sorry. Go ahead.</i>
Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
00:51:08,471 --> 00:51:09,472
I just said it was...

1057
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,974
That it's also nice
to speak with you as well.

1058
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:13,449
<i>It's nice to talk to you, too.</i>

1059
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:16,045
He was acting calm
and collected,

1060
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,748
and I knew he was, like,

1061
00:51:18,782 --> 00:51:22,052
the front, Mr. Serious Face,
Mr. Cucumber,

1062
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:24,420
but inside, butterflies.

1063
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:25,487
<i>Absolutely, yes.</i>

1064
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:27,990
<i>Talk about your family
and your search to find them.</i>

1065
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:29,936
<i>Sometimes we'll learn
something as we're shooting,</i>

1066
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,929
<i>and that can lead
to new discoveries.</i>

1067
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:33,728
Mmm-hmm.
And, uh, do you think it's...

1068
00:51:33,764 --> 00:51:36,132
It's a possibility
that something could,

1069
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,867
uh, come from...

1070
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,070
<i>Yeah, I mean,
there's no promises,</i>

1071
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:42,538
<i>but if you have information,
we'll see where...</i>

1072
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,141
<i>Where our reporting leads.</i>

1073
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,543
<i>Um, and, Dean, one other thing
I wanted to ask you is,</i>

1074
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,847
<i>you know, I think
it might be really interesting</i>

1075
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,949
<i>to interview you
as part of the story as well.</i>

1076
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,822
<i>Is that something
that you're comfortable with?</i>

1077
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:55,952
Uh, I don't know.

1078
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:57,686
I mean, I'm generally
behind the camera.

1079
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:59,822
Ah! Ah!

1080
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:02,860
Somebody doesn't
wanna do it. Oh!

1081
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:05,628
Uh, I'll get back to you
on it. How about that?

1082
00:52:28,451 --> 00:52:30,418
Hmm?

1083
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:32,088
This is a little doorbell.

1084
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:36,126
Good morning, Nan.

1085
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:40,998
Nan?

1086
00:52:42,498 --> 00:52:43,599
Huh.

1087
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:51,440
Just one second.

1088
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,612
Good morning, Nan.

1089
00:52:56,646 --> 00:52:58,614
- Today's the day.
- Yes.

1090
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:01,717
Oh, Nan.

1091
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:03,753
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I was just going to...

1092
00:53:03,786 --> 00:53:07,157
Are you sure that's... Does
it hurt still or... No, adjusted.

1093
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,458
Getting better already.
Look, look.

1094
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,594
All right.

1095
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:16,074
I'm gonna grab you some water.

1096
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,599
Oh, thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

1097
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:27,677
Got your water here.

1098
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,913
Ice-cold,
thirst-quenching water.

1099
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:33,983
Who wants it? A water, water,
who wants a water?

1100
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:35,251
Thank you, Marcello.

1101
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:37,153
You're welcome.

1102
00:53:37,186 --> 00:53:39,956
Quite a day for Lesley Stahl.

1103
00:53:43,193 --> 00:53:46,096
There's
definitely a storm rolling in.

1104
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,697
I can feel it.

1105
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:52,268
I can feel it because
my shell feels tight.

1106
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:01,643
Do I seem nervous?

1107
00:54:01,677 --> 00:54:02,956
- It's okay to be nervous.
- Ugh.

1108
00:54:03,947 --> 00:54:05,047
Let me get that.

1109
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:06,481
Yeah, I guess.

1110
00:54:10,753 --> 00:54:11,954
Uh...

1111
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,623
I...

1112
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:15,768
- Is that...
- What? What is it?

1113
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:18,728
That's the shish kebab
from the other night.

1114
00:54:18,762 --> 00:54:20,172
Where is she?
Do you know where she is?

1115
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:21,264
Nana.

1116
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,199
<i>You took away my vote.
You didn't ask me.</i>

1117
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:23,099
<i>I can't believe you lied.</i>

1118
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,001
- You lied to me, Nan.
- You took my...

1119
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:26,202
You wrote me off.
I did not write you off.

1120
00:54:26,235 --> 00:54:27,612
Did you ask me?
No, you didn't.

1121
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:28,670
So?
You just said no

1122
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:29,840
to <i>60 Minutes,</i> end of story.

1123
00:54:29,873 --> 00:54:32,208
I made a decision for your
health 'cause I was worried

1124
00:54:32,242 --> 00:54:33,175
about you.

1125
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:36,213
Should I get the door?

1126
00:54:36,246 --> 00:54:37,655
That's what I want.

1127
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,614
Well, I...
I want that too,

1128
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:40,751
- but this is...
- All I want...

1129
00:54:40,784 --> 00:54:42,085
- Nan.
- All I want

1130
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:43,987
is for you to try.

1131
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:45,121
- I want you...
- No...

1132
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:46,188
Nan...

1133
00:54:46,222 --> 00:54:47,090
It's a big wide world.

1134
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:48,134
I don't wanna lose everything

1135
00:54:48,157 --> 00:54:50,726
in the hope of something.
That's already gone.

1136
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,038
You break my heart if you don't.

1137
00:54:52,061 --> 00:54:53,661
Hello?

1138
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,740
You can tell 'em
we need to cancel

1139
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:55,831
if you want to do that.

1140
00:54:55,865 --> 00:54:56,943
Well, what's the option?

1141
00:54:56,967 --> 00:54:58,268
- Dean?
- Mmm-hmm?

1142
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,036
Please, can you shut up?

1143
00:55:03,273 --> 00:55:05,673
Marcello...
Yes?

1144
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,811
Let's forget about being afraid.

1145
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:12,282
Uh...
Is Lesley afraid?

1146
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:16,786
Mmm, no, Lesley is fearless.

1147
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,889
It may be good, it may be not,

1148
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:22,025
but just take the adventure.

1149
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:27,264
Don't use me as an excuse
not to live. Hmm?

1150
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:35,938
But what if...

1151
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:38,706
What if everything changes...

1152
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:41,110
again?

1153
00:55:43,012 --> 00:55:45,748
Marcello, oh...

1154
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:46,817
Yeah.

1155
00:55:49,385 --> 00:55:50,753
It will.

1156
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:55,958
Aw.

1157
00:55:56,992 --> 00:55:58,061
Come here.

1158
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,106
Okay, well...
let's do it.

1159
00:56:10,373 --> 00:56:12,041
Come on, go, go.

1160
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:14,177
Yeah.

1161
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,818
Hello. Come in!

1162
00:56:21,851 --> 00:56:23,085
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

1163
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,297
It's good to finally meet you.

1164
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,831
You're Shari, I presume?
You have a camera.

1165
00:56:25,856 --> 00:56:27,266
Oh, I do have a camera.
Okay, then.

1166
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:28,800
Is that okay?
Can I film while you guys

1167
00:56:28,824 --> 00:56:30,001
- are setting up?
- Sure, sure.

1168
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:30,927
- Yeah? That's great.
- Whoa.

1169
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,364
Those gentlemen were not
wearing bee-odorant.

1170
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:44,007
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

1171
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:45,407
- Did you see that?
- I did.

1172
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:47,043
Just those boxes walking.

1173
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:48,844
And then behind them,
there were men.

1174
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:50,813
Look at ponytail over here

1175
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:52,090
looking around for the bathroom.

1176
00:56:52,114 --> 00:56:53,884
Trying to act like
it's not an emergency.

1177
00:56:55,818 --> 00:56:58,954
It's over there!

1178
00:56:58,989 --> 00:56:59,998
What are you...
What are you doing to him?

1179
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:01,934
Now,
I'm just sort of giving Marcel

1180
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:04,161
a little bit of bronzer
just to kind of warm up.

1181
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:05,237
That tickles.

1182
00:57:05,262 --> 00:57:07,429
I'm just gonna
do a little bit here.

1183
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:08,797
Oh.

1184
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:10,976
Sorry, I spit on you. Close...
That's okay. Close your mouth.

1185
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:12,311
Hey, now look, now he's on TV.

1186
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:14,003
Okay, but now
he's back in real life.

1187
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:16,472
This guy over here, look.
Real life, on TV.

1188
00:57:16,505 --> 00:57:17,740
Oh, look at that one.

1189
00:57:17,773 --> 00:57:18,942
That's Toolbelt.

1190
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:20,309
And that one?

1191
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:21,454
That's just
Mr. Headphones.

1192
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:23,346
Do you wanna
see what you look like?

1193
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,713
Oh, my God.
Don't you look rested?

1194
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:27,628
Yeah, I look like I, like,
only drink olive oil.

1195
00:57:28,818 --> 00:57:30,028
This guy over here, look.

1196
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:31,987
Real life, on TV.
Marcello, look.

1197
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:33,065
Good.
How was your flight?

1198
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,128
It was okay.

1199
00:57:34,157 --> 00:57:35,925
Yeah?
You know, long.

1200
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,760
All right,
well, we have a fun day...

1201
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:39,862
Nana, make the noise.

1202
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:42,831
Tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-
tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik...

1203
00:57:42,865 --> 00:57:43,967
All these stories and more

1204
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,871
on <i>60 Minutes.</i>
<i>60 Minutes.</i> Tik-tik, tik-tik.

1205
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:49,815
Marcel, can I get you
to stand in real quick?

1206
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,375
Oh, yes. Uh, Nan,
uh, are you gonna be...

1207
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:54,744
Go, go. Yes, of
course. Go. Okay.

1208
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:55,710
Go.
Coming through.

1209
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:56,545
I'll bring him right back.

1210
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,181
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

1211
00:57:58,215 --> 00:57:59,315
Goodbye.

1212
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:02,717
On real life,

1213
00:58:07,923 --> 00:58:08,925
on TV.

1214
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,329
Wow, I think, uh... Yeah.

1215
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:14,797
I think that's the brightest
thing I've ever seen.

1216
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:47,364
I...
I know that you like

1217
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:49,965
these kind of things
for your movie.

1218
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,235
- It might... might be good.
- Mmm.

1219
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:56,139
I found this the other day.

1220
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:58,942
Mmm... Here it is.

1221
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:01,911
It's about season changing.

1222
00:59:01,945 --> 00:59:04,547
This book... This book
I had for many, many years.

1223
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:08,318
But I had not noticed

1224
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:11,820
this... This part that
I would like to read you.

1225
00:59:11,855 --> 00:59:13,356
Please.

1226
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:18,260
"The trees are coming into leaf

1227
00:59:18,295 --> 00:59:22,565
"Like something
almost being said..."

1228
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:24,043
All right, guys,
five to four minutes.

1229
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,268
Four minutes, everybody.

1230
00:59:28,405 --> 00:59:32,541
<i>"The recent buds
relax and spread,</i>

1231
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:38,414
"Their greenness
is a kind of grief."

1232
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:40,949
Let's reset.
Let's go to one, please.

1233
00:59:40,983 --> 00:59:43,920
<i>"Is it that they are born again</i>

1234
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:47,891
<i>"And we grow old?
No, they die too..."</i>

1235
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:53,228
Oh, hello. Hello.
You are beautiful.

1236
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,204
<i>"Their yearly trick
of looking new</i>

1237
01:00:02,237 --> 01:00:05,442
<i>"Is written down
in rings of grain."</i>

1238
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:09,144
- Sound, please.
- Quiet on the set.

1239
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:11,414
And mark.
Camera B marker.

1240
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,550
<i>And we're rolling.
Rolling.</i>

1241
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,219
<i>When you're ready.</i>

1242
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:22,192
"Yet still

<i>"In full grown thickness

1244
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:29,032
Not ready, no, I'll stay.

1245
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,869
Well, if you insist.

1246
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,273
<i>"Last year is dead,
they seem to say..."</i>

1247
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:40,076
Slow down, come on.

1248
01:00:41,077 --> 01:00:42,579
<i>"Begin afresh..."</i>

1249
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,681
Wait for me.
Wait for me.

1250
01:00:44,713 --> 01:00:47,282
<i>"...afresh, afresh."</i>

1251
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:57,460
- Shari, done?
- Yep.

1252
01:00:57,494 --> 01:00:58,427
We're done.

1253
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,030
All right, everybody.
That's a wrap on Marcel!

1254
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:17,956
I think they had
to get to the outlet,

1255
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:19,125
but we can get them
to move it back.

1256
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:20,115
Yeah, but if something
moved and nobody noticed

1257
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,085
Nana Connie, she could be
behind something.

1258
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:23,920
Nan?

1259
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:26,664
I just... Sometimes she goes
to the toilet

1260
01:01:26,688 --> 01:01:28,023
and sits on the rim.

1261
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,525
Nan?

1262
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,197
- You checked her room, yeah?
- No.

1263
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,474
<i>Yeah, do you want... I mean,
should we go over...</i>

1264
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:37,000
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

1265
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:48,644
Next...

1266
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:53,516
Hmm.

1267
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:06,061
I'm glad I got to meet her.

1268
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:07,262
Me, too.

1269
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:17,539
She probably felt tired.

1270
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:22,311
Especially after
being very excited.

1271
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:28,418
Have you ever done that before,

1272
01:02:28,451 --> 01:02:31,420
like, when there's a party
in your house?

1273
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,557
Sometimes it's easiest to rest

1274
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,126
when you go off by yourself

1275
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:41,164
and you can still hear
the noise of the party,

1276
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:44,467
and you feel safe knowing that
so many people are around...

1277
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:46,302
Yeah.
...that you can have a rest?

1278
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:47,771
Mmm-hmm.

1279
01:02:54,577 --> 01:02:56,646
That's good. And now this one.

1280
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:12,394
<i>She was exactly what you would
want a grandmother to be.</i>

1281
01:03:12,427 --> 01:03:15,766
<i>She had a...
A vibrant past,</i>

1282
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:18,333
and a colorful personality,

1283
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:21,838
and she didn't get sanded down
by life.

1284
01:03:44,827 --> 01:03:46,094
Hello!

1285
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,298
- Hi.
- Hi.

1286
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:51,802
Why're you in the tree?

1287
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:55,873
- Sorry?
- That's my tree.

1288
01:03:55,905 --> 01:03:57,574
- This is yours?
- Yeah.

1289
01:03:57,606 --> 01:03:59,606
Oh, I'm sorry. It looked
like it was on hers.

1290
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,710
Nope.

1291
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:05,824
Well, do you mind if
I stay up here for a minute?

1292
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,751
- I'm just... It's a short...
- I do mind.

1293
01:04:07,784 --> 01:04:08,818
I don't have insurance

1294
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:10,420
for whatever you're doing
up there.

1295
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:14,456
Okay, coming down.
Sorry.

1296
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,259
- Okay.
- You fall,

1297
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:18,728
something happens, I'm liable.

1298
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:20,262
What is it
that you're actually...

1299
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:22,398
Is it... Not with a studio

1300
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:23,599
- or, uh...
- No.

1301
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:34,510
Whoa, all right.

1302
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:38,481
Okay, and I made her
look like an everything bagel.

1303
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:39,514
Perfect.

1304
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:45,288
Ow, darn it.

1305
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:55,932
It doesn't seem to...

1306
01:04:55,965 --> 01:04:57,166
No, no.

1307
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,735
No.

1308
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,940
Nope.

1309
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:04,775
I don't know what you want.

1310
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:07,543
I can't help you.
I don't know what it is,

1311
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:11,882
and she's not here,
so you gotta...

1312
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:15,284
...go.

1313
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:52,588
Hey.

1314
01:06:02,965 --> 01:06:05,568
- How you doing?
- Mmm, good morning.

1315
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:12,340
Can you teach me a song?

1316
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,476
I...
All I... I don't know...

1317
01:06:19,817 --> 01:06:20,983
Will you do it?

1318
01:06:22,452 --> 01:06:24,286
Do you wanna do the mmm-mmms?

1319
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
Sure.

1320
01:06:31,494 --> 01:06:33,931
Well, you're really not
singing the note at all.

1321
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:39,668
You can't sing any notes.
No, I can't. But how do I do it?

1322
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:42,005
Well, I can't teach you
how to sing.

1323
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,505
You do it,
and then I'll copy you.

1324
01:06:46,476 --> 01:06:48,677
No.

1325
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,847
Okay, you...

1326
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:56,284
No.

1327
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:00,356
I really don't know
what to do with you.

1328
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:01,724
I gotta say...

1329
01:07:10,532 --> 01:07:12,400
No, none of those
are the right notes.

1330
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:15,505
Do you like sitting halfway
on a chair?

1331
01:07:16,438 --> 01:07:18,608
Uh, yeah,
go home and think about it.

1332
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:23,545
This is unbelievable.

1333
01:07:25,014 --> 01:07:26,949
What can I do to practice?

1334
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:30,286
She just kept everything.

1335
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:38,661
So, are...

1336
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,965
So where you...
You gonna go now?

1337
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,802
What?

1338
01:07:44,835 --> 01:07:47,036
Aren't you leaving?
No.

1339
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,704
No? Oh.
No, why would I do that?

1340
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:51,617
Well, I guess
'cause of the suitcase and...

1341
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,010
Oh, no.
I'm just looking for my tie.

1342
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:55,443
Oh. Oh.

1343
01:07:56,813 --> 01:07:58,648
Where am I gonna go?

1344
01:07:58,681 --> 01:07:59,750
I don't know.

1345
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,853
You're it, baby.

1346
01:08:04,054 --> 01:08:05,889
Oh, okay.

1347
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,559
<i>Hey, Dean. Hey, Marcel.</i>

1348
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:12,561
<i>This is Shari from</i> 60 Minutes.

1349
01:08:12,594 --> 01:08:15,765
<i>Um, I wanted to let you know
that the interview went great.</i>

1350
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:17,042
<i>We've been looking
at the footage</i>

1351
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:20,536
<i>and I'm wondering
if you would be willing to do</i>

1352
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:22,738
<i>another day of shooting with us.</i>

1353
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:24,640
<i>So, um,
we've made some discoveries</i>

1354
01:08:24,673 --> 01:08:27,043
<i>that I'd love to share with you.</i>

1355
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:30,747
<i>It's kinda all happening fast,
so if you could get back to me</i>

1356
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,024
<i>as soon as you get this message,</i>

1357
01:08:32,048 --> 01:08:33,884
<i>I would really appreciate it.</i>

1358
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,886
<i>Um, hope to talk
to you soon. Bye.</i>

1359
01:08:52,135 --> 01:08:55,104
<i>Good things
come in small packages...</i>

1360
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:59,475
<i>...an old idea, but one you'll
see tonight in a new light.</i>

1361
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,110
<i>In the only interview he's given</i>

1362
01:09:01,144 --> 01:09:03,747
since becoming
an Internet phenom,

1363
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,050
Marcel the Shell
shares his unique perspective

1364
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:09,585
on what we take for granted.

1365
01:09:09,618 --> 01:09:12,756
He adds new meanings
to the simplest of ideas.

1366
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:16,591
Marcel, a 1 inch-tall shell,

1367
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:19,829
reminds us of
the true value of community,

1368
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:22,664
the transformative power
of friendship,

1369
01:09:22,698 --> 01:09:27,136
and the most ingenious use
for a tennis ball.

1370
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,939
<i>But if you wanna make sure</i>

1371
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:32,440
<i>that your parking space is,
like, perfectly flat,</i>

1372
01:09:32,475 --> 01:09:35,945
because otherwise, it's not
gonna be where you left it.

1373
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:37,289
And... And I don't have
the model...

1374
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:39,582
<i>For years, Marcel
and his grandmother Connie</i>

1375
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:42,920
<i>shared this old house
with their pet lint, Alan,</i>

1376
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:45,654
<i>and an ever-changing array
of human guests.</i>

1377
01:09:45,688 --> 01:09:47,523
I just stay
out of their way and...

1378
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:49,591
And stay out of sight,
and it worked.

1379
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,927
<i>But all that changed</i>

1380
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:53,462
<i>when an amateur filmmaker
moved in.</i>

1381
01:09:53,496 --> 01:09:55,007
...so kind of on all the time.
And so, I felt like

1382
01:09:55,032 --> 01:09:56,899
I could just roll
and roll and roll.

1383
01:09:56,934 --> 01:09:59,568
Um, Dean, what were
your first impressions?

1384
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:02,805
Uh, I guess
I was impressed with his, um,

1385
01:10:03,605 --> 01:10:04,673
pizzazz...

1386
01:10:04,707 --> 01:10:06,509
- ...his spark, you know?
- Wow.

1387
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:08,011
Uh, pfft.

1388
01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:09,712
No, I... I like it.

1389
01:10:09,746 --> 01:10:11,047
And maybe you needed...

1390
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,216
Needed the connection,
needed the friendship.

1391
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,018
Yeah, maybe you needed
the friendship.

1392
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:20,122
Marcel, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?

1393
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:23,591
Well, I don't do the clock

1394
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:25,728
the way that you guys
do the clock.

1395
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:28,265
Right.
Uh, but I think

1396
01:10:28,297 --> 01:10:31,068
I'm watching the changes
in the trees and

1397
01:10:32,202 --> 01:10:33,735
the flowers that have bloomed

1398
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,706
and the blossoms
that have fallen.

1399
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:39,743
The buds that have come
and bloomed again.

1400
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:42,779
So I... I couldn't tell you,
but I, uh...

1401
01:10:42,813 --> 01:10:46,582
The space in my heart gets
bigger and louder every day.

1402
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,684
Mmm. Dean,
do you know how long?

1403
01:10:48,717 --> 01:10:49,752
It was two years.

1404
01:10:49,786 --> 01:10:50,820
- Two years.
- Yeah.

1405
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:52,389
Oh, that's nice to know.

1406
01:10:52,421 --> 01:10:55,292
<i>Given all the new
information Marcel shared with us...</i>

1407
01:10:55,324 --> 01:10:58,661
...and he had just, like
the same kind of man face,

1408
01:10:58,694 --> 01:11:00,096
like two eyes,
that kind of thing.

1409
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,465
A mouth and all the teeth.

1410
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:05,568
<i>...we were able
to track down Larissa Geller.</i>

1411
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,738
<i>We found her here
in the highlands of Guatemala</i>

1412
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:11,673
<i>working for
an environmental NGO.</i>

1413
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:17,881
<i>Geller then returned home</i>

1414
01:11:17,913 --> 01:11:20,582
<i>and helped us locate this man,</i>

1415
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:23,119
<i>her former boyfriend,
Mark Booth.</i>

1416
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:25,596
<i>I don't even wanna do this. You're
really putting me in a tough spot here...</i>

1417
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,966
All right, I'll see you soon.
<i>...come on.</i>

1418
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:28,556
Okay, bye.
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1419
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:29,893
<i>Wait, are you still...</i>

1420
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,930
<i>After some
brief introductions...</i>

1421
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:34,864
<i>- This is Mark.
- Hey, sorry.</i>

1422
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:36,664
It's kind of messy.
I'm just sort of...

1423
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:38,211
- So I was cleaning earlier.
- Right.

1424
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:39,543
<i>...the search efforts began.</i>

1425
01:11:39,568 --> 01:11:41,737
<i>I mean, I don't know.
This is...</i>

1426
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:42,948
I don't even know
where else to look.

1427
01:11:42,972 --> 01:11:45,608
I honestly don't know what
to do. I don't know the area.

1428
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,609
This is definitely the bag.

1429
01:11:47,643 --> 01:11:48,811
So that... That is good news.

1430
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:51,314
I'm not gonna get... I'm not
gonna start to feel down...

1431
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:54,682
<i>And then
Marcel heard a familiar sound.</i>

1432
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:55,895
Yeah, and then
you just came over...

1433
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:58,220
<i>What our crew heard
was an argument.</i>

1434
01:11:58,255 --> 01:11:59,823
You were on all of the emails...

1435
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:01,358
<i>But what Marcel heard...</i>

1436
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,025
<i>...was the sounding
of an alarm.</i>

1437
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,895
I'm a child?
Yes.

1438
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:07,163
Oh, dur, the sock drawer.
Did we check the sock drawer?

1439
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,032
<i>An alarm he knew would send</i>

1440
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:11,234
<i>any shells into a shelter plan.</i>

1441
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:14,070
Geez, it's over here!

1442
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:17,039
Hey, guys! Over here!
Over here, I need a boost.

1443
01:12:17,073 --> 01:12:19,275
Hey, I need to get to the top.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1444
01:12:19,309 --> 01:12:20,777
Open the top drawers, somebody.

1445
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:24,056
<i>Be careful.
Be very, very careful.</i>

1446
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:25,347
<i>Open, open. Careful.</i>

1447
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:28,752
<i>What followed
was something we rarely see.</i>

1448
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,993
<i>A family reuniting.</i>

1449
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,447
<i>Marcel was always a performer.</i>

1450
01:14:05,814 --> 01:14:07,951
He always wanted to, um...

1451
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:09,185
CATHERINE & MARIO parents

1452
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,430
Always wanted to be on stage,
make people happy and smile.

1453
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:14,423
Mmm.
And as his mother...

1454
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,295
Sorry.

1455
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,728
Oh, Mom.

1456
01:14:19,762 --> 01:14:20,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

1457
01:14:20,963 --> 01:14:23,275
Yeah, I told you, you're gonna
get right into the real stuff.

1458
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:24,333
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1459
01:14:24,367 --> 01:14:25,734
Uh, well, we can do this thing,

1460
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:26,802
pick it up later or...

1461
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:27,979
Let's talk about something else.

1462
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:30,306
Talk to Mario for a minute.

1463
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,809
It's really hard.
Do you see?

1464
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,311
Mario.

1465
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:38,858
Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry.

1466
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:40,282
I was thinking
about something else.

1467
01:14:44,253 --> 01:14:45,956
And that's us in a nutshell.

1468
01:14:45,988 --> 01:14:48,425
Yeah, I just...
I just was being...

1469
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:01,203
<i>Most of the innovations</i>

1470
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:03,506
Nan and I came up with,
you know,

1471
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:05,307
they're just
not necessary anymore.

1472
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:08,444
Ho!
One, two, three, ho!

1473
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:10,447
All right, blue!

1474
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,216
<i>Then again, some of
them have really taken off.</i>

1475
01:15:43,947 --> 01:15:46,882
Okay. Thank you very much.

1476
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:05,868
Look at you.

1477
01:16:05,902 --> 01:16:07,337
I missed your little face,
Marcel.

1478
01:16:07,369 --> 01:16:09,614
I missed you so much.
I just want to squeeze you.

1479
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:11,408
Um, I'm just moving on.

1480
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,886
More so, I cried from the beauty.

1481
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:17,980
Aw, Mr. Costas,
you're making me blush.

1482
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:22,161
Okay, but just put your weight
on the front foot...

1483
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:23,552
JUSTIN brother

1484
01:16:23,586 --> 01:16:24,630
...and then you unstick the back one.
- Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

1485
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:26,631
I know. Right,
but you have to keep doing it.

1486
01:16:26,655 --> 01:16:27,757
I'm fine.

1487
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,502
Well, all right, but
do you see what's happening?

1488
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:31,060
- I know.
- Okay.

1489
01:16:31,094 --> 01:16:34,363
She is really good, especially
for such a little one.

1490
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:35,597
But you know what it is?

1491
01:16:35,631 --> 01:16:37,243
She has that thing that's like
when you're young,

1492
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:40,103
you have no fear 'cause you
haven't injured yourself yet,

1493
01:16:40,136 --> 01:16:41,479
and you don't even know
what risk is.

1494
01:16:41,503 --> 01:16:43,206
You just zoom around
all the time.

1495
01:16:43,238 --> 01:16:44,974
Marcel, I'm being patient.

1496
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:46,609
Okay.
Marcel, come on.

1497
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:47,720
If you're trying
to be patient...

1498
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:50,046
Come out here with me,
and shake that little tush.

1499
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:51,113
Come on.
I will.

1500
01:16:51,146 --> 01:16:53,158
I really promise I will take
a turn around the rink.

1501
01:16:53,182 --> 01:16:54,426
I'm just kind of observing.
Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean.

1502
01:16:54,451 --> 01:16:55,484
Yeah?
Please.

1503
01:16:55,518 --> 01:16:57,453
This is the stock
that I come from.

1504
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,963
Dean.
You can see a direct line

1505
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:00,365
to Nana Connie with this one.

1506
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:01,224
Could you tell
your friend Marcel

1507
01:17:01,256 --> 01:17:02,891
I'm not gonna wait forever,
please?

1508
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:04,560
Wow.

1509
01:17:04,594 --> 01:17:06,171
It's nice to see you
back with everyone.

1510
01:17:06,195 --> 01:17:08,264
Yeah.

1511
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:10,632
You know, you're welcome
back here any time you want.

1512
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,506
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

1513
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:18,908
You're welcome to
my house any time you want.

1514
01:17:18,942 --> 01:17:20,243
You don't have a house.

1515
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:21,511
I will soon.

1516
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:22,412
- I signed a lease.
- Pay attention.

1517
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:24,079
Each of you...
Oh. Well, then, I accept.

1518
01:17:24,113 --> 01:17:25,554
One, two, three.

1519
01:17:27,516 --> 01:17:30,453
Come on,
Marcel. Come on. Let's go.

1520
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,154
We're going ice skating.

1521
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:33,021
We're going
on the ice skating rink.

1522
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,500
Yeah, I saw you skating before.

1523
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:39,261
<i>It is different now after
living alone for so long.</i>

1524
01:17:39,295 --> 01:17:42,297
<i>I find that sometimes
being in a big group is...</i>

1525
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:44,701
This is what I wanna
be doing. I want to slide down.

1526
01:17:44,734 --> 01:17:46,345
Good. I didn't know
that that's what you were

1527
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:48,368
trying to do. I thought
you were asking me how I...

1528
01:17:48,971 --> 01:17:51,573
<i>...can be
overwhelming to me.</i>

1529
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:57,146
You guys, there's...
I need to learn.

1530
01:17:59,248 --> 01:18:01,984
<i>I needed somewhere
that I could come and just...</i>

1531
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:15,164
<i>I found myself coming down
here more and more.</i>

1532
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,203
<i>Such a lovely smell
from the dryer sheets.</i>

1533
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:24,140
<i>And I... I like it because</i>

1534
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,208
<i>there's a window</i>

1535
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:28,411
<i>that is always opened
a little crack there.</i>

1536
01:18:31,346 --> 01:18:33,182
<i>I would stand there,</i>

1537
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:36,252
<i>and sometimes I'd tell her
things, ask for advice,</i>

1538
01:18:36,286 --> 01:18:39,189
<i>or just let sounds
come out of my mouth.</i>

1539
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:42,225
<i>And one day, I was just sitting,</i>

1540
01:18:43,225 --> 01:18:44,594
<i>and the wind blew in,</i>

1541
01:18:44,627 --> 01:18:49,666
<i>and it blew just over the top
of my head in such a way.</i>

1542
01:18:51,033 --> 01:18:52,135
<i>And the wind blew over,</i>

1543
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,503
<i>and it made
a beautiful whistling sound.</i>

1544
01:18:56,472 --> 01:18:57,582
What kind of noise is it?

1545
01:18:57,606 --> 01:18:59,274
Wait, shh, shh. Listen.

1546
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:02,377
Can you hear it?

1547
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:08,717
That's it.
That's going through my shell.

1548
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:16,326
<i>It felt just like her
to lead me to a place</i>

1549
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:19,429
<i>where I would experience
something new and special.</i>

1550
01:19:24,466 --> 01:19:27,703
<i>It connected me
how I felt like to everything,</i>

1551
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:33,176
<i>because if I wasn't there,
the sound never would exist.</i>

1552
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:37,479
<i>And I felt like
everything was in pieces,</i>

1553
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:38,680
<i>and then I stood there,</i>

1554
01:19:38,715 --> 01:19:41,384
<i>and suddenly,
we were one large instrument.</i>

1555
01:19:44,453 --> 01:19:46,588
<i>I like to go there a lot</i>

1556
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:48,423
<i>because it reminds me</i>

1557
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:52,662
<i>that I'm not
just one separate piece</i>

1558
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:55,497
<i>rattling around in this place,</i>

1559
01:19:55,532 --> 01:19:59,335
<i>but that I'm part of a whole.</i>

1560
01:19:59,368 --> 01:20:03,372
<i>And I truly enjoy
the sound of myself</i>

1561
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:05,041
<i>connected to everything.</i>

1562
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:38,617
I'm gonna let him out.
Are you ready?

1563
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,643
All right.
Release the hounds!

1564
01:20:40,676 --> 01:20:41,811
Come on, do it.

1565
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:43,378
I'm actually really excited
to see him.

1566
01:20:43,412 --> 01:20:44,689
Here it comes.

1567
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:47,583
Hi, bud! Oh, boo-boo.
Come here, bubba.

1568
01:20:47,617 --> 01:20:49,551
How are you, pal?

1569
01:20:49,586 --> 01:20:51,154
Aw, he remembers you!

1570
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:52,823
Ah! Ugh. Ew.

1571
01:20:52,855 --> 01:20:54,132
Oh, you remember Marcel?

1572
01:20:54,157 --> 01:20:55,434
Oh, you smell.
Oh, my goodness.

1573
01:20:55,457 --> 01:20:57,828
He has a new smell.
It's... Is he sick?

1574
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,328
<i>I switched him to wet food,</i>

1575
01:20:59,362 --> 01:21:00,639
<i>and it's made
his breath go crazy.</i>

1576
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:04,199
It is a very dense,
very rich aroma.

1577
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,601
- Arthur!
- Wow.

1578
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:07,670
<i>So, you guys got wet dog food.</i>

1579
01:21:07,703 --> 01:21:09,639
- Yeah.
- You got a balcony.

1580
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:11,417
- Yeah, we got the cool view.
- That's nice.

1581
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,208
I see you have
some flowers here.

1582
01:21:13,242 --> 01:21:14,286
Oh, yeah. They're nice.

1583
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:16,412
<i>They're from, uh, a bike path.</i>

1584
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:17,412
<i>There's a bike path that goes
in front of my place.</i>

1585
01:21:17,447 --> 01:21:19,448
Uh-huh.
Who gave you these flowers?

1586
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:20,525
No one gave them to me.

1587
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,417
- Really?
- Yeah.

1588
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:22,385
- Okay.
- I picked them myself.

1589
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:23,494
Oh, really?
'Cause we had a garden

1590
01:21:23,519 --> 01:21:25,721
at our place. I never
saw you picking any flowers.

1591
01:21:27,457 --> 01:21:28,600
<i>I wanted to make the place nice.</i>

1592
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,827
<i>A friend was coming over.</i>

1593
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,828
<i>- Ah, a friend.
- Yes, I had a friend.</i>

1594
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:32,829
<i>What kind of a friend?</i>

1595
01:21:32,863 --> 01:21:34,039
<i>- She is a girl.
- Really?</i>

1596
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:36,399
Would you like to
see the rest of the apartment?

1597
01:21:36,431 --> 01:21:38,935
Would you
like to change the subject?

1598
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,238
Yes, I want to see it.

1599
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:44,742
<i>- Hop on.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

1600
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:48,878
All right, so, here's my room.

1601
01:21:48,912 --> 01:21:52,481
Oh!
More flowers in here, huh?

1602
01:21:52,515 --> 01:21:54,885
Yeah, more flowers in here.

1603
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:57,654
Hit... Hitting
that bike path pretty hard.

1604
01:21:57,686 --> 01:21:59,856
Actually, those are
from the farmer's market.
