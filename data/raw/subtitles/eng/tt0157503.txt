1
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,844
You can run, but you can't hide
from the Lord.

2
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:28,379
You can never
judge a woman with bad...

3
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:10,683
Sarah Rose knows
you're a beautiful person.

4
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:16,453
Sarah Rose knows
you have an unusual talent.

5
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:21,373
Sarah Rose knows
you're a teenage girl.

6
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,097
And she definitely knows...

7
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:28,673
that you are ready for
the ultimate in teen glamour.

8
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:34,981
The American
Teen Princess Pageant!

9
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:37,665
And now, a few words
from last year's host...

10
00:01:37,703 --> 00:01:39,972
Mr. Adam West!

11
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:42,396
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

12
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,067
has been enriching the lives of
American-made girls since 1945.

13
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,623
The American
Teen Princess Pageant...

14
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:54,972
provides personal growth,
scholarship, travel!

15
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:58,693
And you might even meet
a few celebrities.

16
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,971
Yes!

17
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,415
At the national level...

18
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:04,831
thousands of seventeen-year-old
girls like yourselves...

19
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:07,752
compete around the country
in places like...

20
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,117
beautiful Mount Rose,
Minnesota...

21
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:13,982
and make it all the way
here to Lincoln, Alabama...

22
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:17,987
to compete for the title
of American Teen Princess.

23
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:21,320
So which one of you will it be?

24
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:26,886
Like sands through the hourglass
so are the "Days Of Our Lives. "

25
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,131
God, Iris, you taped
your shows over it.

26
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,446
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,476
Now, ladies,
the rest of the tape...

28
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:43,847
which is now gone forever...

29
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:47,013
goes on about starting
that great journey...

30
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:50,050
which we call the American
Teen Princess Pageant.

31
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,750
So any of you young ladies...

32
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:53,444
who'd like to start
on that journey...

33
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:55,785
you just come right down here
and sign up.

34
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,602
And, please, help yourself
to some coffee and bars.

35
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,154
Showtime.

36
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,968
Do you think
most people would say...

37
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,206
that teenage beauty pageants
are a good idea?

38
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,616
Oh, yeah, sure.

39
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:10,246
I know what some of your
big-city, no-bra-wearin'...

40
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,683
hairy-legged
women libbers might say.

41
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:14,123
They might say that a pageant...

42
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:16,425
is old-fashioned
and demeaning to the girls.

43
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,401
What's sick is women
dressing like men.

44
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:19,970
You betcha, Iris.

45
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,898
No, I think you boys
are going to find something...

46
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,623
a little bit different
here in Mount Rose.

47
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,928
For one thing,
we're all God-fearin' folk.

48
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,623
Every last one of us.

49
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:31,852
And you will not find a
"back room" in our video store.

50
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:34,884
No, that filth is better
left to the sin cities.

51
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,900
A.k. a. Minneapolis, St. Paul.

52
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:00,110
Oh, yeah, sure.

53
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:01,517
Freda, sure.

54
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,787
She was the oldest
living Lutheran.

55
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:06,442
Now she's as dead as a doornail.

56
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,900
It's the damn Shriners
who won't take down...

57
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,561
that goddamn sign,
the lazy sons of bitches.

58
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,446
Every year... every damn year,
I tell 'em...

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,847
"Take down
the goddamn Freda sign...

60
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,319
"you lazy sons of bitches!"

61
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:35,020
Today's "to do" list includes
a trip to the Mall of America...

62
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,944
where we are going
to be buying outfits...

63
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,286
for the physical fitness number.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,303
Nothing too showy.

65
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,871
No. You betcha, Iris.

66
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,213
We need that third judge.
Gosh, don't let me forget...

67
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,427
We need to think of a theme.

68
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,797
Gladys, look out!

69
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,721
Gosh darn it.
Hello, Father Dunegan.

70
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,445
Sidewalks? Sidewalks?

71
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,410
Iris, stop it.
It's not his fault.

72
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,864
The communal wine just proves
too tempting for some of them.

73
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,314
That's why we Lutherans
use grape Kool-Aid...

74
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,655
for the blood of Christ.

75
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:03,438
There's a parking space
over there.

76
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:05,448
Oh, no.
That's just a compact. Sorry.

77
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:07,182
You'd think they'd have
the parking lot of America...

78
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,746
to go with the Mall of America.

79
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,404
It's a $200 fine!

80
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,289
I told you I would move the car
if a cripple came.

81
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,421
Now just run in the store
and pick out some outfits.

82
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,474
All right, let's go.

83
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:19,955
Wait, wait, wait.

84
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,198
What?

85
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,861
I think I just thought
of the theme.

86
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,485
Oh, what?

87
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:28,011
"Proud to be an American. "

88
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,215
So, what was the theme
of the pageant last year?

89
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,901
Oh, that was "Buy American. "

90
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,632
And the year before that was...

91
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,772
"U.S.A. Is A-OK!"

92
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,461
And can you remember the theme
of your favorite pageant?

93
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,409
Can I?

94
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:44,175
"Amer-I Can!"

95
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,564
People ask me where I get this.

96
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,938
I don't know.
A gift from God or something.

97
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:01,773
Hi.

98
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:05,325
Just introduce yourself
and tell us why...

99
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,773
you're signing up
for the pageant.

100
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,878
OK. Hi. Hi.

101
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,406
I'm Leslie Miller.

102
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,928
I'm signing up 'cause,
you know...

103
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:16,941
I always watch
the pageants on TV...

104
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:20,017
and my boyfriend
thinks I'll win.

105
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,581
For my talent,
I'm going to be doing...

106
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:23,181
You've been talking
to this guy long enough.

107
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,165
I'm trying to tell him...

108
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,384
Now?

109
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,462
Hi, Pat.

110
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,923
Go Muskies!

111
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:42,708
Hi. I'm Amber Atkins,
and I'm signing up...

112
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,328
'cause my two favorite people
in the whole world...

113
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,310
competed in pageants...

114
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:50,037
my mom and Diane Sawyer.

115
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,478
Course, I hope I end up...

116
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,845
a little more like Diane Sawyer
than my mom.

117
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:06,518
Do you do
any of the embalming?

118
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,974
Oh, my God, no. Oh, God.

119
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:10,873
I just do the hair and makeup
on the deceased.

120
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,392
I'm lucky I have
an afterschool job...

121
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:15,832
where I can practice my talent.

122
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:23,437
Oh, yeah, sure.
Every pageant is special...

123
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:28,632
but this one
is extra-super-special to me.

124
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:31,894
When I was seventeen...
I don't know if you know this...

125
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:37,942
I was crowned Mount Rose's
American Teen Princess...

126
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,051
and this year...

127
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,709
drumroll, please...

128
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:47,603
my lovely daughter
Rebecca Ann Leeman is competing.

129
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,356
Is this my mark?

130
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,048
Hi. I'm Rebecca Leeman,
and I believe this pageant...

131
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,911
is an important experience
for every young woman.

132
00:07:57,948 --> 00:07:59,987
It...

133
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,907
Well, it teaches you what's
really important in life...

134
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,787
and it has the power
to change you...

135
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,729
in ways you've never dreamed of.

136
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,186
My mom gave me this nine-mill
for my thirteenth birthday.

137
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,808
Yeah. I'll always remember
what she wrote in the card.

138
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,786
"Jesus loves winners. "

139
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,146
That's why no matter what I do,
I aim to win.

140
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:37,079
Why?
Well, it's kinda like asking...

141
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,730
why all the guys chew
Copenhagen, you know?

142
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,258
If you're seventeen...

143
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:45,880
and you're not a total fry,
it's just what you do.

144
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,783
Have you decided what
your talent is going to be yet?

145
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,986
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm gonna sing and dance...

146
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,126
to "New York, New York. "

147
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,818
I just fell in love with
the Big Apple last summer...

148
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:00,157
when I was visiting
my brother Peter there.

149
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:03,071
He followed his dream
all the way to New York.

150
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,266
Wait.

151
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:10,046
Here's Peter as... Liza!

152
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,020
Here's him as Madonna.

153
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,453
As Barbara.

154
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:26,743
I don't know what
my talent's gonna be yet.

155
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:31,167
Kenny! Kenny, come.
Come, Kenny.

156
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:34,200
Oh, Kenny!
Oh, this is Kenny.

157
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,832
Spike, my German shepherd...

158
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:38,361
he went to live
with a nice family on a farm...

159
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,122
after he attacked me...

160
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,495
but it wasn't his fault,
was it, Kenny? No.

161
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,246
I had beef jerky
in my front pocket.

162
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:52,668
They remade my belly
with skin from my butt.

163
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:57,823
I was Mount Rose American
Teen Princess in 1945.

164
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:02,082
We were at war with the Japs.

165
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:04,220
Didn't even get to keep
my damn tiara.

166
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,705
I had to turn it in for scrap.

167
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,777
So we adopt Molly three year ago
when we come to America...

168
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,203
to help acclimate us
to American.

169
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,382
To America, Dad.

170
00:10:26,853 --> 00:10:29,122
She all-American girl.

171
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,742
She our Teen American Princess.

172
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,958
Oh, Ma.

173
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,284
English!

174
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,716
Speak English,
you stupid little retard!

175
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,418
So, Molly, tell movie man
what you talent do.

176
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:50,309
I'll be line dancing.

177
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,609
Country western!

178
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,532
Clint Black, ruff!

179
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,981
Hey, what he got that I not got?

180
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,403
So have you decided what
your talent is going to be...

181
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:03,747
for the pageant yet?

182
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:07,711
Yeah. I'll be doing
a dramatic monologue...

183
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:11,611
and right now
I'm thinking "Othello... "

184
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:13,411
or "Soylent Green... "

185
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:16,577
Well, my own version of it.

186
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:19,133
You know, a lot of girls
make a smooth transition...

187
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,484
from pageants into acting.

188
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:22,045
Competing for the title...

189
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:26,342
of Minnesota's American Teen
Princess sure was exciting...

190
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,263
but I never could have won...

191
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,165
without my Saint Paul
pork products.

192
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:35,266
I've been enjoying Saint Paul
pork products for years.

193
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,022
I grew up right next
to these stockyards.

194
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,707
It's still the same
family-run business...

195
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,738
that Walter and Vera Pularski
started in 1920...

196
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:48,102
when they raised
and slaughtered their first pig.

197
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,523
I just love
Saint Paul pork products.

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,429
In fact, I love 'em so much...

199
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:00,708
I work here now!

200
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,031
Oh, help yourself.

201
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,957
Thanks.

202
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,457
You're welcome.

203
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,439
My talent will be...

204
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:14,822
an interpretive...

205
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,301
dance...

206
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,792
while I sign...

207
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,615
"Through the Eyes of Love. "

208
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,782
Yeah. Well, see...

209
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,826
I have a dream...

210
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,965
of spreading sign language...

211
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,457
around the world.

212
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:41,859
Mom, will you be so kind?

213
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,778
Tammy Curry...

214
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,641
and I'm signing up
for the pageant...

215
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,787
'cause of
the scholarships and all.

216
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:56,713
This one's for varsity soccer.

217
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,090
I'm captain.

218
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:01,507
I run track, and right here
I'm the new president...

219
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,976
of the Lutheran
Sisterhood Gun Club.

220
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:05,321
Love that one.

221
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,012
Would you say...

222
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:14,021
you have a good chance
to win this pageant?

223
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,949
Yeah. You bet I do.

224
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,429
I mean, maybe other people think
I can't win a beauty pageant...

225
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,671
but other people didn't think
I could beat out...

226
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:25,986
Becky Leeman for president of
the gun club, either, and I did.

227
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,331
It's just like
Anthony Robbins says...

228
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,542
"I'm a winner.

229
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:32,233
"Nobody can stop me but me. "

230
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,826
Well, you know, I think
everybody's doing really well...

231
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:48,139
considering the fact
she was so young.

232
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,833
It's always hard to see
the young ones called home.

233
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,772
Especially
on an exploding thresher.

234
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:56,162
It's just so odd and gross.

235
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:57,645
You know, sometimes...

236
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,779
it's hard to understand
God's great plan.

237
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,398
But the show must go on.

238
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,188
I gotta get ahold of Ted...

239
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,165
and ask him if we can use that
barn light as a spot again...

240
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,280
so you watch
the Jell-O salad, OK?

241
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:12,426
You girls gonna sign up
for the pageant this year?

242
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,373
I ain't gonna be
in no goddamn pageant.

243
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,303
Look what happened
to that dork-ass farm girl.

244
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:17,319
Tammy Curry?

245
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,499
Yeah. Everyone says
this is a big accident?

246
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,454
She got iced
because she wins everything...

247
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:23,431
and this time someone
didn't want her to win.

248
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,965
This pageant's
like a Roach Motel.

249
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,929
Girls check in,
but they don't check out.

250
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,808
Yeah, and they say smoking's
bad for your health.

251
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:37,743
And... tendu, close.
Tendu, close.

252
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,264
Tendu, close, plié.

253
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:41,485
And repeat.

254
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:42,732
Tendu...

255
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:44,712
Suck in the bellies, girls!

256
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,730
And tuck in the tushes!

257
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,176
Close those legs.

258
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:50,959
You look like a bunch
of bowlegged cows.

259
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,414
Other side!

260
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:56,786
And tendu, close. Tendu, close.

261
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,126
Tendu, close, plié.

262
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,846
Yeah, you boys
sure picked a good year.

263
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,769
If I was a betting woman...

264
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,177
and there was a line
on this in Vegas...

265
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:06,829
I'd lay down ten to one
that it all comes down...

266
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:09,006
to Amber Atkins
and Becky Leeman.

267
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,800
Oh, sweet Jesus.

268
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,265
What a showdown this should be.

269
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,162
If Cain and Abel...

270
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,267
Oh, God!

271
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:17,966
That's so embarrassing.

272
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:28,493
My winning the Mount Rose...

273
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:34,543
American Teen Princess Pageant
really changed my life.

274
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:38,641
Amber does my hair once a week.

275
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:40,847
Well, it's the least I can do...

276
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:45,587
for the reigning Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

277
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:47,826
- Oh, God.
- What?

278
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:50,642
Oh, just a little snarl.

279
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,270
Don't tell.

280
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:56,492
What? Oh, my God.

281
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:00,275
Lights, camera, and me
without a stitch of makeup on.

282
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:02,253
What are you guys doing here?

283
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,950
What are you doing here?

284
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,011
Oh, Amber, like you're
the only one who visits Mary?

285
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,186
Who are you?

286
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:15,412
"Who are you?"
Oh, Mary, you kill me.

287
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,237
She always says that.

288
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,790
It's a little game
we play every week.

289
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:21,838
Same dippy little look
on her face.

290
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,181
"Who are you? Who are you?"

291
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,623
Just like that.

292
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:28,143
It's me... Becky.

293
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:31,695
And I brought your favorites.

294
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,451
Real nice, Becky.
She's anorexic.

295
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:38,285
She's skinny, Amber, not deaf.

296
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,352
So, beyond this pageant
you must have certain dreams...

297
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:05,273
and certain things
you aspire to, yeah?

298
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,502
Yeah, I got dreams.

299
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,307
Sometimes I dream of winning.

300
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:13,905
I dream of getting out
of Mount Rose...

301
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:17,460
and being a big-time reporter
like Diane Sawyer.

302
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:20,249
I mean, guys get out of
Mount Rose all the time...

303
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:22,899
for hockey scholarships...

304
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,281
or prison.

305
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:27,542
Yeah, 1963.

306
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,139
Her beauty worked against her...

307
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,344
when she started as a reporter
in Louisville, her hometown.

308
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:33,937
Those were different times.

309
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,042
That's my mom.

310
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:38,807
Hey, Amber,
did you get my smokes?

311
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:41,179
Yeah. I'll get 'em in a sec.

312
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,252
Aw, shit.

313
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,603
They're from Los Angeles.

314
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,806
They wanted to see my room
and film me for their movie.

315
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,811
Yeah, well, if they ask you
to take your top off...

316
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:51,763
get the money first.

317
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,692
And go get my smokes!

318
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,938
Hey, hey, you like it?

319
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,388
- Open it.
- This?

320
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,828
Yeah, the globe.

321
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,520
Go on,
pull on the North Pole there.

322
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,705
Here, watch.

323
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,755
Honey, this isn't a showroom.

324
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,968
See, this holds three
full-size booze bottles.

325
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,211
Tape cassette
comes out of Afghanistan.

326
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,054
All right, all right.

327
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,770
How quickly they forget
where this all comes from.

328
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,213
Taiwan.

329
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,767
That's enough, young lady.

330
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,728
I beg your pardon.
Would you like a drink?

331
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,515
Impartial?

332
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,071
When I'm outside these walls,
I am Gladys Leeman...

333
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,381
president Civil Servettes,
impartial as the day is long.

334
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,357
But I'm in my house now,
and I gotta warn you...

335
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,538
I'm wearing my wife apron
and my mom hat...

336
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,398
so I can safely say
that I am the mother...

337
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,302
of the most talented contestant
Mount Rose has ever had.

338
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:55,232
Oh, gosh, she's been
singing and dancing...

339
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:56,954
since she was knee-high
to a pig's eye.

340
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:59,064
Yeah, she's damn
near as good as...

341
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,992
you know, that little...
that black fellow...

342
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,516
the one with the glass eye...

343
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,641
the Candy Man...

344
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,047
- Sammy Davis, Jr.
- Yeah, the Jew.

345
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,739
Nice one, Dad. He's dead.

346
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,987
Yeah. Then we have
the Judges Interview.

347
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,871
Where each girl has a little
ten-minute get-together...

348
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,238
with the judges
prior to the pageant.

349
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:27,681
Then we have the...

350
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:33,405
Hello, Tony.

351
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,624
Hey to the folks.

352
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,942
Yeah, all right.

353
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,635
Gladys, the Judges Interview.

354
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,942
So you've judged a lot
of pageants over the years?

355
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,248
No. No. No way. No.

356
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,171
Never judged a pageant
before in my life.

357
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,552
No way.

358
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,505
Never been around young girls.

359
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,325
I mean, even if I was...

360
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,403
I mean, why would I want
to be, you know?

361
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,102
I don't get off
on that kind of thing.

362
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,796
That's really
why you're asking, right?

363
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,441
Someone say something?

364
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,103
Do you judge the pageant
every year?

365
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,378
No. I've never judged
nothin' before.

366
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:32,131
Harold, are we on "Cops"?

367
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,279
Are we on "Cops," Harold?

368
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,593
Shut up, Hank.
This here's business.

369
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:39,323
Harold,
Mom said not in the head!

370
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,786
Well, Mom's dead,
so shut your flytrap.

371
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,250
I will if you shut your piehole.

372
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,142
Don't make me...

373
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:56,318
Don't make me kick you
where the good Lord...

374
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,302
Don't make me
split you where you...

375
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,969
Come on!
You want some of this!

376
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:03,297
So, are you excited?

377
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:04,708
Oh, you bet.

378
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:07,133
We're happier than the day
Hankie got acquitted.

379
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,860
I get made a judge, then
the furniture store hires us...

380
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,902
to paint the whole damn thing.

381
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:13,829
We're going to use the money...

382
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,772
to get our mom
a proper headstone...

383
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,012
and to move her out
to the cemetery.

384
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,994
Listen, guys,
if you see anything you like...

385
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:27,900
you just let me know because
I happen to know the owner.

386
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,016
So, here we are.

387
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,261
My place of business,
my little house of worship...

388
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,947
the world's largest
Conestoga wagon.

389
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,739
Right here, we have
a very attractive unit.

390
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:39,492
Farmers like that one.

391
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,114
OK, showtime.

392
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:44,935
Hey, Tim, Carla, listen...

393
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:47,358
you two don't Jew me down
too much on that dinette...

394
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,701
I'll throw in a hutch
for free, OK?

395
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,646
See, that's my specialty.

396
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,298
You don't pay less,
I give you more.

397
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:58,950
The secret is... the hutch
is included in the price.

398
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,538
Ain't that right, Jean?

399
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,783
Take a memo, sweetheart.

400
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,727
Five, six, seven... and one...

401
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:20,867
Get that tempo right.
Kick it!

402
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,018
Come on, kick it!

403
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:31,687
Just watching the young girls.

404
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:33,927
Contestants. You know...

405
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,351
like the rest of my friends
and neighbors.

406
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,506
Are you getting her?

407
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,001
The third one, the blond one.

408
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,704
Leave him alone. It's OK.

409
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:55,428
It's just a camera I keep
in the glove compartment...

410
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:59,494
for... car accidents.
Insurance.

411
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,204
I mean, you guys got a camera...

412
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:06,245
and no one's accusing you
of anything, right?

413
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,318
So, Brett, you want to go
to the lake with me on Thursday?

414
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:29,829
Actually,
I got practice on Thursday.

415
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:31,331
Well, maybe Friday then.

416
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:33,742
A bunch of us
were going cow tipping.

417
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:36,327
Well...

418
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,254
I'm kind of busy on Friday.

419
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:52,429
Give her your tray, Brett.

420
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:54,635
You're holding up the line.

421
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,994
Give it to her.

422
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,887
Here, I'll take it.
It's my job.

423
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:02,058
No. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:04,748
Well, you're supposed
to put it in the...

425
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,210
Aw, man.

426
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:14,315
You got some lutefisk
in your hair.

427
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,045
Then it must be Wednesday.

428
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:22,095
Lutefisk is codfish
that's been salted...

429
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,713
and soaked in lye
for a week or so.

430
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:29,391
It's best with lots of butter.

431
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:33,135
I'm not really busy on Friday.

432
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,538
I was just saying that,
you know?

433
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:36,683
I know.

434
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,216
Well...

435
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,680
if you wanted to do something...

436
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:43,722
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. You bet.

437
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:45,170
Oh, crap.

438
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:47,114
I probably gotta work
at the funeral home.

439
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,064
We're real busy
this time of year.

440
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:51,440
Hunting season.

441
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:54,094
Well, I'm cutting out of here
early today...

442
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,757
and doing
a little duck hunting...

443
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,520
but maybe I could
call you tonight?

444
00:24:57,554 --> 00:24:58,669
Yeah, sure.

445
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,004
- All right.
- Fine.

446
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:17,162
Oh, God.

447
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:19,823
You don't think Becky
saw you guys, do you?

448
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,616
Look, you shouldn't be in here.

449
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,961
Doreen gave us hair nets.

450
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,616
No, listen.
We shouldn't talk here.

451
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:28,619
Stop by my house tonight, OK?

452
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,214
Go.

453
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,701
They take out her butt?

454
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:49,196
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

455
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,799
Oh, are we on "Cops" again?

456
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,529
OK, be quiet.

457
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:55,761
It's just the guys
that are, you know...

458
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,621
making the movie
about the pageant.

459
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,630
I told you all about 'em.
This here's Loretta.

460
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:02,127
I tell Annette, you talk to me
during my stories...

461
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,144
you might as well
be talking to the wall.

462
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:05,589
You guys want a beer?

463
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:07,598
No, thank you. Is Amber here?

464
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:08,980
Oh, no. You just missed her.

465
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:11,319
She got called down
to the bone gardens.

466
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:13,107
She's in a hell of a mood today.

467
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:14,866
Say, you boys been
to the Leemans'?

468
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,080
Shut it, Loretta.

469
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,453
If so, you got all the pictures
of the winner you need.

470
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:19,567
- Shut it.
- It's true.

471
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,613
Let's just say who should win,
who deserves to win is Amber.

472
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:29,945
Why don't you just paint
a target on your ass?

473
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:31,765
Best damn tapper,
the most smartest.

474
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:32,880
Most smartest?

475
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:35,288
Oh, that's great.
You're real educated.

476
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,558
"Most smartest. "
Get a picture of that.

477
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:38,967
Most smartest.

478
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,279
I'm cutting you off
and sending you home.

479
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:43,379
Excuse me, but I'm bragging up
your kid here.

480
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:44,692
I know. Come on, let's go.

481
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,452
Amber's gonna be the next
Diane Sawyer, you know.

482
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,799
They're making a movie here.

483
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,657
All right,
they're making a movie.

484
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,829
What makes you think
that Becky's going to win?

485
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,010
Why do I think Becky'll win?

486
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:54,575
You're talking... Don't pinch.

487
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,921
You're talking about the richest
family in a small town.

488
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:59,473
It's front-page news
when one of 'em takes a shit.

489
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:00,660
Oh, great.

490
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,114
Can one of you boys
give me a ride home?

491
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,333
Don't fall for it.

492
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:06,778
She lives two trailers down.

493
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:07,987
So? Be real easy.

494
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:09,434
Go on home, Loretta.

495
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,540
Go on. The party's over.

496
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,360
Oh, my God!

497
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:25,209
Jesus Christ on a cross!

498
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,994
Look, number one rule
in a funeral home...

499
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:30,166
Never sneak up on the living.

500
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,766
You never know who could
have an embalming needle...

501
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,625
or a skull saw in their hand.

502
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,930
Mr. Larson's son
learned the hard way.

503
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:38,003
He's buried next to my grandpa.

504
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,618
Are you upset about Brett?

505
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:47,482
Upset about Brett?

506
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,680
Nah. Hazard of the trade.

507
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,417
I don't really have time
for guys anyways.

508
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:56,664
It's weird, though.

509
00:27:56,702 --> 00:27:59,419
He took it
right between the eyes.

510
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,163
Don't often see that.

511
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:06,808
So, you know,
Brett just got shot in the head.

512
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,023
He did?

513
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,884
Well, hunting's dangerous.

514
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,461
So, anyways, my mom gave me
this thirty-aught...

515
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:14,964
for my sixteenth birthday.

516
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,398
I need Stella now.

517
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,347
The family's steaming
like a cow pie in July.

518
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:25,759
Said she doesn't look nothin'
like the picture they gave you.

519
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,766
Sorry. I just thought she might
not want to meet her maker...

520
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,334
looking like a cheap whore.

521
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,189
Well, this cheap whore
is that family's loving mother.

522
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,645
The Clemens
said to make him look...

523
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,377
like he just came in
from snowmobiling.

524
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,790
Pink cheeks and...

525
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:40,093
Red nose and ears.
I know, I know.

526
00:28:54,658 --> 00:28:58,684
Sorry I couldn't talk to you
before in the cafeteria.

527
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,412
I was scared, OK?

528
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,897
I open my locker today
after first period...

529
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:08,215
and there's a picture
of Tammy Curry taped inside.

530
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,233
This was written on the back:

531
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:15,129
Oh, yeah,
hell of a way to go, there.

532
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,786
After some thorough
investigating...

533
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:21,154
we determined
that the Curry girl...

534
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,771
must have been smoking
and driving.

535
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:26,494
Well, yeah, Tammy liked
to drive her dad's thresher...

536
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,536
but, I mean...

537
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,684
She said the heavy vibration
helped her think.

538
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:34,105
But I know for a fact Tammy
only smoked after a good drive.

539
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,628
You ask me or anyone else who
isn't scared to talk about it...

540
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,556
Tammy was murdered.

541
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:44,226
I bet Diane Sawyer never had
to deal with crap like this.

542
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,290
If it's another stray bullet
to the head...

543
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:48,607
I'm gonna need more caps.

544
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:49,853
You have to go home.

545
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,866
There's some kind of emergency
at the trailer park.

546
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,051
Relax. That's my ma's code...

547
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,531
for bring home milk
and a carton of Lucky...

548
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:57,663
No. Loretta called.
There's been a fire.

549
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,354
Oh, my God.

550
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:25,217
Hey, hey, hey! Family?

551
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:28,101
No, she's just screaming "Mom"
because she's got Turret's.

552
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,443
She's Annette's kid, dipshit.

553
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:32,258
She's alive, sweetie.
She's right over there.

554
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:39,452
I'll be right behind you
in the hearse, OK?

555
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:41,502
Don't let that worry you,
Annette!

556
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:56,869
So, Doctor, is this sort
of an unusual injury?

557
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:59,172
This was a doozie.

558
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,468
Right now our chief concern
is to stabilize Annette here...

559
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:05,057
and then in surgery...

560
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:06,502
remove this.

561
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:08,956
Oh, God.

562
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,594
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.

563
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:13,414
Ruined a brand-new pair
of Lee Press-Ons.

564
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:17,410
Well, I sat down to have a beer,
and kablooey.

565
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:18,855
Next thing I know...

566
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:21,221
something blows
through my kitchen window...

567
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:24,901
and I'm ass-up
in somebody's flower bed.

568
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,904
Hey, ass-wipe, quit dicking
around with the camera.

569
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,222
Just put another book under it.

570
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:30,401
Dude, don't say "ass-wipe. "

571
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:33,736
Mom's got the window open.
We gotta hurry up, though...

572
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,840
because we only got three
frickin' minutes on the battery.

573
00:31:35,882 --> 00:31:37,092
All right, ready.

574
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,242
One, two...

575
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:39,362
One, two, three!

576
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,547
Shit!

577
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:45,829
Let's get out of here!

578
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:52,165
I shoved your tap shoes
in my panties...

579
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,275
before I was blown
out of the house.

580
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,551
You go find the guy
who cut 'em off.

581
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,667
He'll give 'em to you...

582
00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:01,001
so you can practice
for the pageant.

583
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:04,870
About that...

584
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,827
I... Oh, my God!

585
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:15,335
Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

586
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,544
She's pregnant!

587
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:19,369
Oh, Amber, wait!

588
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,793
Come back here.
Mommy wants to talk to you.

589
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,462
And then kill you!

590
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,539
Why don't you see
if there's any more beer...

591
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:27,402
left in that can
and relax a bit?

592
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,941
- I'm quitting the pageant.
- You're what?

593
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:33,540
I'm quitting the pageant.

594
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:37,290
I was just trying to scare you
into changing your mind.

595
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:39,147
Christ, the woman clung
to your tap shoes...

596
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,569
while flying through the air
like a goddamn lawn dart.

597
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:42,790
I know, I know.

598
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,830
Hey, Little Miss Sad Pants
and her friend Serious Sally.

599
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:47,463
How about
some nice cool mints...

600
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,923
to turn those frowns
upside down?

601
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:53,166
Do you think a nice cool mint
would help...

602
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:55,686
if I shoved your head
up your ass?

603
00:32:58,637 --> 00:32:59,946
So what do I say?

604
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:01,837
Simple, just say...

605
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:07,087
I know you sacrificed
everything...

606
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,159
relationships, dreams...

607
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,604
your tummy, ass, and thighs...

608
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:12,046
all to bring me
into this world...

609
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,861
all so I could have tap lessons
and be in the pageant...

610
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:17,318
the same one you were in,
but you know what?

611
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:18,503
I'm quitting.

612
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,963
There. Easy as pie.

613
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:22,982
Oh, my God. I am so dead.

614
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,004
Yeah, you betcha.

615
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,252
Go on, get out!

616
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,386
Next one in here without a pack
of Luckys in her hand dies!

617
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:32,489
Yeah, sure.
You have a super day, too.

618
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,086
Get out!

619
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,484
Mom, look. Don't talk.

620
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,000
First of all,
I'm not pregnant, OK?

621
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:44,107
I am not letting go
until you tell me what's up.

622
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:47,790
Amber, I am reaching a point
where I would kill someone...

623
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:49,352
for the nicotine
under their fingernails.

624
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,507
You hear me, Loretta?

625
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:52,749
OK, OK...

626
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:55,469
yesterday I got this picture...

627
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:58,800
so I'm thinking about...

628
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,239
you know...

629
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,965
I'm gonna quit the pageant.

630
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,408
What?

631
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,099
Oh, excuse us, guys.

632
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,921
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

633
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,093
Loretta, get out of here!
Go on, get out.

634
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,242
What's your problem?

635
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:14,150
What's my problem?
Sit your skinny little ass down.

636
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:15,624
Nice, Ma. Real nice.

637
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,039
Nice mouth you got there...

638
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:18,929
but I'm not going
through this again.

639
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,101
You? You're not
going through it again?

640
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,986
You're not the one that knows
how Jiffy Pop feels, missy.

641
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:25,545
Oh, come on, Mom.

642
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:27,977
First the picture of Tammy, then
Brett Clemmens, and now this?

643
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,425
It's scary.

644
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,497
Scary?
Let me tell you scary.

645
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,482
Look here. Look at me.

646
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,628
You want to look
like you've been rode hard...

647
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:37,587
and put away wet
when you're my age?

648
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:38,763
I'm a lifer here.

649
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,146
Best thing
I got to look forward to...

650
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,088
is to end up
in some decent raisin ranch...

651
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:44,530
where they change me
twice a day.

652
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:49,420
Honest to God, honey.

653
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,427
If I had it to do over...

654
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,674
I'd start walking
out of this town...

655
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,912
the minute I could take
my first step.

656
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,802
You know, practically...

657
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:02,187
the only thing I wouldn't do
different is have you.

658
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:08,114
God, I hope that's you
and not your concussion talking.

659
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,326
It's me.

660
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:13,936
I just don't want this to be
the thing that you do over.

661
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:17,202
Now, this pageant's
your ticket out of here...

662
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:19,792
and I know you can win.

663
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:21,901
Come here.

664
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:23,949
Oh, I love you much.

665
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,418
I love you much.

666
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,219
And you're gonna win.

667
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:28,978
She's gonna win.

668
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,128
Isn't she gonna win, Loretta?

669
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,346
You bet.

670
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,364
You'll see.

671
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,446
Hell no, she ain't quitting.

672
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:35,861
No. Mom said if I did...

673
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,748
she'd look up my dad
and marry him.

674
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:40,368
So, has your mom
kept your dad's life a secret?

675
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,965
No, she never hid the fact...

676
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,493
that my dad
picked his career over us.

677
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:45,942
What did she used to say?

678
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,537
Once a carny, always a carny.

679
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:49,998
Mom still cries
when she sees a tilt-a-whirl...

680
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,046
or a fat lady in a tube top.

681
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:53,975
The Atkins fire.

682
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:56,725
Foul play? Shit, no.

683
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,580
After some extensive
investigating...

684
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,616
we determined that it must
have been bad wiring.

685
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:03,380
Bad wiring?

686
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,782
That's the biggest
crock of shit I ever heard.

687
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,813
What, they have a sale
on dull needles at K-Mart?

688
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:12,236
I just need one more do-over.

689
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,556
Now, we need to remember the
three most important parts...

690
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,376
to give a really good
interview...

691
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,068
Listen up, number one.

692
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,893
Number one.

693
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,297
American Teen Princesses...

694
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,240
do not cross their legs
like streetwalkers.

695
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:46,288
Excuse me,
"Miss Penthouse '98... "

696
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:47,889
put your knees together.

697
00:36:47,962 --> 00:36:49,304
I could drive
a boat show in there.

698
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,767
Ankles together.

699
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,429
Hands resting
lightly on your laps.

700
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:55,703
Good.
Sit up straight. Smile.

701
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:57,649
All right, number two.

702
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,724
The judges are just
as nervous as you are.

703
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,018
So, are you about ready...

704
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,987
to start the judging,
start the interview there?

705
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,649
I guess I could answer that.

706
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,099
Yeah, we're ready.

707
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:22,262
So we should probably get
the young girls in here, then.

708
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,169
You know,
to start the interviews.

709
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:29,816
If you could be any tree
in the woods...

710
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,370
what kind of tree would you be?

711
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:36,598
Dogwood.

712
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:37,915
Bonsai.

713
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,227
Green?

714
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,169
I can be any kind
of tree you want.

715
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:42,838
Just give me a minute
to warm up.

716
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:52,380
One with strong roots in
a community like Mount Rose...

717
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,381
a solid Christian trunk...

718
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:59,066
and long leafy branches
to provide shade...

719
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:01,491
for handicapped kids
on a hot summer day.

720
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:04,567
You guys know
the retard's pants are open?

721
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,821
I don't want to see that.

722
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:12,509
Who would you pick to be
the president, dead or alive?

723
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:15,225
Emperor Hirohito.

724
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:16,473
Brett Favre.

725
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:27,710
My mother, 'cause she could
solve world hunger...

726
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:30,615
with one of her blue-ribbon
rhubarb pies...

727
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,756
create world peace
with one of her prayers...

728
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,215
and still find time
to look beautiful...

729
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,810
for my dad, Lester Leeman.

730
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,277
Do you like to swim?

731
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,255
Yeah, I love to swim.

732
00:38:43,297 --> 00:38:45,184
When I was in New York,
I met Greg Louganis...

733
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:46,811
at one of my brother's shows.

734
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,618
The tard's pants
are completely off.

735
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:07,578
Close up shop.

736
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:12,222
Are you Amber Atkins?

737
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:14,331
Yes, yes, I am. Hello.

738
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:19,647
Name and spell
all the United States...

739
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:20,991
in alphabetical order.

740
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,801
Seriously?

741
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:33,825
Well...

742
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:36,827
Alabama.

743
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:39,518
A- I-a-b-a-m-a.

744
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:40,899
Alaska.

745
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:44,761
A- I-a-s-k-a.

746
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,853
Arizona.

747
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:53,056
A- r-i-z-o-n-a.

748
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,686
West Virginia.

749
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,618
W- e-s-t V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a.

750
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,930
Wisconsin.

751
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:04,511
W- i-s-c-o-n-s-i-n.

752
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:05,629
Wyoming.

753
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,516
W- y-o-m-i-n-g.

754
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,911
Well, OK.

755
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,696
With two weeks until
the pageant...

756
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:28,924
I was practicing my talent,
finishing my costume...

757
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:31,779
brushing up on current events...

758
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:37,762
and running eighteen miles a day
on about four hundred calories.

759
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,807
I was ready.

760
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:53,218
Girls, couple of things.

761
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:54,686
All right, very important.

762
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:58,077
Gladys wants us to all go
in show order today.

763
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,055
All right, so very important,
don't forget that.

764
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,824
Oh, yeah, really nervous.

765
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:08,681
It's been about two months.

766
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,389
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

767
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:13,886
How did you know?

768
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,711
I meant nervous
about the pageant.

769
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:20,063
Oh, nervous about the pageant.

770
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,104
There are eight thousand
sequins...

771
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:25,959
and fifteen hundred beads
on the skirt alone.

772
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:28,513
My mom had Mrs. Lopez make it.

773
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:31,588
She's one of my father's
many Mexican workers.

774
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,973
He lifts them from the poverty
they know in Mexico.

775
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,864
Yeah, all my mom's clothes
melted onto mine.

776
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:41,512
Forming, like, this big
polyester meteor in our closet.

777
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:44,099
But in some kind
of weird miracle...

778
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,547
our neighbor boy Kenny Hansen...

779
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:47,718
found my tap costume
on the roof of their trailer...

780
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,144
while he was setting
coon traps for his dad.

781
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,365
Here's the weird part.

782
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:53,771
It was still on the hanger.

783
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,867
This is my lucky bolt.

784
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:59,462
They think that it fell
from a DC-10.

785
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:02,948
The doctor said I was really
lucky the flat side hit me.

786
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,737
'Cause otherwise it could have
gone right through my head.

787
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:08,870
I know, I know.
Gives me the willies, too.

788
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:13,802
Can we switch numbers?

789
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:20,100
My cousin just had a deaf baby,
and I get to go see it.

790
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,482
I need to go first.

791
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:24,485
Yeah, sure.
It's my lucky number anyway.

792
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:27,373
Diane Sawyer has number eight
at her local.

793
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,372
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

794
00:42:31,854 --> 00:42:36,841
I can see what's mine now

795
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:43,053
Finding out what's true

796
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:49,544
Since I found you

797
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:54,055
Looking through the eyes

798
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,297
Of...

799
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:57,929
I'm gonna be honest.

800
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,007
This is a hard time for me...

801
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:03,146
because this is the time
in the pageant...

802
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:05,453
when you realize
that tomorrow night...

803
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:08,453
all but one of these girls
is gonna walk away a loser.

804
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:09,770
To be

805
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,732
It's just really hard...

806
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,548
for me to know
what that would feel like.

807
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:15,307
It can't feel good.

808
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:19,303
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

809
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:20,773
Don't touch her.

810
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,936
Don't move the body.
Don't touch the body.

811
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,405
She could be paralyzed
from the neck down...

812
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:27,626
and you wouldn't know it.

813
00:43:27,665 --> 00:43:29,159
Someone call nine-one-one.

814
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,176
Don't say anything...

815
00:43:31,216 --> 00:43:33,738
'cause it might be
a hypnotic suggestion.

816
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:36,685
Don't you get it?

817
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:37,800
I was supposed to go first.

818
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:40,141
I was contestant number one.

819
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,859
That light was meant
for my head.

820
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,777
If Jenelle hadn't
wanted to go first...

821
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,191
I owe my life
to that deaf baby.

822
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:53,738
Hey, that was your mom.

823
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:55,689
She wanted you to have this.

824
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,199
Really, Loretta?

825
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:01,389
You bet.

826
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:05,738
My mom wanted me to have this?

827
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:08,521
Oh, shut up.

828
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,472
I thought it might help you
get some sleep.

829
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,752
Loretta, never have kids.

830
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:17,290
Well, God love you
for thinking I still could.

831
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:19,252
Your ma did want you
to have this, though...

832
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:20,689
since your other one
got toasted.

833
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,111
It's just like Diane Sawyer's!

834
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:25,609
Of course, it's not a size ten.

835
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,057
Diane was a little hippy then.

836
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,585
- Not our girl.
- Oh, no.

837
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,107
Pain meds.

838
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:42,895
Hope this thing ends
before they do.

839
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:47,470
We have excitement.

840
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,882
Big excitement.

841
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:50,063
Go, Molly!

842
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,758
Go.

843
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:54,067
Leslie Miller
kicks Teen Princess ass!

844
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,076
Whoo! Go, Muskies!

845
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,423
Oh, gotta go.

846
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,213
Thank you, thank you.

847
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:28,663
Oh, my.

848
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:31,543
Is that for me or my gown?

849
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:39,732
Welcome to the Mount Rose
American Teen Princess Pageant.

850
00:45:39,768 --> 00:45:42,155
While every contestant...

851
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,720
you'll meet here tonight
is special and unique...

852
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,630
they all have
one thing in common.

853
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:52,561
They are all proud
to be an American.

854
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:33,041
I chose Mount Rushmore...

855
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:34,806
because to live in a country...

856
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:36,566
where you can take
an ugly old mountain...

857
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,473
and put faces on it,
faces of great Americans...

858
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:42,384
who did so much to make
our country super great...

859
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,273
well, that makes me,
Rebecca Leeman...

860
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:47,250
proud to be an American.

861
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm Lisa Swenson, and I am proud
to be an American...

862
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:53,593
because living in a country
where Lady Liberty...

863
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:56,409
always keeps her flame
burning bright...

864
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:01,682
She always keeps her flame
burning bright.

865
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:04,025
It makes me proud
to be an American.

866
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:05,139
God.

867
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:07,003
The Washington Monument...

868
00:47:07,037 --> 00:47:09,621
Oh, yeah, baby!

869
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:10,610
Makes me...

870
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,717
Leslie Miller,
proud to be an American.

871
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:18,299
Living in a country
where no matter who you are...

872
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,202
or where you come from,
you can grow up...

873
00:47:21,244 --> 00:47:24,825
and become what you've always
dreamed of makes me...

874
00:47:24,894 --> 00:47:27,862
Amber Atkins,
proud to be an American.

875
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:31,315
Atomic power makes me,
Molly Howard...

876
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,691
proud to be an Asian-American.

877
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:37,240
My uncle Phil's world's-largest
ball of twine...

878
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,133
in Bundy, Minnesota...

879
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,362
it makes me proud I'm American.

880
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:45,693
I kind of misunderstood
the assignment.

881
00:47:49,982 --> 00:47:53,212
A couple of notes from
yesterday's dress rehearsal.

882
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:54,557
Gladys says a couple of youse...

883
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:55,802
are getting sexy
with your hips...

884
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,943
during the physical
fitness routine.

885
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:00,381
Oh, my God,
my tap costume's gone.

886
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:03,679
Amber, we are not putting on
our talent costume.

887
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:05,915
You need to put on
your physical fitness outfit.

888
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:07,861
Let's shake a leg, ladies!

889
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:10,269
It was here
before the opening number.

890
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:13,399
Wait.

891
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,678
What am I saying?

892
00:48:15,712 --> 00:48:18,429
I should just ask you, Becky.

893
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:20,122
Where is it?

894
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,304
What?

895
00:48:21,344 --> 00:48:23,733
You heard me. Where is it?

896
00:48:25,026 --> 00:48:27,773
If you're getting at something,
you'd better just say it.

897
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,849
I just did.

898
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:31,644
Well, then you'd better be
willing to back it up...

899
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:33,055
because you're talking crazy.

900
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,708
You bring me on some
of that snotty attitude.

901
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:36,825
Bring it on!

902
00:48:36,864 --> 00:48:38,555
Well, as my mother says
at Sunday dinner...

903
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:39,641
come and get it!

904
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,024
I'll get it!

905
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,137
I might even take seconds!

906
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:44,829
If you want seconds,
I'll make sure you get them!

907
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:46,208
Give me your stringy ass!

908
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,561
I think that you guys
should leave.

909
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,284
The girls are changing.
I think you should leave.

910
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:53,729
All right, let's go.

911
00:48:53,761 --> 00:48:56,128
- I hate her!
- We all do. Let's go.

912
00:48:56,162 --> 00:48:58,070
Let's give a big round
of applause...

913
00:48:58,115 --> 00:49:00,502
for last year's
American Teen Princess...

914
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,716
in her farewell performance.

915
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:04,674
Who could ever forget
her lip-synching...

916
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:08,120
to "Don't Cry Out Loud"
by Melissa Manchester?

917
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:09,821
And here she is...

918
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,518
Mary Johanson.

919
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:25,537
Don't cry out loud

920
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:28,091
Just keep it inside

921
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:32,539
And learn how to hide
your feelings

922
00:49:32,613 --> 00:49:37,915
Fly high and proud

923
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:40,956
And if you should fall

924
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:43,418
Remember you almost

925
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:48,130
Had it all

926
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:52,799
All right, why don't we pick up
the stepladders...

927
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:53,917
for the physical fitness number?

928
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,037
There we go.

929
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:56,420
They're wet.

930
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,533
What?

931
00:49:57,572 --> 00:49:59,002
My hands are stuck.

932
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:01,598
I'm kind of dizzy
from the fumes.

933
00:50:01,638 --> 00:50:02,817
You know what, girls?

934
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:05,274
Keep them away from you so
they don't get on the outfits.

935
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:06,398
There we go.

936
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,292
Let's form a line.

937
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,098
What kind of a mental retard...

938
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,956
paints stepladders
right before a pageant?

939
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,778
I'm the judge!

940
00:50:16,903 --> 00:50:20,034
Back, you cuddly retard.

941
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,348
Go, Hank!

942
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:23,749
It's OK.

943
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:24,864
My dress is fine.

944
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:28,774
All right, so...

945
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:30,846
our other judges are...

946
00:50:30,888 --> 00:50:32,383
Jean Kangas...

947
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:33,765
and John Dough...

948
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,583
Opening number looked good...

949
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:39,942
solid, but now you're going
to have to actually dance.

950
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:43,303
So, here, put a dab of this
on the old choppers, ladies.

951
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:44,995
It'll help you smile...

952
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,941
and when they're looking
at your teeth, God willing...

953
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:48,774
they won't be looking
at your feet.

954
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:08,194
Hurry up.

955
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:09,577
OK, I think we all got some.

956
00:52:09,613 --> 00:52:11,172
Just take it off.

957
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:13,547
Here, I didn't...

958
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:15,949
I think it went really well.

959
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,541
Don't go in the bathroom.

960
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:19,436
Tess blew chunks all over.

961
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:22,056
She ate a really large dinner.

962
00:52:22,093 --> 00:52:24,232
Maybe she should've
shoved that lucky bolt...

963
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,699
down her throat for dessert.

964
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:29,732
And the winner
of the spirit award goes to...

965
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:33,155
I'd like to take you back
seventeen years...

966
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,459
when a peanut farmer
was in the White House...

967
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:38,665
a group of boys
calling themselves Queen...

968
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:40,392
topped the record charts...

969
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:42,340
and Gladys Leeman
was Gladys Wood...

970
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:46,886
and she was Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

971
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:56,110
Thank you very much.

972
00:52:56,142 --> 00:53:00,421
You know, seventeen years ago,
I won the talent contest...

973
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:01,609
by sewing...

974
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:03,786
these culottes...

975
00:53:03,825 --> 00:53:05,765
Butterick pattern
seven-four-three-two.

976
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,630
And can you believe it?

977
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:08,777
They still fit.

978
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:11,565
She had a big ass then,
she's got a big ass now.

979
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:13,968
Our next contestant is ready,
so let's welcome her...

980
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,376
Tess Weinhaus.

981
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,058
Yeah, it's just gone.

982
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,320
I mean...

983
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:28,360
I just wanna tap, you know?

984
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:32,842
I'm not saying I'm the best
or that I'd even win, but...

985
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:34,920
shouldn't I at least
get a chance to compete?

986
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,606
The beagle is known
for its howl.

987
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:44,972
I just wanted my mom
to see me dance.

988
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,628
Amber, Amber, come here.

989
00:53:47,697 --> 00:53:50,220
Please. I got so much Vaseline
on my teeth...

990
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:52,233
I'm going to be smiling
for a year.

991
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:53,803
No. Here.

992
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,084
It's nothing special...

993
00:53:55,124 --> 00:53:57,993
but talent like yours doesn't
need to hide behind sequins.

994
00:53:58,033 --> 00:53:59,410
Oh, Miss K.

995
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:00,720
Oh, look.

996
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:05,904
But none can compare
to the greatest bark of all...

997
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,110
the German shepherd.

998
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,962
Aw, hell, go out there
and kick some Leeman ass.

999
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:17,327
Not so hard, sweetie.
I heard something snap.

1000
00:54:17,363 --> 00:54:19,153
Roll him over!

1001
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:20,148
Lay him flat!

1002
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:22,797
Pin his shoulders!

1003
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:24,330
To the mat!

1004
00:54:25,331 --> 00:54:26,825
Roll him over! Lay him flat!

1005
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:28,788
Pin their shoulders
to the mat!

1006
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:30,346
Go...

1007
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,699
Muskies! Yeah!

1008
00:54:41,397 --> 00:54:42,345
Fade in.

1009
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:46,772
The year... 2024.

1010
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:49,967
Planet... Earth.

1011
00:54:51,126 --> 00:54:53,012
The question
on everyone's mind?

1012
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:55,787
What is...

1013
00:54:55,863 --> 00:54:57,358
Soylent Green?

1014
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:04,653
Mrs. Clark, why are you
doing this to me?

1015
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:06,582
Why are you pretending
you don't know what's going on?

1016
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:08,558
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am.

1017
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:10,006
But you know the rules.

1018
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:11,894
All talent costumes
have to be OK'd...

1019
00:55:11,927 --> 00:55:13,235
by Gladys before the pageant.

1020
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:14,766
But doesn't someone
taking your costume...

1021
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:17,174
so you can't compete
overrule that rule?

1022
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,181
Amber, I'm sorry.
I don't make up the rules.

1023
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:20,685
Oh, this...

1024
00:55:20,729 --> 00:55:22,254
this is bullshit!

1025
00:55:22,297 --> 00:55:25,330
Amber Atkins, that is not
American Teen Princess language.

1026
00:55:25,399 --> 00:55:28,248
Good, because this isn't an
American Teen Princess Pageant.

1027
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:30,187
This is... this is...

1028
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:32,151
this is Nazi Germany!

1029
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,427
Where do they get this stuff?

1030
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,215
I'm wearing this tap costume.

1031
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,527
I'm going to do
my talent tonight.

1032
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,739
Oh, really?

1033
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:52,206
I don't think so.

1034
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:57,717
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news...

1035
00:55:57,784 --> 00:56:00,338
but you know the rules state
that a costume has to be OK'd...

1036
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:02,317
at least a week in advance.

1037
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:05,776
I couldn't let you go out there
in that skimpy little thing.

1038
00:56:05,816 --> 00:56:07,311
We've got kids in the audience.

1039
00:56:07,355 --> 00:56:09,297
I hope you understand.

1040
00:56:09,337 --> 00:56:10,832
But you... I mean...

1041
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:13,331
It's not my fault. Please.

1042
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:15,377
I didn't do anything wrong.

1043
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:17,806
I know the truth, that's why.

1044
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:19,126
I must say...

1045
00:56:19,163 --> 00:56:21,234
Soylent Green...

1046
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:23,249
is people!

1047
00:56:26,812 --> 00:56:28,634
Now, that's my cue.

1048
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,785
I just wanted to compete.

1049
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:14,713
I can't believe
this is happening.

1050
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:17,170
I can't believe she said...

1051
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:26,453
Here.

1052
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:27,923
Here? What?

1053
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:29,460
My jacket.

1054
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:31,804
Take it, because I got
my costume OK'd a month ago...

1055
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,397
before the pageant.
You can wear it.

1056
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:34,878
Put it on.

1057
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:35,989
Oh, wow.

1058
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,689
Lisa, I don't think
you should do this.

1059
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:39,417
They're never going to let you
perform naked. I asked.

1060
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,527
Shut up, you guys.

1061
00:57:41,568 --> 00:57:44,217
Listen, Amber...

1062
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:46,938
I'm not going to win.

1063
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:49,431
And let's be honest, the family
only needs one Liza...

1064
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:52,156
and Peter's got
much better legs than me, OK?

1065
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:53,500
Your parents will kill you.

1066
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,120
Ah, come on.
I love them...

1067
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,606
but they only had me because
Peter needed that kidney.

1068
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:06,136
Thank you.

1069
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:10,618
Now...

1070
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:12,151
it is with overwhelming pride...

1071
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:14,680
that I introduce to you
contestant number six...

1072
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:17,469
who is also the president of her
class two years running...

1073
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,926
an honor roll student,
and the new president...

1074
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,107
of the Lutheran Sisterhood
Gun Club.

1075
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,324
Ladies and gentlemen...

1076
00:58:23,361 --> 00:58:25,565
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

1077
00:58:33,057 --> 00:58:34,521
You know what?

1078
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:35,992
The rumors are true.

1079
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:40,376
I do have a special fella
in my life...

1080
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:43,777
and if nobody minds...

1081
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:47,389
I'd like to sing a little song
just for him.

1082
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,985
You're just too good

1083
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:55,130
To be true

1084
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,811
Can't take my eyes

1085
00:58:58,853 --> 00:58:59,866
Off of you

1086
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:00,986
Bullshit.

1087
00:59:01,028 --> 00:59:03,362
You'd be like heaven

1088
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:05,339
To touch

1089
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,038
I wanna hold you

1090
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:08,863
So much

1091
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:11,418
At long last

1092
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:14,558
Love has arrived

1093
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:16,984
And I thank God

1094
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:18,173
I'm alive

1095
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:21,888
You're just too good

1096
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,833
To be true

1097
00:59:23,878 --> 00:59:26,463
Can't take my eyes

1098
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:27,909
Off of you

1099
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:31,420
I love you, baby

1100
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,054
And if it's quite all right

1101
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,068
I need you, baby

1102
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:37,213
To warm the lonely night

1103
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:39,774
I love you, baby

1104
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:41,787
Trust in me when I say

1105
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,285
Lisa, come on, you're next.

1106
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:45,852
Nah, I quit.

1107
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:48,511
And since my costume was OK'd
a month ago...

1108
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,662
I'm giving it to Amber.

1109
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:55,581
Let me love you, baby

1110
00:59:55,622 --> 00:59:58,438
Let me love you

1111
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:15,367
Oh, boy,
I'd hate to follow that act.

1112
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:17,986
The voice of an angel, that one.

1113
01:00:23,527 --> 01:00:26,563
I have just been notified
that contestant number seven...

1114
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:29,449
Lisa Swenson has dropped out
of the pageant.

1115
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:33,953
I know,
but these things happen...

1116
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:37,288
and we still have one more
contestant... number eight.

1117
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:38,498
Amber Atkins.

1118
01:02:09,453 --> 01:02:11,343
Thank you.

1119
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:25,583
Well...

1120
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,847
The time has finally come...

1121
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,481
where we say good-bye
to the judges...

1122
01:02:33,518 --> 01:02:37,380
so that they can go off and make
the toughest decision...

1123
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:38,568
of their lives.

1124
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:45,903
So, who gets the crown?

1125
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:47,081
How are you going
to figure this all out?

1126
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,575
Well, you know, we'll...

1127
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:52,136
compare scores
and figure out a winner...

1128
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:54,509
because, I mean, we don't know
who the winner is yet.

1129
01:02:54,544 --> 01:02:57,390
I mean, I have no idea
who Jean picked...

1130
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:58,918
or Harold.

1131
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:00,399
- No.
- No idea.

1132
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:04,464
I know who the winner is.

1133
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:06,187
I know who the winner...
Harold.

1134
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:07,884
I know who the winner is.

1135
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,264
That's it.

1136
01:03:09,296 --> 01:03:13,127
You shut your goddamn mouth,
you goddamn retard!

1137
01:03:13,169 --> 01:03:16,038
I've had your shit
for two weeks now!

1138
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:17,064
Come on.

1139
01:03:18,642 --> 01:03:20,911
Back off, college boy!
Now listen!

1140
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:25,394
Hank can't help it if he's born
crazier than a shit-house rat!

1141
01:03:25,425 --> 01:03:29,003
For fuck's sake, why didn't you
leave him with a sitter?

1142
01:03:33,714 --> 01:03:34,958
Nice, John.

1143
01:03:34,995 --> 01:03:36,172
That's real nice.

1144
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:38,928
You know the baby-sitter's dead.

1145
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:44,849
So...

1146
01:03:44,883 --> 01:03:46,739
Anyone talk to Jenelle lately?

1147
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,358
Oh, yeah. I brought her
some flowers this morning.

1148
01:03:49,394 --> 01:03:51,697
Yeah. She's in the room
next to my mom.

1149
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,770
Oh, she's super happy.

1150
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:54,987
She's happy?

1151
01:03:55,061 --> 01:03:57,198
Oh, the blow to her head
made her deaf.

1152
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,381
Oh, God.

1153
01:03:58,452 --> 01:04:00,395
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, that's great.

1154
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,256
She's so happy.

1155
01:04:03,763 --> 01:04:05,519
Jesus Christ!

1156
01:04:05,557 --> 01:04:08,372
What are they doing, letting
the retard count the votes?

1157
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:11,090
Ladies, it's time.

1158
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:31,955
Welcome back, everybody...

1159
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:33,038
and judges.

1160
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,053
Oh, gosh.

1161
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:37,874
We are so darn close
to that moment...

1162
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,399
we have all been waiting for.

1163
01:04:40,437 --> 01:04:43,155
And now, our second runner-up...

1164
01:04:43,191 --> 01:04:45,395
and winner
of a fifty-dollar scholarship...

1165
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,658
for the vo-tech
of her choice is...

1166
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:52,079
Leslie Miller.

1167
01:04:57,016 --> 01:04:58,511
You rule, Leslie!

1168
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,789
Envelope, please.

1169
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:19,021
Our next prize, a seventy-five-
dollar scholarship...

1170
01:05:19,064 --> 01:05:21,966
will be awarded
to the first runner-up.

1171
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:24,015
The first runner-up is...

1172
01:05:28,186 --> 01:05:29,909
Amber Atkins.

1173
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:58,706
And now, finally the moment...

1174
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,657
that I know
I've been waiting for.

1175
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:02,935
With a scholarship
of five hundred dollars...

1176
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:06,297
courtesy Leeman Furniture,
and an all-expense-paid trip...

1177
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:09,397
next weekend, when she will be
competing for the title...

1178
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:10,776
of Sarah Rose Cosmetics...

1179
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:13,627
Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

1180
01:06:19,836 --> 01:06:21,395
Our new...

1181
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:24,948
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess is...

1182
01:06:26,427 --> 01:06:28,085
contestant number...

1183
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,709
You know what?
It's my daughter...

1184
01:06:30,748 --> 01:06:33,138
Rebecca Ann Leeman!

1185
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:47,891
Oh, thank you so much.

1186
01:06:50,365 --> 01:06:52,187
Bitch.

1187
01:07:09,566 --> 01:07:11,639
Here she is

1188
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,084
Our Mount Rose

1189
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,486
American Teen Princess

1190
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,557
Look at her

1191
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,671
Doesn't she look fine?

1192
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:22,843
Our heart swells big

1193
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:25,180
As we look at her

1194
01:07:25,216 --> 01:07:26,361
Our Mount Rose

1195
01:07:26,398 --> 01:07:30,871
American Teen Princess

1196
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,438
One, two, three.

1197
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,327
- You got her there?
- Yeah, I got her.

1198
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,694
We was robbed. We was robbed.

1199
01:07:37,729 --> 01:07:39,964
It's OK. They're just
giving her a ride back.

1200
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:42,519
She almost blew out of Loretta's
pickup on the way over.

1201
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,999
Thank God for bungee cords.

1202
01:07:45,216 --> 01:07:47,159
I got second runner-up.

1203
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:48,541
I got second place.

1204
01:07:48,576 --> 01:07:50,299
- Third.
- Huh?

1205
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:51,961
- Third.
- Bye.

1206
01:07:57,954 --> 01:08:01,182
Are you disappointed
about not winning?

1207
01:08:01,215 --> 01:08:03,705
Yeah, well, no.

1208
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:08,733
At least I got to compete,
and my mom got to see me dance.

1209
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:11,159
I guess number eight
only worked for Diane Sawyer.

1210
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:12,607
Oh, stop.

1211
01:08:12,642 --> 01:08:13,689
Let's go home.

1212
01:08:13,762 --> 01:08:15,191
I'll let you drive.

1213
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:18,269
I hope it was worth it.

1214
01:08:18,305 --> 01:08:20,215
No, Dad, it was worth it.

1215
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,568
Amber should've won.

1216
01:08:21,603 --> 01:08:22,716
I tell you one thing...

1217
01:08:22,754 --> 01:08:24,217
Peter never would've pulled
a shenanigan like that.

1218
01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:26,428
Well, you know what, Dad?

1219
01:08:26,466 --> 01:08:28,375
You know what? Peter's gay.

1220
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:30,844
Gay!

1221
01:08:32,419 --> 01:08:33,531
What?

1222
01:08:35,043 --> 01:08:36,155
So, Becky, how does it feel?

1223
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,624
Oh, well...

1224
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:40,285
I mean,
it's all happening so fast.

1225
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,331
I'm so excited.

1226
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:44,988
I mean, I won.

1227
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,670
I'm the winner,
and I'm going to state.

1228
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,774
She's the winner,
and we're going to state.

1229
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:53,056
What a surprise.

1230
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,750
Gladys Leeman's finally
going to go to state...

1231
01:08:54,787 --> 01:08:56,194
and she'll probably
ride on Becky's ass...

1232
01:08:56,228 --> 01:08:57,787
all the way to nationals, too.

1233
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:59,738
Wonder how she's going
to fix that one.

1234
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:01,983
Are you ladies going
to the parade?

1235
01:09:02,021 --> 01:09:04,770
Nah. I think I'm, like,
due or something.

1236
01:09:23,588 --> 01:09:26,624
Beautiful as a whore's ass
today, huh, boys?

1237
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:31,200
Do you need help
with the cooler?

1238
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:53,628
See, Gladys had me get that
special-made from Mexico...

1239
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:54,848
in case Becky won.

1240
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:56,742
You know, I do a lot
of business down there...

1241
01:09:56,774 --> 01:09:58,683
always offer
to pay them off in tacos.

1242
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,501
Oh, they love that.

1243
01:10:01,544 --> 01:10:02,789
Keep on moving through.

1244
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,328
Let's get this straight
right now.

1245
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:08,961
We wouldn't have been
late at all if not for you.

1246
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:11,934
I want to have the big bag
of little doughnuts.

1247
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:13,055
You get nothing, Hank.

1248
01:10:13,096 --> 01:10:15,302
I want to eat a big bag
of little doughnuts.

1249
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,278
There's your paint can.

1250
01:10:17,322 --> 01:10:18,783
The next time you drink
window cleaner...

1251
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:20,964
I'm just going to
leave it in you.

1252
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,759
My pants are...

1253
01:10:42,377 --> 01:10:44,103
You rule!

1254
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,264
Rebecca Ann Leeman.

1255
01:10:59,307 --> 01:11:01,926
You are the one
that wanted this.

1256
01:11:01,964 --> 01:11:03,107
Now get up there.

1257
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:06,115
I don't care if you have to ride
this thing sidesaddle.

1258
01:11:06,156 --> 01:11:07,235
Get up there.

1259
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:09,696
It smells funny... like gasoline.

1260
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,292
Everything smells
like that in Mexico.

1261
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:14,054
My dress will reek, Mother.

1262
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:15,401
You listen to me now, missy.

1263
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,061
This thing cost your dad
a pretty penny...

1264
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:18,626
so you get your ass up there.

1265
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:21,350
And show me some teeth.

1266
01:11:21,389 --> 01:11:23,363
Love you, baby.

1267
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:35,305
You rule!

1268
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:38,500
Stop it!

1269
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:41,093
You are a bad kid!

1270
01:11:57,486 --> 01:11:58,947
You rule!

1271
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:04,807
If I die from these fumes...

1272
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:06,756
you'll make sure and cover up
the hickeys on my neck?

1273
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:11,816
And the bite marks on my ears.

1274
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,284
Yeah, sure.

1275
01:12:13,326 --> 01:12:17,068
And I know it won't show,
but on my inner thighs...

1276
01:12:17,103 --> 01:12:18,477
Yes, Leslie, OK.

1277
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:20,039
Help!

1278
01:12:30,193 --> 01:12:31,916
OK, I designed the float.

1279
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:38,249
And what's going to happen here
is that this is going to look...

1280
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:41,802
like a glistening lake
beneath the swan.

1281
01:12:42,929 --> 01:12:44,237
We need more bars.

1282
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:45,483
This is... What?

1283
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,665
Enid ate a whole pan.

1284
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:48,014
She can't do anything
by herself.

1285
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:51,562
This is exactly
how I pictured it...

1286
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,357
Choking on swan gas.

1287
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,511
Oh, great.

1288
01:13:05,522 --> 01:13:06,930
Oh, my God.

1289
01:13:09,936 --> 01:13:12,077
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

1290
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:13,193
Oh, my God.

1291
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:14,695
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

1292
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,769
Oh, my baby!

1293
01:13:30,837 --> 01:13:32,525
Oh, my God!

1294
01:13:32,597 --> 01:13:35,147
The swan ate my baby!

1295
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:40,426
Becky, baby, get up!

1296
01:13:40,468 --> 01:13:42,703
We got to go to state!

1297
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:47,020
Gladys, let her go.

1298
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:48,174
No. She's not getting up.

1299
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:50,701
We got to...
Get off of me, you cow!

1300
01:13:53,908 --> 01:13:56,658
What are you looking at, huh?

1301
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:59,279
A whole goddamned town
full of losers...

1302
01:13:59,316 --> 01:14:00,844
that's what I'm looking at!

1303
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:04,077
And you...

1304
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,376
You piece of shit trailer trash!

1305
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:10,065
That should've been you
in there!

1306
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:12,306
Damn it, I should've killed you
when I had a chance...

1307
01:14:12,342 --> 01:14:14,282
just like your little friend!

1308
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:18,637
Tammy was one crispy critter
up on that thresher!

1309
01:14:18,678 --> 01:14:21,197
Ding! Fries are up!

1310
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:23,701
Stop it! Stop it!

1311
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:31,407
Take it easy.

1312
01:14:31,446 --> 01:14:33,171
Let go of me!

1313
01:14:33,206 --> 01:14:34,548
Oh, my God, it's "Cops. "

1314
01:14:34,614 --> 01:14:36,045
He sells reproductions!

1315
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:38,965
His furniture's as fake
as my orgasms.

1316
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:40,406
Hey, how you doing?

1317
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,844
Hey. What's up, Scott?

1318
01:14:41,879 --> 01:14:43,439
You remember Bruce, right?

1319
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,847
Bruce, that's Roy.
Roy, Bruce.

1320
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:50,832
And that's why, dear Lord,
it's with such great sorrow...

1321
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,393
we turn over to you
this young woman...

1322
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:55,635
whose dream of riding
on a giant swan...

1323
01:14:55,673 --> 01:14:57,811
has brought about
her untimely death.

1324
01:14:57,849 --> 01:15:03,150
Maybe it's your way
of telling us to buy American.

1325
01:15:04,154 --> 01:15:05,364
That's right.

1326
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:08,888
As acting president...

1327
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,026
of the Mount Rose
Civil Servettes...

1328
01:15:11,096 --> 01:15:12,656
it is my duty...

1329
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:18,096
to make you Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

1330
01:15:20,184 --> 01:15:22,073
Turn around for the picture.

1331
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:23,055
You look good.

1332
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:28,630
What is wrong with you?

1333
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:29,745
I don't know.

1334
01:15:29,787 --> 01:15:31,281
I didn't wanna win like this.

1335
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:33,111
You stop right there.

1336
01:15:33,144 --> 01:15:34,552
You are a good person.

1337
01:15:34,586 --> 01:15:36,953
Good things happen
to good people.

1338
01:15:36,987 --> 01:15:38,066
Really?

1339
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:40,493
No, it's pure bullshit, sweetie.

1340
01:15:40,538 --> 01:15:43,190
You're lucky as hell,
so you might as well enjoy it.

1341
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:44,819
Let's get you a root-beer float.

1342
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,964
You guys want some shots?
I'm buying.

1343
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:51,249
I never liked her,
but she didn't deserve...

1344
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,658
to die in the belly
of a swan like that.

1345
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:58,330
The whole thing's just kinda
sad and lame at the same time.

1346
01:15:59,452 --> 01:16:01,339
This came for you, sweetie.

1347
01:16:01,372 --> 01:16:02,932
Hi, guys.

1348
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:04,695
It's from the state!

1349
01:16:04,733 --> 01:16:06,159
Yeah. Open it up.

1350
01:16:07,132 --> 01:16:09,499
It's all the stuff I get to do.

1351
01:16:10,493 --> 01:16:11,768
OK, let's see.

1352
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:16,251
We get a personal consultation
with a makeup artist.

1353
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:20,250
Oh, there'll be
a choreographer to the stars.

1354
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,692
- Choreographer.
- The stars.

1355
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:24,091
Oh, my God.

1356
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:25,847
No way. Oh, my God.

1357
01:16:25,885 --> 01:16:28,252
For Christ's sakes,
spit it out, Amber.

1358
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,133
We'll be staying overnight at...

1359
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:32,889
the Airport Howard Johnson!

1360
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:34,331
Right by the airport!

1361
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:35,446
Oh, Amber!

1362
01:16:35,484 --> 01:16:37,373
God, that's so great!

1363
01:16:38,846 --> 01:16:41,213
Oh, crap. I only got
four weeks to practice.

1364
01:16:41,244 --> 01:16:42,651
Let's go, let's go!
Right now!

1365
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:43,767
I'm gonna call your mom.

1366
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,478
All right, say, "airport hotel. "

1367
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:16,479
Airport hotel!

1368
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,399
Coffee and doughnuts.

1369
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:24,000
Yeah, why don't you
take a picture?

1370
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:24,959
It lasts longer.

1371
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:26,007
Loretta, don't do that.

1372
01:17:26,049 --> 01:17:27,358
All right. I'm sorry.
They're just staring.

1373
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:28,799
I gotta work with these girls.

1374
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:29,945
OK, I'm sorry.

1375
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,026
And you are...

1376
01:17:57,056 --> 01:17:59,424
Mount Rose
American Teen Princess.

1377
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,368
Funny, you don't look dead.

1378
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:06,944
- OK, ladies!
- Girls, come on.

1379
01:18:06,978 --> 01:18:09,498
Ladies, listen up.
I'm Colleen Douglas.

1380
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:12,704
And this raven beauty
on my right is Terry Macy.

1381
01:18:12,738 --> 01:18:13,850
Hi there.

1382
01:18:13,891 --> 01:18:16,380
And we're your Minnesota
American Teen Princess...

1383
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:17,628
state board.

1384
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:18,942
That's right.

1385
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:21,661
We're also the cofounders of
the Minnesota Modeling Academy.

1386
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,455
Yep. And you can get
your applications...

1387
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,898
over here at the tiki bar...

1388
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:26,817
and we will wave the
fifty-dollar application fee...

1389
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:29,218
if you list a friend
and put down her address.

1390
01:18:30,532 --> 01:18:31,777
So...

1391
01:18:31,811 --> 01:18:32,925
you're cute.

1392
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:35,202
Oh, I see you're married.

1393
01:18:35,235 --> 01:18:38,497
If you catch this in your mouth,
I'll give you a present.

1394
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,320
All right? Open wide.

1395
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:43,007
Oh, God, you got that
on the first try.

1396
01:18:43,045 --> 01:18:44,930
Come here.

1397
01:18:44,964 --> 01:18:46,720
Oh, you are cute.

1398
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:48,283
OK, due to budgetary
cutbacks...

1399
01:18:48,325 --> 01:18:49,732
And the fact...

1400
01:18:49,764 --> 01:18:51,653
that the national didn't
cough up a goddamn nickel...

1401
01:18:51,717 --> 01:18:53,440
You won't be staying overnight.

1402
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:55,002
So everybody pay attention.

1403
01:18:55,076 --> 01:18:57,696
You've got about eight hours
till showtime.

1404
01:18:57,732 --> 01:18:59,391
Remember to count, ladies.

1405
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,246
Cross on the left
and arms up on eight.

1406
01:19:02,277 --> 01:19:04,219
On the beat, on the beat,
on the beat!

1407
01:19:04,262 --> 01:19:06,650
Keep on. Keep moving it.

1408
01:19:06,694 --> 01:19:08,102
Come on, Miss Forest Lake...

1409
01:19:08,133 --> 01:19:09,858
take that stick out of your ass
or I will!

1410
01:19:09,894 --> 01:19:11,487
All right. Very nice.

1411
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:12,669
Now come on.

1412
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,204
Mom's out here in the front row.

1413
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:15,325
Come on. Sell it!

1414
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:17,154
That's very nice.

1415
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,435
Remember, figure eights, ladies.

1416
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:24,636
I can sum up our entire
philosophy with this glass.

1417
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,718
I can look at it and see...

1418
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,318
it's half full.

1419
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:30,945
Which in the beauty pageant biz
means...

1420
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:32,510
"Where the hell is my waiter?!"

1421
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,590
- Marco!
- Polo!

1422
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:37,665
Stop with the friggin' Marco
Polo, or I'll come over there...

1423
01:19:37,702 --> 01:19:39,196
and rip your
fat little heads off!

1424
01:19:48,104 --> 01:19:50,655
Miss Burnsville,
you're up next.

1425
01:19:55,978 --> 01:19:58,345
I have a little
secret weapon of my own.

1426
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:00,416
Don't tell anyone.

1427
01:20:12,713 --> 01:20:14,601
Oh, I don't eat shellfish.

1428
01:20:14,634 --> 01:20:16,259
Ma always says,
"Don't eat anything...

1429
01:20:16,298 --> 01:20:17,702
"that can carry its house
around with it.

1430
01:20:17,737 --> 01:20:19,646
"Who knows the last time
it's been cleaned?"

1431
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,576
I've done
about thirty-five pageants.

1432
01:20:22,603 --> 01:20:24,261
I guess my most memorable one...

1433
01:20:24,297 --> 01:20:26,664
would have to be
Miss Teen America 1995...

1434
01:20:26,729 --> 01:20:28,136
'cause it was in Vegas.

1435
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,689
And my roommate did Adam West.

1436
01:20:30,761 --> 01:20:33,895
She said he was so horny.

1437
01:20:45,738 --> 01:20:46,917
Oh, my God.

1438
01:21:03,595 --> 01:21:05,898
I should just go home now.

1439
01:21:06,957 --> 01:21:08,364
OK, real good.

1440
01:21:08,394 --> 01:21:09,802
One suggestion, sweetie.

1441
01:21:09,837 --> 01:21:12,357
Why don't you hike up your skirt
a little bit then, OK?

1442
01:21:13,357 --> 01:21:14,469
Next!

1443
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:18,445
Oh, my God.

1444
01:21:18,476 --> 01:21:19,884
I gotta go!

1445
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,285
You better do something
about those nerves, sweetie.

1446
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:23,723
Thirty million people
aren't gonna wait for you...

1447
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:25,164
while you run to the john.

1448
01:21:25,196 --> 01:21:26,603
That's true.

1449
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,986
Will somebody
get a mop and a bucket?

1450
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:34,022
Today, a beauty pageant
turned ugly.

1451
01:21:37,006 --> 01:21:38,316
Did I win?

1452
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:39,943
Honey, if I was a good lover...

1453
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:41,923
Oh, for crap sake.

1454
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:43,374
A salmonella dysentery
outbreak...

1455
01:21:43,404 --> 01:21:45,958
now traced to improperly
refrigerated shellfish...

1456
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:48,454
was believed to be the cause.

1457
01:21:54,064 --> 01:21:56,649
Oh, my God.
Do you think they heard us?

1458
01:21:56,688 --> 01:22:00,104
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Call an ambulance!

1459
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:01,223
An ambulance?

1460
01:22:01,262 --> 01:22:02,987
Call a priest,
for Christ's sake!

1461
01:22:04,334 --> 01:22:06,341
Joining us now
is David Richardson...

1462
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:09,711
a member of a documentary crew
filming the pageant.

1463
01:22:09,775 --> 01:22:12,295
He was there
when tragedy struck.

1464
01:22:13,456 --> 01:22:16,457
Fuckin' beauty queens
blowin' chunks everywhere.

1465
01:22:16,495 --> 01:22:20,142
I've never seen anything
like it before, and...

1466
01:22:20,175 --> 01:22:21,420
I live in L.A.

1467
01:22:21,456 --> 01:22:22,732
Oh, hey, Ed.

1468
01:22:23,695 --> 01:22:25,103
That's our sound guy.

1469
01:22:25,138 --> 01:22:27,024
Could you tell us anything
about the controversy?

1470
01:22:27,058 --> 01:22:28,465
Is there a controversy here?

1471
01:22:28,495 --> 01:22:29,805
Has there been sabotage?

1472
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:30,735
Wait a minute.

1473
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:32,657
While we haven't
ruled out sabotage...

1474
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:34,281
from neighboring
state pageants...

1475
01:22:34,322 --> 01:22:35,915
Iowa, Wisconsin, South Dakota.

1476
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:37,195
Yeah, that's right.

1477
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:39,153
Ohio.

1478
01:22:39,185 --> 01:22:40,114
That bitch from Wisconsin.

1479
01:22:40,145 --> 01:22:41,093
All right then.

1480
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,242
The important thing
is we have a winner!

1481
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,395
- Yes, we do.
- OK.

1482
01:22:44,433 --> 01:22:46,604
The Minnesota Modeling Academy
is proud to present...

1483
01:22:46,641 --> 01:22:48,364
Along with Sarah Rose
Cosmetics...

1484
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:49,483
Amber Atkins...

1485
01:22:51,026 --> 01:22:53,808
The new Minnesota
American Teen Princess!

1486
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:54,955
That's Amber Atkins.

1487
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:56,882
That's right.
From Mount Rose.

1488
01:22:56,915 --> 01:22:59,697
Amber, how do you feel?

1489
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:01,136
Well, I...

1490
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,405
I feel like I need
to take a shower.

1491
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:06,288
Honey, is this the best day
of your life?

1492
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:09,191
Yeah. I wish
my mom was here, though.

1493
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,643
Wave hi to her.

1494
01:23:10,673 --> 01:23:12,081
Hi, Mom.

1495
01:23:12,147 --> 01:23:13,554
Hey, you hear that?

1496
01:23:13,587 --> 01:23:14,995
Hi, monkey.

1497
01:23:15,027 --> 01:23:16,751
I got some.

1498
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:21,075
Uh-huh. No, no. Gosh, no.

1499
01:23:21,107 --> 01:23:23,277
You know, I still don't
want to be on camera.

1500
01:23:23,315 --> 01:23:25,519
I just wanna say...

1501
01:23:25,554 --> 01:23:27,793
that little bitch
better watch her back...

1502
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:29,390
at the nationals...

1503
01:23:29,427 --> 01:23:31,795
'cause I am making friends
on the inside.

1504
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:33,867
Yeah. Darn good friends.

1505
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,950
Friends who have friends
on the outside.

1506
01:23:35,988 --> 01:23:38,062
Get your sweet ass
off the phone, Cinnamon.

1507
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,212
Gotta go.

1508
01:23:40,469 --> 01:23:41,395
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:42,836
I just can't believe it.

1510
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,626
I'm Minnesota's
American Teen Princess.

1511
01:23:44,661 --> 01:23:46,549
Our baby's going to nationals.

1512
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:48,436
Lincoln, Alabama, look out!

1513
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,078
I'm gonna be on TV
just like Diane Sawyer.

1514
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:57,588
Annette, just use your hand.

1515
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,149
They told me to practice.

1516
01:24:11,894 --> 01:24:13,325
I did it.

1517
01:24:13,398 --> 01:24:14,860
OK. Ready?

1518
01:24:14,934 --> 01:24:17,783
Here's the signal I'm gonna give
Mom when I'm on TV.

1519
01:24:19,574 --> 01:24:21,911
My little Carol Burnett.

1520
01:24:21,942 --> 01:24:23,349
Here she is...

1521
01:24:23,383 --> 01:24:25,554
Minnesota's
American Teen Princess...

1522
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:26,997
and soon to be...

1523
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:30,380
the next America's
American Teen Princess...

1524
01:24:30,422 --> 01:24:32,178
our little Amber.

1525
01:24:53,401 --> 01:24:55,605
So after Frank
dusts the crops...

1526
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,489
he's taking her
to Lincoln, Alabama.

1527
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,503
Come on out...

1528
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:20,919
you little blond piece
of trailer-park trash!

1529
01:27:26,112 --> 01:27:29,079
We're here in the sixth hour
of a shootout between...

1530
01:27:35,074 --> 01:27:36,481
This is Amber Atkins...

1531
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:39,677
reporting live from
the Food Shack for KRLH News.

1532
01:27:39,714 --> 01:27:41,601
One of our reporters
has just been shot.

1533
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:44,503
Paramedics are working on her
right now...

1534
01:27:47,713 --> 01:27:49,242
I'm Peter Atchison.

1535
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:50,688
And I'm Amber Atkins.

1536
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:52,793
For WAZB News, good night.
