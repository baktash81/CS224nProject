1
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:06,167
That's right.
Come on. No, don't stop.

2
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:12,779
Keep looking!

3
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,242
You don't feel so good now, do you?

4
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:20,313
See, you let it out. Out!

5
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,392
I feel like an idiot.

6
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:34,087
Not so fast, not so fast. Slower.

7
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:34,774
Slower.

8
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,198
Good, good.

9
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:41,200
Keep it specific.

10
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,636
Still a little tension in the mouth.

11
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,314
Good, good.

12
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:48,229
Okay, make her work peripherally.

13
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,192
Michael...

14
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,256
...Dorsey, is it?

15
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,284
Yes, that's right.

16
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:02,591
Mr. Dorsey, would you turn
to page 23, please?

17
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,285
Yes, I believe you mean
the first scene...

18
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:08,096
Sorry, the second scene
of the first act.

19
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:11,884
Second scene of the first act. Right.
Begin when you're ready.

20
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,082
Yes, of course.

21
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:22,893
Oh, sweetheart, do you know what
it was like waking up in Paris...

22
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,653
...seeing the empty pillow where...

23
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:30,618
Wait! Cover your breasts. Kevin is
downstairs! My God, what are you?

24
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:34,359
I'm a woman. Not Felicia's mother.
Not Kevin's wife.

25
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:37,969
Thanks very much.
We need someone a little older.

26
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,127
Mom! Dad! Uncle Pete, come quick!

27
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:45,652
Something's wrong with Biscuit!
I think he's dead!

28
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,939
We're looking for someone younger.

29
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,330
"They have dinner..." Can I start again?
I didn't get kicked off right.

30
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,421
The reading was fine.
You're the wrong height.

31
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,099
I can be taller.

32
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,623
No. We're looking
for somebody shorter.

33
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,235
Look. I don't have to be this tall.

34
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:06,373
See, I'm wearing lifts.
I can be shorter.

35
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,959
I know, but we're looking
for somebody different.

36
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,876
I can be different.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,834
We're looking for somebody else.

38
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,943
What do you care more
about than working?

39
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:20,491
The part's the most important thing.
But love sometimes is too.

40
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:24,585
With improvisation, you're the writer.
When somebody writes a play...

41
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:28,584
...they decide where the highs are,
where the lows are. Now you do it.

42
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,850
And you may not be high where
they're high in the writing.

43
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,027
You may not be low where they're low.

44
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:38,183
You may be high on "but."
You may be high on "and."

45
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,423
Of course, they were doing it
for dough...

46
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,318
...the same as everybody
does it for dough.

47
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,642
But the question is in
the last analysis.

48
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,431
What were they doing for dough?

49
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:52,566
You and me were advancing our
little non-Prussian careers.

50
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:57,086
So when all hell broke loose,
and the Germans ran out of soap...

51
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:01,900
...and figured, "What the hell?
Let's cook up Mrs. Greenwald!"...

52
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,015
...who the hell do you
think stopped them?

53
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,432
Pardon me, is my acting
interfering with your talking?

54
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:16,133
Don't play a part that's not in you.

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,918
Don't say "he" or "she" like you did
last week when you were doing Kitty.

56
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,402
When you were doing
Time Of Your Life.

57
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,840
If you can't make the part yourself,
you can't play it.

58
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,777
Sergeant.

59
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:29,469
Quick! Get a priest!

60
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,434
No, sergeant, no priest.

61
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,848
- But you're dying, Count Tolstoy.
- I know.

62
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,741
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost...

63
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,131
...I commit your soul to God.

64
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:43,226
- My friends...
- That's super, Michael.

65
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:48,338
But I wonder if you could move center
stage on that speech, and then die.

66
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:51,383
Why?

67
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,951
The left side of the house
can't see you.

68
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:02,414
You want me to stand up and walk
to the center of the stage...

69
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:04,178
...while I'm dying?

70
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,464
I know it's awkward,
but we'll just have to do it.

71
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,667
- Why?
- I just told you. Now do it!

72
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:13,166
Because you say so?

73
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,188
Yes, love.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,124
Not with me as Tolstoy.

75
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,606
You gotta work.

76
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:23,523
There's no excuse for not working.

77
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,809
There's no excuse.
There's unemployment.

78
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:29,484
There was unemployment when
my friends and I started acting.

79
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,770
And it's not changed.

80
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,078
You got 90-95% unemployment.
It's never going to change.

81
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,235
You're an actor.
You're in New York.

82
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:40,955
There is no work.
But you gotta find ways to work.

83
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,357
Two tortellinis,
a gazpacho with two salads.

84
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:48,482
Ordering: Veal chop, medium,
two scrods, an order of chicken!

85
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,181
One scrod underdone.

86
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,614
- What's the rest?
- Baked potato.

87
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,466
- How'd it go?
- Terrible.

88
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:57,447
- Did you rewrite the last scene?
- I did the necktie scene.

89
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,578
How is it?

90
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,343
It'll change theatre as we know it.

91
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,933
We'll work on it
when we get home tonight.

92
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,174
That's my flounder.

93
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,631
- That is my flounder.
- Robber!

94
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,153
- Ordering: One flounder...
- That's for the customer!

95
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:14,677
I eat these things so if the
customers ask if I eat his food...

96
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,617
...I can say, "Yeah, I eat his food."

97
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:22,035
You rewrote the necktie scene? Good.

98
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:24,623
- Without the necktie?
- With the necktie.

99
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,886
- With the necktie?
- Yeah, with the necktie.

100
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,499
The necktie's wrong. You take the
necktie out, you got something.

101
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:34,636
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

102
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:37,877
What's wrong is it's depressing
to be disagreed with.

103
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,378
It's depression.

104
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,468
Today's your birthday,
and you haven't mentioned it.

105
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,585
Don't start. I'm a character actor.
Age has no effect on me.

106
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:51,041
- That's very good.
- How does one not be depressed?

107
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:55,527
Instead of trying to be Michael Dorsey,
the great actor or the great waiter...

108
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:57,723
...why not just try to be
Michael Dorsey?

109
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:00,442
I am Michael Dorsey.
What's the payoff?

110
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:04,814
- Say it like you mean it.
- I am Michael Dorsey. Fine. Okay?

111
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,100
Surprise!

112
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,807
Speech! Speech! Speech!

113
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:19,027
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute.

114
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,071
First a toast.

115
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:24,597
To Michael Dorsey, who makes you
remember what acting's all about!

116
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,210
Being unemployed!

117
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,469
To Michael...

118
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:32,321
...who's been my friend for six years.

119
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,672
Was it that long?

120
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,738
And who is my coach.
And he's just great.

121
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:40,482
He's a great coach, a great actor.
He's a great guy and...

122
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,113
This is a really dumb speech.
Let's get drunk.

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,073
Happy birthday!

124
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,623
- How you doing? Michael.
- Patty.

125
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:14,272
You an actress? Terrific face.
Nice blouse. Who'd you come with?

126
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,277
I don't want a full house
at the Winter Garden Theatre.

127
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:23,025
I want 90 people who just came out
of the worst rainstorm in history.

128
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,091
These are people who are alive
on the planet...

129
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,724
...until they dry off.

130
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:33,466
I wish I had a theatre that
was only open when it rained.

131
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,123
Strasberg said you create
your opportunities.

132
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,669
- Uta said that.
- I don't care.

133
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:46,112
The point is, Sandy and I are raising
$8,000 to do Jeff's play in Syracuse.

134
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:49,160
We're going to do it.
You could do the same.

135
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,918
Look at Emily!
Look who's here.

136
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,489
You can do it in the Poconos.

137
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:58,577
You're sitting around saying,
"I can't work." Create your own...

138
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,972
Isn't she cute?

139
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:02,605
He loves children.
He really does.

140
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,541
You make it!
You find a way to raise it.

141
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:09,373
I was looking at you.
Terrific face. Are you an actress?

142
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,898
- Sometimes.
- You were in Dames At Sea!

143
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:14,312
- You saw that?
- Good work. Really!

144
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,814
You have a great singing voice.

145
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,143
I felt there was an aura
between us when I saw it.

146
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,188
I'm not kidding.
I don't know you, but I know you.

147
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:25,887
I'll tell you about yourself.
You like to run barefoot on the beach.

148
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:29,891
- Why are you so wired?
- It's my birthday. I'm out of work.

149
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:31,678
That's it? Nothing more?

150
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:36,004
Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one
to take your coat tonight. We'll talk.

151
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:37,599
Fine. All right.

152
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,964
Will you? Serious?

153
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,383
Give me a hug.

154
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,474
Thank you for liking me.

155
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,229
I don't like it when people say...

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,014
..."I really dug your message, man."

157
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,866
Or, "I really dug your play, man.
I cried."

158
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,482
You know?

159
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,528
I like it when people come up to me...

160
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:57,988
...the next day...

161
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,598
...or a week later and they say...

162
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,379
..."I saw your play.

163
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,299
What happened?"

164
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:09,189
I've got it under control. I'll feed
my cats and be back in an hour.

165
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:12,457
I can't make it. My roommate
wants to work on the third act.

166
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,650
- You can't make it?
- He wants to work.

167
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:18,132
- Give me your phone number.
- I already did.

168
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,155
- I thought you changed it.
- Since an hour ago?

169
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,748
Good point.
Let me talk to him. I'll call you.

170
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,427
- Didn't anybody hear me?
- Guess not.

171
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,796
I've been trapped for half an hour.

172
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,499
What kind of a party is this?

173
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,243
God, you guys are having
a good time, huh?

174
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:37,482
Sorry.

175
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:41,742
I'll remember that if I ever
do a scene where I'm trapped.

176
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,333
- It's nice, Michael.
- Thanks.

177
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,321
Who is that?

178
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,230
- Mallory. She's married to John.
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:10:56,325 --> 00:11:00,716
I did a thing about suicides
of the American Indian.

180
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,043
And nobody cared. Nobody showed.

181
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:08,507
And I think the American Indian
is as American...

182
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,011
...as John and Ethel Barrymore...

183
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,384
...and Donny and Marie Osmond.

184
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:15,382
I think it's really sad...

185
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:18,753
...but I think that, nowadays,
when people dream...

186
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,371
...they don't even dream in their
own country anymore.

187
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,289
And that's sick.

188
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,919
I had a good time.
I just didn't know half the people.

189
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,531
It was late, and I wanted it
to be a surprise.

190
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,337
I invited 10 people.
They all invited 10 people.

191
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,928
You met 40 new people.
They all liked you.

192
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,078
I heard nice things about you.

193
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:38,682
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Good night.

194
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,760
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

195
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,127
- One of the five people I knew.
- Great party.

196
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,587
Thank you.

197
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,113
Excuse me, Miss Right?
Miss Right?

198
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,303
Good night.
It was a wonderful party.

199
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,283
My date left with someone else.
I had fun. Do you have any Seconal?

200
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,177
Come on, I'll take you home.

201
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,699
I did have a good time.
I really did.

202
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,421
You didn't.
Wait. Money for cab fare.

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,008
That's okay. It's cheaper to
get mugged. Let's walk.

204
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,707
The fares are really
insane now anyway.

205
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:23,035
- Why didn't you have a good time?
- I did have a good time.

206
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,192
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

207
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,889
What?

208
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,979
- What?
- Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

209
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,002
I just cry like this, like a tic.

210
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,243
Tell me what's wrong,
or I'll kill you.

211
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,552
Nothing's wrong, Michael.
I'm really very up.

212
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,272
You're worried about your audition.
Why?

213
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,516
- Because I'm not going to get it.
- Why not?

214
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,972
- Because I'm completely wrong for it.
- What kind of a part is it?

215
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,496
A woman!

216
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,200
You don't have a man,
so you act like one.

217
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,921
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm proud of being a woman.

218
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,830
Wait a minute.
This guy treats you like dirt...

219
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,899
...because he's a big doctor, right?

220
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,428
But don't take that.
Talk to him on his level.

221
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:06,946
Show me.

222
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,281
You're doing a Southern accent?

223
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,325
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm very proud of being a woman!

224
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,566
I can't do it as good as you.

225
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,351
You can! Just turn the tables
on him. Come on, now.

226
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,312
You're wrong.
I'm proud of being a woman.

227
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,428
Where am I off?

228
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:26,294
- I don't know what you're playing.
- I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.

229
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,929
You told me to turn the tables.
I'm playing rage.

230
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:30,755
This is rage?

231
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,085
I have a problem with anger.

232
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:37,437
You do. But there's 100 other
actresses reading...

233
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,914
...who don't, who aren't
afraid of working.

234
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,503
Who aren't afraid to stick
everything on the line and do it!

235
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:45,114
- Don't get mad!
- Stop being a doormat!

236
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,007
- I'm not a doormat!
- Act right now! Do it!

237
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,119
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...

238
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:51,411
Go on.

239
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,756
- You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...
- Must I hit you with a stick?

240
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:57,606
You're wrong.
I am very proud to be a woman.

241
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,174
And I'm proud of this hospital.

242
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,893
And before I see it destroyed
by your petty tyrannies...

243
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:03,351
Have the anger. Don't show it to me.

244
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,314
...I'll recommend you be
thrown out into the street.

245
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,294
- Don't lose it.
- Good day.

246
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,553
- Don't whine like you're second-rate.
- I said good day!

247
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:13,933
Not bad.

248
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,800
Did you feel how much I hated you?

249
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:18,494
- You really felt it?
- That's why I'm going.

250
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:22,546
How can I get it back tomorrow?
How can a total stranger enrage me?

251
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:25,111
I'll pick you up at 10:00
and enrage you.

252
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,965
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.

253
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:36,295
- Bennett?
- Right here.

254
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:37,671
Stanz?

255
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,261
I'm supposed to look like this?

256
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,373
- That is what you look like.
- It's not funny.

257
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:47,853
Good.
Don't lose that.

258
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:51,138
No sequins, Alfred.
She's attending her husband's funeral.

259
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:54,641
Jacqui? As soon as Ron gets here, in.

260
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,055
Lester.

261
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,881
Lester. Sandy Lester?

262
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,495
Yes, here.

263
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,345
Stop it!

264
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,325
Bye-bye. Good morning, ladies.

265
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:09,220
Please bring your résumés
and follow me.

266
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,353
Wish me luck.

267
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,264
- Fuck you.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,268
- Go.
- God bless you.

269
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:19,381
Here you'll recognize your favorite
characters from Southwest General...

270
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:23,363
...including John Van Horn,
who has played Dr. Medford Brewster...

271
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,103
...since the first episode aired
20 years ago.

272
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,327
Now we'll head into Studio B,
where the episodes are actually taped.

273
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,634
Andrew Donovan,
report to Wardrobe, please.

274
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,054
I didn't get it.

275
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:40,096
- What?
- They wouldn't let me read.

276
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:44,771
- They wouldn't let you read?
- They said I wasn't right physically.

277
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,842
They want somebody tougher.
So I'm going home.

278
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:48,933
I'll walk you.

279
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:49,938
To San Diego?

280
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:53,305
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going home!

281
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,742
I hate it here!

282
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:58,241
God! I'm 34!
I paid $24 for these glasses.

283
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:01,006
All I do is buy things...
I want to be a waitress.

284
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:04,337
I wasn't gonna resort to this,
but you're gonna read.

285
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,520
Excuse me, is Terry Bishop here?

286
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,368
No, Mr. Bishop is rehearsing
The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.

287
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:11,453
He's what?

288
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:15,127
He's rehearsing The Iceman Cometh
for Broadway.

289
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,915
That was my part.
I was supposed to be up...

290
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:21,855
I got to see somebody.
Don't do anything rash.

291
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:23,641
Will he be back?

292
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,165
- Is George Fields in?
- Yes, he is.

293
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:51,036
Now, wait a minute.
You can't just go in there!

294
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,916
Michael, he's tied up right now.
I swear!

295
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,633
Hang on. Will you wait outside?
I'm talking to the Coast.

296
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:08,683
This is a coast.
New York is a coast too.

297
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,106
Oh, boy.

298
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:11,798
Sy, are you...

299
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:14,495
God... Look what you...
Margaret?

300
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:16,605
Get him back.
I cut myself off.

301
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,869
What is it, Michael?

302
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:22,693
Terry Bishop's doing Iceman.
You promised to send me up for that.

303
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:26,262
You told me I'd get a reading for that.
Aren't you my agent?

304
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,095
- Stuart Pressman wants a name.
- Terry Bishop is a name?

305
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,163
Michael Dorsey is a name,
when you want to send a steak back.

306
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:36,619
Wait, wait, wait!
You always do this to me.

307
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,322
It was a rotten thing to say.
Let me start again.

308
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:42,844
Terry Bishop is on a soap.
Millions watch him every day.

309
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:47,086
That qualifies him to ruin Iceman?
I can act circles around him.

310
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:51,787
- I played that part in Minneapolis.
- lf he wants a name, that's his affair.

311
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:55,008
People are in this business
to make money.

312
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:57,706
- I'm in it to make money too.
- Really?

313
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:01,254
The Harlem Theatre for the Blind?
The People's Workshop at Syracuse?

314
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:03,800
Wait a minute.
I did nine plays up at Syracuse.

315
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:07,760
I got great reviews from the critics.
Not that that's why I did it.

316
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,721
God forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure.

317
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,767
You think I'm a failure?

318
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,726
I will not get sucked
into this conversation.

319
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,033
I will not.

320
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:21,164
I sent you my roommate's play to read.
It had a great part in it for me.

321
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:24,643
Where do you come off sending me
a play for you to star in?

322
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,931
I'm not your mother.
I don't find plays for you to star in.

323
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:30,174
I field offers.
That's what I do.

324
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,090
Who told you that?
The agent fairy?

325
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:35,200
I could be terrific in that part.

326
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,485
- Nobody's going to do that play.
- Why?

327
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:41,032
It's a downer about a couple
that move back to Love Canal.

328
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:42,140
But that actually happened.

329
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,060
Nobody wants to watch people
living next to chemical waste!

330
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,754
They can see that in Jersey.

331
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,279
I don't want to argue about it.
I'll raise $8,000 and produce his play.

332
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,286
Send me up for anything.
I don't care.

333
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,920
I'll do dog commercials.
I'll do radio voice-overs.

334
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,202
- I can't put you up for that.
- Why not?

335
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,904
Because no one will hire you.

336
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:05,684
I bust my ass to get a part right!

337
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,187
And you bust everybody else's ass too!

338
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,320
Who wants to argue about
whether Tolstoy can...

339
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,345
...walk when he's dying
or walk when he's talking..?

340
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,331
That was two years ago,
and that guy's an idiot!

341
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,721
They can't all be idiots.
You argue with everybody!

342
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,246
You've got one of the worst
reputations in this town.

343
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,994
Nobody will hire you.

344
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:31,122
Are you saying that nobody
in New York will work with me?

345
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:35,494
Nobody in Hollywood will either.
I can't even get you a commercial.

346
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:40,087
You played a tomato, and they went over
schedule because you wouldn't sit.

347
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:41,728
Yes, it wasn't logical.

348
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:45,575
You were a tomato! A tomato
doesn't have logic. It can't move!

349
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,836
So if he can't move,
how's he going to sit down?

350
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:52,342
I was a stand-up tomato.
A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!

351
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,843
Nobody does vegetables like me!
I did vegetables off-Broadway!

352
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,803
I did the best tomato,
the best cucumber!

353
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:02,044
I did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass!

354
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,092
I'm trying to stay calm here.

355
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,789
You are a wonderful actor.

356
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:08,641
Thank you.

357
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:12,099
But you're too much trouble.

358
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:13,972
Get some therapy.

359
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,344
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise
$8,000 to do Jeff's play.

360
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,759
Michael, you're not
gonna raise 25 cents.

361
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,808
No one will hire you.

362
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,462
Oh, yeah?

363
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,358
Dorothy Michaels?

364
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,686
- Yes.
- George Fields is your agent?

365
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,562
- Yes.
- Okay, ladies.

366
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:04,216
Please bring your pages
and follow me.

367
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:11,043
I hate this line,
"You have every right to happiness."

368
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:13,893
This is Dorothy Michaels.
Our director, Ron Carlysle.

369
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:18,397
That's our producer, Rita Marshall.
George Fields is Dorothy's agent.

370
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:19,926
That's impressive.

371
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:26,668
I'm afraid you're not right for
this role. Thanks for coming by.

372
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:29,111
Page 205, you want camera one or two?

373
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:32,658
- Camera two, and tell Art.
- Why am I not right?

374
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:35,417
I'm trying to make
a certain statement...

375
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:39,029
...and I'm looking for
a specific physical type.

376
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:44,381
Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.
I can play it any way you want.

377
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,864
I'm sure you're a very good actress.

378
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,822
It's just that you're not
threatening enough.

379
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,042
Not threatening enough?

380
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:54,630
Take your hands off me or
I'll knee you in the balls!

381
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,397
- Is that enough of a threat?
- It's a start.

382
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,463
I think I know what you want.
You want a caricature of a woman.

383
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:05,229
To prove some point like
power makes a woman masculine...

384
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:07,081
...or masculine women are ugly.

385
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:10,824
Well, shame on any woman
that lets you do that.

386
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:12,890
And that means you, Miss Marshall.

387
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:16,523
Shame on you, you macho shithead.

388
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,655
Jesus!

389
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:24,140
What is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine?

390
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:28,077
Not that that was my point.

391
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,582
Miss Michaels, just a minute.

392
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,892
Was that for real
or were you auditioning?

393
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:39,828
Which answer will get me
a reading, Miss Marshall?

394
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,853
Well, good for you.

395
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,052
Come.

396
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,121
- Miss Michaels.
- Yes. Oh, thank you.

397
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:52,773
You really think she's worth testing?

398
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:57,493
She told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast.

399
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:58,932
She said that?

400
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,525
I like her...

401
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,028
...accent.

402
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,715
- I gotta get these back in order.
- They won't know the difference.

403
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,873
I'm a little nervous.

404
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:28,461
Just think of them
as something friendly.

405
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:30,462
Like a firing squad.

406
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,819
Miss Michaels, we're going to
do a camera test now.

407
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:43,474
Let me have a right profile, camera 1.
Camera 3, a left profile.

408
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,349
What side?

409
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,851
Left side.

410
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:47,764
Which way for your left?

411
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:50,789
- What?
- Is that my left or your left?

412
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,726
Wait. What are you talking about?
My left.

413
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:55,495
Your left.

414
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:58,229
Miss Michaels, nobody's talking to you.

415
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:00,494
I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted my profile.

416
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:03,823
- Not so close on camera 3.
- Camera 3, back off.

417
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:07,912
Make her look a little more attractive.
How far can you pull back?

418
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,960
- How do you feel about Cleveland?
- Knock it off.

419
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,788
That's good right there, Herbie.

420
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:15,726
Dorothy, honey, we're going
to try one. Okay?

421
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:19,138
Let me see exactly
what you showed us a while ago.

422
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:20,559
Cue her, Jo.

423
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,904
"I know the kind of woman
you are, Emily.

424
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:29,086
You're getting older. You don't have
a man, so you want to act like one."

425
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:32,933
Shut your mouth right now. When you
talk to me, talk professionally.

426
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,263
You don't get personal.
That is inappropriate behavior.

427
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,796
I'm proud of being a woman,
Dr. Brewster.

428
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,513
I'm proud of this hospital,
and you should be too.

429
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:47,992
And I must tell you, before I let it
be destroyed by your petty tyrannies...

430
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,977
...by your callous inhumanities, sir...

431
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:54,956
...I'm going to recommend
you be turned out into the street.

432
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:58,853
Good day, Dr. Brewster.

433
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,965
I said good day, sir.

434
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:10,299
Thank you.
Hold it a minute.

435
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:11,932
Tough cookie.

436
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,676
I gave her that direction.

437
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:15,455
Something more, though.

438
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:20,697
I don't know. It's your decision,
but something about her bothers me.

439
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:22,332
I like it.

440
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,379
We'll send the contracts to George.

441
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:36,778
Excuse me. Could you help me?
I'm looking for the Russian Tea Room.

442
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:40,807
This is the Russian Tea Room.
You're in front of it.

443
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,875
Oh, well, my stars! So it is.

444
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:45,182
Well, this is very embarrassing.

445
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,684
Yeah, well, this is it.

446
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,534
Thanks very much.

447
00:25:56,106 --> 00:26:00,150
Good afternoon, Mr. Fields.
Nice to see you. Please sit down.

448
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:05,811
- The waiter will be just a minute.
- George, how are you?

449
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,375
Hey, Ronnie. How are you?

450
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,775
- Hi.
- Wait a minute...

451
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:21,131
I'm new in town, and I'm lonely.
Would you buy me lunch?

452
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:24,195
You can't come...
Gregory, this woman...

453
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,436
Don't. It's okay.

454
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:29,330
George. George. George.
It's Michael Dorsey, okay?

455
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:34,162
Your favorite client. How are you?
Last job you got me was a tomato.

456
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,039
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Yeah.

457
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,710
- Swear to God.
- Michael?

458
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,495
Oh, God! I begged you to get therapy.

459
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:46,303
- You also said no one would hire me.
- And this'll make a difference?

460
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:48,045
I got a soap.

461
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:51,546
I'm the new woman administrator on
Southwest General.

462
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:54,833
Congratulate me! They thought
I almost looked too feminine.

463
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:59,251
- Something from the bar?
- A double vodka right away, please.

464
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:00,558
For the lady?

465
00:27:01,211 --> 00:27:03,690
How about a Dubonnet with a twist?

466
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,670
- Thank you. Lovely blouse.
- Thank you.

467
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,608
- Welcome.
- You won't get away with this.

468
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,721
- I got away with it. Look around.
- I don't believe this.

469
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,223
I mean, I just don't
believe anybody else will.

470
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:17,270
- You want to bet?
- Don't sit...

471
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:21,317
- You know Joel Spector.
- Hello, Joel. How are you?

472
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,691
I talked to Stuart yesterday.

473
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:28,867
He'll be one more week in London.
Then he definitely...

474
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,242
- I missed you!
- Then he definitely...

475
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:36,197
You're such a tickly-wickly. You
never were before. We go back years.

476
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,091
- We haven't been introduced.
- Joel Spector.

477
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,855
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Weintraub.

478
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,643
- Sorry. This is Michael...
- Dorothy Michaels. Nice to meet you.

479
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,626
May I say that you are
the best director...

480
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:49,650
- Producer.
- Sorry. Producer...

481
00:27:49,674 --> 00:27:51,459
...on the Broadway scene today.

482
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,759
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Michaels.

483
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,985
- Hope to see you again.
- Let's have lunch.

484
00:27:58,183 --> 00:27:59,661
- Fine.
- Call you.

485
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,075
He's handsome.
You should represent him.

486
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:04,493
- You are psychotic!
- No, I'm employed.

487
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:06,776
- I got the whole world...
- Don't!

488
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:10,409
- I won't make fun of you.
- Don't get close to me!

489
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:13,173
- Loan me $1000 till payday.
- For what?

490
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:17,153
For what? I gotta have something
to wear besides this.

491
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,932
I won't let you not buy it.
It's the best dress you've had on.

492
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,046
I think it makes me look dumpy.

493
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:43,132
Because you're wearing ankle straps.
With a few alterations...

494
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,182
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

495
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,357
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:51,512
What are you doing?
I was here first!

497
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:03,242
Thank you.

498
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,938
Those women were like animals.
I saw this beautiful handbag.

499
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:11,682
I was afraid to fight for it.
They're vicious. They kill their own.

500
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:15,732
The woman that finally bought
this handbag, I know did time.

501
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:17,885
Now I don't have a decent handbag.

502
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,475
You know what this lingerie cost?
And the makeup?

503
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,502
How does a woman keep herself
attractive and not starve?

504
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:25,546
Can I have more cottage cheese?

505
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,723
- You wore this today?
- I gotta set that before I go to bed.

506
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,249
Easy, easy, easy.
Please!

507
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,532
I'm dieting. Please.

508
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:34,578
I gotta get up at 4:30,
do a close shave.

509
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,124
I told the studio I do my own makeup
because I'm allergic.

510
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,931
I appreciate your doing this,
but it's for the money, isn't it?

511
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:45,195
It's not so you can wear
these little outfits?

512
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:50,199
I'm not even gonna answer that.
It's a great acting challenge.

513
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,575
You know what my problem is?

514
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,121
Cramps.

515
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,862
No, not cramps.

516
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,123
Sandy.

517
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,818
How can I tell her they cast a man
instead of her? She'll be suicidal.

518
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,934
Don't tell her.

519
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,257
Where will I say I got the money?

520
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,762
What am I going to do? Tell her
somebody died and left it to me?

521
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,987
- My God! When did she die?
- Last week.

522
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,221
Of what?

523
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,830
A disease.

524
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,377
Gee, what a coincidence.

525
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,945
I mean, your needing $8000 and
her leaving you exactly that much.

526
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,015
- Isn't it?
- It's, well...

527
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,557
- All right, kid.
- It's mine?

528
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,780
- Learn your lines.
- I'm excited!

529
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,848
This is the greatest part!

530
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:34,655
I want to take you to dinner.
It's time we celebrated something.

531
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,489
- To Return to the Love Canal.
- Hurry up.

532
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,204
- I'll jump in the shower.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

533
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,045
Why, yes.

534
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,734
You know, we can stay here
if you want to, and...

535
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:34,581
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God! I'm...

536
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,846
Sandy, I want you.

537
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,677
You want me?

538
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:43,822
I want you.

539
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,119
I want you.

540
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:53,516
- Will I ever see you again?
- We've known each other six years.

541
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:56,819
I know. But sex changes things.

542
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,415
I've had relationships where I
know a guy, then have sex with him...

543
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:03,634
...and then I bump into him and
he acts like I loaned him money.

544
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:06,263
That's not me.
I'll call you tomorrow.

545
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:10,855
I know there's pain in every
relationship. I just want my pain now.

546
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,251
Otherwise, I'll wait by the phone...

547
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:15,993
...and then I'll have pain
and wait by the phone.

548
00:32:15,972 --> 00:32:17,145
It's a waste of time.

549
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,694
Let's make it definite.
Dinner tomorrow.

550
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:23,320
Mom?

551
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:29,302
What do you think?
Hurry. I'm late.

552
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:31,004
Turn around.

553
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:34,508
Smile.

554
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:38,509
- Say something.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

555
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:40,551
You look very nice. Nice.

556
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,945
But the hair's not right.

557
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:44,865
You got a Howard Johnson's thing going.

558
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:48,323
Do something. I can't be late
my first day. Come on.

559
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:52,390
- Easy, easy!
- It's not your head.

560
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,243
- Okay?
- Let's see.

561
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,418
Well, it works.

562
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:59,119
But what?

563
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,051
Don't play hard to get.

564
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,054
Taxi! Taxi!

565
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,035
Taxi!

566
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,913
- Dorothy Michaels. Southwest General.
- Oh, yeah.

567
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,047
TV 2.
Straight ahead, first right.

568
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,223
Is that clock right?

569
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,033
- Yes.
- I couldn't get a cab.

570
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:27,493
Hi, Bobby. This is Miss Michaels.

571
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,229
You'll be in Room 4. We'll need you
on set in about 15 minutes.

572
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:34,589
- I'm sorry.
- That's ok...

573
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:36,653
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's quite all right.

574
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:40,196
- I'm April Paige.
- My, what a nice-looking table.

575
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,570
- Really?
- Yes, it's very smooth.

576
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,790
And that's a very good idea.
A socket for a plug.

577
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:48,771
- Yeah, well, we got everything.
- Yes, I see.

578
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:52,818
Just push all that out of the way.
Make yourself at home.

579
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:56,911
Yes?

580
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,518
One more thing, Miss Michaels.
I forgot to give you these.

581
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:02,460
Oh, are these for today?

582
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,721
They always throw stuff
at you in the last minute.

583
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,529
- My goodness!
- What's wrong?

584
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:11,030
- I have to kiss Dr. Brewster!
- He kisses all the women.

585
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:13,857
We call him "The Tongue."

586
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:19,230
Okay, quickly. Now, the tubes
have pulled out of Rick's nose.

587
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,778
Julie, there's an alert
at your station.

588
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:24,976
Rick, get on the floor.
That's why the tubes pulled out.

589
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:28,418
When Julie starts stuffing
the tubes back up your nose...

590
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:31,486
...you grab her hard.
- In his condition?

591
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,401
Yes. He's been crazy
since he fell through the ice.

592
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:36,881
You're delirious.
You think she's Anthea.

593
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,384
- Mr. Carlysle, I...
- Jesus Christ!

594
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:42,406
Could I have
a little more hammering here?!

595
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:49,134
Now, when you grab her,
maybe you even say, "Anthea! Anthea!"

596
00:35:49,177 --> 00:35:51,700
Good. Is my violin somewhere
in the room?

597
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,093
Your violin sunk.
It's at the bottom of the lake.

598
00:35:56,184 --> 00:35:58,141
The violin fell through the ice.

599
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:00,665
He was playing during the thaw.

600
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,362
You're Dorothy Michaels, aren't you?

601
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,649
I'm John Van Horn.

602
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:07,845
We're up next.

603
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:16,616
When he grabs you,
you've got to be torn, to struggle.

604
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:20,445
You know you've got to get those
tubes stuck back up his nose.

605
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:23,188
But you also realize
you're in the arms of a man...

606
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:27,627
...whose music was everything to Anthea.
It was her whole life.

607
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:31,109
This is a man who stood by you
after Ted's breakdown.

608
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:33,262
Get me a bagel and cream cheese.

609
00:36:33,678 --> 00:36:36,677
- Julie, you want anything?
- No. She's fine, thanks.

610
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:41,439
So it's a struggle, but you're
struggling with yourself as well.

611
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:44,165
- And I lose, right?
- Get down here a minute.

612
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:48,015
Now, then, Rick, it says when she
comes down to her knees...

613
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:50,649
...it inflames your desire.

614
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:52,434
God knows, it inflames mine.

615
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,329
Okay, Big John.

616
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:56,635
Dorothy, come in here.

617
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:00,589
This is Dorothy Michaels,
the new hospital administrator.

618
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:01,837
Hello, Dorothy.

619
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,726
Hi! We met the other day.
Julie Nichols, hospital slut.

620
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:07,646
No! Now, Mr. Carlysle...

621
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:11,105
I'm sorry, but we have so little time,
we can't even rehearse.

622
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:15,564
I'm gonna show you your marks,
and then we'll go straight to tape.

623
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:19,396
Big John, you'll enter from here,
you see them struggling...

624
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:23,721
...you cross to here and cry loudly,
"Nurse Charles! Are you insane?"

625
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:27,703
Yes, I see. Will it be
on the teleprompter? "Loudly?"

626
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,559
And who do I say that to?

627
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,648
Nurse Charles.

628
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:34,433
I thought when Dr. Brewster...

629
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:37,606
You will enter from here,
cross to this mark.

630
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:39,570
I know my mark.
But I thought...

631
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,724
The corridor scene will be played
right here. Right?

632
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:46,700
See, I just wanted to ask
concerning the doctor...

633
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,182
Places, please.
Stand by, tape is rolling.

634
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:54,211
Five, four, three...

635
00:37:56,258 --> 00:37:57,301
Anthea!

636
00:37:58,259 --> 00:37:59,266
Oh, Anthea!

637
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:00,956
Freeze up.
One twenty-five.

638
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:07,071
Nurse Charles! Are you insane?

639
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:09,963
I'm Emily Kimberly,
the new hospital administrator.

640
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,423
Nurse Charles, what on earth
is going on here, dear?

641
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:17,167
Help me get her to her feet,
Miss Kimberly.

642
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:19,213
John's going.

643
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:25,238
Nurse Charles, tend to your patient
and faint on your own time!

644
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,722
- Yes, Miss...
- Kimberly.

645
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,197
Dr. Brewster...

646
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,421
...you and I must talk.

647
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,314
- Rita, you want to keep rolling?
- It's okay. The girl saved it.

648
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:37,383
- You haven't changed, Emily.
- But I have, Medford.

649
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:42,146
You know, Emily, there's no reason
for us to be in opposite camps.

650
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:44,864
We can rule Southwest General together.

651
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:48,003
I admire people with power.

652
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:51,093
Women with power, especially.

653
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,880
God, she hit him on the head.
Rita, she hit him.

654
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:58,231
- and not consider it a threat?

655
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,973
I'm afraid that you have
underestimated me.

656
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:04,193
If you want to win me over,
you'll deal with my mind...

657
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:05,842
...and not my lips.

658
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:07,719
- Cut it.
- And stop tape.

659
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,698
- I was supposed to kiss her.
- It was just an instinct.

660
00:39:10,787 --> 00:39:13,788
Remember what you said about
being more threatening?

661
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,548
It was a good instinct.
It would've been mine.

662
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,268
Wait. I'll handle the instincts here.

663
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,685
It happened to be a good
instinct, toots.

664
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:26,055
But next time you want to change
something, discuss it with me first.

665
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:29,634
Yes. I was wrong not to.

666
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,934
Good girl.

667
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,674
Big John, wonderful!

668
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:33,901
All right, people.

669
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:36,788
Item seven. In the corridor.

670
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:39,251
Thanks for catching me.

671
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,879
You saved my ass. Literally.

672
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,710
Dorothy...

673
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:48,950
...I just want to say I loved what you
did in our scene. Welcome aboard!

674
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:51,542
Well, you know, you were good too...

675
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:04,291
Can I have your autograph?
I've always watched the show.

676
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,599
You're so great.

677
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:07,752
Wonderful! Oh, thank you!

678
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:10,146
Thank you. That was an
exhilarating first day.

679
00:40:10,386 --> 00:40:13,082
- Tell me about it next week.
- Good night.

680
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:14,607
Julie, come on, baby.

681
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,480
Can we drop you?
Maybe you'd like to join us for a drink.

682
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,984
- No, thanks. I feel like walking.
- Okay, bye.

683
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:36,455
She's a very attractive girl.

684
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:39,349
And no dummy.
But for the life of me...

685
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:42,892
...I cannot understand why she
hangs around with that director.

686
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,963
He treats her like she's just...

687
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:46,292
...nothing!

688
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,598
I think you're right.

689
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,274
I'm rewriting the necktie scene
without the necktie.

690
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:53,362
He's condescending.
He calls me "sweetheart."

691
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,255
He doesn't even know my name.

692
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,041
He calls her "baby."

693
00:40:57,473 --> 00:41:01,734
He pushed me around. If not for
the dress, I'd have kicked his ass.

694
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:03,936
How'd you communicate with him?

695
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,958
He told me what he wanted.
I didn't say anything.

696
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:11,678
I did it my way. He bawled me out.
I apologized. That was that.

697
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,252
I think Dorothy's smarter than I am.

698
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,713
I just wish I looked prettier.
I look in the mirror and...

699
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:21,824
Maybe I can just get a softer...

700
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:25,282
...hair or something,
because she deserves it.

701
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,048
- Don't answer that!
- Why not?

702
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,202
- It could be for Dorothy. Please.
- Why'd you give them this number?

703
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:36,597
The show has to contact me
in case they change the schedule.

704
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,319
I'll find out.

705
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:41,821
They can't think Dorothy lives
with a man! It's wrong for her.

706
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:44,149
It could be for me.
Answer as Dorothy.

707
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:46,564
I can't!
What if it's Sandy?

708
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:49,371
If it's Diane, how do I
explain there's a woman here?

709
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,221
I'll get a service tomorrow.

710
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:57,835
When you were playing Cyrano and you
stuck a saber in my armpit...

711
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,340
...I didn't say anything.

712
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,494
When you were hopping around,
ranting about your hump...

713
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:05,344
...saying this was a bell tower,
I didn't say anything.

714
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:08,805
But I don't see why I should
pretend I'm not home...

715
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,352
...just because you're not
that kind of girl.

716
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:12,809
That's weird.

717
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,333
- Where are you going?
- To Diane's.

718
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:20,425
That way if anybody wants to reach me,
they can talk to me.

719
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:26,059
What do you think I'm doing this for?
For you, for the play, for Sandy...

720
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,369
I told you to give me
the pain yesterday.

721
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:33,176
Sandy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk long.

722
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:35,635
I just don't have the energy.

723
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,378
I didn't forget.
I just may have the flu.

724
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:40,229
Do you have a fever?

725
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:43,491
How much? Go right to bed
and take two aspirin...

726
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,539
...bundle up, sweat, and drink liquids.

727
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:49,737
Above all, take 1000 units of
vitamin C every hour with milk only.

728
00:43:14,564 --> 00:43:17,174
Did you give Melanie
an overdose on purpose?

729
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:20,176
I don't know.
I don't write the shit, you know.

730
00:43:21,071 --> 00:43:24,417
Don't be so hard on Dr. Brewster.
He's insecure.

731
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,965
I have to be tough.
He just wants my body.

732
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,447
Dorothy, you're so bad.

733
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,667
- You look just the way you look.
- Thank you. You're very attractive too.

734
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,518
I want you to meet my dad, Les.

735
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:39,500
- It's nice to meet you.
- I feel I know you already.

736
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:42,350
I just love your daughter to pieces.

737
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:58,129
I can't write any clearer
than I can write. It's in English.

738
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:00,349
- What about those?
- For Sandy?

739
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:04,088
For me, for Dorothy. Not exactly,
but that kind of idea.

740
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:06,547
- A little overstated.
- Really? Wait a minute!

741
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:08,204
Jesus!

742
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:10,836
- That's her.
- Mr. Earl!

743
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:20,456
You got it.
Thursday, what time?

744
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,041
8:30.

745
00:44:24,674 --> 00:44:26,846
I will not forget.
Okay, bye-bye.

746
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:41,105
"Things are better since you
came to Southwest General."

747
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:43,516
- "We're so grateful to you."
- For?

748
00:44:43,567 --> 00:44:48,654
- "For your help and advice."
- "I think of you all as my daughters."

749
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:52,504
"What kind of mother wouldn't
give her girls tits?"

750
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,833
"Tips."
It's "tips."

751
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:56,621
Tips.

752
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,792
You'll find you picked
the wrong man to challenge.

753
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:03,296
It was you who pro...
Look at me when I talk to you.

754
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:05,590
I don't trust a man
who won't meet my eye.

755
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:08,373
I don't trust it in a bank teller
or a salesman.

756
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:12,109
And I certainly don't trust it
in a chief surgeon.

757
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,329
You provoked this confrontation.

758
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,940
You're an incredibly
insensitive woman.

759
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,793
Stop thinking of me as a woman
and start thinking of me as a person.

760
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:23,971
That's what Southwest General
is made of, people.

761
00:45:25,565 --> 00:45:28,172
And have Nurse Charles
see me immediately.

762
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:32,371
- Push in for a close-up.
- Not too close!

763
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:34,524
Okay, hold it there.

764
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:37,027
- And cut it!
- Stop tape.

765
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,877
Dorothy, it was wonderful
the way you held my face.

766
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:44,033
You controlled me completely.

767
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:46,645
Thank you, but you had
some great moments.

768
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:48,603
Hold it. Good news, children.

769
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,411
Our brilliant engineers have
again erased a reel of the show.

770
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:56,410
So we have to retape
14, 15 and 16.

771
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:00,441
It's either that
or do it live, tomorrow.

772
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,424
I think we should tape it.

773
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:06,638
That's a wrap. See you bright
and early, 6:30 tomorrow.

774
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,857
- Good night, Dorothy.
- Good night, Ben.

775
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,250
That's some day, huh?

776
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,665
What? Oh, you mean about
doing it over again.

777
00:46:33,171 --> 00:46:35,649
Tell me, does that happen often?

778
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:38,890
Every once in a while.
We actually had to do it live once.

779
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,086
Live!

780
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:44,132
You should have seen Van Horn's face.
He was so panicked...

781
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,570
...we had to shoot him from the back.

782
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,028
- Want some wine?
- No, thanks. I better go home.

783
00:46:50,647 --> 00:46:54,213
I have to wash my hair.
Thanks anyway.

784
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:55,928
- Dorothy?
- Yes?

785
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:59,886
Listen, I know this is exactly
what you want to hear now...

786
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,977
...but we've got 26 pages,
and I was wondering...

787
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,204
...if you could come over and
run some lines with me tonight.

788
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:09,963
I could make you something to eat.

789
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:11,512
Night, Fay.

790
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:13,228
I'm a born defroster.

791
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:15,405
You don't have a thing to wear?

792
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,671
- She's seen me in all these.
- Not in the white thing.

793
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:23,237
What, this? You cannot wear white
to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.

794
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:26,608
- You couldn't wear pants?
- No. Pants? I can't.

795
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:29,548
- What about this?
- No shoes for it.

796
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,724
The lines make me look hippy...

797
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:33,725
...and it cuts me across the bust.

798
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:37,358
We're getting into a weird area.

799
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,425
This is smart.
What about this?

800
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:42,040
Looks like you should
ring a school bell.

801
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,777
This may seem silly to you,
but this is our first date.

802
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:47,525
I want to look pretty for her.

803
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,833
Hi.
What a pretty outfit.

804
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:53,726
- Glad you like it.
- Come on in.

805
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,054
- Brought you something.
- You didn't have to.

806
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,012
It wasn't nothing.

807
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,124
Come in.
I'll put them in water.

808
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,257
What a big apartment.

809
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:06,456
- What a lovely, lovely room.
- Is it?

810
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:09,589
- Yes, it's yummy.
- I had a decorator do it.

811
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:12,349
Before, no money.
Now, no time.

812
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,220
- Amy is asleep. Finally.
- Scared the daylights out of me.

813
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:21,773
Miss Nichols, that child is never
going to learn anything if you keep...

814
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:23,642
Thank you, Mrs. Crawley.

815
00:48:23,736 --> 00:48:26,345
- Dorothy, Mrs. Crawley.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

816
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,429
Nice meeting you.

817
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:31,263
- Scares the shit out of me.
- Scared me to death.

818
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,113
Drop your coat here.

819
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,743
- Who is it?
- Amy's nanny.

820
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,091
And she hates me.

821
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,294
Who's Amy?

822
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,509
My daughter.

823
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,750
She was 14 months old last week.

824
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,622
I didn't know you had a baby.

825
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:48,863
You got any kids, Dorothy?

826
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,888
- Were you ever married?
- I haven't been that fortunate.

827
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:57,223
I was engaged once, though,
to a brilliant young actor...

828
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,005
...whose career was cut short by
the theatrical establishment.

829
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:04,378
- They killed him?
- So to speak.

830
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:07,274
Sutton gave up acting, and me as well.

831
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,905
He's working now as a waiter
in a disreputable restaurant.

832
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,801
I don't want to talk about it.

833
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,216
Maybe you'd like some wine?

834
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,304
No, I think I'd better keep sharp
when we work, you know?

835
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,636
You mind if I ask you a question?

836
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:26,402
Do you worry about using so much
heavy makeup on your skin?

837
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,318
I don't worry.

838
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,689
I have a little...

839
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,146
...moustache problem I'm sensitive to.

840
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,388
Probably just too many
male hormones or something.

841
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,852
Some men find that attractive.

842
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,939
I know, I know. I just don't like
the men that find it attractive.

843
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:50,294
So you're divorced?

844
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:52,710
I've never been married.

845
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,123
Perhaps I'll have
one little drink.

846
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,111
Tell me about Ron.

847
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:10,570
- How much time have you got?
- Go on.

848
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,926
Well, Ron...

849
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:16,689
Ron is, hands down, the best
director of daytime drama.

850
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:19,362
Did they tell you
not to call it a soap yet?

851
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:23,583
If anybody calls it a soap opera,
Rita fines them a quarter.

852
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:25,331
It's how she got her car.

853
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:27,653
You're not telling me
about you and Ron.

854
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:32,097
That's nighttime drama.
He's interesting there too.

855
00:50:32,444 --> 00:50:34,226
Oh, you mean he's...

856
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:38,343
You mean you have a good relationship.

857
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,037
What's a good relationship, Dotty?
Can I call you Dotty?

858
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,979
- Oh, please do.
- Ron's smart and he's funny.

859
00:50:47,457 --> 00:50:48,893
We got things in common.

860
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:51,960
You know a guy who wants a woman
who eats at four...

861
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:54,136
...is unconscious by nine
and works at dawn?

862
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:57,226
But how does he treat you?

863
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,622
Oh, that!

864
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:03,384
- You think I do this without a plan?
- What do you mean?

865
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:08,345
There are a lot of men out there.
I'm selective. I look around carefully.

866
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:11,350
When I find the one who can
give me the worst time...

867
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,637
...that's when I make my move.

868
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:25,556
My lines sound like subtitles
for a Czech movie.

869
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:29,302
Try answering as if the question
took you by surprise.

870
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:30,371
What do you mean?

871
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,847
I'll ask a question.
You just answer it.

872
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,504
Why do you drink so much?

873
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:41,550
When you grow up as I did, an orphan
raised by a sister 16 years older...

874
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,316
...you have few illusions.

875
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:45,863
- There you go.
- It made a difference?

876
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:46,801
You got it.

877
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:48,931
Thanks, Dorothy.

878
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:52,935
Why do you drink so much?

879
00:51:53,438 --> 00:51:55,133
Because it's not fattening...

880
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:59,088
...and it's not good for me.
How many things can you say that about?

881
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,028
You telling me to mind
my own business.

882
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:04,552
I just don't think you
should worry about it.

883
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,821
- It's nice of you, but...
- But I should mind my own business.

884
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,758
It's all so complicated, isn't it?

885
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,412
- What?
- All of it.

886
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:20,980
Don't you find being a woman
in the '80s complicated?

887
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:22,813
Extremely.

888
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:26,381
- You know what I wish, just once?
- What?

889
00:52:27,554 --> 00:52:30,990
That a guy could be honest enough
to walk up to me and say...

890
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:33,149
..."Hey, I'm confused about this too.

891
00:52:33,435 --> 00:52:37,087
I could lay a big line on you,
we could do lots of role-playing...

892
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:41,303
...but the simple truth is,
I find you very interesting...

893
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:45,177
...and I'd really like to make love
with you." Simple as that.

894
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,051
- Wouldn't that be a relief?
- Heaven.

895
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:49,706
Sheer heaven.

896
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:55,340
Ron was supposed to come over
last night. I had dinner all ready.

897
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,018
He never showed up.

898
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,911
Oh, my Lord!
What time is it?

899
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:00,672
It's 10:30.

900
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,089
I gotta go.

901
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,632
Listen, forgive me for rushing off.
It was a wonderful dinner.

902
00:53:24,025 --> 00:53:25,031
The dinner is burned.

903
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:28,070
I'm sorry I'm late.
But I was taking a shower...

904
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:30,225
...and the water turned off...

905
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:32,919
...and I got soap in my eyes.

906
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,985
I had to go to five stores to get
chocolate-chocolate chip.

907
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:38,386
Michael, I saw her.

908
00:53:39,038 --> 00:53:40,386
What? You saw who?

909
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,433
When you were late,
I went by your place.

910
00:53:43,544 --> 00:53:47,413
I waited outside and I saw that
fat woman go into your apartment.

911
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:49,196
Fat woman?

912
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,850
The one in the raincoat.

913
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:55,876
Oh, that woman!
That's a friend of Jeff's.

914
00:53:56,056 --> 00:53:58,970
She came over to help him
with the play.

915
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:02,535
They've known each other for years.

916
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:04,064
You think she's fat?

917
00:54:04,063 --> 00:54:07,282
Well, it was dark but, yes,
I thought she was fat.

918
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,129
When did Jeff start
collaborating on his play?

919
00:54:10,654 --> 00:54:12,610
She's an excellent typist.

920
00:54:13,157 --> 00:54:16,069
Look, I'm not having
an affair with that woman.

921
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:18,121
It's impossible.

922
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:21,619
I don't want to make trouble.

923
00:54:21,663 --> 00:54:24,359
I shouldn't have people over.
They never show up.

924
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:27,671
I'm sorry. I feel guilty.
You feel guilty. I'm sorry.

925
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:32,127
Don't do that. Don't apologize
because I'm three hours late.

926
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:34,438
You should be furious.

927
00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:36,112
You've been great to me.

928
00:54:36,637 --> 00:54:40,812
You helped me with the audition
for that soap. It's that soap!

929
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:43,533
That soap!

930
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:47,319
Did you see that cow they hired?

931
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:48,560
Cow?

932
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:51,236
They must've gone a different way.

933
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:52,911
She is awful.

934
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:58,261
Well, I heard she was pretty good.

935
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,196
Baloney!

936
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:02,721
She's supposed to be tough, right?

937
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,618
She's not tough.
She's a wimp!

938
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:08,227
Maybe it's the lines.
She doesn't make them up.

939
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,406
Well, I think she should.

940
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,280
They couldn't be any worse.

941
00:55:12,252 --> 00:55:14,428
I can't move out, Miss Kimberly.

942
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:16,502
I have no place to go.

943
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:19,439
I don't know what to do.

944
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:26,332
Don't tell me your husband beats you,
but you can't move out.

945
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:29,209
- Why should you move?
- What is she saying?

946
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:30,406
Three's up. Ready one.

947
00:55:30,729 --> 00:55:33,296
You know what I'd do
if somebody did this to me?

948
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:37,825
I'd pick up the biggest thing
around and I'd just...

949
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:40,608
...bash their brains
right through...

950
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:44,477
...the top of their skull before
I'd let them beat me up again.

951
00:55:45,787 --> 00:55:49,005
Well, I can't afford therapy,
Miss Kimberly.

952
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,340
Who said anything about therapy?

953
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:53,016
- Cut it, Ron.
- Cut it!

954
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,423
Wait a minute. Her line is
"Your husband..."

955
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:57,672
Wait a second.

956
00:55:58,258 --> 00:55:59,692
May I say in my own defense...

957
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:02,932
...to tell a woman
with two children, no money...

958
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:06,086
...and a husband who beats
her up like this...

959
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,793
...to move into a welfare center
to get therapy is a lot of...

960
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:12,836
...horseshit!
I wouldn't do it, would you?

961
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,318
- I can't act with this.
- Oh, shut up.

962
00:56:15,732 --> 00:56:16,559
Ron?

963
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,704
I'm partially to blame, Miss Kimberly.

964
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:40,080
I know I'm pretty, and I use it.

965
00:56:40,297 --> 00:56:43,907
I guess I shouldn't have gone
to Dr. Brewster's office so late.

966
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:45,478
No, that's not true.

967
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:49,844
Dr. Brewster has tried to seduce
several nurses on this ward...

968
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,744
...claiming to be in the throes
of an uncontrollable impulse.

969
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:55,333
Do you know what?

970
00:56:56,272 --> 00:57:01,141
I'm going to give every nurse
on this floor an electric cattle prod...

971
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:04,669
...and instruct them to just zap
him in his "badubies."

972
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,284
Cattle prod?

973
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,411
Ruby. Hi, do you want to
open up the yellow pages...

974
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:12,437
...under the section
of Farm Equipment...

975
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:26,829
I am Dorothy. Nobody's writing her.
It's coming out of me.

976
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,419
You're Michael acting Dorothy.

977
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:31,834
It's the same thing.
I'm experiencing these feelings.

978
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:37,491
Why can't you get me a special?
I feel I have something to say to women.

979
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,670
- You have nothing to say to women.
- I have plenty to say to women.

980
00:58:41,997 --> 00:58:44,911
I've been an unemployed
actor for 20 years!

981
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:48,089
I know what it's like to wait
for the phone to ring!

982
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:52,247
Then when I finally get a job,
I have no control! I got zip!

983
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:54,770
If I could impart that experience
to other women...

984
00:58:54,968 --> 00:58:58,012
There are no other women
like you. You're a man!

985
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:01,407
Yes, I realize that, of course.
But I'm also an actress.

986
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:05,630
- We shouldn't argue about this.
- I'm a potentially great actress.

987
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:10,674
I could do Medea, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth.
Just like in Shakespeare's day.

988
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:12,807
Get the writers at the agency...

989
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:14,942
I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.

990
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:16,858
We can do the
Eleanor Roosevelt story!

991
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,077
The Eleanor Roosevelt story?

992
00:59:19,492 --> 00:59:21,361
What's the matter with that?

993
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:24,190
Phil Weintraub's party is Saturday.
Let's just go.

994
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:27,194
Have a good time.
Don't take yourself so seriously.

995
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:30,200
- He never invited me to a party.
- I'm inviting you.

996
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:33,680
He did a fabulous job on your eyes.

997
00:59:33,922 --> 00:59:36,183
I can't blink for a week. Really.

998
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:38,772
- I don't like it here.
- Stand up straight.

999
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:49,499
- What do you want?
- A double champagne.

1000
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:54,655
What is this?
Just serve yourself?

1001
00:59:55,568 --> 00:59:57,046
Hi. What would you like?

1002
00:59:57,571 --> 00:59:58,918
Give me two...

1003
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:02,965
- Two what?
- Of anything.

1004
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,755
- I'm sorry...
- A couple of champagnes.

1005
01:00:15,588 --> 01:00:19,241
- Can I get you something?
- Vodka on the rocks with a twist.

1006
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,225
You don't remember me?

1007
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,599
When I came in, I thought
you looked familiar.

1008
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,751
- What's your name again?
- Suzanne.

1009
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:29,535
Call Pamela Green, my agent.

1010
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,385
Paramount's interested.
I'll know after the first.

1011
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:34,411
I'll read it after the first.

1012
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:37,389
Actually, I'm not that crazy
about the script.

1013
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:41,524
I'm having a rewrite done.
Maybe we could have dinner.

1014
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,072
Call Pamela.
She handles me for dinner.

1015
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,725
Do you have a light?

1016
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,054
- How've you been?
- Great.

1017
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,034
- Good.
- You look wonderful.

1018
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,038
Silly me, I already had dinner.

1019
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,887
I didn't know there'd be so much food.

1020
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,129
It's for my dog.

1021
01:00:58,671 --> 01:00:59,626
He likes fruit.

1022
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,461
Mike Dorsey.

1023
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:05,812
Great view, huh?

1024
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:09,510
Only Phil could afford all those lights.

1025
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:11,602
You know...

1026
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,604
...I could lay a big line on you...

1027
01:01:15,563 --> 01:01:19,127
...and we could do a lot of
role-playing, but the simple truth...

1028
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:22,609
...is that I find you
very interesting.

1029
01:01:22,569 --> 01:01:24,439
And I'd like to make love to you.

1030
01:01:25,073 --> 01:01:26,941
You know?
It's as sim...

1031
01:01:30,076 --> 01:01:31,728
As simple as that.

1032
01:01:43,174 --> 01:01:45,477
I understand who you really are.

1033
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:49,327
And I'll no longer submit to your
petty insults and humiliations.

1034
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:52,076
It's not necessary now that
Emily Kimberly's here.

1035
01:01:52,682 --> 01:01:55,159
Now that someone who sees
the truth is your equal.

1036
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:58,923
Listen, doctor, I've filed charges
against you with the AMA.

1037
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:00,757
You'll be notified tomorrow.

1038
01:02:01,564 --> 01:02:03,434
- And cut it.
- Cut.

1039
01:02:03,691 --> 01:02:04,821
It's a good one.

1040
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:07,830
Perfect.

1041
01:02:08,153 --> 01:02:10,460
- That was great.
- Thanks, John.

1042
01:02:10,655 --> 01:02:13,091
- Lovely job. First-rate.
- You were wonderful.

1043
01:02:13,158 --> 01:02:14,506
Thanks to my coach.

1044
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,423
No, you did it yourself.

1045
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,448
- Was it okay?
- I loved the middle...

1046
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,884
So much for the
mutual-admiration society.

1047
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:24,298
Let's move on to item 17.
Jo, clear this set.

1048
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:27,886
I'll need Alan, Tom and John.

1049
01:02:28,173 --> 01:02:29,653
Tootsie, take 10.

1050
01:02:29,674 --> 01:02:31,022
Ron?

1051
01:02:31,175 --> 01:02:32,219
My name is Dorothy.

1052
01:02:32,678 --> 01:02:35,591
It's not Tootsie or Toots
or Sweetie or Honey or Doll.

1053
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,508
- Oh, Christ.
- No, just Dorothy.

1054
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:41,814
Alan's always Alan, Tom's always Tom
and John's always John.

1055
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:46,449
I have a name too. It's Dorothy,
capital D-O-R-O-T-H-Y.

1056
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:47,605
Dorothy.

1057
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:51,132
Excuse me, doctor.

1058
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:06,800
Did somebody die?

1059
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,996
- Violinist.
- I didn't know he was that sick.

1060
01:03:10,172 --> 01:03:12,476
He wasn't.
He asked for a raise.

1061
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:18,283
I'm sorry about what
happened out there.

1062
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:22,290
- I was upset.
- What're you doing for the holidays?

1063
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:23,903
Why?

1064
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:29,143
Well, the baby and I are gonna
go up to my dad's farm upstate.

1065
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:33,235
It's not exactly the fast lane,
but it's kind of fun.

1066
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:35,431
Maybe you'd like to come along?

1067
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:41,608
You know, since my dad met you,
he's your biggest fan.

1068
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:44,223
Is Ron coming too?

1069
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,660
Would that make a difference?

1070
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:50,124
Actually...

1071
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,990
...I think he has to stay
in town and work.

1072
01:03:56,258 --> 01:03:57,607
If it matters...

1073
01:03:57,758 --> 01:04:02,238
...I've always hated women who treat
other women as stand-ins for men.

1074
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:04,415
It's not that, really.

1075
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:07,116
I'd just like you to come.

1076
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:11,945
I just don't want to get up too soon
or I'll have another relapse.

1077
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:16,229
Isn't there some way we could rehearse
in the same room together?

1078
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:19,627
We will. Right after the weekend.
I'll call you Monday.

1079
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:20,997
Thanks. Bye-bye.

1080
01:04:21,784 --> 01:04:24,696
You know where my pink nightgown is?
With the flow...

1081
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:25,917
- Listen to me.
- What?

1082
01:04:26,288 --> 01:04:27,504
Stop packing.

1083
01:04:27,788 --> 01:04:28,616
Don't do this.

1084
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:30,660
- Why?
- You should not do this.

1085
01:04:31,249 --> 01:04:34,728
In two weeks, if I ever see Julie again,
it'll be as Michael...

1086
01:04:34,753 --> 01:04:37,493
...and she'll probably
throw a drink in my face.

1087
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:40,887
- How can you keep lying to Sandy?
- It's for her own good.

1088
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:45,038
I never told Sandy I wouldn't
see other women. Come on.

1089
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:48,611
If I told her, it would hurt her
and I don't want to do that.

1090
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:51,807
Especially since Julie and I
are just girlfriends.

1091
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:54,162
I'm just afraid you'll
burn in hell for this.

1092
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:57,685
I don't believe in hell.
I believe in unemployment.

1093
01:05:28,847 --> 01:05:32,108
- Wait! Let me get those.
- Oh, well, thank you.

1094
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:35,874
- Strong little thing, aren't you?
- Well, no.

1095
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:41,097
Come on, Dorothy.
I'll show you the house.

1096
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,099
- Careful coming up here.
- It really is old, isn't it?

1097
01:05:46,782 --> 01:05:47,913
Here we are.

1098
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:52,825
I'll set up the crib in a second.

1099
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,435
Unpack your bags and we'll...

1100
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:56,653
Wait. Are we sharing?

1101
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:59,489
The upstairs is shut off.
And I know you girls.

1102
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:04,140
No matter what, you'll sneak back
together and spend the night giggling.

1103
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:07,274
He still thinks I'm 12.

1104
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,101
Which side do you want?

1105
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,151
I think the one closest
to the bathroom.

1106
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:14,327
I won't take up much room.

1107
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,163
Take it between your thumb
and forefinger.

1108
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:31,014
Let every finger roll down
individually. That's it, yes.

1109
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:33,014
My goodness.

1110
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,300
You'll be all right.

1111
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,947
Special up here, isn't it?

1112
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,040
I'm glad you came.

1113
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,410
Can I tell you something?

1114
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,308
Sweetheart?

1115
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:34,332
Ron is on the phone.

1116
01:08:34,942 --> 01:08:36,724
Hi. I'm sorry.

1117
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:39,031
- What, Dorothy?
- Nothing.

1118
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,535
- I think I'll put her down.
- Good.

1119
01:08:43,575 --> 01:08:45,750
Gets a little chilly out here.

1120
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,164
- No, I was just...
- I brought this sweater for you.

1121
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:51,327
Thank you.
Very nice of you, Les.

1122
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,497
Thank you.

1123
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:04,508
I wonder if we're going to get
any stars out of the sky tonight?

1124
01:09:04,471 --> 01:09:05,906
I've got my stars.

1125
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:08,427
You and Julie.

1126
01:09:38,045 --> 01:09:40,653
- It's beautiful.
- I should've transposed it.

1127
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:43,048
It's wonderful for a lady
to play piano.

1128
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,724
Quit. Mama insisted.

1129
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,878
- Who wants another drink?
- You better take it easy.

1130
01:09:48,054 --> 01:09:49,533
- Remember Injun Joe.
- What's that?

1131
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:51,035
Don't you tell that story.

1132
01:09:51,557 --> 01:09:54,254
- This bar Daddy hangs out in...
- I don't.

1133
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,039
He and Injun Joe threw back
a few too many.

1134
01:09:57,063 --> 01:09:57,889
Hard liquor.

1135
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,717
They thought they saw this elk.

1136
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:01,849
They stalked it for a couple hours.

1137
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:04,459
They cornered it up
against Charlie's barn.

1138
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:07,702
About the time they were ready
to blast it, it mooed.

1139
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:09,641
It was a cow?

1140
01:10:10,575 --> 01:10:12,316
Enough laughing at your old man.

1141
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:13,927
You know this one?

1142
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:18,412
Wait a minute.

1143
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:49,766
- Bravo!
- That was Julie's mother's name.

1144
01:10:50,072 --> 01:10:52,159
Mary Juliet Cooper.

1145
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,594
Well, I'm going to bed.

1146
01:10:56,162 --> 01:10:59,162
Do you wanna hit the hay,
as they say on the farm?

1147
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:03,627
I think I'll... You and...
Both of you go to bed.

1148
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:05,408
- I'll stay up.
- I'll stay with you.

1149
01:11:07,048 --> 01:11:08,309
Well, I'm going.

1150
01:11:08,673 --> 01:11:10,544
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

1151
01:11:10,676 --> 01:11:11,808
Good night, Dad.

1152
01:11:12,052 --> 01:11:13,705
Sleep well.

1153
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:16,206
Be good.

1154
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:21,143
- Nice girl, isn't she?
- Very sweet.

1155
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:23,143
I'm kind of glad Ron didn't come up.

1156
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:25,712
You know I am too, actually.

1157
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,325
Really?

1158
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,564
- I'm sorry. Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

1159
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:34,306
I thought you'd be more like
one of them "liberators."

1160
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:37,790
You know, I'm not really
like the woman on the show.

1161
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,856
I mean, it's just a part.
I'm not that militant.

1162
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:43,336
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all for equality.

1163
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,405
Women ought to be entitled to
everything and all, et cetera.

1164
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,800
Except...

1165
01:11:49,255 --> 01:11:52,691
...sometimes I think
what they really want is to be men.

1166
01:11:52,674 --> 01:11:56,198
Like men are all equal
in the first place. We're not.

1167
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,545
Can I get you another drink?

1168
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,117
I must keep my wits tonight.

1169
01:12:00,139 --> 01:12:01,619
Tonight?

1170
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:02,984
Well, always.

1171
01:12:03,142 --> 01:12:04,403
I remember years ago...

1172
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:07,906
...there wasn't talk about
what a woman was, what a man was.

1173
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,018
You just were what you were.

1174
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:14,085
Now they have all this stuff about
being like the other sex...

1175
01:12:14,654 --> 01:12:18,915
...so you can all be the same.
Well, I'm sorry, but we're just not.

1176
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:21,110
Not on a farm, anyway.

1177
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:24,506
Bulls are bulls,
and roosters don't try to lay eggs.

1178
01:12:24,664 --> 01:12:26,098
Never.

1179
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:32,278
My wife and I, we were
married a lot of years.

1180
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:33,889
People got it all wrong.

1181
01:12:34,256 --> 01:12:36,649
They say your health
is the most important thing.

1182
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:39,889
But I can lift this house off the
ground. What good is it?

1183
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:41,527
Being with someone.

1184
01:12:41,763 --> 01:12:43,112
Sharing.

1185
01:12:43,766 --> 01:12:46,246
That's what it's all about.

1186
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:50,141
- Julie says you're not married.
- No.

1187
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:51,815
Like another drink?

1188
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:53,497
- No.
- You sure?

1189
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:58,124
Yes. Well, you know what?
I think it is about that time.

1190
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:02,913
- Thanks for staying up and talking.
- Don't you mention it.

1191
01:13:06,246 --> 01:13:07,593
You have beautiful eyes.

1192
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,313
Oh, well, thank you.

1193
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,096
Good night, Les.

1194
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:02,069
Daddy's a little out of
touch, isn't he?

1195
01:14:02,048 --> 01:14:03,919
No. Very sweet, very sweet.

1196
01:14:05,552 --> 01:14:08,248
He sees things pretty simply.

1197
01:14:09,556 --> 01:14:11,645
You're either happy or unhappy.

1198
01:14:11,643 --> 01:14:13,511
Married or not married.

1199
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:17,148
There's nothing in between.

1200
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:30,444
I tried to get him to take out
other women after Mama died but...

1201
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:34,486
You know, she must have been
a very special person.

1202
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,346
I guess so.
I don't remember her very well.

1203
01:14:40,045 --> 01:14:44,522
I remember her helping me
pick out this wallpaper.

1204
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:50,416
I'd chosen one with great big,
purple flowers on it.

1205
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:52,507
And she said to me...

1206
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,466
..."Just remember that once
you choose it...

1207
01:14:56,142 --> 01:15:00,534
...it's gonna cover the walls
of your room for a long, long time."

1208
01:15:01,648 --> 01:15:06,779
So I tried to imagine what those big,
purple flowers would look like...

1209
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,461
...on all the walls of my room...

1210
01:15:10,155 --> 01:15:12,549
...every night when I was
falling asleep...

1211
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:15,269
...and every morning
when I was getting dressed.

1212
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:21,533
So I said to her,
"Which one would you choose, Mom?"

1213
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:28,168
And she said, "The one with
the daisies and the little rosebuds...

1214
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:33,134
...because daisies
are such homey flowers...

1215
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:39,029
...and rosebuds are so cheerful
and always waiting to bloom."

1216
01:15:40,644 --> 01:15:41,774
That's lovely.

1217
01:15:43,647 --> 01:15:47,908
I made a million plans
looking at this wallpaper.

1218
01:15:52,154 --> 01:15:55,590
I was always waiting
for these rosebuds to open.

1219
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:17,507
That's nice.

1220
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:23,510
My mother used to do that too,
sometimes.

1221
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:32,514
- Good night, Julie.
- Good night, Dottie.

1222
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,206
Cathy Campbell,
please call your office.

1223
01:16:50,253 --> 01:16:52,426
It says "cool."

1224
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:56,257
Don't you think I should be angry?
Doesn't it play better?

1225
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:57,910
Yes. Why don't you try that?

1226
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,392
This just came to
our dressing room for you.

1227
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:05,549
- I think it's from Julie's father.
- Oh, my!

1228
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:09,901
Now don't you dare eat any.
You don't want to ruin your cute figure.

1229
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,751
What a thoughtless present
to give a woman.

1230
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:13,557
Chocolates!

1231
01:17:14,234 --> 01:17:16,973
Dorothy Michaels,
Rita Marshall's office.

1232
01:17:17,863 --> 01:17:19,426
You're a complicated lady.

1233
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:23,304
On the one hand,
you're a real pain in the ass.

1234
01:17:23,743 --> 01:17:27,091
I've got one of the most
expensive directors in soaps...

1235
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:29,116
I owe myself a quarter.

1236
01:17:29,749 --> 01:17:32,143
And you've got him
defensive and hostile.

1237
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:33,511
I don't mean to.

1238
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:36,580
However, we're getting
2000 letters a week...

1239
01:17:36,838 --> 01:17:39,753
...and we've picked up
three share points.

1240
01:17:40,258 --> 01:17:42,651
And it's largely due to you.

1241
01:17:42,762 --> 01:17:46,068
You are the first woman character
who is her own person.

1242
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:49,698
Who asserts her own personality
without robbing someone of theirs.

1243
01:17:49,727 --> 01:17:51,814
You're a breakthrough lady for us.

1244
01:17:52,228 --> 01:17:56,100
We're picking up your option for
another year. Congratulations.

1245
01:17:57,734 --> 01:18:01,081
Come on, Mike. What do you mean,
get you out of it?

1246
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:03,755
There's no way out.
It's their option.

1247
01:18:03,864 --> 01:18:05,604
What? Who gave them that?

1248
01:18:05,825 --> 01:18:07,825
You signed the standard contract.

1249
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:12,198
But I didn't know I'd be working
for the rest of my life as a woman!

1250
01:18:12,248 --> 01:18:13,899
You gotta make it work.

1251
01:18:14,332 --> 01:18:17,247
They'll pay. They'll go from
650 to 850 an episode.

1252
01:18:17,252 --> 01:18:20,689
You get me out of this,
or I'll go in and tell them.

1253
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:21,796
Tell them what?

1254
01:18:22,257 --> 01:18:24,344
That you put a network on the spot?

1255
01:18:24,342 --> 01:18:27,171
You're making a fool out of women?
They'll kill you!

1256
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:31,523
My secretary wants to be like
Dorothy Michaels. I want to fire her.

1257
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:36,328
We're talking major fraud here.
Major fraud! You can't tell them.

1258
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:40,292
What about me? You think anybody
will believe I wasn't in on this?

1259
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:44,404
It's not just ruining yourself.
This is ruining me too.

1260
01:18:44,737 --> 01:18:47,433
You can't do it.
You gotta make it work.

1261
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:51,368
- Can you take that many Valium?
- We'll see.

1262
01:18:51,328 --> 01:18:53,763
Maybe your contract has
a morals clause.

1263
01:18:54,332 --> 01:18:58,505
If Dorothy did something filthy or
disgusting, they'd let you go.

1264
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:04,466
But you've already done everything
filthy and disgusting on your show.

1265
01:19:10,848 --> 01:19:13,758
Dorothy, it's Julie.

1266
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:18,328
There's sort of an emergency.
Well, it's not really an emergency...

1267
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:21,334
...but if you get a chance,
would you call me?

1268
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:25,184
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- No, but I'm going to.

1269
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,100
I've been fooling myself about Ron
for too long now.

1270
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:33,388
I guess I really wanted you here
for moral support.

1271
01:19:33,326 --> 01:19:36,674
Although I did fire Mrs. Crawley today.
I really did.

1272
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:40,373
- Want a drink?
- I'm not the one breaking up with Ron.

1273
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,898
I'd buy a ticket to that.

1274
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:46,074
You have influenced me though.
I've seen Ron through your eyes.

1275
01:19:46,422 --> 01:19:48,858
Julie, I don't want
that responsibility.

1276
01:19:48,925 --> 01:19:50,706
Why shouldn't you influence me?

1277
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:53,669
You wouldn't compromise your
feelings like I have...

1278
01:19:53,929 --> 01:19:55,494
...or live this kind of lie.

1279
01:19:55,929 --> 01:19:57,371
Well, no, I wouldn't.
But...

1280
01:19:57,348 --> 01:19:59,827
Of course not. And you're right.
It's just...

1281
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:03,786
I deserve something better.
I don't have to settle for this.

1282
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:08,417
But I've always been too lazy
or too scared or too something.

1283
01:20:08,944 --> 01:20:10,901
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1284
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:13,120
What the hell?
I'll live, won't I?

1285
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:16,795
Maybe not happily, but honestly.

1286
01:20:16,952 --> 01:20:18,386
Sounds like something you'd say.

1287
01:20:18,953 --> 01:20:23,953
You mustn't idealize me. Honesty,
in many ways, is a relative term.

1288
01:20:23,956 --> 01:20:25,393
My father's coming.

1289
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,221
If he calls, don't say
anything about this.

1290
01:20:28,421 --> 01:20:30,942
He's coming tonight.
He'll want to see you.

1291
01:20:30,923 --> 01:20:32,316
Me?

1292
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:33,969
Oh, God!

1293
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:35,687
It's Ron.

1294
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:38,515
Oh, Dorothy, God bless you.

1295
01:20:38,931 --> 01:20:40,278
Wish me luck now.

1296
01:20:40,431 --> 01:20:41,778
Always.

1297
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:45,588
I feel that little moustache.
You should put some makeup on it.

1298
01:20:51,442 --> 01:20:53,009
How're you doing?

1299
01:20:55,446 --> 01:20:56,452
What's going on?

1300
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:58,230
Dorothy's gonna sit with Amy.

1301
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:00,624
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1302
01:21:02,454 --> 01:21:04,105
Hi, honey.

1303
01:21:04,955 --> 01:21:08,260
You don't mind if I call you honey
when we're not working?

1304
01:21:15,424 --> 01:21:16,902
Nice dress.

1305
01:21:17,426 --> 01:21:18,774
Thank you.

1306
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:22,015
You don't like me, do you?

1307
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,909
I can respect that...

1308
01:21:24,557 --> 01:21:28,514
...but there's not many women
I can't make like me.

1309
01:21:28,437 --> 01:21:30,306
Why don't you like me?

1310
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:33,027
I don't like
the way you treat Julie.

1311
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:34,268
Oh?

1312
01:21:34,527 --> 01:21:38,919
I don't like the way you patronize her,
deceive her and lie to her.

1313
01:21:39,531 --> 01:21:40,358
What do you mean?

1314
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:41,709
You want me to go on?

1315
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:44,538
No, I know what you mean.

1316
01:21:46,037 --> 01:21:51,039
Look, I never promised Julie I'd be
exclusive and not see other women.

1317
01:21:51,544 --> 01:21:54,239
But I know she doesn't want
me to see them...

1318
01:21:54,546 --> 01:21:56,850
...so I lie to her
to keep from hurting her.

1319
01:21:57,424 --> 01:21:59,509
That's very convenient.

1320
01:21:59,925 --> 01:22:03,274
No, wait a minute.
Look at it from my side.

1321
01:22:03,554 --> 01:22:06,683
See, if a woman
wants me to seduce her...

1322
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:08,476
...I usually do.

1323
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:14,063
But then she pretends I promised her
something. Then I pretend I did.

1324
01:22:14,023 --> 01:22:16,109
In the end, I'm the one
that's exploited.

1325
01:22:16,525 --> 01:22:18,221
Bullshit, Ron!

1326
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:20,223
You know what?

1327
01:22:20,528 --> 01:22:23,355
I understand you a lot better
than you think I do.

1328
01:22:23,532 --> 01:22:24,662
Really?

1329
01:22:25,534 --> 01:22:27,097
I'm ready.

1330
01:22:29,536 --> 01:22:32,667
- Julie's ready.
- She sure is.

1331
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:35,717
Dorothy, she never wakes up.

1332
01:22:36,044 --> 01:22:38,956
But if she does,
there's applesauce in the fridge.

1333
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:41,416
Give her a couple spoonfuls.

1334
01:22:41,549 --> 01:22:44,245
I'm sure she...
Are you sure you'll be okay?

1335
01:22:44,552 --> 01:22:47,856
Don't be silly. How much trouble
can a baby be? Go on.

1336
01:22:48,555 --> 01:22:51,469
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.

1337
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:56,063
Oh, please don't cry.
Please don't cry.

1338
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:58,785
Oh, I love you.

1339
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:00,893
Look how much fun we're having.

1340
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:06,459
It's all right. It's all right.

1341
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,186
It's okay.
It's Uncle Dorothy.

1342
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:11,662
Please don't cry.
Please don't cry. Please.

1343
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:15,555
Oh, come on.
Oh, here's funny clown.

1344
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,497
Funny clown's talking to...
Look.

1345
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:20,215
Come on, Amy.
Hello, Amy.

1346
01:23:20,544 --> 01:23:23,372
Amy...
Give me a break, will you?

1347
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:26,983
Here, come on.
Will you eat some more now?

1348
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:30,482
You told me to open up this one.
Now this is apri...

1349
01:23:35,519 --> 01:23:37,212
Gotcha! Gotcha!

1350
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:39,301
You want a little more apricot?

1351
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:42,561
Don't do that anymore.
Don't do that to Aunt Dorothy.

1352
01:23:42,525 --> 01:23:44,395
You'll go to sleep after this.

1353
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,043
Just try this one,
and then I'll put you...

1354
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:52,461
I don't like you.
It's not funny.

1355
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:55,426
Amy, look at this.

1356
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,561
She'll have to paint the kitchen.

1357
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:01,276
Here, look at yourself.
You see what a bad girl looks like?

1358
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:27,084
Dorothy?

1359
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:30,804
I'll be right there.

1360
01:24:35,115 --> 01:24:36,377
How's Amy? Any trouble?

1361
01:24:36,617 --> 01:24:38,922
Oh, not at all.
She was an angel.

1362
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,903
Are you all right?

1363
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:42,599
Fine.

1364
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,413
What's the matter?

1365
01:25:10,649 --> 01:25:13,348
Tell the truth now.
Are you sure you're all right?

1366
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:15,281
No.

1367
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:17,157
Why?

1368
01:25:18,117 --> 01:25:20,334
Who am I going to have dinner with?

1369
01:25:21,243 --> 01:25:24,896
Oh, God! I hate myself
for being like this.

1370
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,493
- You know something funny?
- What?

1371
01:25:31,713 --> 01:25:34,974
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

1372
01:25:35,633 --> 01:25:39,374
But since I met you, I'm so grateful
to have you as a friend.

1373
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:41,416
And yet, at the same time...

1374
01:25:42,223 --> 01:25:45,266
...I've never felt lonelier
in my whole life.

1375
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:52,209
It's as though I want something
that I just can't have.

1376
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,710
You know what I mean?

1377
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:02,373
Do you?

1378
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,293
- Dorothy?
- Julie!

1379
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:13,493
- My God!
- Let me explain.

1380
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,884
Don't say anything.

1381
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,127
- There's a reason.
- I understand.

1382
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:20,172
That's not the reason.
I'm not who you think I am.

1383
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:22,936
- Just wait a minute.
- Nobody is.

1384
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,524
- It's me.
- No, it's me.

1385
01:26:24,507 --> 01:26:25,776
- No, it's me.
- No, it's me.

1386
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:28,093
I'm not well-adjusted enough.

1387
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,660
I'm sure I've got the same impulses.
Obviously, I did.

1388
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:34,772
Don't jump to conclusions about
that impulse.

1389
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:38,059
If you could just see me
out of these clothes...

1390
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:39,366
What? What?

1391
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,908
That's my father!
You've got to tell him.

1392
01:26:42,323 --> 01:26:44,149
- Tell him.
- Tell him what?

1393
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:45,897
That I...
That's a corncob.

1394
01:26:48,242 --> 01:26:49,373
Hi, Dad.

1395
01:26:49,828 --> 01:26:50,747
Fine.

1396
01:26:50,746 --> 01:26:53,226
I'm here with Dorothy.

1397
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,638
I can't tonight, Daddy.
But wait.

1398
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,039
You've got to see him.
Just don't lead him on.

1399
01:27:01,217 --> 01:27:04,478
- Please don't make me do this.
- You gotta let him down gently.

1400
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:07,106
- I can't.
- You owe me that.

1401
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:18,947
Hi, Les.
I'm fine. How are you?

1402
01:27:19,816 --> 01:27:21,905
Tonight, sure.
Tonight?

1403
01:27:25,237 --> 01:27:27,326
- What'll you have?
- Just water.

1404
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:29,845
- Water and bourbon.
- Make that a straight scotch.

1405
01:27:30,241 --> 01:27:31,983
Scotch and bourbon.

1406
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,461
I'd like to...

1407
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:36,267
- Let's dance.
- What?

1408
01:27:36,332 --> 01:27:39,245
- It's my favorite dance.
- Oh, really, I don't dance.

1409
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:40,880
- You'll love it.
- What?

1410
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:44,859
- Follow me. Follow me.
- Please, I don't...

1411
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:50,060
You know what? I'd...
Really, I'd rather not.

1412
01:27:52,806 --> 01:27:54,503
- Just relax.
- You're very good.

1413
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:58,288
- My wife and I took a course.
- I could tell at once.

1414
01:27:59,312 --> 01:28:01,922
- Emily, we love you.
- You're fabulous!

1415
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:03,663
- Just wonderful.
- Wonderful.

1416
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:06,556
- You're even prettier in person.
- Thank you.

1417
01:28:10,324 --> 01:28:13,238
I'm sorry. I forgot that
you're on your feet all day.

1418
01:28:13,326 --> 01:28:16,371
- Come on, sit down.
- Yes, I think we should stop.

1419
01:28:17,831 --> 01:28:19,614
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1420
01:28:19,914 --> 01:28:22,134
I was happy you could
come out tonight.

1421
01:28:22,419 --> 01:28:25,029
I know you usually
got a lot of lines to learn.

1422
01:28:25,337 --> 01:28:29,077
- There's something I'd better say.
- I want to say something too.

1423
01:28:29,343 --> 01:28:32,257
Wouldn't it be funny
if we both said the same thing?

1424
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:34,297
It'd be hilarious.
But I doubt it.

1425
01:28:34,429 --> 01:28:39,431
Well, mine's pretty simple.
I'm not too good with words anyway.

1426
01:28:40,309 --> 01:28:42,746
I only took two pictures in my life...

1427
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:45,726
...my high-school graduation
and my wedding.

1428
01:28:46,316 --> 01:28:48,316
My wife stood next to me in both.

1429
01:28:48,317 --> 01:28:51,970
I never thought I'd want anybody
to fill her place.

1430
01:28:52,406 --> 01:28:53,882
That changed last weekend.

1431
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:54,648
- Lester.
- Lesley.

1432
01:28:54,907 --> 01:28:56,475
- Lesley...
- Don't interrupt me.

1433
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:59,214
I gotta do this in one go
or I won't do it.

1434
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:02,457
I know this is kind of quick,
but that's how I am.

1435
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:05,834
Never did believe in
not getting down to it.

1436
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,896
Don't say anything now...

1437
01:29:08,337 --> 01:29:11,251
I know it's fast.
But take time to think about it.

1438
01:29:11,423 --> 01:29:14,553
If you say no, at least I'll feel
you took me seriously.

1439
01:29:14,927 --> 01:29:17,102
Would you mind?
I just need to be alone.

1440
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:20,432
I'd like to start thinking it over
as soon as possible.

1441
01:29:25,937 --> 01:29:27,154
Dorothy?

1442
01:29:29,441 --> 01:29:30,876
This is a nightmare.

1443
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:33,617
Don't be angry.
I had to talk to you.

1444
01:29:33,905 --> 01:29:36,208
- How'd you know where I live?
- I followed you.

1445
01:29:36,406 --> 01:29:40,711
- What? Followed me home?
- I didn't have the courage to phone you.

1446
01:29:40,911 --> 01:29:44,997
- Could I come up for a drink?
- No, you can't! I have a headache.

1447
01:29:44,913 --> 01:29:48,785
Please! I'll only take
a tiny moment of your time.

1448
01:29:49,419 --> 01:29:53,681
I'll see you on the set tomorrow
and we'll talk about it.

1449
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,925
Go home.
Have you been drinking?

1450
01:30:25,913 --> 01:30:29,565
Shh! Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind?

1451
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,215
Come on up!
I'm on the third floor!

1452
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:35,240
Hurry before someone
calls the cops!

1453
01:30:35,422 --> 01:30:36,898
Jesus!

1454
01:30:40,425 --> 01:30:42,514
Come in, but you can
just stay a minute.

1455
01:30:42,929 --> 01:30:46,885
Can I have a drink?
Anything alcoholic will do.

1456
01:30:47,516 --> 01:30:51,473
- Just one drink and I'll go.
- Oh, all right, but I...

1457
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:53,869
Nice mirror.

1458
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,944
Here.

1459
01:31:04,032 --> 01:31:06,510
What is it that couldn't wait?

1460
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:11,057
I'm just an untalented
old has-been.

1461
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:12,937
Were you ever famous?

1462
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:16,350
- No.
- Then how can you be a has-been?

1463
01:31:16,503 --> 01:31:19,982
I love the way you never let me
get away with anything.

1464
01:31:23,508 --> 01:31:24,683
- Dorothy...
- Yes?

1465
01:31:25,428 --> 01:31:26,993
- I want you.
- Pardon?

1466
01:31:27,512 --> 01:31:31,774
- I've never wanted a woman this much!
- Please! Perhaps another time.

1467
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,583
Turn me away, it'll kill me!

1468
01:31:34,018 --> 01:31:36,932
- I don't want emotional involvement.
- I'll take sex.

1469
01:31:37,022 --> 01:31:39,023
- I don't want to hurt you.
- I don't mind.

1470
01:31:39,024 --> 01:31:40,156
Oh, shit!

1471
01:31:47,616 --> 01:31:50,964
John Van Horn, Jeff Slater.

1472
01:31:52,037 --> 01:31:54,429
Jeff Slater, John Van Horn.

1473
01:31:55,123 --> 01:31:55,950
How do you do?

1474
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,040
How do you do?

1475
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,849
- I'll be going.
- I think it's best.

1476
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,552
- Gee, I hope I haven't...
- No, I hope I haven't...

1477
01:32:10,513 --> 01:32:13,557
I want you to know, for the record...

1478
01:32:14,017 --> 01:32:16,842
...that nothing happened here tonight.

1479
01:32:20,524 --> 01:32:22,479
Thank you, John.

1480
01:32:25,526 --> 01:32:27,397
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

1481
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:31,683
I didn't understand.
I'm really sorry.

1482
01:32:32,617 --> 01:32:34,097
Please don't talk about this.

1483
01:32:34,621 --> 01:32:35,662
My lips are sealed.

1484
01:32:44,129 --> 01:32:45,476
You slut!

1485
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:48,762
Look, don't start in with me.
Don't do that.

1486
01:32:49,133 --> 01:32:51,524
Rape is not a laughing matter.

1487
01:32:52,636 --> 01:32:53,854
That guy wanted me.

1488
01:32:54,138 --> 01:32:57,357
You cannot believe
the night I have had tonight!

1489
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,904
- I think I can imagine.
- No, you can't.

1490
01:33:00,102 --> 01:33:01,799
I saw his eyes.
I was in trouble.

1491
01:33:02,104 --> 01:33:05,365
If you don't come in,
I'm in the Daily News the next day.

1492
01:33:05,523 --> 01:33:07,088
How did you ever let him in?

1493
01:33:07,108 --> 01:33:09,934
What do you mean?
He was singing.

1494
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,919
- Is he that good a singer?
- What do you..?

1495
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:14,075
That's him!

1496
01:33:14,116 --> 01:33:16,723
Say I'm in the bedroom crying.
Don't let him in!

1497
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:18,074
Michael.

1498
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:19,625
It's Sandy.

1499
01:33:19,621 --> 01:33:21,403
Sandy?
It's Sandy?

1500
01:33:21,622 --> 01:33:23,796
I can't let her see me like this.

1501
01:33:24,124 --> 01:33:25,561
I hear you in there.

1502
01:33:26,627 --> 01:33:29,541
Open the door. It's me, Sandy.
Open the door!

1503
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:31,565
- Sandy, is that you?
- Yes!

1504
01:33:31,632 --> 01:33:34,764
What time is it?
I fell asleep, I guess.

1505
01:33:35,136 --> 01:33:37,701
I was having a nightmare
and you were in it.

1506
01:33:38,097 --> 01:33:39,271
Mike's in the shower.

1507
01:33:39,598 --> 01:33:42,426
I'm in the shower!
I got soap in my eyes!

1508
01:33:42,726 --> 01:33:46,162
I'm not dressed.
I was asleep. I was dreaming.

1509
01:33:46,105 --> 01:33:48,411
You were in my dream.
You had big teeth.

1510
01:33:49,108 --> 01:33:50,149
I had big what?

1511
01:33:50,232 --> 01:33:52,931
- I gotta get something on.
- Are you having a party?

1512
01:33:54,113 --> 01:33:56,114
I'm in the shower!
Turn on the water!

1513
01:33:56,114 --> 01:34:01,026
It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes
and there's no water coming out!

1514
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:03,207
I can't come out
with soap in my eyes!

1515
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,534
Open the door!

1516
01:34:06,623 --> 01:34:09,844
I can hear you in there, you guys.
Open the door!

1517
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:14,542
- Open this door.
- The door was open.

1518
01:34:14,714 --> 01:34:16,586
You must think I'm really stupid.

1519
01:34:16,635 --> 01:34:18,503
No one would say it to your face.

1520
01:34:18,636 --> 01:34:22,768
I've been out there for 10 minutes.
It sounded like a party in here.

1521
01:34:23,098 --> 01:34:25,839
Well, Mike was in the shower.
You know.

1522
01:34:26,102 --> 01:34:29,016
- Hi, I was taking a shower.
- He was in the shower.

1523
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,882
- Good shower?
- Good shower.

1524
01:34:31,106 --> 01:34:33,412
Why haven't you returned
my phone calls?

1525
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:35,827
I'll go do some writing.
Excuse me.

1526
01:34:36,695 --> 01:34:39,302
Wait, I'll be back.
I got a present for you.

1527
01:34:39,697 --> 01:34:40,616
Pigs!

1528
01:34:40,615 --> 01:34:44,354
I'm glad you came over.
I've been meaning to give this to you.

1529
01:34:44,703 --> 01:34:48,268
- I suppose this means nothing's wrong?
- Nothing is. Is it?

1530
01:34:48,706 --> 01:34:51,750
I've called you all week
and you haven't called back.

1531
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:53,710
- You treat me like I'm a jerk.
- What?

1532
01:34:54,213 --> 01:34:56,908
- I called and you didn't call back!
- No, it's...

1533
01:34:57,215 --> 01:35:00,869
My new answering machine is no good.
I'll answer my own calls.

1534
01:35:01,218 --> 01:35:06,220
- I went to six stores for your favorite.
- Chocolate-covered cherries?

1535
01:35:06,223 --> 01:35:08,310
That's sweet.
Oh, and a card.

1536
01:35:08,725 --> 01:35:11,335
Oh, yeah. No, no!
Don't, don't read it!

1537
01:35:11,727 --> 01:35:13,686
I was very angry when I wrote that!

1538
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:16,513
"Thank you for the lovely night
in front of the fire.

1539
01:35:16,733 --> 01:35:18,386
Missing you, Les."

1540
01:35:21,197 --> 01:35:23,631
This isn't for me.
It's another girl's candy.

1541
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:26,721
I wouldn't give you
another girl's candy.

1542
01:35:26,701 --> 01:35:28,397
- Then, whose is it?
- Mine.

1543
01:35:29,704 --> 01:35:31,488
A guy named Les sends you candy?

1544
01:35:31,707 --> 01:35:35,575
Yes. He's a friend of mine.
He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.

1545
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:39,363
Why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire?

1546
01:35:40,715 --> 01:35:42,062
My mind's a blank.

1547
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,982
Are you gay?

1548
01:35:48,723 --> 01:35:50,287
In what sense?

1549
01:35:50,306 --> 01:35:53,741
Just be honest with me.
For once in your life tell the truth!

1550
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:57,664
Because these stories
are very demeaning to me.

1551
01:35:58,233 --> 01:36:00,188
No matter how bad the truth is...

1552
01:36:00,692 --> 01:36:03,648
...it doesn't tear you apart inside
like dishonesty.

1553
01:36:04,196 --> 01:36:07,761
At least it leaves you with
some self-respect and some dignity.

1554
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,677
You're right.

1555
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:15,111
Okay. Okay.

1556
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:18,013
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

1557
01:36:19,793 --> 01:36:22,230
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Sandy...

1558
01:36:23,214 --> 01:36:25,302
I'm in love with another woman.

1559
01:36:27,303 --> 01:36:28,648
What are you saying?!

1560
01:36:28,718 --> 01:36:30,893
- Sandy, please. Don't...
- You liar!

1561
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,656
We never said "I love you."

1562
01:36:32,806 --> 01:36:34,894
- We went to bed one time.
- I don't care.

1563
01:36:35,309 --> 01:36:38,962
You're a dear friend. But let's not
pretend it was something else!

1564
01:36:39,314 --> 01:36:40,752
We're gonna lose everything!

1565
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:43,947
I don't care about "I love you!"
I read The Second Sex...

1566
01:36:44,317 --> 01:36:48,274
...and The Cinderella Complex!
I'm responsible for my own orgasms!

1567
01:36:48,196 --> 01:36:50,195
I just don't like to be lied to!

1568
01:36:50,698 --> 01:36:53,091
You asked me
to be straight with you.

1569
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:55,202
I didn't say
how I'd feel about it.

1570
01:36:55,328 --> 01:36:58,458
- What can I do?
- There's nothing you can do for me.

1571
01:36:58,832 --> 01:37:00,701
I just have to feel like this...

1572
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:03,533
...and you have to know
you made me feel this way!

1573
01:37:03,794 --> 01:37:05,492
- Aren't we still friends?
- No!

1574
01:37:05,798 --> 01:37:08,929
I don't take this shit from friends,
only from lovers.

1575
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:11,822
- Wait, what about the play?
- What about it?

1576
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:14,107
I should tell you to shove your play.

1577
01:37:14,304 --> 01:37:17,436
But I won't, because
I never allow personal despair...

1578
01:37:17,891 --> 01:37:19,892
...to ruin my
professional commitments.

1579
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,199
I am a professional actress!

1580
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:27,467
So, are these real
chocolate-covered cherries?

1581
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:29,971
I think so.

1582
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,584
- See you at rehearsal.
- Oh, Sandy...

1583
01:37:33,823 --> 01:37:35,563
Don't call me.

1584
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,206
It's 2 a.m.
Can't this wait?

1585
01:37:39,329 --> 01:37:42,024
I don't care.
Get me off this show in 10 days.

1586
01:37:42,415 --> 01:37:45,328
- It's impossible.
- Then I'm getting a new agent.

1587
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:47,882
You hurt my feelings.
What happened?

1588
01:37:47,922 --> 01:37:51,052
I told her about Julie.
She thinks I'm gay.

1589
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:53,908
- Julie thinks your gay?
- No, my friend Sandy.

1590
01:37:54,302 --> 01:37:55,563
Well, sleep with her.

1591
01:37:55,802 --> 01:37:59,237
- I did and she still thinks I'm gay.
- Oh, that's not so good.

1592
01:37:59,389 --> 01:38:02,652
I gotta get back to my life.
You got lots of lawyers...

1593
01:38:02,893 --> 01:38:05,502
...there must be a way to get
me out of this show.

1594
01:38:05,811 --> 01:38:09,334
- We've been through this.
- Why can't Dorothy have an accident?

1595
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:12,140
We can use our imaginations.
This isn't too tough.

1596
01:38:12,402 --> 01:38:16,054
Kill somebody and bring back the stiff,
but she'd better look like you.

1597
01:38:16,322 --> 01:38:19,974
- They don't miss a trick.
- These are nice, good people.

1598
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:24,282
Since when do you care so much
about what other people feel?

1599
01:38:24,413 --> 01:38:28,154
You should have seen Julie's face
when she thought I was a lesbian.

1600
01:38:28,919 --> 01:38:30,702
Lesbian?
You just said "gay."

1601
01:38:30,795 --> 01:38:33,316
Sandy thinks I'm gay.
Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.

1602
01:38:33,297 --> 01:38:35,689
- I thought Dorothy was straight.
- She is.

1603
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,365
Les, the sweetest man in the world,
asked me to marry him.

1604
01:38:39,928 --> 01:38:41,799
A guy named Les
wants to marry you?

1605
01:38:41,889 --> 01:38:43,801
Yeah.
No, wants to marry Dorothy.

1606
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,194
- He knows she's a lesbian?
- She's not!

1607
01:38:46,392 --> 01:38:48,612
- I know that, but does he?
- Know what?

1608
01:38:48,895 --> 01:38:50,982
That...
Well, I don't know.

1609
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:54,965
You know he gave me a ring?
He gave me a diamond ring.

1610
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:56,468
What did you say?

1611
01:38:56,904 --> 01:38:58,381
"I got to think it over."

1612
01:38:58,404 --> 01:39:01,970
I went in the ladies' room
and almost pissed in the sink.

1613
01:39:02,992 --> 01:39:05,080
Thirteen's up.
Ready 14.

1614
01:39:05,031 --> 01:39:07,079
Widen E.
Pull three to 130.

1615
01:39:07,999 --> 01:39:09,867
- Cut it.
- Stop tape.

1616
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,109
We're gonna take
a short break, people.

1617
01:39:13,419 --> 01:39:17,246
Hold it, hold it!
Slight change of plans, children.

1618
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:20,857
Our future ex-tape editor spilled
a bottle of celery tonic...

1619
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:24,123
...on the second reel
of the show airing today.

1620
01:39:24,389 --> 01:39:26,910
So we have to redo
Emily's party scene, live.

1621
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:28,803
- Live?
- Quick, like bunnies.

1622
01:39:28,893 --> 01:39:30,978
You have 26 minutes.
Get into wardrobe.

1623
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:33,917
- But Rita...
- You've only got a few lines.

1624
01:39:33,897 --> 01:39:36,726
Well, I don't see
why we can't use the tape.

1625
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,422
Just because it's a little sticky.

1626
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:50,585
Explain to them that
the hours have to be flexible.

1627
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:55,304
No...
And I would...

1628
01:39:59,507 --> 01:40:02,420
Can I call you back?
Thank you.

1629
01:40:07,012 --> 01:40:09,926
My God, Dorothy! I just...
Really, I can't.

1630
01:40:10,016 --> 01:40:11,449
It's for Amy.

1631
01:40:12,015 --> 01:40:14,408
Oh, thanks.

1632
01:40:14,519 --> 01:40:16,087
That's nice.

1633
01:40:16,523 --> 01:40:19,523
- I don't know how to say this...
- I wish you wouldn't.

1634
01:40:20,525 --> 01:40:25,004
I understand that you weren't able
to tell my dad last night.

1635
01:40:24,987 --> 01:40:30,120
So it'd be better for all of us
if I tried to explain it to him.

1636
01:40:30,493 --> 01:40:33,536
Look, I wouldn't be honest
if I didn't tell you...

1637
01:40:33,998 --> 01:40:37,780
...how much you've meant to me
these past couple weeks.

1638
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,132
You taught me how to stand up
for myself because you always do.

1639
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:47,658
You taught me to stop hiding
and just be myself...

1640
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:50,184
...because you're always yourself.

1641
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:52,774
I'm grateful to you.

1642
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,644
But...

1643
01:40:58,104 --> 01:41:00,103
Well, I just...

1644
01:41:00,605 --> 01:41:03,824
I just can't see you anymore,
you know?

1645
01:41:06,987 --> 01:41:12,119
I just feel it would be leading you on.
It wouldn't be fair to you.

1646
01:41:13,994 --> 01:41:16,602
I really love you, Dorothy.

1647
01:41:16,995 --> 01:41:18,868
But I can't...

1648
01:41:19,498 --> 01:41:21,371
I can't love you.

1649
01:41:21,501 --> 01:41:23,676
Places, everybody.
Immediately!

1650
01:41:24,505 --> 01:41:27,113
Fifteen seconds to commercial.

1651
01:41:28,507 --> 01:41:30,376
I don't care how you get there.

1652
01:41:30,593 --> 01:41:33,331
This is the most important night
in Emily's life.

1653
01:41:33,511 --> 01:41:38,078
We're all going to be there
to honor her, including you.

1654
01:41:44,189 --> 01:41:46,407
Stand by.
Quiet, please, on the floor.

1655
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:47,725
Stand by.

1656
01:41:47,816 --> 01:41:50,816
Twenty-two and 23
come down to 18.

1657
01:41:51,323 --> 01:41:52,670
Hold it.
That's good.

1658
01:41:52,823 --> 01:41:55,823
Five, four, three...

1659
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:05,617
Let's raise our glasses to our
guest of honor, Ms. Emily Kimberly.

1660
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:12,471
We're looking forward to having
you grace us with your presence...

1661
01:42:12,801 --> 01:42:15,409
...for many years to come.

1662
01:42:19,808 --> 01:42:23,242
Thank you, Gordon.
I can't tell you all how moved I am.

1663
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:24,962
I never in my wildest dreams...

1664
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:30,182
...imagined that I would be the object
of so much genuine affection.

1665
01:42:37,281 --> 01:42:41,456
It makes it more difficult for
me to say what I'm now going to say.

1666
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:47,045
I do feel it's time
to set the record straight.

1667
01:42:47,293 --> 01:42:50,031
I didn't come here
just as an administrator.

1668
01:42:50,294 --> 01:42:52,817
I came to this hospital
to settle a score.

1669
01:42:52,881 --> 01:42:53,751
What score?

1670
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,382
My father built
this hospital.

1671
01:42:56,384 --> 01:42:58,078
But to his family...

1672
01:42:58,385 --> 01:43:01,733
...he was an unmerciful tyrant.
An absolute dodo bird.

1673
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:02,932
Oh, no! Not live.

1674
01:43:03,391 --> 01:43:04,847
Let's see where she goes.

1675
01:43:04,823 --> 01:43:06,243
He drove my mother to drink.

1676
01:43:06,393 --> 01:43:09,524
In fact, she went riding one time
and lost all her teeth.

1677
01:43:09,813 --> 01:43:11,250
What? What?

1678
01:43:11,897 --> 01:43:15,553
- the oldest daughter, the pretty,
charming one, became pregnant...

1679
01:43:15,903 --> 01:43:18,597
...at 15 and was driven
out of the house.

1680
01:43:18,905 --> 01:43:23,906
She was so terrified that her daughter
would bear the stigma of illegitimacy...

1681
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:28,172
...she changed her name and contracted
a disfiguring disease...

1682
01:43:32,418 --> 01:43:36,549
...after moving to Tangiers, where
she raised the girl as her sister.

1683
01:43:37,007 --> 01:43:38,876
But her one ambition...

1684
01:43:38,883 --> 01:43:40,885
Any preference of shots
on this one?

1685
01:43:41,386 --> 01:43:43,603
- was to become a nurse.

1686
01:43:43,888 --> 01:43:47,673
So she returned to the States
and joined the staff right here...

1687
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:49,455
...at Southwest General.

1688
01:43:50,394 --> 01:43:52,394
She worked here
and had to speak out...

1689
01:43:52,396 --> 01:43:55,093
...wherever she saw injustice
and inhumanity.

1690
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,921
Don't you understand that,
Dr. Brewster?

1691
01:43:57,902 --> 01:43:59,161
I never laid a hand on her.

1692
01:43:59,485 --> 01:44:02,400
Yes, you did. She was shunned
by all you nurses too.

1693
01:44:02,905 --> 01:44:04,690
Give me something, one.
Not backs.

1694
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:07,299
Two and three go left and right.

1695
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:09,367
No, two go left!
Three go right!

1696
01:44:09,495 --> 01:44:12,104
Her outspokenness threatened
you doctors.

1697
01:44:12,415 --> 01:44:16,241
But she was deeply, deeply,
deeply loved...

1698
01:44:16,502 --> 01:44:18,287
...by her brother.
- Her brother?

1699
01:44:18,505 --> 01:44:20,983
This brother,
on the day of her death...

1700
01:44:21,007 --> 01:44:24,660
...swore to the good Lord above
he'd follow in her footsteps.

1701
01:44:24,886 --> 01:44:27,190
And, and, and...

1702
01:44:29,014 --> 01:44:31,274
...just, just, just...

1703
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:34,675
Don't, don't, don't panic.

1704
01:44:34,896 --> 01:44:38,243
...owe it all up to her!
But on her terms!

1705
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:39,526
Here come the terms.

1706
01:44:39,519 --> 01:44:41,176
As a woman...

1707
01:44:41,485 --> 01:44:44,616
...and just as proud to be a woman...

1708
01:44:45,488 --> 01:44:46,835
...as she ever was...

1709
01:44:49,494 --> 01:44:52,188
...for I am not Emily Kimberly...

1710
01:44:52,412 --> 01:44:55,327
...the daughter of Dwayne...

1711
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:58,476
...and Alma Kimberly.

1712
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:00,547
No, I'm not.

1713
01:45:02,506 --> 01:45:05,635
I'm Edward Kimberly,
Anthea's reckless brother.

1714
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:07,639
Holy Christ!

1715
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:13,251
Edward Kimberly, who's finally
vindicated his sister's good name.

1716
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:14,647
I'm Edward Kimberly.

1717
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,003
Edward Kimberly.

1718
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,238
- I'll be damned.
- I'm not mentally ill, but proud...

1719
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:24,568
...and lucky to be the woman
that was the best part of my manhood.

1720
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:27,335
The best part of myself.

1721
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:31,401
That is one nutty hospital.

1722
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:34,682
I knew there was a reason
she didn't like me!

1723
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:35,820
Cut it!

1724
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:37,323
Cut!

1725
01:45:54,597 --> 01:45:55,945
Does Jeff know?

1726
01:46:49,107 --> 01:46:50,456
Hey, Robert.

1727
01:47:00,075 --> 01:47:01,121
Hi, Les.

1728
01:47:02,579 --> 01:47:03,623
Get him!

1729
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:06,756
All right!

1730
01:47:09,086 --> 01:47:12,347
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Oh, come on.

1731
01:47:54,211 --> 01:47:57,214
- I thought you'd want it back.
- Outside.

1732
01:47:57,591 --> 01:47:59,679
Give it to me outside.

1733
01:48:11,186 --> 01:48:12,840
Why'd you do it?

1734
01:48:14,189 --> 01:48:15,843
I needed the work.

1735
01:48:18,693 --> 01:48:22,431
The only reason you're still living is
because I never kissed you.

1736
01:48:24,699 --> 01:48:27,092
I hope you enjoyed the chocolates.

1737
01:48:28,704 --> 01:48:30,660
I gave them to a girl.

1738
01:48:30,705 --> 01:48:32,879
So did I. I thought.

1739
01:48:35,084 --> 01:48:36,040
Do you like them?

1740
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:37,863
- Chocolates?
- Girls!

1741
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:41,392
I like Julie.

1742
01:48:43,175 --> 01:48:45,175
I think I love Julie.

1743
01:48:45,677 --> 01:48:47,984
Wearing a dress is
a funny way to show it.

1744
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:50,485
I know. I apologize.

1745
01:48:57,271 --> 01:48:59,575
The truth is,
you were okay company.

1746
01:49:00,692 --> 01:49:02,257
So were you.

1747
01:49:02,278 --> 01:49:04,496
I could have done
without the dancing.

1748
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:07,285
You know, you're very good.

1749
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:12,137
- I'm seeing a real nice woman now.
- Oh, really?

1750
01:49:13,203 --> 01:49:15,161
You think I didn't check her out?

1751
01:49:18,209 --> 01:49:20,079
Can I buy you a beer?

1752
01:49:22,672 --> 01:49:24,584
You got six bits.
Yeah.

1753
01:49:26,175 --> 01:49:28,045
Can I have a couple of beers?

1754
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:35,488
Does Julie ever mention me?

1755
01:49:48,197 --> 01:49:49,460
Taxi!

1756
01:49:56,287 --> 01:49:57,417
Thank you.

1757
01:50:31,281 --> 01:50:32,323
Hi.

1758
01:50:34,782 --> 01:50:36,870
I saw your father.

1759
01:50:38,786 --> 01:50:42,351
I drove up to see him
in that bar he hangs out at.

1760
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,226
He doesn't hang out there.

1761
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:46,988
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

1762
01:50:48,296 --> 01:50:50,471
- How's Amy?
- Fine.

1763
01:50:51,799 --> 01:50:56,279
Your dad and I had a couple of beers
and shot a good game of pool.

1764
01:50:56,304 --> 01:50:59,434
We had a really good time together.

1765
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:03,029
How's it going?

1766
01:51:06,272 --> 01:51:08,272
Terry Bishop's back on the show.

1767
01:51:08,273 --> 01:51:09,839
April lost her license...

1768
01:51:10,276 --> 01:51:13,190
- I meant with you.
- I know what you meant.

1769
01:51:18,281 --> 01:51:20,806
So you're pretty hot
after your unveiling.

1770
01:51:21,285 --> 01:51:22,763
What's your next triumph?

1771
01:51:22,788 --> 01:51:24,875
I'm going to do this play with...

1772
01:51:24,872 --> 01:51:26,568
Good. I've gotta catch a cab.

1773
01:51:28,792 --> 01:51:32,663
Can I call you sometime?

1774
01:51:37,386 --> 01:51:39,558
Look, I don't want to hold you up.

1775
01:51:40,304 --> 01:51:44,653
I just did it for the work.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1776
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:46,832
Especially you.

1777
01:51:58,863 --> 01:52:00,865
I miss Dorothy.

1778
01:52:03,368 --> 01:52:05,457
You don't have to.

1779
01:52:05,870 --> 01:52:07,044
She's right here.

1780
01:52:09,873 --> 01:52:11,354
And she misses you.

1781
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,404
Look, you don't know me from Adam.

1782
01:52:18,884 --> 01:52:23,057
But I was a better man with you,
as a woman...

1783
01:52:23,386 --> 01:52:26,085
...than I ever was with a woman,
as a man.

1784
01:52:26,389 --> 01:52:28,043
You know what I mean?

1785
01:52:30,895 --> 01:52:34,940
I just gotta learn to do it
without the dress.

1786
01:52:39,404 --> 01:52:42,839
At this point, there might be
an advantage to my wearing pants.

1787
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:52,131
The hard part's over,
you know?

1788
01:52:52,874 --> 01:52:55,178
We were already...

1789
01:52:55,878 --> 01:52:57,572
...good friends.

1790
01:53:07,471 --> 01:53:10,601
Will you loan me
that little yellow outfit?

1791
01:53:11,977 --> 01:53:12,934
Which one?

1792
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:16,565
- The Halston.
- The Halston?

1793
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:18,544
Oh, no!

1794
01:53:18,982 --> 01:53:20,763
You'll ruin it.

1795
01:53:21,485 --> 01:53:23,877
- You'll spill wine all over it.
- I will not.

1796
01:53:24,487 --> 01:53:28,967
I'll loan it to you, but you gotta
give it back. It's my favorite...

1797
01:53:28,992 --> 01:53:30,644
What are you gonna use it for?
