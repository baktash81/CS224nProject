<i>This is a true story,</i>

8
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,930
<i>but I can't believe
it's really happening.</i>

9
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,399
<i>It's a murder story, too.</i>

10
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,274
<i>I can't believe my luck.</i>

11
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,880
<i>And a love story,

12
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:57,690
<i>I know the murderer.</i>

13
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,528

<i>I know the time.</i>

15
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,303
<i>I know the place.</i>

16
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,578
<i>I know the motive,
and I know the means.</i>

17
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:24,784
<i>I know who will be the foil,
the fool, and the poor foal.</i>

18
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:29,454
<i>I couldn't stop them
even if I wanted to.</i>

19
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,467
You.

20
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,738
Always you.

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,983
<i>You can't stop people
once they start.</i>

22
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:00,820
Please...

23
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:05,821
<i>You can't stop people
once they start creating.</i>

24
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,998
<i>It all started three weeks ago</i>

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,601
<i>when I flew in on
a red-eye from New York.</i>

26
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,806
<i>Nobody in their right mind
wants to come</i>

27
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,474
<i>to London right now.</i>

28
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,842
<i>They're afraid
the crisis is going</i>

29
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,444
<i>to reach a conclusion,</i>

30
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,813
<i>that everything's going
to fall into chaos.</i>

31
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,682
<i>I thought I would be able
to find something</i>

32
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:33,849
<i>to write about.</i>

33
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:37,621
<i>See, I write fiction,
but my novels, um...</i>

34
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,858
<i>aren't really fiction.</i>

35
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,599
You have arrived
at your destination.

36
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,665
You know, uh,
not many people rushin' in

37
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,034
to merry ol' London town
these days.

38
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,670
<i>I answered
a personal ad</i>

39
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,705
<i>in The New York Review
of Books.</i>

40
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,741
<i>The celebrated writer
Mark Asprey</i>

41
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,912
<i>was offering up his apartment
for a swap.</i>

42
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,046
<i>He would have been
overwhelmed with responses</i>

43
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:05,684
<i>if it weren't for the crisis.</i>

44
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,653
<i>Instead, poor Mark ended up</i>

45
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,791
<i>with my shithole
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

46
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,024
Well, fuck me.

47
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,059
<i>And I got the keys</i>

48
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,462
<i>to his inspiring
three-bedroom flat</i>

49
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,163
<i>in the heart of London.</i>

50
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,064
<i>Mr. Samson Young.</i>

51
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,700
<i>Mr. Mark Asprey here.</i>

52
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,835
<i>Checking in to see
if you survived</i>

53
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,035
<i>your plane trip, mate.</i>

54
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:27,271
<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

55
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,940
<i>Do feel free, by the way,
to touch everything.</i>

56
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,075
<i>Everything in that place
has inspired a book</i>

57
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:36,011
<i>in some way,
or a million sales at least.</i>

58
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,214
<i>And I hope it does that
for you. I really do.</i>

59
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:40,217
<i>I-I'm sorry
it's not all finished.</i>

60
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,252
<i>You know, I'm refurbishing
the building</i>

61
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,587
<i>but this bloody
panic everywhere,</i>

62
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,956
<i>you just can't get
all the stuff you need</i>

63
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,860
<i>no matter how much money
you throw at the problem.</i>

64
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,729
<i>I left a copy of my
third novel on the desk.</i>

65
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,598
Crossbone Waters.

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,766
<i>It never hurts
to reread the classics</i>

67
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,204
<i>for a spot of inspiration.</i>

68
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:04,477
<i>Your place is just phenomenal.</i>

69
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:08,278
<i>I had no idea
this would be so...</i>

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,046
<i>wonderfully diminished.</i>

71
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,881
<i>As you know,
my latest character</i>

72
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,050
<i>lives in Hell's Kitchen,</i>

73
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:17,621
<i>and I think I might
make him even poorer.</i>

74
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,955
<i>It's just going
to be delicious,</i>

75
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,623
<i>and I can't thank you enough.</i>

76
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,258
<i>Oh, I just hope
you enjoy yourself.</i>

77
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,495
Hey, tiger.

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,895
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

79
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:29,000
<i>I do hope you get a chance
to enjoy the mirrors.</i>

80
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,236
<i>I do.</i>

81
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,611
<i>Anyway, see you, mate.</i>

82
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,794
<i>If London is a pub
and you want the whole story,</i>

83
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,830
<i>well, where do you go?</i>

84
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,832
<i>You go to a London pub.</i>

85
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,700
Oi!

86
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:08,037
Here he is. Samson Young.

87
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,007
My famous American friend.

88
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,010
- Now, here we got my boy Thelonius, Dean...
- Yeah, man.

89
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:17,580
...Zbig, Zbig 2,
Big Dred,

90
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,049
- Shakespeare...
- Shakespeare.

91
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,051
...Norvis, Fucker,

92
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,087
Bogdan, Juniper...

93
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:29,058
Yeah, that's Pepsi,
Pongo, and God.

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,596
And my mate, Guy Clinch.

95
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,164
Nobility, he is.

96
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,700
Yeah, he's like cousin
to the King

97
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,068
or Queen or something.

98
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,702
He had a bit of trouble
when he first come

99
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:40,936
into the Black Cross,

100
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,938
but I introduced him
to some faces

101
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,911
and now he's got
a face all on his own.

102
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,712
Guy Clinch, Samson Young.

103
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,847
- Pleasure to meet you, Samson.
- Sam's fine.

104
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,849
You know, Sam here
is newly arrived.

105
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,652
American. Writer.

106
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,988
Huh?

107
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,323
Well, fuck me.

108
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,959
- You all right, mon?
- Yeah, loan sharks.

109
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,327
Loan sharks?

110
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,096
Keith, you really
shouldn't be doing that.

111
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,298
What? Eh? Every time
I borrowed money

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,798
from you, I paid you back,
didn't I?

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,704
Well, no. You've never
actually paid me back.

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,739
Pleasure to meet you, Sam.

115
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,674
Yeah, you too.

116
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:21,645
Yeah, listen. You don't
loan money, do you, Sam, huh?

117
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,013
No, I'm just a broke writer.

118
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,618
Huh. Why should
they own me, right?

119
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:28,853
Yeah.

120
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,423
But I'm behind on me rent.

121
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,024
Two fucking weeks.

122
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,327
Listen, I appreciate
your trustworthy instincts.

123
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:38,661
Yeah, right.

124
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:39,695
<i>I had to borrow a pinch</i>

125
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:41,197
<i>from me old loan shark,</i>

126
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,368
<i>Kirk Stockist.</i>

127
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,168
<i>Trouble was,
I already owed a ton</i>

128
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,671
<i>for me darts training
and other expenses.</i>

129
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,106
I recognize the stench
but not the face.

130
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,676
<i>So then I had to
borrow money from Ashley Royal</i>

131
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,445
<i>to pay the vig
on Kirk's loan.</i>

132
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:56,949
You've got a week.

133
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,448
Then you suffer.

134
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,950
<i>Woulda been fine
had it not have been</i>

135
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,786
<i>for an unwise investment.</i>

136
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,354
So now I gotta borrow money

137
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,826
from me old mate
Chick Purchase.

138
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,928
<i>Trouble was, there's a bit
of bad blood between us.</i>

139
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,965
You know something?

140
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:17,299
I'm actually
fucking ecstatic

141
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,004
to loan you
as much as I can.

142
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,972
So that I can fuck you up
as hard as I can

143
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,306
when you don't pay.

144
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,743
Don't tickle me with that.

145
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,243
And, love...

146
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,746
it will not be
over quickly.

147
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,414
And I promise,

148
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,952
you will not enjoy it.

149
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,893
So, my advice to you...

150
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,029
is to celebrate
while you can...

151
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,366
go and drop a bit
on a bird, eh?

152
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,835
Now, all three
require payment,

153
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,006
immediate and in full.

154
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,380
Take care, love.

155
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,155
You don't play darts,
do you, sir?

156
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,291
I'll give you lessons
if you like.

157
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,859
Darts...

158
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,096
is destiny.

159
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,803
<i>My God.</i>

160
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,395
Do you have any
Gauloises cigarettes?

161
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,999
We don't sell
French fags here, darling.

162
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,299
Carlyle!

163
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,802
Come here.

164
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,102
Right.

165
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,037
Now.

166
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,271
Go and get this lady

167
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,573
her French snouts, will ya?

168
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,975
Go on. Fuck off.

169
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:09,345
Poor grieving girl, eh?

170
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,280
Is the world
against everything?

171
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,249
I've lived down the road
for over a year now,

172
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,321
and this is the first time
I've been in here.

173
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,922
Always wondered
what it was like.

174
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:20,925
Just never had the courage.

175
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,360
I suppose this is...

176
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,995
by way of having been
at a wake?

177
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,130
Yeah. Weren't family,
was he?

178
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,899
Not anyone I knew very well.

179
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,303
Still. Does you credit.

180
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,270
No, shows respect,
don't it?

181
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,239
<i>Here we are
at the event horizon</i>

182
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,810
<i>of a black hole.</i>

183
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,847
<i>Anything, including
matter and photons,</i>

184
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,484
<i>that pass this boundary
are unable to escape.</i>

185
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,855
A black veil.

186
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,358
It's ironic
how becoming it is.

187
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,195
One never gets enough
opportunity to wear one.

188
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,362
People should die
more often.

189
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,300
What's your name,
sweetheart?

190
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,202
Nicola Six.

191
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,170
What? Sex? Huh.

192
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,475
It's S-I-X.

193
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,884
Fuck off.

194
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,418
Thank you.

195
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,287
Now, huh.

196
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,992
An honor...

197
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,930
to service you.

198
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:49,581
You all right?

199
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,348
Sorry.

200
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,419
Thank you.

201
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,921
I must be leaving now.

202
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:00,191
You've been very kind.

203
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:06,395
Keith...

204
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,597
You're...
You're not, are you?

205
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,165
A girl like that?

206
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,400
A girl like what?

207
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,370
- Well...
- Mate, she's dreaming of it.

208
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,172
Yeah, she's begging for it.

209
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,106
She's just been
to a funeral, Keith.

210
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,578
Well, then
she's praying for it.

211
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:24,480
Life fucking goes on,
don't it, eh?

212
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:25,581
<i>With Keith and Guy,</i>

213
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,217
<i>I had two promising
story characters.</i>

214
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,555
<i>Two men forming
a social contrast.</i>

215
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:37,028
<i>But none of this would have
started without the girl.</i>

216
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,237
<i>There was no book
without the girl.</i>

217
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,342
You know, they say
the first thing that will go

218
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,246
with the hot sun
will be the flowers.

219
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,349
Won't be any more flowers.

220
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,454
Now, I see
a girl like you.

221
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,323
You know, bit of a beauty.

222
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,424
Head in the clouds, as such.

223
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:12,462
Now, me? I'm Handy Andy.

224
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,065
You know, I'm Mr. Fixit.

225
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,502
So what's your
phone number, Nick?

226
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,607
Of all things, she lives
in my building.

227
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:25,276
Remarkable.

228
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:29,412
<i>The pain kit
from Dr. Slizzard</i>

229
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,246
<i>arrived in good time.</i>

230
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:33,118
<i>Like a box of candy.</i>

231
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:39,991
<i>Why can't I do it?</i>

232
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,293
<i>Why can't I just write?</i>

233
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,467
<i>I write. I'm a writer.</i>

234
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>From the moment
Nicola's thoughts began</i>

235
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,454
<i>to be consecutive,</i>

236
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,491
<i>she knew two strange things.</i>

237
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,159
<i>I've always known
what was going to happen next.</i>

238
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:26,462
<i>The second was that
she must never tell anyone</i>

239
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,663
<i>about the first.</i>

240
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,165
<i>Hers was a specific kind
of fortune telling.</i>

241
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,870
<i>Nicola saw the death
of many, many things.</i>

242
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,737
<i>She knew her young friend
Dominique</i>

243
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:37,073
<i>would fall to her death.</i>

244
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:41,309
<i>How painful. I was
prepared for Mom and Dad.</i>

245
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,813
<i>She knew her parents
would die in a plane crash.</i>

246
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,582
<i>They both died,
together,</i>

247
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,885
<i>as I always knew they would.</i>

248
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,488
<i>So why love anyone?</i>

249
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,560
<i>I met the surviving
pilot and slept with him.</i>

250
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,430
<i>If the crash didn't
kill him, love would.</i>

251
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:03,632
<i>She saw the circles
of concentric devastation</i>

252
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:06,871
<i>with London like a bull's-eye
in the center of the board.</i>

253
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,175
<i>She knew that was coming.</i>

254
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:14,713
<i>Nicola knew when
her own story ended, too.</i>

255
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,882
<i>Some minutes after midnight...</i>

256
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,853
<i>on her 30th birthday.</i>

257
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,454
<i>Guy Fawkes Day.</i>

258
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,325
<i>Her final entry.</i>

259
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,592
<i>"In the Black Cross Pub."</i>

260
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,360
<i>I found my murderer.</i>

261
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,595
<i>"I found my murderer."</i>

262
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,665
<i>I met him.</i>

263
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,566
"Today."

264
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:46,909
- Yes?
- Oh, hello.

265
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,778
Uh, my name
is Samson Young.

266
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,612
I live downstairs.

267
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,582
Um...

268
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,301
Are you gonna sit down?

269
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,638
Thank you.

270
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,844
Okay.

271
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:24,382
So I, uh,
I read everything.

272
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,951
Look...

273
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm a writer.

274
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,956
Anything I might know?

275
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,959
I seriously doubt it.

276
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:40,799
Listen. I believe
your premonitions.

277
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,937
I believe you see
your death.

278
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,311
So who's going to kill you?

279
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,782
I don't know.

280
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,954
I just know
he was there yesterday.

281
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,893
I've always wanted to write
a murder novel, but I...

282
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:14,632
was never close
enough to it. I...

283
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:20,035
Um... I-I believe
I would have to be there,

284
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,440
recording it.

285
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:24,008
Would you let me do that?

286
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,379
I think you could be
my masterpiece.

287
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:33,752
Yes.

288
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,368
I know what you're thinking.

289
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,470
It's a gift.

290
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,007
And I'm going to take it.

291
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,608
Regardless.

292
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,945
<i>She was a great character.</i>

293
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,614
<i>A fascinating creature.</i>

294
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:08,487
<i>Compelling.</i>

295
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,889
<i>Self-destructive.</i>

296
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:15,925
<i>I had the makings</i>

297
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,963
<i>of a really snappy
little thriller.</i>

298
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,050
<i>She entered the Black Cross.</i>

299
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:42,150
<i>She entered the pub
and its murk.</i>

300
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:45,420
<i>She lifted her veil
with both hands like a bride.</i>

301
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:47,890
<i>Surveyed the main actors
of the scene,</i>

302
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,692
<i>and immediately
she knew, with pain,</i>

303
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,630
<i>within intense recognition,</i>

304
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,564
<i>that she had found him,
her murderer.</i>

305
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,002
I just had a deja vu.

306
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:04,707
<i>Nicola awoke
and heard the rain</i>

307
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,809
<i>and went back to sleep again.</i>

308
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:07,976
<i>Or she tried.</i>

309
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:11,714
<i>I want more</i>

310
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,015
<i>of that Mark Asprey.</i>

311
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,985
<i>That's what I want more of.</i>

312
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:17,686
<i>Not to be greedy, my love,</i>

313
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,822
<i>but you cannot expect
a girl to go gentle</i>

314
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:22,591
<i>into that good night
after having received</i>

315
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:24,563
<i>such an otherworldly fucking.</i>

316
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,602
Come in.

317
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,904
Mr. Handy Andy.

318
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,073
Are you famous?

319
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,044
Everyone has their dreams.

320
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:16,512
You want a drink
or something?

321
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:17,780
No, not for me, darling.

322
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:19,881
Work before pleasure, innit?

323
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:22,051
But you're already quite drunk,
aren't you, Keith?

324
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,954
<i>Fuck me.</i>

325
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:28,827
<i>Keith.
"Fuck me." Belches.</i>

326
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,197
Ow!

327
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,799
<i>Fuck it!</i>

328
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,104
Me fucking darts thumb.

329
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,269
Look.

330
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:42,971
Look, I know the knockers
take the piss

331
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:44,806
out of the sport
these days.

332
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:46,809
But I happen to have
reached the last 32

333
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,944
in the Duoshare Sparrow Masters.

334
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:51,846
You know, one more win
and Keith Talent here

335
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,082
will be televised.

336
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:57,456
- You're dripping blood.
- Eh? Oh.

337
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:01,792
Let me see.

338
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,696
Are you married?

339
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:08,967
No.

340
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:17,206
Well, me wife thinks she is.

341
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,207
How about children?

342
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,307
Oh, no. No, no, no.

343
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,578
God, no.

344
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,112
Yeah, a little girl we got.

345
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:26,617
Princess. Lovely, she is.

346
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,017
<i>What about you, eh?</i>

347
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,586
<i>You know what
babies do, Keith, don't you?</i>

348
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:32,890
<i>They ruin your figure.</i>

349
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,026
<i>And one other thing.</i>

350
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:38,561
The man you
introduced me to

351
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,930
the other day
at the Black Cross,

352
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,297
the posh one?

353
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,166
Oh, yeah.

354
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,935
Guy Clinch?

355
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:46,738
I'd like to meet him.

356
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,171
You could arrange that,
couldn't you?

357
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,109
<i>Have Guy call.</i>

358
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:55,947
And do it now, please.

359
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,750
Is it gonna be Keith?

360
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,052
Well, he's kind of
an animal presence,

361
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,186
wouldn't you say?

362
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,526
I bet he's an animal in bed.

363
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,128
But animals can be trained.

364
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,130
Can't they?

365
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:14,632
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,976
You know, I went round that Nicky's house.
You know, Nicola.

367
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,377
The one in the veil
in the Black Cross.

368
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:29,777
Right.

369
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,647
Now, I thought she
might want seeing to.

370
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,716
What, you mean her flat?

371
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:34,853
Don't be daft.

372
00:22:36,953 --> 00:22:37,886
Here.

373
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,293
No, she's a funny one,
that one.

374
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,793
One minute she's
coming on dead tasty.

375
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:46,698
And then the next minute,
she's Lady Muck.

376
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,297
So, did, uh...

377
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,365
Did anything happen?

378
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,102
Nah. Fuck all, really.

379
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,775
I took my leave,
and she's asking about you.

380
00:22:58,709 --> 00:22:59,777
The...

381
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,410
- About me?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:03,914
Wants you to phone her.

383
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,918
How, uh...

384
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,354
How exactly does she
require my help?

385
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:12,357
Don't ask me, mate.

386
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,026
Maybe she likes her own sort.

387
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,296
I'm going to take a nap.

388
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,066
- Hello.
- Do you mind?

389
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,242
Oh, yes.

390
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,109
Smashing wife.

391
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:36,311
Smashing wife.

392
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,149
Find out
how much Keith owes...

393
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,352
and take care of it.

394
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,956
You know, I told Keith
to have Guy call me.

395
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:49,661
I'm sure he will.

396
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:59,703
Keith. I couldn't ask you
a favor, could I?

397
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,805
To look after the child
for 20 minutes. It's my shift.

398
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:06,441
Of course I can. Ah.

399
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:08,944
Oh, no. I love
the little one.

400
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,845
What you doing?

401
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:13,050
You having a little war
on words, are you?

402
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,084
I got a book here
you might like.

403
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:18,887
Have a look at this book.

404
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:20,889
Yeah, nice picture book.

405
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:22,890
Kelly, that is.

406
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,362
She's a vegetarian.

407
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:30,001
Oh, you want some
of that? Here, go on.

408
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:34,002
That's it.
Breathe it right down.

409
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,273
Down like a man.

410
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,810
<i>You know, Guy seemed
so sweet and gentle.</i>

411
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,044
You know, he might be
capable of loving me.

412
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:46,948
It's Guy Clinch.
Is Nicola Six there, please?

413
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,217
<i>Speaking.</i>

414
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,918
<i>I'm not disturbing you
at all, am I?</i>

415
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
No, no, not at all.
I-I'd like your help.

416
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:55,424
If it wouldn't be too much
out of... out of your way.

417
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:56,859
Do you think we could meet?

418
00:24:56,861 --> 00:25:00,763
<i>She's setting up the
oldest conflict in the world.</i>

419
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,064
<i>Two men. One woman.</i>

420
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,268
<i>Someone dies.</i>

421
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:13,911
<i>Guy Clinch.</i>

422
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,345
<i>When he woke up in the morning,
there was no life.</i>

423
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:20,050
<i>So life could loom up
on him at any moment.</i>

424
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,986
So, just when things were
starting to finally open up

425
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,257
between my parents and I...

426
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,557
they died
in a plane crash.

427
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,829
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Nicola.

428
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,329
Thank you.

429
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:36,234
That's when I joined
the convent.

430
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,967
They sent me
to work in India

431
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:42,905
where I, uh, worked
in an orphanage there.

432
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:43,975
Wow.

433
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,180
Mmm.

434
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:55,085
Mmm.

435
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:57,855
Hmm.

436
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,126
I take it you're married?

437
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:06,131
Yes. Yeah.
Nine years now.

438
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,098
You must be a romantic.

439
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,199
- Like me.
- Funny though...

440
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:13,601
Romantic life never
quite matches up...

441
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:14,805
somehow.

442
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:18,877
Still, one must
never give up hope.

443
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:26,881
There was something
I wanted to ask you.

444
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,118
Yeah, of course.

445
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,585
So when I was
in the orphanage,

446
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:32,920
I was friends with
a little Burmese girl.

447
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,526
She was a few years
younger than me.

448
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,126
We were like sisters.

449
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:40,896
And I promised her one day
we would live together.

450
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:42,363
That I'd get her out.

451
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:45,033
But when I returned, I found
out that she'd been adopted

452
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,201
by a Saudi businessman.

453
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:48,469
Right.

454
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:50,104
She had his son.

455
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,305
God.

456
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,542
And when he washed
his hands of her,

457
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,513
she was repatriated
back to Burma.

458
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,348
Now she's not even
allowed back into England.

459
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,882
It's just such a mess.

460
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,853
Yeah.

461
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:06,053
I just figured you were
the sort of person

462
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,225
who might know someone.

463
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,094
Higher up.

464
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,062
Of course. Yeah, yeah.
I can... I can...

465
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:15,300
I can definitely try.

466
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,434
Her name is Enola Gay.

467
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:21,136
And her son
is simply known as

468
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,173
Little Boy.

469
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:25,309
Right.

470
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,643
Sorry, er...

471
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:31,112
Eno-Enola Gay, is it?

472
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,515
That's it. Nothing else.
Little Boy.

473
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:34,585
Yeah.

474
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:49,499
<i>All I know for sure
is the last scene.</i>

475
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:54,201
<i>The car, the car tool,</i>

476
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,106
<i>the murderer waiting
in his car.</i>

477
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:02,247
<i>The murderee
walking towards him.</i>

478
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,281
<i>But I don't know
how to get</i>

479
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:07,651
<i>to the dead-end street.</i>

480
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,094
Was that the car?

481
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,171
Guy is just so sweet.

482
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,109
So, it's gonna be Guy.

483
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,743
Well, it's his car,

484
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:37,079
and he's falling in love.

485
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,517
It normally ends
very badly with me.

486
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:45,019
<i>Guy Clinch was a good guy.</i>

487
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,390
<i>Or a nice one, anyway.</i>

488
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,690
<i>He worked
for the family business,</i>

489
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,192
<i>trying to keep tabs
on the proliferating hydra</i>

490
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,262
<i>of Clinch money.</i>

491
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:57,466
<i>Guy wanted for nothing
and lacked everything.</i>

492
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:00,401
<i>Guy had money, health,
handsomeness,</i>

493
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:01,602
<i>and he was lifeless.</i>

494
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:04,639
Nice joint
you got here. Yeah.

495
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:06,440
<i>For years, he'd been trying
to have a child</i>

496
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:07,945
<i>with his wife Hope.</i>

497
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,022
Excuse me.

498
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,354
<i>They used to worry
about the kind of world</i>

499
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:22,392
<i>they were bringing
their child into.</i>

500
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,704
<i>But when their prayers
were answered,</i>

501
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,371
<i>they worried
about what kind of child</i>

502
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:39,142
<i>they were bringing
into the world.</i>

503
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,182
<i>Guy always thought it was
life he was looking for.</i>

504
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:49,019
<i>But it must have been death.</i>

505
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,667
Keith, I've been waiting
for you all morning.

506
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,101
Would you take Kim
for a bit, please?

507
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,637
Nah, love, fuck off.

508
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,771
Look, I'm fucking busy,
all right?

509
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:11,540
I got me darts class to teach.

510
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,675
She's got the hiccups,
and I...

511
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:15,146
I-I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

512
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,446
Why, what's the matter
with you?

513
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,716
- Eh?
- Please.

514
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,249
Here, come here.

515
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:23,620
Eh? Come here, you.

516
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,656
I'm a dart.
What kind of dart am I?

517
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,857
You're the finisher.

518
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,225
Yeah, that's right.

519
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:31,759
What does a finishing dart do?

520
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:32,861
Bullseye.

521
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:34,332
You're a little angel,
you are.

522
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:36,334
Come on.

523
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,372
Premium shot, Samson.

524
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:44,538
Imagine the dart's
like a pen.

525
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,643
Write a love letter
to treble 13.

526
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:49,547
Sealed with a kiss.

527
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:54,051
Guy Fawkes Day's
coming up, Keith.

528
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:59,057
Here, darling.

529
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,363
You know what happened
to him, right?

530
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,266
No?

531
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,468
Oh.

532
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,236
Then today is your lucky day.

533
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:18,573
'Cause I'm like
a fucking historian, ain't I?

534
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,811
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

535
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,782
He was hanged,
drawn, and quartered.

536
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,820
And I know this might
sound unpleasant.

537
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:34,392
But I might just have
to fucking Guy Fawkes you.

538
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,328
I thought he was burned.

539
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:39,464
If they burned him...

540
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,865
he was already dead,
weren't he?

541
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,599
Know what I mean?

542
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,704
Ashes to ashes, like,
dust to dust.

543
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:49,838
What?

544
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,709
It's fucking dirt
and worms, mate.

545
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,845
It's fucking dirt
and worms.

546
00:31:58,815 --> 00:31:59,816
Ooh.

547
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,186
One more thing.

548
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:05,222
I bought out
all your debts.

549
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,359
So, no-one left
to borrow from.

550
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:17,634
She's lovely.

551
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:19,737
The little girl.

552
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,842
<i>I decided to send
the first three chapters</i>

553
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:31,213
<i>to my long-time publisher,
Missy Harter.</i>

554
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,352
<i>I knew Missy.
It was right up her alley.</i>

555
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,622
<i>Callous and sensational.</i>

556
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:40,423
<i>She wouldn't be able
to resist.</i>

557
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,368
<i>The normal accepted laws
of writing</i>

558
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,969
<i>are working backwards.</i>

559
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,706
<i>What started out
as reality fiction</i>

560
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,611
<i>is becoming more and more
unvarnished reality.</i>

561
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,879
<i>I have to keep reminding
myself that this is a story.</i>

562
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:06,814
<i>I'm writing a story.</i>

563
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,752
<i>If I can just get
the balance right.</i>

564
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:13,588
<i>501 up.</i>

565
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,760
<i>It's the Texas
Hold'em of darts.</i>

566
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,326
<i>The rules are pretty simple.</i>

567
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:22,730
<i>You have to score
exactly 501 points.</i>

568
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,332
<i>You go over, you bust.</i>

569
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,766
Play the game!

570
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:27,334
<i>That's about it.</i>

571
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:43,820
Come on.

572
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:34,872
The Black Cross Pub!
Tossing them out one by one!

573
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,422
Excuse me.

574
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:55,426
Not afraid?

575
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,926
<i>Nicola used to think that</i>

576
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:00,527
<i>she might be saved by love.</i>

577
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:01,899
<i>But it never happened.</i>

578
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,732
<i>She could make
a man feel he was,</i>

579
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,437
<i>at last, really living.</i>

580
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,737
<i>She could attract it.</i>

581
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,038
<i>She could bring love in.</i>

582
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,975
- Nicola.
- <i>Couldn't send love out.</i>

583
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,578
Coming.

584
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:26,587
<i>♪ She wore an itsy bitsy ♪</i>

585
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:29,656
Do you know the origin
of the word "bikini," Keith?

586
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:31,025
You what?

587
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:33,728
Bikini, it's from the
Bikini Atoll in the Pacific,

588
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,400
where the US conducted
atomic bomb tests.

589
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,073
I know all about
your money trouble, Keith.

590
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,010
And very soon...

591
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:49,979
I'm gonna give you
a lot of money.

592
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,818
Oh, I wanna believe
that you will.

593
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:01,755
Guy is supporting
a foreigner and her son

594
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,558
in their efforts
to escape Burma.

595
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,161
Very oppressed people.

596
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,565
Poor, unfortunate, really.

597
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:14,935
And you, Keith, can get 30,000
just for setting things up.

598
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:19,908
Nicola, I have some, er,
some rather bad news.

599
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,879
I thought that... Hello?

600
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:29,650
It's coming.

601
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:31,388
This is just a little...

602
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,690
to start you off.

603
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:40,895
Oh, Nicky.

604
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,130
Do you know
what that looks like?

605
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:45,632
A gun barrel in a holster?

606
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,006
Exactly.

607
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:57,814
You can have the money
if you don't touch.

608
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:05,022
The qualities
of patience and coolness

609
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:09,192
that I imagine you apply
to your darts, Keith...

610
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:12,495
apply to me.

611
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:20,036
Nicola?

612
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:25,575
You'll find with me...

613
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:30,180
when it rains, it pours.

614
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,156
And when it pours...

615
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,160
I get rather wet.

616
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,938
Take this.

617
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,009
And this. You don't have
to do anything nasty

618
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,676
with it, Keith. Just props.

619
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,879
For Guy.

620
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:07,084
Now, leave my flat.

621
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:11,752
Hello, mate.

622
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:12,756
Hello, Keith.

623
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,031
Nicola?

624
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,702
Sorry. I was just changing.

625
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:28,272
Hello.

626
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,142
It's lovely to see you.

627
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:34,945
Look, er...

628
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:39,149
Some bad news.
I made some calls. Um...

629
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,820
But I didn't come up
with anything in Burma.

630
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:45,756
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:47,690
I...

632
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:54,062
I'm not gonna stop trying.
I-I haven't given up.

633
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,196
Well, yet.

634
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,170
Seems a bit stupid now,
but I...

635
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,038
I bought you a gift. Er...

636
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,710
It's hardly a consolation prize,
but I thought it'd be...

637
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,613
something to cheer you up.
It's a...

638
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,879
It's a globe.

639
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:13,917
Obviously.

640
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:16,252
There's Burma.

641
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,219
Would you do me a favor?

642
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,623
Yes, of course.

643
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,690
Would you please take these
to a jewelry store

644
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:24,993
for me and sell them?

645
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,627
I'm sure they'll
just take advantage of me

646
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:28,064
if I try to do it myself.

647
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:30,868
They were my grandmother's.

648
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,167
I don't know
how much they're worth

649
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,701
but I think
it should be enough

650
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:36,073
to get me a plane ticket.

651
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,774
It's just that I got a call from
my Foreign Office friend yesterday,

652
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,978
and he's going to come
into London to talk to me.

653
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:44,946
He's found Enola
and Little Boy,

654
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:46,714
but there are warlords

655
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,181
and all sorts
of complications,

656
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:50,620
and they need to be paid
in order to get out and...

657
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,786
I don't know what else to do.

658
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:54,022
It's all right,
it's all right.

659
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,757
I think I should come
with you, all right?

660
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:56,961
It'll be safer.

661
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,600
I promised my friend
I would be alone.

662
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,433
Well, in that case,

663
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:09,770
I'll come
but I'll keep at a distance.

664
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:10,774
All right?

665
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,110
Look.

666
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,746
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

667
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:18,882
Everything from here on in.

668
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,987
You really are a good person.

669
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,057
Yeah.

670
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:31,225
Let's put these back
where they belong, shall we?

671
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:36,330
Oh, I'm sorry.

672
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:38,201
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

673
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:15,902
Mi Mi's mother's very sick

674
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:18,406
and we have to go
to Hong Kong.

675
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:21,042
She would very much like
to clean for you

676
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,145
when we get back.

677
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,781
Don't worry.

678
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:27,951
I understand completely.

679
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:30,016
Here's a check.

680
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:32,089
I'm sorry
the last one bounced.

681
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:45,533
Looks trustworthy.

682
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:48,439
What was his, er...
What was his estimate?

683
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:50,841
60,000.

684
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:55,111
60,000?

685
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:57,346
Right.

686
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:01,783
Can you find out whether
it's in pounds or dollars

687
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,886
or kyat, I think.

688
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:11,525
I'm so sorry to bring you
into all of this.

689
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,296
No, no, it's...

690
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,967
It's gratifying for me
to help, do you understand?

691
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:19,435
We're gonna save them.

692
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,105
Enola and her Little Boy.

693
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:26,342
It's pounds.

694
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:29,946
Right.

695
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:31,848
Of course.

696
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:33,917
I better get back to him.

715
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,877
It wouldn't change anything.

716
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:39,582
<i>I'm just playing my part.
Beginners' luck.</i>

717
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:49,323
I always knew I'd be killed
over an affair of the heart.

718
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,261
<i>Passion, love... You know.</i>

719
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,834
You shouldn't kiss me.

720
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:00,404
Fine.

721
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,114
<i>Nicola
purposely showed up late</i>

722
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:14,418
<i>to her dinner with Keith.</i>

723
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:19,053
Akbar!

724
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:20,687
Get her a fucking menu,
will you?

725
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:22,925
Double gin and tonic, please.

726
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,294
<i>"I'm on
a special diet."</i>

727
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,298
No food.

728
00:44:29,498 --> 00:44:31,998
Is there a good reason
why you're late?

729
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,536
Did you dress up for me?

730
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:38,205
You look so handsome.

731
00:44:38,207 --> 00:44:41,609
You remind me of the king
of Saudi Arabia.

732
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:44,245
<i>"I once slept,"
she said, "experimentally,</i>

733
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,413
<i>with the king
of Saudi Arabia."</i>

734
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:49,049
He had his men search
the entire world

735
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,120
for the most beautiful
women alive.

736
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:55,992
People do want value
for their money.

737
00:44:57,426 --> 00:44:58,725
Don't they, Keith?

738
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,430
Yeah, absolutely.

739
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:03,563
Absolutely they do.

740
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:05,636
The thing
about the king was...

741
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:25,652
<i>"The king never slept
with the same..."</i>

742
00:45:25,654 --> 00:45:27,187
...same woman twice.

743
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:29,056
When I was brought
to his room,

744
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:31,025
he laid out two lines

745
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:33,060
of the finest cocaine.

746
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,531
<i>When I was brought
to his room,</i>

747
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:41,171
he laid out
the most miraculous panties.

748
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:44,038
<i>"Knickers."</i>

749
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,075
Knickers.

750
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:47,607
<i>"Worth a fortune."</i>

751
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:49,011
...fortune.

752
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,516
They were
absolutely weightless.

753
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,156
Six weeks later,
there was a revolution,

754
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:04,025
and the king was dead
within a year.

755
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,197
And soon, Keith,
you'll be king, too.

756
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:32,622
If London is a spider web,

757
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:35,388
maybe I'm the fly.

758
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,559
Did you write that?

759
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:38,491
In my book?

760
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:39,528
Mmm-hmm.

761
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:42,295
To tell you the truth,
I feel pretty good

762
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:43,667
about my writing right now.

763
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:46,737
I think I'm doing
the best work of my life.

764
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:49,005
I picked up your book.

765
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:51,672
<i>Memoirs of a Listener.</i>

766
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:54,208
Yeah, let's change the subject.
How about that?

767
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,747
I'm not one of your
one-dimensional characters, Sam.

768
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,212
You've got to get that.

769
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:00,480
I'm pretty worried
that the critics

770
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:03,185
are gonna call you
a male fantasy figure.

771
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,223
I know your secret.

772
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,426
You do?

773
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:11,395
And what is it?

774
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,413
I'll race you
to the finish line.

775
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:32,282
Correction.

776
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:34,683
You go first, I go second.

777
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,189
Remember, I have to write it.

778
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:45,592
<i>I'm not in love with her.</i>

779
00:47:45,594 --> 00:47:48,265
<i>Something intertwines us,
but it isn't love.</i>

780
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,368
<i>With Nicola,
it's the other thing.</i>

781
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,303
<i>It's death.</i>

782
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:59,272
<i>There's no language for pain</i>

783
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,110
<i>except bad language.</i>

784
00:48:03,478 --> 00:48:06,179
<i>The single pill in the bottle.</i>

785
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:08,317
<i>That's for when the living
will envy the dead.</i>

786
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:12,688
<i>That's for the most
painful condition of all.</i>

787
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:14,825
<i>Life.</i>

788
00:48:17,826 --> 00:48:19,627
<i>Hello, mate. Mark.</i>

789
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,495
<i>Um... I finished
your book, and er,</i>

790
00:48:22,497 --> 00:48:26,500
<i>I've got to say
I so admire your nerve.</i>

791
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:28,839
<i>The endless contortions
of your prose,</i>

792
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:31,071
<i>so brave.</i>

793
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:34,208
<i>You know, an autobiography
is, uh, most of the time,</i>

794
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,408
<i>just success stories.</i>

795
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,279
<i>For a man to take up his pen
and tell a story</i>

796
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:43,419
<i>of continual failure.
Just so bloody brave.</i>

797
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,721
<i>Sales, success, and money
and acclaim,</i>

798
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:49,190
<i>they're not the measure
of an artist.</i>

799
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,894
<i>No, really, well done, mate.</i>

800
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,495
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Guy?</i>

801
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,864
I'm sorry
but I can't see you any more.

802
00:48:57,866 --> 00:48:59,632
<i>It's just too hard for me.</i>

803
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:02,435
I just don't trust myself
when I'm with you.

804
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:04,807
- <i>This has to be goodbye.</i>
- Nicola, you can't.

805
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:07,908
You can't. It's not fair.

806
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,976
I could never accept
your money.

807
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:12,245
<i>And please, don't worry
about my friends in need.</i>

808
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:13,948
Nicola, stop it.

809
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,748
All right? Stop it. You have to...
you have to let me help you.

810
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,520
- Sorry. Goodbye.
- <i>Nicola.</i>

811
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:35,338
- <i>Keith.</i>
- <i>I'm desperate.</i>

812
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:40,810
Where's the fucking money...

813
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,245
in that?

814
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:51,687
Are you doing me, young lady?

815
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,424
Huh?

816
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,694
Are you having me for a cunt?

817
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:01,661
'Cause I'm not having that.

818
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:03,700
- Keith.
- I'm not having that.

819
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,671
<i>The money is coming.
Trust me.</i>

820
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:10,506
I'm very good at this.

821
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:16,009
Go and see Guy.

822
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:17,810
Tell him this.

823
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:20,614
Tell him I'm pale and drawn
and pining away.

824
00:50:20,616 --> 00:50:22,549
And that I sit, staring
at the beautiful globe,

825
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:24,654
crying, and that
I'm selling off all my things.

826
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:26,855
Get out.

827
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:36,399
Hello, Keith.

828
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:40,500
Now, listen, mate,
I just popped round Nicola's,

829
00:50:40,502 --> 00:50:42,969
and between you and me,
it don't look too shrewd, mate.

830
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:45,071
Yeah, says to me,
"Don't fix this.

831
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:46,674
"Don't fix that.
It's not important.

832
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,011
What's the point?
There's no point."

833
00:50:49,411 --> 00:50:50,614
Says she's leaving London.

834
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,986
Yeah. Goin' to some place
with poppies

835
00:50:58,988 --> 00:51:00,487
and drug lords or something.

836
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:01,922
Y-Y-You don't think
she's gonna do that...

837
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:04,391
All this, mate,
it's too much.

838
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:05,792
I've never seen her so down.

839
00:51:05,794 --> 00:51:08,062
You know?
She just sits there,

840
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,397
spinning that little
globe thing.

841
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:12,368
As though she's been having
a bit of a cry.

842
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,471
I'm worried she might
do herself an injury.

843
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,919
I had a chill
run through me today.

844
00:51:35,457 --> 00:51:37,393
It's the feeling of life
leaving me.

845
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:40,794
My breath was shallow,

846
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,732
and my heartbeat
was really faint.

847
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:46,803
I guess I'm quitting,
whether I like it or not.

848
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:49,638
But goddammit, I can't go yet.

849
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:52,909
I still don't know
who you are.

850
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:00,649
But you know me.

851
00:52:06,788 --> 00:52:08,357
It's in my diaries.

852
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:10,760
I know you're beautiful.

853
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:15,864
And that the entire world
falls into you...

854
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:18,902
and does anything you want.

855
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:22,571
I mean, look at me.

856
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:24,574
And look at you.

857
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:27,643
I have no idea what it's like.

858
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,979
I can't imagine it.

859
00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:35,417
You just don't understand.

860
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:38,721
Look at me.

861
00:52:42,056 --> 00:52:43,125
Really?

862
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:47,997
Look at me.

863
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,370
No, it...

864
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,565
As you don't have
any living family member

865
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:27,003
to advise you,
I can't allow you to do this.

866
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:30,170
- What's this?
- Nothing.

867
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,172
You're leaving tomorrow?

868
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,477
- I can't let you do that.
- I'm sorry, Guy.

869
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,844
It's a bloody good thing
you did, all right,

870
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:39,882
because I'm
absolutely furious.

871
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:45,118
You have to take
this money, all right?

872
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,219
You have to.

873
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:48,187
- I couldn't.
- You have to.

874
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:49,755
I couldn't.

875
00:53:49,757 --> 00:53:50,924
<i>As a little girl,
Nicola did have</i>

876
00:53:50,926 --> 00:53:53,092
<i>a best friend named Enola Gay.</i>

877
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:54,531
<i>They were inseparable.</i>

878
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,165
<i>Enola shared in all
of Nicola's schemes</i>

879
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,067
<i>in domestic terrorism.</i>

880
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,236
<i>But the thing about Enola was</i>

881
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:05,205
<i>she came from inside the head
of Nicola Six.</i>

882
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:09,208
It's too much for me.

883
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,210
It's too much for me.

884
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:15,051
<i>She didn't exist,
so she couldn't die.</i>

885
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:22,788
<i>♪ Everything, even life ♪</i>

886
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,792
<i>♪ Seems to be made of ♪</i>

00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:30,663

Stop it.

906
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:22,311
Stop it.

907
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:25,181
You know it has to.

908
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:27,948
It has to happen

909
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,185
at least once.

910
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:32,355
You see, I can't.

911
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:38,327
I can.

912
00:56:57,212 --> 00:56:59,015
Be still.

913
00:57:00,314 --> 00:57:01,380

How do you feel
about me?

918
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:28,877
Truthfully.

919
00:57:33,948 --> 00:57:37,653
The truth is
you're a bad dream.

920
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:42,422
I keep thinking I'll wake up
and you'll disappear.

921
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,861
You're so alone, Sam.

922
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:53,435
Why am I
the only person with you?

923
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:04,113
People don't like

<i>It's a once in a lifetime...</i>

925
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:47,888
Yes?

926
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,357
- Good afternoon. I'm your new social worker.
- Where's Mrs. Ovens?

927
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:52,558
Is your husband
at home at the moment?

928
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,060
Yes. He's not been
well though. He's...

929
00:58:55,062 --> 00:58:56,495
I'm sure you're aware

930
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:58,265
of the dangers
of passive smoking?

931
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,366
I've been passively
smoking for years

932
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:02,301
and it hasn't
done me any harm.

933
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:04,504
- I'm afraid I might have to seek an order.
- Order?

934
00:59:04,506 --> 00:59:06,205
What?

935
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:08,975
I know we haven't got what
some do, but we are trying.

936
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:10,576
Yeah, you tell her, Kath.

937
00:59:10,578 --> 00:59:12,978
- You come in here...
- You haven't got any money.

938
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,948
Certainly not
enough for proper care.

939
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,951
There is nothing I wouldn't do
for my daughter!

940
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:20,219
My God.
Do you abuse your daughter?

941
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:23,290
And I can't say I like the look of that dog.

942
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:26,359
Oi! No-one talks
about my dog like that!

943
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:28,929
You fuck off out of it!

944
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:30,596
What kind of care
do you give people

945
00:59:30,598 --> 00:59:32,232
from an office?

946
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:35,868
Get out, you evil witch!

947
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,273
- Get the fuck out!
- Good day.

948
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:42,844
You don't let her touch you.

949
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:47,550
You are who you are.
All right?

950
00:59:57,491 --> 01:00:00,897
You know I'm gonna
fucking kill you, don't you?

951
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:02,998
Shall we say 8:00?

952
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:14,207
<i>This is London.
There are no fields,</i>

953
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:17,547
<i>only fields of operation
and observation.</i>

954
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:25,387
Sorry?

955
01:00:27,288 --> 01:00:28,924
I didn't say anything.

956
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:37,029
<i>The human being
can formulate</i>

957
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:38,364
<i>a strategy for death.</i>

958
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:40,333
<i>Gentle or defiant.</i>

959
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:42,101
<i>But then death
moves in completely</i>

960
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:43,303
<i>and decides
to run the show</i>

961
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:44,973
<i>at some point
near the end.</i>

962
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,641
<i>Nicola wasn't having
any of that.</i>

963
01:00:48,643 --> 01:00:50,377
<i>She would be
running things right up</i>

964
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:52,081
<i>to the very last second.</i>

965
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:55,348
You know,
I'm looking forward

966
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,518
to the eclipse.

967
01:00:57,551 --> 01:00:58,618
It's on my birthday.

968
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,058
No, no, no, no, no.

969
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:07,226
You shouldn't have come
to my place.

970
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:10,163
Never should have done that.

971
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:11,901
Now I know why.

972
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,636
You didn't want me
to see how you live.

973
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:17,937
You live like a pig.

974
01:01:17,939 --> 01:01:20,373
That is so fucking
out of order!

975
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,212
Sixty thousand Pounds.

976
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,547
That's more than you need

977
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:31,150
so that you could take care
of all your other troubles

978
01:01:31,152 --> 01:01:32,551
and clear your mind,

979
01:01:32,553 --> 01:01:34,289
<i>for what's really important.</i>

980
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:37,623
The big one.

981
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,091
The big one.

982
01:01:39,093 --> 01:01:40,493
Yes.

983
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:42,395
TV stardom.

984
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:44,397
Televised?

985
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,234
See, that's where you belong.

986
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:51,007
That is where everything
that you want is.

987
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,509
Including me.

988
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,045
All right?

989
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,949
You can have a taste now.

990
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:07,522
I said... a taste.

991
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:09,691
A taste.

992
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:14,027

Look. It's right there.
I even got extra for ya.

1013

- There's even extra in there.
- Go on, love. Have a look.

1014
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:58,565
- Extra?
- Yeah.

1015
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:01,266
- Count it.
- It's all there.

01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:02,337

1017
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,875
You're a smart man.

You're a smart fucking man

his fucking drugs.

1026
01:04:32,533 --> 01:04:33,732
Don't disappoint.

1027
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:35,768
- I really need a hug.
- A hug?

1028
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:41,406
- 'Cause the fucking floor's...
- Want me to hold you or something?

1029
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:43,576
You looked

1030
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:44,780
I'll tell you why.

1031
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:49,651
You're such a sweet,
sweet fucking boy.

1032
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:53,486

- Look, look, look at me.

1033
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:55,254
Look at me.

1034
01:04:55,256 --> 01:04:57,190
- There's no one else here.
- What?

1035
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,790
It's just you and me, man.

1036
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,527
Go on, open your eyes.

1037
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,428
- I got the fucking money.
- Open your eyes.

1038
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,667
- Fucking God. I had a bag of money.
- Where you want it?

1039
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:07,400
- Cock?
- No, not the cock.

1040
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:10,670
Is his name Jesus?
Tell me now.

1041
01:05:10,672 --> 01:05:12,804
- Is your cock's name Jesus?
- What?

1042
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:15,574
- Chick, it is now.
- It is now?

1043
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:16,909
Jesus fucking Christ.

1044
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:18,511
And he was nailed
to the fucking cross.

1045
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,312
- That's right.
- That's a nail.

1046
01:05:20,314 --> 01:05:22,281
I did it all for you.
Everything I've done.

1047
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:29,254
On my face.

1048
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:49,875
<i>It's the sort of darts</i>

1049
01:05:49,877 --> 01:05:51,978
<i>that Robin Hood
would be proud of.</i>

1050
01:05:56,817 --> 01:05:58,451
I understand
that in years past

1051
01:05:58,453 --> 01:05:59,986
you threw number three
for the pub, Keith.

1052
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:01,788
Then boof!
Here you are

1053
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,424
on a winning streak,
a contender for the throne.

1054
01:06:04,426 --> 01:06:06,326
Yeah, that's right.
It's very sweet, Tony.

1055
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:08,460
You know, uh, the pub's
two top darters,

1056
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:10,529
uh, Duane Kensal
and Alex O'Boye,

1057
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:12,167
were defeated by me
very recently.

1058
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:16,868
<i>So the Duoshare comes round,</i>

1059
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,737
<i>and, you know, it's given
me game a spirit, like.</i>

1060
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:20,676
You see,
I'm oozing confidence.

1061
01:06:23,611 --> 01:06:25,346
May Lady Luck
smile on you, Keith.

1062
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:27,282
Right.

1063
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:37,857
<i>There's something about
Keith when he's in this mood.</i>

1064
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:40,359
<i>He's so confident.
He's got talent, sure,</i>

1065
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:41,828
<i>but that swagger,</i>

1066
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:43,629
<i>how long can he keep it?</i>

1067
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,700
<i>And how far will it take him?</i>

1068
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:55,174
<i>Some say there's gonna be</i>

1069
01:06:55,176 --> 01:06:58,379
<i>a Chick Purchase rendezvous
a la darts.</i>

1070
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:02,281
<i>Fuck him.</i>

1071
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,484
<i>Oh.</i>

1072
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:07,522
<i>Uh, we apologize sincerely
for the language.</i>

1073
01:07:16,964 --> 01:07:18,297
<i>I can't believe</i>

1074
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:19,565
<i>it has taken me this long</i>

1075
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:22,567
<i>to realize why I felt
so strange in your place,</i>

1076
01:07:22,569 --> 01:07:25,370
<i>and it's because
I've kind of done this.</i>

1077
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:26,906
<i>I could've been you before.</i>

1078
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:28,775
<i>It's a character
I wrote in my third novel,</i>

1079
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:30,009
Crossbone Waters.

1080
01:07:30,011 --> 01:07:34,480
<i>And for all intents
and purposes, it was you.</i>

1081
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:35,948
<i>And I cut him in the end.</i>

1082
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,417
<i>The character was just too,
too depressing.</i>

1083
01:07:38,419 --> 01:07:40,719
<i>Just couldn't find
any truth in him.</i>

1084
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,888
<i>You're not frightened to face
the truth, are you, Samson?</i>

1085
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,623
<i>Don't be.
It doesn't serve you.</i>

1086
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,991
<i>It won't help.</i>

1087
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:47,926
<i>Anyway, who am I
to give advice?</i>

1088
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:50,062
<i>Just 'cause I've
sold a few more books than you.</i>

1089
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:51,864
<i>What do I know
about life and art?</i>

1090
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,444
<i>Some say there's gonna be</i>

1091
01:08:05,446 --> 01:08:07,013
<i>a Chick Purchase rendezvous...</i>

1092
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:09,614
I ain't playing the board,
know what I mean?

1093
01:08:09,616 --> 01:08:10,750
Fuck him.

1094
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:11,951
<i>Oh.</i>

1095
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:23,929
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

1096
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:25,698
<i>That's not what I hear.</i>

1097
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,368
Oh, yeah.

1098
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:35,877
Keith.

1099
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,715
Do you remember what it feels
like to be punished?

1100
01:08:44,986 --> 01:08:46,785
Come here.

1101
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:48,690
Oh, you know
Keith has another one now?

1102
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:51,694
- Really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

1103
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:54,627
Just around da corner.
The rich one.

1104
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:55,962
You know the one I mean.

1105
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:57,797
He be doing her arse off
every night.

1106
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,399
Dark personality bitch.

1107
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,868
What do you mean
I know the one?

1108
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:09,976
I'm innocent.

1109
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:16,915
See, I know you covet the bitch,
but she is his.

1110
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,019
Keith is a slayer.

1111
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,119
And one more thing,
she pays him for it.

1112
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:22,954
- What?
- Mmm.

1113
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:24,425
Keith is her toy boy.

1114
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:28,127
No, she has nothing
to do with Keith like that.

1115
01:09:28,129 --> 01:09:31,567
Don't be a fool now, man.
You follow the darts?

1116
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,404
<i>Nicola. It is the one.</i>

1117
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,683
"I was the only one
who ever mattered.

1118
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,120
"M.A."

1119
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:17,645
Nicola, you've killed me.

1120
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:37,433
Another writer.

1121
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,140
What happened
to your apartment?

1122
01:10:48,142 --> 01:10:49,508
An accident.

1123
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:50,912
Do you want to sit down?

1124
01:10:53,113 --> 01:10:54,683
What's wrong?

1125
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:58,950
Yeah,
I'll tell you what, Nicky.

1126
01:10:58,952 --> 01:11:00,686
I'm not gonna wash that
for a month.

1127
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:01,987
Pure filth, that was.

1128
01:11:01,989 --> 01:11:04,059
I'm sorry, I almost forgot
you were even here.

1129
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:07,192
Keith.

1130
01:11:07,194 --> 01:11:09,561
Hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll let me self out, shall I?

1131
01:11:09,563 --> 01:11:12,531
Thank you.
Goodnight, Keith.

1132
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:14,566
So, tell me...

1133
01:11:14,568 --> 01:11:16,602
I'm so sorry, but...

1134
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:17,770
What were you saying?

1135
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:19,707
Is he... Is he here
all the time?

1136
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:24,947
I teach him.

1137
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,146
You...

1138
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:29,649
You... You teach him.
I don't understand.

1139
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:32,183
I mean, it's not
that he's illiterate, exactly.

1140
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,186
I mean, he's really
picking up on it.

1141
01:11:34,188 --> 01:11:36,158
He's doing great
actually, but...

1142
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:39,991
You know, I gave him
his first copy

1143
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:41,259
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
the other day.

1144
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:43,228
- Just the other day.
- Hold on one second.

1145
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,599
Has he ever...

1146
01:11:46,099 --> 01:11:48,102
Has he ever done
anything to you?

1147
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:50,936
What do you mean?

1148
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:52,573
Has he ever tried
to fuck you?

1149
01:12:01,815 --> 01:12:03,785
How could you even
ask me that?

1150
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:08,588
I'm sorry, all right.
I'm so sorry. I just...

1151
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,691
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

1152
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:14,763
All right. I was just
being jealous. That's it.

1153
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:21,970
Nicola.

1154
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,238
Nicola.

1155
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,310
It's because I love you.

1156
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:31,212
That's why.

1157
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:38,185
I love you.

1158
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:41,622
I love you.

1159
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,604
<i>I just want
to protect you. I love you.</i>

1160
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,304
<i>I want you to have
the keys to my flat.</i>

1161
01:12:59,306 --> 01:13:01,910
<i>Thank you.</i>

1162
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,746
I'll be right back.

1163
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:27,868
Hi.

1164
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,209
Hello.

1165
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:48,790
It's okay.

1166
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:20,788
May I touch?

1167
01:14:21,922 --> 01:14:23,058
Yes, please.

1168
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,233
It's like a rock.

1169
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:35,437
Yes.

1170
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:43,111
<i>The kiss of death.</i>

1171
01:14:45,078 --> 01:14:46,911
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

1172
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:49,749
<i>Poisons and paralyzes.</i>

1173
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,286
There's something
I haven't told you.

1174
01:14:52,819 --> 01:14:53,822
What?

1175
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:56,725
I'm a virgin.

1176
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:01,761
Right. Okay.
Well, that's okay.

1177
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,096
Do you... Do you...
Do you want to stop?

1178
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:05,167
Do you think we should stop?

1179
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,804
No. No, it's okay.

1180
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:20,047
Oh, my God.

1181
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,953
<i>Nicola often found
herself imagining</i>

1182
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:29,457
<i>that she was
going out with God.</i>

1183
01:15:31,058 --> 01:15:33,325
<i>She had slept with him once.</i>

1184
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:36,031
<i>And once only.
Then never again.</i>

1185
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:39,734
<i>God cried in the street
outside her flat.</i>

1186
01:15:41,301 --> 01:15:43,968
<i>God got Shakespeare
and Dante working</i>

1187
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:46,004
<i>as a team
to write her poems.</i>

1188
01:15:46,006 --> 01:15:48,143
<i>Of course, there was
another man in Nicola's life.</i>

1189
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:50,277
<i>The Devil.</i>

1190
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:54,445
<i>Nicola gave herself
to the Devil</i>

1191
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:56,517
<i>because she wanted
to make God mad.</i>

1192
01:15:57,551 --> 01:15:59,517
<i>A jealous God.</i>

1193
01:15:59,519 --> 01:16:01,020
<i>He threatened
to wash his hands</i>

1194
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:02,290
<i>of the whole planet.</i>

1195
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,761
<i>He promised plague
and famine and terror.</i>

1196
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:11,132
<i>He threatened to make her old
and keep her that way forever.</i>

1197
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,104
<i>Nicola told him to get lost.</i>

1198
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:25,343
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What, what?

1199
01:16:25,345 --> 01:16:27,612
I just realized
something's terribly wrong.

1200
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:29,080
What, what, what, what?

1201
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:30,516
There's something
you have to do first.

1202
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:32,618
You want me to leave my wife?
I'll leave my wife.

1203
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,553
- I'll do it. I'll leave my wife. That's fine. That's fine.
- No, no, no, no.

1204
01:16:35,555 --> 01:16:37,188
What, what, what?

1205
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,124
I don't want you to leave her.
I want you to tell her.

1206
01:16:40,126 --> 01:16:42,293
It's bad enough
what we're doing.

1207
01:16:42,295 --> 01:16:44,230
It could harm her more
if she doesn't know.

1208
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,500
You want me to...

1209
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:48,267
- Okay?
- You want me to...

1210
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:50,071
- You want me to tell my wife?
- Okay?

1211
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:55,076
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

1212
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:57,011
Okay, that's fine.

1213
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:00,215
Okay.

1214
01:17:02,015 --> 01:17:03,515
Okay, that's fine.

1215
01:17:03,517 --> 01:17:04,885
<i>It's okay.</i>

1216
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,044
<i>Samson, Mark.</i>

1217
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:32,477
<i>Talk to your neighbors.
Get in there.</i>

1218
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:34,482
<i>I would. Well, I did.</i>

1219
01:17:51,431 --> 01:17:53,635
<i>This was
the fifth of November.</i>

1220
01:17:55,403 --> 01:17:57,305
<i>This was horror day.</i>

1221
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,312
<i>I wasn't in love with Nicola.</i>

1222
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:10,115
<i>Something intertwined us...</i>

1223
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:11,085
<i>but it wasn't love.</i>

1224
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:17,125
<i>With Nicola,
it was the other thing.</i>

1225
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:23,064
<i>Death.</i>

1226
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:41,248
Happy birthday.

1227
01:19:14,081 --> 01:19:15,317
Did he, uh...

1228
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:19,487
Did he love you?

1229
01:19:28,261 --> 01:19:30,465
Did Mark write about you?

1230
01:19:36,303 --> 01:19:37,604
He was afraid of me.

1231
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:44,746
He found a way to escape.

1232
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:47,715
Without the story.

1233
01:19:48,648 --> 01:19:50,317
Without being in the story.

1234
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:17,144
This is the dress
of my dreams.

1235
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,820
<i>Unofficial
declaration of war.</i>

1236
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:29,253
<i>A nuclear...</i>

1237
01:20:29,255 --> 01:20:32,758
<i>Where the undefeated
Chick Purchase</i>

1238
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,793
<i>will play the eighth seed
Keith Talent</i>

1239
01:20:35,795 --> 01:20:37,329
<i>in the Black Cross Pub.</i>

1240
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:40,268
<i>Good luck, Keith.
You'll need it.</i>

1241
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:42,401
Probably sound
more dramatic

1242
01:20:42,403 --> 01:20:43,772
than it really is
I expect but...

1243
01:20:46,273 --> 01:20:47,409
There's someone else.

1244
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:49,807
It seems to me that
there's been a need

1245
01:20:49,809 --> 01:20:52,177
to redefine our relationship.

1246
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:10,764
You should have lied about it.

1247
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:18,839
Would you like to know
how the story ends?

1248
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:23,875
Or you could always imagine
whatever you want to.

1249
01:21:23,877 --> 01:21:25,843
No matter what's going on
in the world,

1250
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:28,614
you can always imagine
anything you like,

1251
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:29,850
and It'll make you happy.

1252
01:21:31,184 --> 01:21:32,653
Okay?

1253
01:21:56,743 --> 01:21:57,910
Package for you, sir.

1254
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:59,681
Oh. Thank you.

1255
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:22,601
Okay, so where's
the actual pub?

1256
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:23,668
Pub?

1257
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,770
You know,
where's the crowd

1258
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:26,737
and the birds and that?

1259
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:28,339
We use cutaways

1260
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:31,375
and just slug in fake audience
reaction shots later.

1261
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:33,678
There's never anybody here.

1262
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,617
What you see at home
is 100 percent TV magic.

1263
01:22:39,853 --> 01:22:41,456
<i>Love is blind.</i>

1264
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:47,362
<i>But it makes you see
a blind man.</i>

1265
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:55,769
<i>It makes you search him out
with eyes of love.</i>

1266
01:23:03,443 --> 01:23:05,444
<i>After years of war
and revolution,</i>

1267
01:23:05,446 --> 01:23:07,215
<i>dreams and imagination,</i>

1268
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:10,285
<i>love is a big idea.</i>

1269
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:12,750
<i>It's thought police.</i>

1270
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:14,889
<i>It's a knock on the door
at 3 a.m.</i>

1271
01:23:15,788 --> 01:23:17,655
<i>Love makes you
bring on World War Three</i>

1272
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:18,692
<i>for a piece of ass.</i>

1273
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,427
<i>Enola Gay was
the plane that flew</i>

1274
01:23:22,429 --> 01:23:23,631
<i>the mission to Hiroshima.</i>

1275
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:28,469
<i>The pilot named the aircraft
after his mother.</i>

1276
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,806
<i>He was once her little boy.</i>

1277
01:23:32,706 --> 01:23:35,243
<i>But Little Boy was the name
of the atom bomb.</i>

1278
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:39,645
<i>It killed 50,000 people</i>

1279
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:42,250
<i>in 120 seconds.</i>

1280
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,952
Ah, there's Chick.

1281
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,855
You certainly gotta
respect his style.

1282
01:24:23,857 --> 01:24:26,928
Well, he's got some nick,
and he's got the pull.

1283
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:31,429
Yeah, who's that
with him?

1284
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:33,432
It's Julian Neat.

1285
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:35,503
Agent to the darting stars.

1286
01:24:36,937 --> 01:24:40,504
As always,
looking fabulous, Chick!

1287
01:24:40,506 --> 01:24:42,309
Thanks ever so much.

1288
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:54,522
Hey, baby girl, eh.

1289
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:58,589
Oh, Chick, mate.

1290
01:24:58,591 --> 01:25:02,362
Listen, let's say we forget
any past unpleasantries, eh?

1291
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:05,963
What is a stunner
of this stature doing

1292
01:25:05,965 --> 01:25:08,335
with a fucking trog like you?

1293
01:25:09,068 --> 01:25:10,401
Eh?

1294
01:25:10,403 --> 01:25:13,571
Seriously! The mind boggles.

1295
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:19,410
What is it, narcissistic
personality disorder or...

1296
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:21,413
Ah, got it.

1297
01:25:21,415 --> 01:25:24,719
Likes to be watched. Eh?

1298
01:25:26,553 --> 01:25:28,820
I love
to be watched.

1299
01:25:28,822 --> 01:25:30,491
I would too,
if I was her.

1300
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:33,894
Innit, Keithy? Or is it not?

1301
01:25:35,461 --> 01:25:36,927
Okay, you lot.

1302
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:38,700
Pre-match interview.

1303
01:25:43,537 --> 01:25:47,004
In five, four, three,
two, one.

1304
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:58,482
A real treat in store
for you this evening.

1305
01:25:58,484 --> 01:26:00,886
To my right,
the one and only

1306
01:26:00,888 --> 01:26:03,789
Chick "Cock 'o
the Walk" Purchase.

1307
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,660
And to my left,
Keith Talent.

1308
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:09,895
- So...
- Tony, sir,

1309
01:26:09,897 --> 01:26:11,998
I'm Keith Talent,
"The Finisher."

1310
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:15,534
Right. Chick?

1311
01:26:15,536 --> 01:26:17,002
To be quite frank,

1312
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:19,838
I just hope it's not too
one-sided really, you know.

1313
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,010
For the sake of the sport,
for the sake of darts, like.

1314
01:26:24,944 --> 01:26:26,714
For Queen
and country really.

1315
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:30,582
Got it. Brilliant.
Thanks, lads.

1316
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:31,885
Thirty seconds, yeah?

1317
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,489
Looking a bit
out of sorts, Keith.

1318
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:48,033
<i>Keith Talent,
the young upstart</i>

1319
01:26:48,035 --> 01:26:50,904
<i>from the Black Cross
will throw first.</i>

1320
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,784
<i>That's a fine start
from Keith.</i>

1321
01:27:05,786 --> 01:27:07,788
<i>He's come
in with a ton 40.</i>

1322
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,026
- All right, Chick.
- Come on, Chick.

1323
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:18,166
<i>But what does
the maestro have?</i>

1324
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:21,701
<i>What a star he is.</i>

1325
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:25,003
<i>Whoa! You can say
you don't believe it,</i>

1326
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,070
<i>but there we go.</i>

1327
01:27:26,072 --> 01:27:27,774
<i>That's how to start
a game of darts.</i>

1328
01:27:31,778 --> 01:27:33,147
Get on with it.

1329
01:27:34,915 --> 01:27:37,214
<i>There's one.
There's two.</i>

1330
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,551
<i>And Chick is...
What's Chick doing?</i>

1331
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:40,988
<i>He's toying with him.</i>

1332
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:43,890
What a shock.

1333
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:47,995
<i>Oh! That is
a schoolboy error.</i>

1334
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:53,231
<i>This is man against boy.</i>

1335
01:27:53,233 --> 01:27:55,901
<i>This is boy against man.</i>

1336
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,973
Whipline throw from Purchase.
Get your darts out.

1337
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,547
<i>Can he keep it together</i>

1338
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,785
<i>on the biggest stage
of his life?</i>

1339
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,588
<i>Well, he's getting
a bit finished off here.</i>

1340
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,758
<i>I'm not sure
he's really concentrating.</i>

1341
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,596
<i>I'm not sure his mind's here.</i>

1342
01:28:24,797 --> 01:28:26,897
<i>He's responded
remarkably well</i>

1343
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:29,036
<i>with that treble 20
to start off the leg.</i>

1344
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:31,869
Nicola.

1345
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:33,204
- I have.
- Nicola.

1346
01:28:33,206 --> 01:28:34,940
What?

1347
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:36,941
I think you should
come home with me now.

1348
01:28:36,943 --> 01:28:38,310
Please.

1349
01:28:39,746 --> 01:28:40,878
Nicola.

1350
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,013
I think you should
come home with me.

1351
01:28:43,015 --> 01:28:44,585
Oh, don't be
ridiculous.

1352
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:48,719
Come with me!

1353
01:28:51,925 --> 01:28:54,258
Hey, don't be a cunt!

1354
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,695
Hey, it's game over, mate.

1355
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:59,964
Yeah, yeah.
It's fucking game over.

1356
01:28:59,966 --> 01:29:01,301
Please, all right?

1357
01:29:02,269 --> 01:29:03,905
She's coming home with me.

1358
01:29:06,139 --> 01:29:08,873
She's coming home with me.

1359
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:11,276
Yeah, for more of
what she got last night.

1360
01:29:15,114 --> 01:29:16,216
Fuck off.

1361
01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:27,625
Yeah. Ain't that right,
girl. Eh?

1362
01:29:27,627 --> 01:29:28,763
Hardly.

1363
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,192
<i>Keith, are you with us?</i>

1364
01:30:32,091 --> 01:30:34,828
<i>Of all the forces,
love is the strangest.</i>

1365
01:30:35,862 --> 01:30:38,797
<i>Love can make a woman
pick up a bus,</i>

1366
01:30:38,799 --> 01:30:41,636
<i>or can crush a man
under the weight of a feather.</i>

1367
01:30:42,803 --> 01:30:44,369
<i>Or it just lets
everything go on</i>

1368
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:45,940
<i>as if it was yesterday...</i>

1369
01:30:48,207 --> 01:30:49,809
<i>and will be tomorrow.</i>

1370
01:30:53,345 --> 01:30:55,813
<i>Samson, Mark.</i>

1371
01:30:55,815 --> 01:30:57,852
<i>Slightly in my cups,
so I'm gonna...</i>

1372
01:30:59,019 --> 01:31:01,386
<i>say some
uncomfortable things, mate.</i>

1373
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:05,155
<i>I know you're envious
on some level of me.</i>

1374
01:31:05,157 --> 01:31:08,128
<i>Many levels, probably.
And I can't blame you.</i>

1375
01:31:09,295 --> 01:31:10,994
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

1376
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:13,798
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1377
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,868
<i>It doesn't matter
what anyone writes anymore.</i>

1378
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,038
<i>The time for it mattering
has passed.</i>

1379
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,173
<i>Truth doesn't matter anymore</i>

1380
01:31:23,175 --> 01:31:26,080
<i>and is not wanted.</i>

1381
01:31:27,514 --> 01:31:29,717
<i>Lower the flag, mate.</i>

1382
01:31:31,283 --> 01:31:32,420
<i>Anyway.</i>

1383
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:36,357
<i>See ya.</i>

1384
01:32:04,117 --> 01:32:05,119
Keith!

1385
01:32:12,526 --> 01:32:13,493
I'm gonna do her.

1386
01:32:16,429 --> 01:32:18,065
I'm gonna
fucking do her.

1387
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,566
Eh, look what
she's done to me!

1388
01:32:21,568 --> 01:32:23,000
Look what
she's done to me!

1389
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:24,401
Oh, you want some?

1390
01:32:24,403 --> 01:32:27,271
Oh, you fucking
want some, do ya?

1391
01:32:27,273 --> 01:32:29,209
Come on. Eh?

1392
01:32:30,277 --> 01:32:32,977
Come on then!
Fucking come on then!

1393
01:33:34,174 --> 01:33:36,274
- I lost it.
- I know.

1394
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:39,246
I lost it.
I lost it.

1395
01:33:40,313 --> 01:33:42,146
Could you take him
to Thatcher Tower,

1396
01:33:42,148 --> 01:33:43,414
Golborne Road.

1397
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:44,915
If you could help him
upstairs, please,

1398
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:46,219
if you don't mind?

1399
01:33:59,532 --> 01:34:01,168
Look what
she's done to me.

1400
01:34:04,069 --> 01:34:05,872
Just get out
of the car, Guy.

1401
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:09,042
Look at what
she's done to me!

1402
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:12,576
I want you
to listen to me.

1403
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:14,247
Get out
of the car.

1404
01:34:26,926 --> 01:34:30,130
Look what
she's done to me, Sam.

1405
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:01,258
<i>This is a true story,
but I can't believe</i>

1406
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,360
<i>it's really happening.</i>

<i>I can't believe my luck.</i>

1410
01:35:14,273 --> 01:35:16,676
<i>It's a love story,

1411

You.

1418
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:07,493
Always you.

<i>The equation
she was working on</i>

1421
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:21,407
<i>And love was dying.</i>

1422
01:36:23,343 --> 01:36:24,674
<i>It was fixed</i>

1423
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:26,576
<i>from that first moment
in the Black Cross</i>

1424
01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:29,382
<i>when she looked my way
with eyes of recognition.</i>

1425
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:33,420
Please.

1426
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:40,424
<i>I should have understood
that a cross has four points.</i>

1427
01:36:40,426 --> 01:36:41,627

<i>You can't stop people

1430
01:38:23,496 --> 01:38:25,466
<i>There are two kinds of titles.</i>

1431
01:38:26,565 --> 01:38:29,200
<i>The first kind of title
decides on a name</i>

1432
01:38:29,202 --> 01:38:30,871
<i>or something
that is already there.</i>

1433
01:38:33,273 --> 01:38:36,343
<i>The second kind of title
is present all along.</i>

1434
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:40,848
<i>It lives and breathes...</i>

1435
01:38:41,947 --> 01:38:44,517
<i>or it tries, on every page.</i>

1436
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:09,673
<i>If love travels
at the speed of light,</i>

1437
01:39:09,675 --> 01:39:11,209
<i>then it can have other powers</i>

01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,280
<i>just on the edge
of the possible.</i>

1439
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:18,385
<i>It can create impressions
on those left behind.</i>

1440
01:39:20,519 --> 01:39:24,424
<i>Like a sun, trying to shine
right across the universe.</i>

1441
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:26,894
<i>It was me.</i>

1442
01:39:27,794 --> 01:39:29,296
<i>Always me.</i>

1443
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:31,732

<i>Mark Asprey,</i>

1447
01:41:14,635 --> 01:41:16,933
<i>with his new novel,</i>
London Fields.

1448
01:41:16,935 --> 01:41:19,369
<i>It's such an honor
to have you here today.</i>

1449
01:41:19,371 --> 01:41:20,570
<i>Just for a treat
to our audience,</i>

1450
01:41:20,572 --> 01:41:22,673
<i>could you read a little bit
from your novel?</i>

1451
01:41:22,675 --> 01:41:23,744
<i>Certainly.</i>

1452
01:41:25,444 --> 01:41:28,713
"After sex,
she'd whisper,

1453
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:29,815
"'That's what I am,

1454
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,650
"'a black hole.

1455
01:41:32,652 --> 01:41:34,321
"Nothing can escape me.'

1456
01:41:35,354 --> 01:41:37,687
"She had the power
of inspiring love

1457
01:41:37,689 --> 01:41:39,123
"almost everywhere.

1458
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,691
"She received it,

1459
01:41:40,693 --> 01:41:43,694
"was empowered by it,
and returned it,

1460
01:41:43,696 --> 01:41:46,733
not merely negated,
but murdered."

1461
01:41:47,767 --> 01:41:49,600
Thank you.
That was great.

1462
01:41:49,602 --> 01:41:52,669
You know, I'm just
going through this,

1463
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:55,438
and i-it doesn't
sound like you.

1464
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,609
I-It... The kind of prose
it is written in,

1465
01:41:58,611 --> 01:42:00,677
the immediacy
of the language,

1466
01:42:00,679 --> 01:42:02,480
the whole style
of this,

1467
01:42:02,482 --> 01:42:04,882
it feels like
a real tectonic shift

1468
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:06,883
that reads more
like a memoir really.

1469
01:42:06,885 --> 01:42:08,718
This is not the voice

1470
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,054
of the Mark Asprey
that we all know.

1471
01:42:11,056 --> 01:42:13,093
My audience, my readers...

1472
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:17,497
deserve this level
of authenticity.

1473
01:42:18,797 --> 01:42:19,832
No matter what the...

1474
01:42:20,832 --> 01:42:24,000
the cost
to me as an artist.

1475
01:42:24,002 --> 01:42:26,003
And I'm prepared
to shoulder that.

1476
01:42:26,005 --> 01:42:27,341
<i>Buy the book.</i>

1477
01:42:29,474 --> 01:42:30,977
