1
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,947
Any signs got my name on them?

2
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,850
Quite a few.

3
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,950
What do they say?

4
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,855
The usual.

5
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,955
'Death to Rosenberg”...

6
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,957
'Retire Rosenberg”...

7
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,668
'Cut off the oxygen. ”

8
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965
That's my favourite.

9
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,592
Of course, you,
Mr Grantham...

10
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,028
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

11
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,228
'Rosenberg equals
the government...

12
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,377
...over business...

13
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,609
...the individual over government,

14
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,840
the environment over everything...

15
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,313
...and the Indians, oh,

16
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,219
give them whatever they want.'

17
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,555
With all due respect,

18
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,931
that wasn't my line,
that was a quote.

19
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,781
From one of your unnamed

20
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,056
Senior White House officials.

21
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,743
Senior White House bastard,

22
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,063
you should have said.

23
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,731
Got in there by...

24
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,581
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

25
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,464
Never fails to amaze me...

26
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,384
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

27
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,391
Yes?

28
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,494
Looking for Mr Sneller.
Mr Sneller?

29
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,539
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

30
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,447
Hello.
Everything is in place.

31
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,511
All the money must be there...

32
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,851
...when I arrive in Zurich.

33
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,912
It will be there
if the job is finished.

34
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,872
It will be finished.

35
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,443
May I help you?

36
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,449
I'd like to order room service.

37
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,874
What would you like?
#NAME?

38
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,937
...scrambled eggs,
whole-wheat toast...

39
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,121
...and orange juice, please.

40
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,582
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

41
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,293
When we substitute
threat for an argument...

42
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,630
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

43
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,799
...to overcome our
capacity for reason.

44
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,819
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

45
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,625
...which brings us...

46
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,848
...to Bowers against Hardwick.

47
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,432
A police officer
entered Mr Hardwick's...

48
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:14,645
...apartment to serve
him a warrant...

49
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,981
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

50
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,631
They caught him with an open beer.

51
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,237
When he entered
Mr Hardwick's bedroom...

52
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,887
...he found him in bed with a man.

53
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,200
The officer arrested Hardwick...

54
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,501
...for violating
Georgia's statute...

55
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,829
...which outlaws sodomy.

56
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,206
Even though Georgia
dropped the case...

57
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,813
...Hardwick challenged...

58
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,168
...the constitutionality
of the statute.

59
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,268
Now, what was his claim?

60
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,988
That it violates the
right of privacy.

61
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,088
Why?

62
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,109
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

63
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,498
But what if he decided
to sell drugs...

64
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,598
...at his home or
engage in child abuse?

65
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,647
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

66
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,858
The court, beginning
with Griswold...

67
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,597
...has limited the
right of privacy...

68
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:04,069
...to actions which
are intimate...

69
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,199
...which are deeply personal,

70
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,866
which allow us to
control our lives...

71
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,743
...to define who we are.

72
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,646
But is that a
constitutional claim?

73
00:09:12,746 --> 00:09:13,746
There's no...

74
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,284
...right to define oneself...

75
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,874
...written into the Constitution.

76
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,876
It's not even in
the Bill of Rights.

77
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,748
If the State of
Georgia can regulate

78
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,962
Hardwick's sexuality...

79
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,856
...engaged in private
with consenting...

80
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:25,382
...adults, Hardwick
cannot be free.

81
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,093
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

82
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,899
If there's no right of privacy...

83
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,972
...and Georgia can
enforce the statute...

84
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,233
...we sacrifice the
liberty the framers...

85
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,809
...thought they'd guaranteed us.

86
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,061
The Supreme Court
disagreed with you.

87
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,411
They found that the statute...

88
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,064
...did not violate
the right of privacy.

89
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,441
Why?

90
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,541
They're wrong.

91
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,945
So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

92
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,931
Sexual attraction.

93
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,408
You mean he's just got it?

94
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,268
Does he ever.

95
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,978
What you're saying...

96
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,868
...is that if you could clone...

97
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,816
...three of him,
you'd all be happy.

98
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,835
Okay, tell us, what
is your secret?

99
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,219
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

100
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,466
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

101
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,718
A very big secret.

102
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,039
My goodness gracious.
I can't believe my ears.

103
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,958
Hope my mom's not watching.

104
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,668
She hopes so too.

105
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,336
Ma, I was just kidding.

106
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,791
Ladies, have you changed...

107
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:47,297
...your opinion about our stud?

108
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,397
You still like him?

109
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,902
I like big guys.

110
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,686
I think your fan
club has increased.

111
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,738
Everything has increased.

112
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,956
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

113
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,133
His nurse was also murdered.

114
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,184
Jensen was found
two hours later...

115
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:50,314
...in some queer club.

116
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,474
Voyles called me, wildly upset.

117
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:55,164
It's hardly good for
FBI's reputation.

118
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,893
He and Giminski are on the way.

119
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:57,446
Giminski?

120
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,310
Yes. The CIA should be involved,

121
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,324
at least for now.

122
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,032
You must wait two
hours to address...

123
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,907
...the nation if we
want an audience.

124
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,361
A coat and tie may
seem a bit rehearsed.

125
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:09,583
How about a cardigan?

126
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,235
You want me to talk
to the nation in a...

127
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,379
...time of crisis
wearing a sweater?

128
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,479
Mr President...

129
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,822
...I've already told Justice...

130
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:21,053
...to put together
a list of nominees.

131
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,378
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

132
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,615
Mr President.

133
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
Mr Voyles,

134
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,187
does the FBI have any suspects?

135
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,688
It's too soon.

136
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,483
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

137
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,702
I would like to have a report...

138
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,530
...on your security and
where it broke down.

139
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,880
You're assuming it broke down.

140
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,957
We have two dead
judges, both of whom...

141
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:47,287
...were being
protected by the FBI.

142
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,627
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

143
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,963
Are these killings in any way...

144
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,377
...linked to the CIA...

145
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,477
...or to any other agency...

146
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,714
...of the United
States government?

147
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,716
I'm shocked you'd think that.

148
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,991
Bob, just look into it, okay?

149
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,852
I suggest we meet
back here at five.

150
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,405
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

151
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,799
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

152
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,283
Your approval ratings will go...

153
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,905
...through the roof.

154
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,200
That's the weather...

155
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,325
...in New Orleans.
This is Tim Bellew.

156
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,994
We interrupt our program now...

157
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,245
...for a special bulletin.

158
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,623
In a special address,
live from the White House...

159
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,573
...the president of
the United States.

160
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,519
My fellow Americans...

161
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,024
...our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

162
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,733
Last night...

163
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,282
...Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

164
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,532
...were assassinated.

165
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,107
These assassinations may be an...

166
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,940
...attempt to strike
at the very fabric...

167
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
...of our government.

168
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,378
But I can assure each...

169
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,212
...and every American...

170
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:08,039
...that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

171
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,955
Everything...

172
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,059
...is being and will be done
to bring the culprit...

173
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,062
...or culprits to justice.

174
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,230
For justice must...

175
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,482
...and shall prevail.

176
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,243
I wish you could have known him...

177
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:30,224
...when I used to clerk for him.

178
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,549
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

179
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,810
That's why they killed him.

180
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,004
That mind was still a threat.

181
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,774
But why kill him now,

182
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,274
when he had so little time left?

183
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,417
Maybe they couldn't
take a chance...

184
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:47,116
...he'd last till the elections.

185
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,016
So why Jensen?

186
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:49,827
This president nominated him.

187
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,027
He and Rosenberg had almost...

188
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:54,086
...nothing in common.

189
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,209
That's what they should look for.

190
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:00,009
Decisions on which
they both agreed.

191
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,505
Boy, if there ever was a moment...

192
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,605
...for a drink...

193
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,111
One day at a time, right?

194
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,554
We're talking a conspiracy,

195
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:25,571
then who are the conspirators?

196
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,051
If we've let foreign
terrorists in,

197
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,568
there'll be hell to
pay politically.

198
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,815
The intelligence
community can't be...

199
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,038
...blamed for a weakness
in immigration.

200
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,808
Denton, who are your suspects?

201
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,144
This has to be kept very quiet.

202
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,481
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

203
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,983
At least 11 Underground
Army members...

204
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,054
...have been in the D.C. area...

205
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,454
...and we suspect
them in at least...

206
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:55,726
...100 bombings of
abortion clinics...

207
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:56,679
...porno houses,

208
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,479
gay clubs all over the country.

209
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,429
The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

210
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,293
Correct?

211
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,171
Watch your claws.

212
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,213
Gray Grantham covers the

213
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,833
Supreme Court for the
Washington Herald.

214
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,437
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg...

215
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,317
...before he was shot on,

216
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,424
as it turned out,
the day he died.

217
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,736
Did he say anything
that might shed...

218
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,929
...some light on
these dreadful events?

219
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,806
Yes. He spoke about things...

220
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,330
...off the record,

221
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,327
appropriately for
a sitting justice.

222
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,125
But I think it would
be appropriate...

223
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,272
...to quote him now.

224
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,842
He said, 'The campaign waged...

225
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,609
...by the president
was so ruthless...

226
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,723
...in its manipulation of the...

227
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:50,030
...middle-class fears
of minorities...

228
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,722
...had been so exploitive
and divisive...

229
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:55,285
...that it created a
climate of distrust.'

230
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:59,135
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

231
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,095
Everyone wants to know...

232
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,960
...when you're starting
classes again.

233
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
That includes me.

234
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,238
You know what they say:

235
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:10,738
Drinking makes depression worse.

236
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,806
What do they
recommend for anguish?

237
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,139
Where've you been?

238
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,103
The library. I
studied a printout...

239
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,642
...of the Supreme Court docket.

240
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,472
I even made a list of
possible suspects.

241
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,231
And then threw it away...

242
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,406
...because they'd be
obvious to everyone.

243
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,854
Then you looked for areas

244
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,987
Jensen and Rosenberg
had in common.

245
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,280
Exactly.

246
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,187
Jensen generally
protected the rights...

247
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,826
...of criminal defendants.

248
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,494
Some notable exceptions.

249
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,274
He wrote 3 majority opinions...

250
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:40,998
...protective of the environment.

251
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,900
And almost always supported...

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,876
...tax protestors.

253
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,496
So they might have
been assassinated...

254
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:48,589
...by an insatiable tax collector?

255
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,983
As yet, I rule no one out.

256
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,591
Everyone is assuming the motive...

257
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:54,845
...is hatred or revenge.

258
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,621
Or an attempt to influence...

259
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,515
...the social agenda of the court.

260
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,017
What if the issue involved...

261
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,518
...old-fashioned material greed?

262
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,768
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

263
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,076
Can I help you?

264
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:08,780
I'd like to see this file, please.

265
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,527
Why?

266
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,446
It's public record, isn't it?

267
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,546
Semi-public.

268
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,200
Are you familiar with...

269
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,850
...the Freedom of Information Act?

270
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,038
This file has the pleading...

271
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,411
...and correspondence.

272
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:24,625
The rest is discovery
and the trial.

273
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,376
When was the trial?
Last summer.

274
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,879
Went on for 2 months.
Where's the appeal?

275
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,279
Not perfected yet.

276
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:33,004
I think the deadline
is August 1st.

277
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,406
So, who done it?

278
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,693
You have some obscure
suspect unknown...

279
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,646
...to the FBI and the CIA and...

280
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,106
...Secret Service...

281
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,317
...and 10,000 police departments?

282
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,417
I had one...

283
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,796
...which I have now discarded.

284
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,679
You skipped class,
ignored me for a...

285
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,577
...week, just to throw it away?

286
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,677
Let me see it.

287
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,229
Don't laugh. It was
ludicrous of me...

288
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,001
...to think I could solve it.

289
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,101
Hubris of the young, huh?

290
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,814
Don't knock the
hubris that I love.

291
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,112
I'm leaving tomorrow.

292
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,525
I'm going up to
Rosenberg's memorial...

293
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,615
...in Washington.

294
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,092
I went through
Rosenberg's decisions...

295
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,192
...the other night...

296
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,908
...and in the back of my mind...

297
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,531
...there's an idea...

298
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,491
...to do a book on him.

299
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,591
No one could do it better.

300
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,138
I started making notes...

301
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,015
...about what he meant to me:

302
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,740
surrogate father,
mentor, you know.

303
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,485
I started to get very thirsty.

304
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,100
I deserted you this week.

305
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Not the greatest timing.

306
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,719
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

307
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,667
It's Alice.

308
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,906
Want to come out with
me for a burger?

309
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,006
No, thanks.

310
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,636
It might do you good to get out.

311
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,428
I'm fine, thanks.

312
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,514
You sure?
Yes.

313
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,059
Okay, bye.

314
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,800
Hey, Sarge.

315
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Hey, son.

316
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,097
Dark coffee, three sugars.

317
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,057
So how's the president?

318
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,157
Which one?

319
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,770
Not Coal, the real one.

320
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,605
Cool and mellow.

321
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,275
Would you believe
he's all tore up...

322
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,375
...about Rosenberg?

323
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,793
And all fired up about...

324
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,962
...restructuring the court.

325
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,866
Thinks it'll make
his place in history.

326
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,591
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

327
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,194
There's a short list of nominees.

328
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,244
The original had 20 or so names,

329
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:35,626
then they cut it to
8. I gave you 2.

330
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,756
What about the investigation?

331
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,769
I haven't heard much...

332
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,871
...but I'll keep my ears open.

333
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,384
I know you will. Thanks.
#NAME?

334
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,969
I'll see you later.

335
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,069
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

336
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,283
Martini, please.

337
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,996
Good day.
Good to see you.

338
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,916
Another coffee, please.

339
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,225
You read the Grantham article.

340
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,769
It had me running around all day.

341
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,373
Coal blasted the
director, saying the...

342
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,660
...judges' names were
leaked by the FBI.

343
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,649
The director said Coal
had leaked them...

344
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,540
...himself to test the waters.

345
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,818
Coal ran the most
divisive campaign...

346
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:17,918
...in 20 years...

347
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,493
...and the president did nothing.

348
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,276
I'd like to have seen your name...

349
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:24,716
...on this list of judges.

350
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,104
We all voted you...

351
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:28,679
...most likely to make the court.

352
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,990
These days, it's hard enough...

353
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,063
...just to make my class.

354
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,742
How old is she, this time?

355
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,956
Twenty-four. But she's...

356
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,289
...extremely mature.

357
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,128
At 24, she's mature.

358
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,052
I don't know if I believe that.

359
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:48,240
Do you have a photo?

360
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,908
No, I don't. She's
not a puppy dog...

361
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,077
...or a grandchild.

362
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,177
Thank God.

363
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,305
Who killed them, Gavin?

364
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,141
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,

365
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,962
I'm not an agent.

366
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,912
But, as I recall,
you have great ears.

367
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,274
To be honest, we
don't have a clue.

368
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,224
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

369
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,358
...on who might have ordered...

370
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,686
...the assassinations.

371
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,961
Your girlfriend has a theory?

372
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,017
Here, take a look at
it. You'll get...

373
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,117
...a kick out of the
way her mind works.

374
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,192
Is this Gray Grantham?
#NAME?

375
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,633
Sorry to call at
such a crazy hour.

376
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,097
I'm at a pay phone
on my way to work.

377
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,325
I can't call from
home or the office.

378
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,769
What kind of office?

379
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,869
I'm an attorney.

380
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,871
Private or government?

381
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,873
I'd rather not say.

382
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,781
I may know something...

383
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,131
...about Rosenberg and Jensen.

384
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,379
Are you recording this?

385
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,882
Can this call be traced?

386
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,551
I'm not recording
it or tracing it.

387
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,621
I promise you.

388
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,746
I may know who killed them.

389
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,226
What's your name?

390
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,978
Garcia.

391
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,649
That's not your real name.

392
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,586
I think I saw
something at the office

393
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,686
I wasn't supposed to see.

394
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,867
Do you have a copy?

395
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,105
I need to think about this.

396
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,515
I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

397
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,086
Listen, I promise you...

398
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,539
...I will protect you
as a confidential source.

399
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,099
Hello.

400
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,949
Got you.

401
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,175
Mr Grantham's not here,

402
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,900
but he left his
car number for you.

403
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,436
It's Garcia.

404
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:38,410
I still don't know what to do.

405
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,510
Mr Garcia...

406
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,516
...I've gone to jail
rather than reveal a source.

407
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,892
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

408
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,129
You're clearly a
decent human being,

409
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:53,383
a good citizen.

410
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,944
But could you live
with yourself...

411
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:58,819
...if you don't
reveal what you know?

412
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,848
MORGAN I'll get back to you.

413
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,982
Taxi.

414
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,456
French authorities
reviewed footage...

415
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:47,771
...from the airport
cameras in Paris...

416
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,982
...and think they
recognized a face...

417
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,192
...that might be
Khamel's, the terrorist.

418
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,053
He may have arrived
here on a flight...

419
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:58,228
...10 hours after we
found Jensen's body.

420
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,007
Anything else?

421
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,093
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

422
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,707
What's the wrinkle?

423
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,960
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

424
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,535
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

425
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,487
He's afraid it
might be damaging...

426
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,587
...to the president.

427
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,471
How's that?

428
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,671
It's all there in the brief.

429
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,082
It's amateur stuff...

430
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,104
...but how often
does something make

431
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:37,821
Coal sweat and run for cover?

432
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:40,657
He didn't exactly
sweat in front of us.

433
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,627
But his stone face showed
he wasn't happy.

434
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,245
Did he have any symptoms?

435
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,175
As I told you,
the president...

436
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,166
...is here for his
annual check-up.

437
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,043
I wish I was in as good shape.

438
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,439
Was this timed to counter...

439
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,171
...the age issue in
the next election?

440
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,271
Why didn't I think of that?

441
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,467
He hasn't decided
whether to run again.

442
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,344
When will he decide?

443
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,222
Do you really expect
me to answer that?

444
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,064
One rumour I can deny is...

445
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:07,768
...that he checked in
to get away from you.

446
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:10,043
Although could you blame him?

447
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,663
Thank you again.

448
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,944
Commander, go downstairs...

449
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:16,714
...and tell them

450
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:19,029
I have a date for
golf this afternoon.

451
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,129
Yes, sir.

452
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,493
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

453
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,137
Good.
Now, what's so important?

454
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,540
This is...

455
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,375
...a brief...

456
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:33,450
...written by an eager-beaver...

457
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,545
...law student.

458
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,570
It's a theory about
the assassinations.

459
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,883
And indirectly...

460
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,458
...it implicates the White House.

461
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,962
The premise is so far-fetched...

462
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,391
...it's absurd.

463
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,551
But Director Voyles,
for reasons...

464
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:51,228
...both you and I can guess...

465
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,328
...is going after it.

466
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,667
Well, we...

467
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,911
We can't interfere
with his investigation.

468
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,409
You should ask Giminski
to have the CIA investigate.

469
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,234
When we confirm that
this is garbage,

470
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,659
you can ask Voyles to back off.

471
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,181
It's domestic.

472
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,342
The CIA can't go nosing around.

473
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:17,921
It's illegal.

474
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,021
Yes, technically.

475
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:23,635
What about...

476
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,345
...your friend...

477
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,866
...Barr, and the Unit,
I think you call it.

478
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,658
I've spoken to Barr.

479
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,013
They're very good...

480
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:34,605
...for small specific missions...

481
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,730
...but they aren't the CIA.

482
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,341
How does it implicate
the White House?

483
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:42,112
What are there, names?

484
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,212
One name.

485
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,465
Someone we both know?

486
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,911
Mr President...

487
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,986
I've decided my agenda
for the future.

488
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:25,214
I'll stay in bed...

489
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,839
...drink...

490
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,091
...make love...

491
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,986
...and forget the
whole damn business.

492
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,807
You don't approve.

493
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,712
What about the book on Rosenberg?

494
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,812
You should write it.

495
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,815
Let's go.
#NAME?

496
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:48,218
You have the youth, the energy,

497
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,221
the certitude.

498
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,321
You'd be perfect.

499
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,782
Can I have the keys?

500
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,834
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

501
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,543
You've drunk too much.

502
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,549
Give me the keys.

503
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,550
Remember the Mashed Potato?

504
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,705
Give me the keys.

505
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,665
You're too young.
#NAME?

506
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,017
Do you remember the Fishback?

507
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,311
The Slide?
#NAME?

508
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,887
Please what?
#NAME?

509
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,056
Give me the keys.
I'll drive or I'll walk.

510
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,150
You'll walk?
Yes.

511
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,321
Have a nice stroll.

512
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,083
Miss Shaw.

513
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,591
You take my breath away.

514
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,847
Thomas.

515
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,520
Oh, my God.

516
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,623
Watch the door.

517
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,589
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

518
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,884
You'll be safe in my car.

519
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,472
Your name?

520
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,397
Darby Shaw.

521
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,445
Let's go.

522
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,162
Is this your car?

523
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,417
Come here.

524
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,195
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

525
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,956
I'm taking you to the hospital.

526
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,592
Check the plates.

527
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,870
Did you know the man in the car?

528
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,270
Thomas Callahan.

529
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,283
It'll be a few minutes.

530
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,203
Are you sure that the man who...

531
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,528
...called himself Rupert
said he was a cop?

532
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,105
We don't have a record of a cop...

533
00:36:54,205 --> 00:36:55,741
...named Rupert.
The computer...

534
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,743
...has no record of
the tag numbers of...

535
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,618
...the car you were
in. Must be fake.

536
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:05,273
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

537
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,642
All right?

538
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,873
Gavin Verheek?

539
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,967
This is Darby Shaw.
Do you know who I am?

540
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,631
We have a mutual friend.

541
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,706
Thomas gave you a
copy of my theory.

542
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,077
Yes, he did.

543
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,177
Where is it?

544
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,792
I read it and I showed it...

545
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:32,624
...to some folks at the Bureau...

546
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,104
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

547
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,885
Has it been seen
outside of the FBI?

548
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,896
I can't answer that.

549
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,707
Then I won't tell you...

550
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,982
...what's happened to Thomas.

551
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,680
Okay, yes.

552
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,055
It's been seen outside the FBI,

553
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,155
but by whom I don't know.

554
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,353
He's dead, Gavin.

555
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,356
He was murdered.
Someone planted...

556
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:56,857
...a car bomb for both of us.

557
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:59,507
I got lucky, but they're after me.

558
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,229
What's your phone number?

559
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:04,156
Where are you?

560
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,256
Not so fast.

561
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,393
Come on. Thomas Callahan...

562
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,162
...was my best friend.

563
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:12,292
I'll have agents pick you up.

564
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:14,398
You can't stay on the street.

565
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,640
Thomas is dead
because he talked...

566
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,462
...to you. Tell that to Voyles.

567
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,837
Turn up the TV,

568
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,487
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

569
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,903
Down.

570
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,826
Mr President.

571
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,329
Sit down. You must see this.

572
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,025
We've been working
on this all morning.

573
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,155
You have your first audience.

574
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,421
Over. Roll over.

575
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,408
Roll over.

576
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:50,058
How serious is this Pelican thing?

577
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,330
I've assigned 14
agents in New Orleans.

578
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,534
I doubt if there's anything to it,

579
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:57,167
but we must check it out.

580
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,267
I don't have to tell you...

581
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,183
...how much trouble and pain...

582
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:03,006
...this nonsense could cause...

583
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,346
...if the press gets wind of it.

584
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,612
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

585
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,850
I just wish...

586
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,518
...that you'd...

587
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,618
...back off the thing...

588
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:18,689
I mean...

589
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,874
...it's a goose chase.

590
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,849
Are you asking me to
ignore a suspect,

591
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,949
Mr President?

592
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,906
If the press...

593
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,659
...gets wind of what
you're after...

594
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,034
...and starts digging, I'll be-

595
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,134
We'll be crucified.

596
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:40,208
So you're asking me to back off?

597
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,756
Back off and chase
the real suspects.

598
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,334
Ignore it for a few
weeks, that's all.

599
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:53,536
Your hatchet man did
a real number on me...

600
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:55,726
...with the press.
They ate my lunch...

601
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,394
...over the security...

602
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:00,194
...we provided Jensen
and Rosenberg.

603
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,723
Get that pit bull off my ass and

604
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:06,748
I'll forget the
Pelican theory a while.

605
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,019
May I have your card?

606
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:32,022
I'll pay with cash.

607
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,318
Verheek.
Yes.

608
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:39,239
What did Voyles say?

609
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,035
Mr Voyles has been unavailable.

610
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,637
But I will try to speak to him...

611
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:47,715
...later this afternoon.

612
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,333
I expected more.

613
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,243
There's a memorial
service tomorrow.

614
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,465
I'll be there tonight.

615
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:58,673
I think we should meet.

616
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,261
Darby, I can save your life.

617
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,879
You can't even talk
to the director.

618
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,684
Where will you stay?

619
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,523
At the Westin, by the river.

620
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:17,192
Okay.

621
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,555
She's watching TV.

622
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,877
They've been looking under...

623
00:46:48,977 --> 00:46:50,461
...rocks. She's
using credit cards.

624
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,586
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

625
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,729
I'll give her 72.

626
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,968
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

627
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,068
All right, Bob.

628
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,612
Hooten, stay.

629
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:12,249
This means her little brief
is right on point.

630
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,792
Will you notify the president?

631
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,530
Notifying the president...

632
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,632
...means notifying Coal.

633
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:22,827
Gray Grantham's article...

634
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,995
...in tomorrow's
Washington Herald...

635
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,370
...maintains that, according...

636
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,831
...to unnamed White
House sources...

637
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,591
...the Mid-Eastern
terrorist, Khamel...

638
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:33,191
...may be among those
who assassinated

639
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:35,214
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

640
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,853
Those sources say that
a country known...

641
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:40,177
...for sponsoring
terrorist activity...

642
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,277
...may have hired Khamel.

643
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,685
It's Garcia.

644
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,030
I'm on the corner of

645
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,022
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

646
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,023
Take down my license number;...

647
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:56,527
...there's a lot of
grey Volvos out there.

648
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,627
8-5-6...

649
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,630
...V-N-N.

650
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,202
Right.

651
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,302
Ten minutes.
Yes.

652
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,311
My keys.

653
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,318
I can't do it.

654
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,158
Let's get together anyway.

655
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,242
You'll feel better if we meet...

656
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,230
...and you don't have
to reveal anything.

657
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,355
I have a wife and daughter.

658
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,402
There's a chance they
know that I know.

659
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:40,070
The guys at the firm?

660
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,720
I didn't tell you I was in a firm.

661
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,326
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

662
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:49,747
You must work at a firm
where they expect people...

663
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,622
...to work at least
100 hours a week.

664
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,975
Garcia, we can work
this thing out...

665
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,775
...if you just get
together with me.

666
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,875
Garcia?

667
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,613
Who's this?

668
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:24,713
Is this Gray Grantham?

669
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,715
Yes. Who's this?

670
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:30,293
Have you heard of
the Pelican Brief?

671
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,206
The what?

672
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:34,306
Pelican Brief.

673
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,269
No. Never heard of it.

674
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,161
It's an unlikely little theory...

675
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:43,300
...about who killed
Rosenberg and Jensen.

676
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,886
A friend of mine took
it to Washington.

677
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:47,822
He gave it to a
friend in the FBI...

678
00:49:47,922 --> 00:49:49,181
...and it was passed around.

679
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:51,906
My friend was killed
in a car bomb.

680
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:54,576
Wait now.

681
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,289
Your friend took it to the FBI...

682
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,731
...and then he was killed?
What's his name?

683
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:03,752
I can't tell you that.

684
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,757
How do you know all this?

685
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:09,257
I wrote the brief.

686
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,496
Are you a lawyer?

687
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,596
No.

688
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,123
Where are you calling from?

689
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,192
I'd rather you not...

690
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:21,467
...ask me any more questions.

691
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,480
You called me.

692
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:25,482
What's your name?

693
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,945
Alice.
#NAME?

694
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:31,752
Can you get a list of the major...

695
00:50:31,852 --> 00:50:34,442
...presidential
campaign contributors?

696
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,287
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

697
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,356
You know who did these killings?

698
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yes.

699
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,845
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

700
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,701
Let's take it slow.
I'll be in touch.

701
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,801
When?

702
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,154
Hi.

703
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,906
How are you?

704
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,006
How are you?

705
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,135
Did you get into my apartment?

706
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,846
Your computer's gone.

707
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:40,000
So are your floppy disks.

708
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,352
And your red expandable files.

709
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,030
I need you to do me a favour.

710
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,791
Go to the memorial
service tomorrow...

711
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:54,183
...and spread the
word I called to say

712
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:56,725
I'm staying with
an aunt in Denver.

713
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,150
And I won't be back until fall.

714
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,371
What is going on?

715
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,961
Are you okay about money?

716
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:14,006
I have the money
my father left me.

717
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,637
Who are you hiding from?

718
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,202
I think you better go now, Alice.

719
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,490
It would be better
for me if you go now.

720
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,424
That's not fair.

721
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,260
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,

722
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,760
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

723
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,057
I can't get you to
give me a smile?

724
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,176
I saw that.

725
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,276
That's something.

726
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,202
Just one beer?
No.

727
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:28,373
I've found my mission in life.

728
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,027
To make you smile.

729
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,377
You must find another mission.

730
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,013
Wait.

731
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,915
Will you marry me,
just for 5 minutes?

732
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,026
I know it's stupid,

733
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:49,421
but I think we're
fated for each other.

734
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:51,090
I must go now.

735
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,635
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

736
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:56,862
I'd walk a million miles

737
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:59,154
For one of your smiles

738
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,766
You beautiful

739
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,392
You wonderful girl

740
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,745
From the laundry

741
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,831
You've got the wrong girl.

742
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,085
Go get her.

743
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,992
Please, help me.

744
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,861
Looking for Mr Sneller.

745
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,321
Mr Sneller?

746
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,965
Yes, Mr Edwin F. Sneller.

747
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:35,045
Have you heard from Darby?

748
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,547
Yes, I did.

749
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:37,945
I got a note from her.

750
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:40,384
She's staying with
an aunt in Colorado.

751
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:43,529
But she's going to
be back next semester.

752
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,499
I'll see you later.

753
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:25,151
Gavin, it's Darby.

754
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,866
I'd just about given up on you.

755
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,477
Tell me where you want to meet...

756
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:32,936
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

757
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,272
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

758
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,522
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

759
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,868
We can get you out
of the city tonight,

760
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:42,196
in Washington tomorrow.

761
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,715
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

762
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,923
We'll go from there.

763
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:48,191
At noon tomorrow,

764
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:50,120
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

765
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,220
Wait, Riverwalk?

766
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:55,997
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

767
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,393
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

768
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,215
...and I'll find you.

769
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,315
The riverside bandstand.

770
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:07,321
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

771
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,098
Your weight?

772
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:10,198
About 180,

773
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:11,975
but I'm planning on losing it.

774
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:14,075
I'll see you tomorrow.

775
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:16,077
Tomorrow.

776
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,136
Gavin, it's Darby.

777
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,588
I'd just about given up on you.

778
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,701
Tell me where you want to meet...

779
01:00:43,794 --> 01:00:45,796
...and I'll come with 3 agents.

780
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,565
I thought the FBI
was not involved.

781
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,258
It's not involved, not yet.

782
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,303
I have friends.

783
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:55,993
We'll get you out of
the city tonight,

784
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:57,516
in Washington tomorrow.

785
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,993
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

786
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,312
We'll go from there.

787
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:03,690
At noon tomorrow,

788
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,083
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

789
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:11,071
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

790
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,660
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

791
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,825
...and I'll find you.

792
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,925
The riverside bandstand?

793
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,429
How tall are you?
- 5'10'.

794
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:22,916
Your weight?

795
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,016
About 180,

796
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:26,366
but I'm planning on losing it.

797
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:29,271
All right.

798
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,877
Tell me where you want to meet...

799
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:40,017
Tell me where you want to meet...

800
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:41,642
...and within an hour

801
01:01:41,742 --> 01:01:44,142
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

802
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:21,004
Mr Sneller on line 2.

803
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,717
Khamel is dead.
We don't know who did it.

804
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:31,167
And the girl?
- She's running.

805
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,475
We lost her.
We'll find her.

806
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,133
There's been another murder.

807
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:54,302
You remember my friend gave...

808
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:57,095
...the brief to a
friend at the FBI?

809
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,700
The FBI friend was
killed yesterday.

810
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,546
How do you know?

811
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,910
I was holding his hand.
He was shot...

812
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,345
...in broad daylight in a crowd.

813
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:14,014
I'm very sorry.

814
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,752
I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

815
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:20,302
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

816
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:23,282
We get crank calls from
people claiming...

817
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:25,969
...to know who killed
Rosenberg and Jensen.

818
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:28,069
Something you can confirm?

819
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,556
Please.

820
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,656
Such as?

821
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,812
The name of the friend...

822
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:37,062
...that was murdered
in the car explosion.

823
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,082
Take your time.

824
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:44,169
Callahan.

825
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,157
His first name?

826
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,659
Thomas.

827
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,759
Where did it happen?

828
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,169
In New Orleans.

829
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:54,519
I think that should be enough.

830
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,392
All right.

831
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,428
What's the name of the friend...

832
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,519
...that worked at the FBI?

833
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:07,594
Verheek.

834
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,694
Gavin Verheek.

835
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,113
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

836
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,724
I think that's more than enough.

837
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,439
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

838
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,124
You must follow my instructions.

839
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:37,347
This is Gray Grantham.

840
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:41,726
That's right.

841
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:47,148
Got it.

842
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:05,074
Did you follow my instructions?

843
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,669
Yes.

844
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:39,826
You must think I'm crazy.

845
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,288
Yes, I did...

846
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,041
...till I checked New Orleans.

847
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,503
Callahan was...

848
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,921
...killed exactly as you said.

849
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:55,469
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI...

850
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,419
...they found his
body 2 days ago...

851
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,514
...in a hotel room
early in the morning.

852
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:05,635
He'd been dead for
at least 8 hours.

853
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,481
That can't be.

854
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,618
Want to talk about the brief?

855
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:19,098
Everyone I've told
about the brief is dead.

856
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,910
I'll take my chances.

857
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,488
You can't, under
any circumstances,

858
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:26,817
use my name...

859
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,570
...or reveal how you got
the information.

860
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,356
Or publish anything until

861
01:09:31,456 --> 01:09:33,556
I've left the country. Agreed?

862
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,576
Unless I can convince
you otherwise.

863
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:37,676
You can't.

864
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,889
May I sit down?

865
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:48,186
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

866
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:01,869
Interesting read, isn't it?

867
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:05,996
What'd the president say?

868
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,707
He spoke to Voyles...

869
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,927
...who will leave it
alone for a while.

870
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:16,222
The president asked
Voyles to back off?

871
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:18,896
We thought it was
just another shot...

872
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:20,871
...in the dark.
Now I'm not sure.

873
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,956
That's obstruction of justice.

874
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:26,056
Assuming the brief
turns out to be true.

875
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:28,893
If it does, you'll
be the fall guy.

876
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:34,274
I won't be the only one.

877
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,568
The old Nixon two-step.

878
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:39,304
Don't even think that name.

879
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:42,643
Look at the hopeful side,
Iran gate, Iraq gate...

880
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:44,993
Good chance it won't come out.

881
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:48,038
What's up with Grantham?

882
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:49,966
We got his car phone.

883
01:10:50,066 --> 01:10:52,403
We haven't been
inside the home yet.

884
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:54,071
Why not?

885
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,246
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

886
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,847
Grantham knows about the brief.

887
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,281
He called 3 White
House aides today...

888
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,434
...and God knows who else.

889
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,595
What made you hone in...

890
01:11:11,695 --> 01:11:14,285
...on this particular
case so quickly?

891
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,161
I remembered this piece...

892
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:19,036
...that 'Frontline'
did a year ago...

893
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:24,155
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

894
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,502
They said he'd committed suicide,

895
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:30,602
but his family thought
it was foul play.

896
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,337
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

897
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:39,882
They said he had...

898
01:11:39,982 --> 01:11:42,703
...a depressive
problem years before...

899
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,728
...but medication
had taken care of it.

900
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:50,090
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

901
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:52,486
They told the police...

902
01:11:52,586 --> 01:11:55,736
...they were not
convinced it was suicide.

903
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:00,618
But the police
closed the investigation.

904
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,489
Exactly.

905
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,624
That's it.
That's the brief.

906
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:19,129
Maybe we could...

907
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,425
...finish up in the morning?

908
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:35,631
I'll be up late going
over my notes...

909
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:38,281
...while they're fresh in my head.

910
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,693
Call me when you wake up.

911
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,073
Try and get some sleep.

912
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:57,918
Mr Grantham.

913
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,381
I know it sounds silly, but...

914
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,293
...would you sleep on the sofa?

915
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,975
No problem.

916
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:22,442
Good night.

917
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,945
Listen...

918
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:27,947
At the risk of sounding
old-fashioned...

919
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,083
...isn't it time I
knew your real name?

920
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:35,705
Darby Shaw.

921
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,309
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

922
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,714
Callahan was a fan.

923
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,057
Does the name Victor Mattiece...

924
01:13:57,157 --> 01:13:58,422
...mean anything to you?

925
01:13:58,522 --> 01:13:59,631
Money.

926
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,731
Power.

927
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,733
Influence.

928
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:06,272
He's made and lost several...

929
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:09,222
...fortunes drilling
oil in Louisiana.

930
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:12,492
In 1979...

931
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:14,785
...his oil company
punched some holes...

932
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,732
...in Terrebonne
Parish and hit oil.

933
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,650
A lot of oil.

934
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,200
He needed governmental
permission...

935
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:23,536
...to dredge a channel though...

936
01:14:23,636 --> 01:14:26,156
...the marshlands
to get the oil out.

937
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,202
Enter Mattiece,

938
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:29,620
the great campaign contributor...

939
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,205
...and as night follows day...

940
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,189
...government permission...

941
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:36,514
...to gouge through
the endangered marshes.

942
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,922
Mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars...

943
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,548
...when Green Fund...

944
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:43,801
...an obscure
environmental outfit...

945
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,233
...trots down to the
U.S. District court...

946
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,222
...in Lafayette and
files a lawsuit...

947
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:50,722
...to stop the entire operation.

948
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:53,460
Of course, Mattiece
spares no expense...

949
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,686
...to win the lawsuit.

950
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:57,156
I don't think there's
a top law firm...

951
01:14:57,256 --> 01:14:59,316
...between Houston
and New Orleans...

952
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,416
...that he hasn't hired.

953
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,877
Fucking PBS.

954
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:07,071
By the time the
Green Fund lawyers...

955
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,325
...all two of them...

956
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,494
...wade in, the joint ventures...

957
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:12,113
...limited partnerships...

958
01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:13,914
...and corporate associations...

959
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:15,990
...form an impenetrable maze...

960
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,001
...that makes Mattiece invisible.

961
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,761
Luckily for the Green
Fund's lawsuit...

962
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,225
...the heart of the
new oil reserve...

963
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:25,759
...is near a natural
refuge for waterfowl:

964
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:30,239
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

965
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,033
The pelican becomes the hero.

966
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:35,663
After 30 years of contamination...

967
01:15:35,763 --> 01:15:38,238
...by DDT and other pesticides...

968
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:40,422
...the Louisiana
brown pelican is...

969
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:41,859
...on the brink of extinction.

970
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:45,154
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts...

971
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,949
...from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

972
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:51,779
It takes 7 years for
the pelican suit...

973
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:53,871
...to go to trial in Lake Charles.

974
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,882
The 3-man jury,
caring less...

975
01:15:55,982 --> 01:15:57,958
...about the pelicans than jobs...

976
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:00,383
...votes in favour of Mattiece.

977
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,218
But the judge rules to keep the...

978
01:16:03,318 --> 01:16:05,549
...injunction against
drilling because...

979
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:07,432
...he thinks Green
Fund has proven...

980
01:16:07,532 --> 01:16:08,969
...its point about the pelican...

981
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,494
...a federally-protected species,

982
01:16:11,594 --> 01:16:13,594
and that it will appeal.

983
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:15,757
What's the lawsuit's status?

984
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,020
From the trial level...

985
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,710
...it will be appealed
to the Court...

986
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:23,317
...of Appeals in New
Orleans in a month.

987
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,657
Any idea what the court will do?

988
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,669
It could be reversed.

989
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,550
Then the fun starts.
If either side...

990
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,576
...is unhappy with the court...

991
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:34,995
...they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

992
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:37,404
From today, how long
would it take...

993
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:39,750
...for a decision by
the Supreme Court?

994
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,019
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

995
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,269
Rosenberg would have died.

996
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:46,582
But another president could be...

997
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:48,801
...in the White
House when he died.

998
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:50,594
So if you're Mattiece...

999
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:52,478
...and you don't mind killing...

1000
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:53,847
...a couple of Supremes...

1001
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:55,608
...now's the time to kill them,

1002
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,810
when you can predict
their replacement.

1003
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,394
But why Jensen?

1004
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:00,797
He shared one piece...

1005
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:02,815
...of common ground
with Rosenberg:

1006
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,940
Protecting the environment.

1007
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,251
I didn't mean to wake you.

1008
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:00,444
You said that Mattiece
hired law firms...

1009
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:02,869
...from Houston to New Orleans.

1010
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,650
Were there any in Washington?

1011
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,562
Maybe two.

1012
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,023
White & Blazevich...

1013
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:16,780
...and Brim,
Stearns & Somebody.

1014
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,240
Great.

1015
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:22,811
I got a call from
a lawyer in D.C...

1016
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:24,127
...who saw something...

1017
01:18:24,227 --> 01:18:25,939
...concerning
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1018
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,069
He backed out of our meeting.

1019
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,197
I never heard from him again.

1020
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:33,744
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

1021
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:35,491
How?

1022
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:38,461
Long story. If he works
at one of these...

1023
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:41,163
...law firms, he could
be our confirmation.

1024
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,263
I hope you find him.

1025
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,499
Come with me to Washington.

1026
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:50,729
I've had enough.

1027
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,112
If you're right about Mattiece,

1028
01:18:53,212 --> 01:18:54,718
then there'll be a cover-up.

1029
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,512
It'll probably work.

1030
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:58,305
How do you know?

1031
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:01,255
I called the Herald
morgue last night.

1032
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,542
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

1033
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,111
...on 'Violations of

1034
01:19:06,211 --> 01:19:08,211
Campaign Financing Laws.'

1035
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,307
He found out that,
hidden under...

1036
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:12,528
...a lot of other
names of individuals...

1037
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,728
...and PAC's and corporations,

1038
01:19:14,811 --> 01:19:17,533
Mattiece was the
biggest contributor...

1039
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:18,992
...by far...

1040
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,994
...to the president's campaign.

1041
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:23,349
We ran a picture,
with the article,

1042
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:25,374
of the president and Mattiece.

1043
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,252
It was taken unbeknownst
to either one.

1044
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,110
In it, the president
and Mattiece are...

1045
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:31,922
...in front of Mattiece's
hunting lodge...

1046
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:33,640
...sipping on some bourbon,

1047
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,925
having a good laugh.

1048
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,677
The best of pals.

1049
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:37,793
The captions said:

1050
01:19:37,893 --> 01:19:39,680
'The President's Most Secret...

1051
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,366
...and Generous Contributor.'

1052
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:45,482
Now if your brief is right...

1053
01:19:45,582 --> 01:19:47,771
...and it ever reaches
the light of day...

1054
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:50,607
...the president loses
any chance of re-election.

1055
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:52,306
The men around the president...

1056
01:19:52,406 --> 01:19:53,527
...won't let that happen.

1057
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:55,322
I checked with my sources.

1058
01:19:55,422 --> 01:19:58,082
The Bureau, Langley,
the White House...

1059
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,790
...all said the
brief doesn't exist.

1060
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,191
You may be the only
witness to the fact...

1061
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:07,499
...there is a brief.
If you disappear...

1062
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,599
...so does justice.

1063
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,204
Is that what Callahan would want?

1064
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:21,260
He'd want me to see
my 25th birthday.

1065
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,558
Darby.

1066
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:26,556
If this thing reaches as deep...

1067
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:28,979
...and goes as high as
we think it does...

1068
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:32,079
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

1069
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,110
Where can you hide?

1070
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,210
Go back to Washington.

1071
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:48,175
They're all shook up...

1072
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:50,501
...about you asking
about something.

1073
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:51,752
I expected that.

1074
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:53,463
It's like the Gestapo over there.

1075
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:54,671
Coal clears everything.

1076
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:56,634
They put me on medical leave...

1077
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:57,424
...for 90 days.

1078
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,843
What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

1079
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:03,543
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

1080
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:05,680
I'm worried about you, son.

1081
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,688
Gray, it's Darby.

1082
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:14,664
When you hear this,
I'll be in the air...

1083
01:21:14,764 --> 01:21:16,764
...on my way to nowhere.

1084
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,669
Try to understand.

1085
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:23,081
I can't keep you on that story.

1086
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,217
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

1087
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,260
The Times, the networks...

1088
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,382
...are there checking
out the judge...

1089
01:21:29,482 --> 01:21:30,916
...they're about to nominate.

1090
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,459
I need more time.

1091
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:33,710
For what?

1092
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,317
You lost your White House sources,

1093
01:21:36,417 --> 01:21:38,817
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

1094
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,982
Not your best week.

1095
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:44,127
You can't take me off this story.

1096
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:47,224
What do you know for fact?

1097
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,891
An unidentified guy says...

1098
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:50,978
...he knows about
the assassinations.

1099
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:53,506
He works in a law
firm, you don't know...

1100
01:21:53,606 --> 01:21:55,732
...which one. He's
cut off all contact.

1101
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,001
That's not very promising.

1102
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:01,502
There's something
there, I can smell it.

1103
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,606
Evidence based on
olfactory prowess is...

1104
01:22:04,706 --> 01:22:07,035
...inadmissible, in
case you didn't know.

1105
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:08,579
Then there's a girl...

1106
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:10,244
...with her bird
brief for which...

1107
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:11,540
...you can't get confirmation.

1108
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,708
Not yet.

1109
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,841
She also cut off
contact, something...

1110
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:16,920
...that's reaching
epidemic proportions.

1111
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,089
They're waiting for you upstairs.

1112
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:21,189
Everything she said about...

1113
01:22:21,237 --> 01:22:23,635
...the two deaths
has been confirmed.

1114
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:25,625
The FBI says Verheek was killed...

1115
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:26,930
...in some hotel mugging.

1116
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,391
That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

1117
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,788
And they said they knew of...

1118
01:22:30,888 --> 01:22:32,603
...no connection with
the assassinations.

1119
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:34,441
What else would they say?

1120
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:37,065
I'm interested in
what they did say.

1121
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:39,865
Let's look at what
I have confirmed.

1122
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:41,150
Callahan was killed.

1123
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,781
He was a professor.
They had an affair.

1124
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:45,505
Give it to the Times-Picayune.

1125
01:22:45,605 --> 01:22:47,117
Maybe they want some gossip.

1126
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:48,797
I also found that
Callahan clerked...

1127
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,037
...for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

1128
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:52,456
Life is filled with
odd coincidence.

1129
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,291
Not a coincidence if the brief-

1130
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,794
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

1131
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:58,687
I confirmed Verheek
and Callahan...

1132
01:22:58,787 --> 01:22:59,421
...were friends.

1133
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,396
They met here a few weeks ago,

1134
01:23:01,496 --> 01:23:03,884
when he must have
given him the brief.

1135
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:04,835
Supposition again.

1136
01:23:04,935 --> 01:23:06,637
I've confirmed the
pelican lawsuit.

1137
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:09,615
On which she has based
her suppositions.

1138
01:23:09,715 --> 01:23:11,740
It's all just suppositions.

1139
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,685
You know what Mattiece could do?

1140
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,813
I know what he has done already.

1141
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:17,731
He has a bizarre history.

1142
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,400
So do I, according
to my ex-wife. It...

1143
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,110
...doesn't mean that
I killed the Justices.

1144
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,760
But it means it's worth exploring.

1145
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:27,902
Go down to that crappy
cabin of yours...

1146
01:23:27,964 --> 01:23:30,244
...on the weekend,
hole up, retrench.

1147
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,959
Prove you have a
way to revitalize...

1148
01:23:33,059 --> 01:23:36,209
...this story, and I
might keep you on it.

1149
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:41,384
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

1150
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,946
This is the story of...

1151
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:50,472
...a mystery that
may never be solved.

1152
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:52,960
The story of a brilliant
young lawyer...

1153
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:54,351
...who loved this land...

1154
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:56,666
...and wanted to fight
to preserve it...

1155
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,188
...from the inroads of man...

1156
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,940
...until his abrupt death...

1157
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
...a few months ago.

1158
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,769
His body was found
in a lonely cottage,

1159
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:07,948
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

1160
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,242
There was a bullet in his head...

1161
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,342
...and a gun beside him.

1162
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:16,370
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

1163
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:18,666
But he died sitting at a computer,

1164
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,335
surrounded by his notes...

1165
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,081
...for what he called...

1166
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:24,506
...the case he was born to win.

1167
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:27,157
His friends and family ask...

1168
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,163
...would anyone commit suicide...

1169
01:24:29,263 --> 01:24:30,304
...in such a manner...

1170
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,404
...at such a time?

1171
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:37,015
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

1172
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,126
Who's there?

1173
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,171
It's Darby.

1174
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,735
I got your message.

1175
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,030
If they bugged your phone,

1176
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:59,580
they'd think I'd left the country.

1177
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,433
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

1178
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,779
Not yet.

1179
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,879
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

1180
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:17,175
I could help you find him.

1181
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:22,347
How'd you find me?

1182
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,519
I called your editor.

1183
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:29,229
He told you?

1184
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:34,526
I told him I was
your sister Mary...

1185
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:37,776
...from out of town
and couldn't find you.

1186
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:42,408
How'd you know I
had a sister Mary?

1187
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,212
You're not the only
one doing research.

1188
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,152
It was a beautiful service.

1189
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:18,113
Thank you, Mr President.

1190
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,558
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

1191
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:44,471
It was the right thing to do,

1192
01:27:44,571 --> 01:27:47,196
no matter where
the body was found.

1193
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:56,552
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

1194
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,929
You said they'd be
vetted this weekend.

1195
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:00,931
There must be a change in plans.

1196
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:03,031
I don't understand.

1197
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:05,450
The Pelican Brief.

1198
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:09,129
What about the Pelican Brief?

1199
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,834
I thought that was
ancient history.

1200
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,384
We believe that Grantham's
gotten hold of it.

1201
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:18,949
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

1202
01:28:19,049 --> 01:28:21,049
Not if it's true.

1203
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,640
You think it's true?

1204
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:31,626
I know what Grantham will write:

1205
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:34,131
'A man who gave
the president millions...

1206
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:36,201
...had two Supreme
Court Justices killed...

1207
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:37,301
...so the president...

1208
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:40,271
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

1209
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,870
...so his oil could be harvested.'

1210
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:45,449
If Voyles says you told
him to back off...

1211
01:28:45,549 --> 01:28:47,770
...the case, we face
an obstruction charge.

1212
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,870
Oh, Jesus.

1213
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,841
There's a way to handle this.

1214
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,918
Handle it how?

1215
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:59,646
We appoint two nature-lovers...

1216
01:28:59,746 --> 01:29:00,949
...to the court.

1217
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,730
Good environmentalists...

1218
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:05,412
...who'd kill Mattiece
and his oil field.

1219
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:07,656
Meet with Voyles,
in the presence...

1220
01:29:07,756 --> 01:29:09,291
...of the Attorney General...

1221
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,292
...and demand an investigation...

1222
01:29:11,392 --> 01:29:12,169
...into Mattiece.

1223
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:15,172
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

1224
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:17,649
Then we ride out the storm.

1225
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:20,893
But there has to be
some way to keep...

1226
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:23,097
...this information
from coming out.

1227
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:25,197
I'm working on it.

1228
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,185
What?
How?

1229
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,978
Mr President...

1230
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:32,078
...you don't want to know.

1231
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,591
What's this all about?

1232
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:46,662
A trip to Mt. Vernon
will do you good.

1233
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,762
Are you losing it?

1234
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:50,984
First I order you to
go to Little Rock,

1235
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:52,084
you refuse to go.

1236
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:55,295
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

1237
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,495
...your boss, I might add...

1238
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:59,132
...to drop everything...

1239
01:29:59,232 --> 01:30:01,218
...and meet you at George's place.

1240
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,887
I thought of making
you unemployed...

1241
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:06,181
...but you'd sue me
for discrimination.

1242
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:08,058
She's here.

1243
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:10,183
The bird girl?
- She's here.

1244
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,480
You could've told me.
#NAME?

1245
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,502
By the way, refusing to tell me...

1246
01:30:15,602 --> 01:30:17,234
...where you could be reached...

1247
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,236
...didn't leave a good impression.

1248
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,139
It's too risky to go
to my apartment...

1249
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:22,239
...or to the job.

1250
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,908
Where have you been?
#NAME?

1251
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:26,333
This is a hell of a time...

1252
01:30:26,433 --> 01:30:27,911
...to punch notches in your belt.

1253
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:29,633
We're not in the same hotel.

1254
01:30:29,733 --> 01:30:31,415
She's helping me find Garcia.

1255
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:34,017
It sounds like she's in control.

1256
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:36,086
It's the only way she'd play.

1257
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,255
So what if you can't find Garcia?

1258
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,355
We go to plan B.
What's that?

1259
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,150
We attack the lawyers directly.

1260
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:43,677
What if it's another firm?

1261
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,262
We go to plan C.
What's that?

1262
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:47,952
We didn't go that far.
What if you do?

1263
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:51,031
I must be able to get
in touch with you.

1264
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:55,043
I'm at the Marbury
Hotel, room 833.

1265
01:30:55,143 --> 01:30:56,899
Don't use my name.

1266
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:58,999
Write it down.

1267
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:02,654
You mind getting off
at the next exit?

1268
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,239
Why?

1269
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:07,189
A tan car's been two
cars behind us...

1270
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:10,012
...since we got on the parkway.

1271
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,381
I thought it was following us.

1272
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:33,408
Right.

1273
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,660
Georgetown Law School, please.

1274
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:26,211
Hurry.

1275
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,945
Meet me by the stacks.

1276
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:49,794
Someone was in my room.

1277
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,784
Did you tell anyone
where you were?

1278
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:56,659
Smith Keen, but he'd
never repeat it.

1279
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:58,803
Did you tell him by phone?

1280
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:00,805
No.
We were...

1281
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:03,642
We were in his car.

1282
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,504
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

1283
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:07,756
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

1284
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,091
This is Susan Johnson.

1285
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:11,301
I'm a partner with
White & Blazevich.

1286
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:15,155
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

1287
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:18,158
May I have the names
of your students...

1288
01:34:18,258 --> 01:34:20,310
...that clerked here last summer?

1289
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,410
I'm from White & Blazevich.

1290
01:34:22,485 --> 01:34:24,485
You have something for me?

1291
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,252
Would you sign this, please?

1292
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:37,808
Thank you, Mr Stevens.
- You're welcome.

1293
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,414
I'll call these five
and see who's home.

1294
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:43,409
I'll take the two with
no phone number...

1295
01:34:43,509 --> 01:34:45,984
...and get their class schedules.

1296
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:52,774
See you later.

1297
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,806
I'm from the Washington Herald.

1298
01:34:59,906 --> 01:35:01,143
I'm looking for...

1299
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:02,812
...Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.

1300
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,854
Is there a problem?

1301
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:04,954
No.

1302
01:35:05,054 --> 01:35:06,815
Just a few questions
I want to ask.

1303
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:09,240
Are they in class this morning?

1304
01:35:10,586 --> 01:35:12,586
One moment, please.

1305
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:21,413
Excuse me.

1306
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:23,513
Do you have ID?

1307
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:28,020
Could I speak to
Dennis Maylor, please?

1308
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:31,046
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1309
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:33,275
I'm sorry to bother you.

1310
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:40,644
Akers has Criminal Procedure,

1311
01:35:40,714 --> 01:35:42,714
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1312
01:35:42,743 --> 01:35:44,478
I'll try to find them. Maylor,

1313
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:46,730
Reinhart and Wilson
were all at home.

1314
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:48,830
I can go to Maylor's.

1315
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,194
Excuse me.

1316
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:54,027
Do you know Laura Kaas?

1317
01:35:54,127 --> 01:35:56,944
She's the girl with
the red backpack.

1318
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:04,513
Do you recognize this man?

1319
01:36:04,513 --> 01:36:07,138
He's a lawyer at
White & Blazevich.

1320
01:36:07,476 --> 01:36:09,336
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1321
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:11,380
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1322
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,340
I'll get his class schedule.

1323
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,540
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1324
01:36:15,776 --> 01:36:17,776
It's me again.

1325
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,597
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1326
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:22,697
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

1327
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:24,854
A student you talked to called

1328
01:36:24,954 --> 01:36:27,771
White & Blazevich,
who called the Dean.

1329
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,721
No more class schedules
for reporters.

1330
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:43,969
Mr Grantham.

1331
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:46,805
I know Edward.

1332
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,765
He's dropped out of
school for a while.

1333
01:36:49,865 --> 01:36:51,587
Personal problems.

1334
01:36:51,687 --> 01:36:53,046
Where is he?

1335
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:56,221
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

1336
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:58,610
He's being detoxified.

1337
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,990
Look, he's a good guy.

1338
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:06,658
Parklane Hospital.

1339
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:33,268
Good afternoon.

1340
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:36,188
May I see Edward Linney?

1341
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,842
What room is he in?
- What's your name?

1342
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:41,778
Gray Grantham,
Washington Herald.

1343
01:37:42,362 --> 01:37:45,062
The law school said
I could see him.

1344
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:47,807
I'm sorry they did.

1345
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,737
We run this hospital...

1346
01:37:49,837 --> 01:37:52,312
...and they run their law school.

1347
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:54,839
May I see your administrator?

1348
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:57,734
I'll see if I can find him.

1349
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:24,555
Mr Grantham.

1350
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:26,655
Great architecture.

1351
01:38:26,907 --> 01:38:28,907
I'm sorry, Mr Grantham.

1352
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:30,435
Visitation...

1353
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:32,146
...is only allowed
on the weekend...

1354
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:34,246
...and then only family.

1355
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:36,625
When will he be discharged?

1356
01:38:37,934 --> 01:38:40,259
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1357
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:43,463
Perhaps when his
insurance expires?

1358
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,634
Do you recognize that man?

1359
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:51,346
What's his name?

1360
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,268
That's the point,
I don't know.

1361
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:57,853
What is his name?

1362
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,086
He works in the oil
and gas section...

1363
01:39:04,186 --> 01:39:06,186
...on the 9th floor.

1364
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,950
Morgan.

1365
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,620
Yes. Morgan.

1366
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:18,066
His first name's something like...

1367
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,502
...Charles, but that's not it.

1368
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:24,170
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

1369
01:39:26,842 --> 01:39:28,867
When you opened the door...

1370
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:32,820
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1371
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:36,057
I'm sorry.

1372
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,827
I'll take a hallucination
like that...

1373
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:42,063
...anytime.

1374
01:39:44,318 --> 01:39:46,318
Take care of yourself.

1375
01:39:51,632 --> 01:39:54,332
Excuse me, miss.
What are you doing?

1376
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:55,813
Visiting my brother.

1377
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:57,481
Who is your brother?

1378
01:39:57,581 --> 01:39:59,581
Edward Linney.

1379
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,501
This your sister?

1380
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:09,785
Yes.

1381
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:11,885
Leave her alone.

1382
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:14,979
Mom will come on the weekend.

1383
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,307
Sis?

1384
01:40:17,309 --> 01:40:18,836
Come back soon.

1385
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,936
I'll try.

1386
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:23,319
I know you'd agree
with me about...

1387
01:40:23,419 --> 01:40:25,467
...the horrendous
cost of health care.

1388
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:27,261
Of course, of course.

1389
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:29,100
We pride ourselves on our...

1390
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,515
...enlightened policy
regarding payment.

1391
01:40:31,615 --> 01:40:34,165
Thank you very much for your time.

1392
01:40:36,787 --> 01:40:39,176
We'll be happy to have you back...

1393
01:40:39,276 --> 01:40:42,126
...on any of our
normal visiting days.

1394
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:47,840
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1395
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:00,669
White & Blazevich, please.

1396
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:03,094
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

1397
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:25,778
May I help you?

1398
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:28,653
Dorothy Blythe, to
see Curtis Morgan.

1399
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:33,257
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

1400
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:10,091
You have a meeting with Mr Morgan?

1401
01:42:10,161 --> 01:42:11,448
Yes. At 5.

1402
01:42:11,548 --> 01:42:13,169
When was your appointment?

1403
01:42:13,269 --> 01:42:14,118
Two weeks ago.

1404
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:15,994
May I ask why?

1405
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:19,094
Obviously, I need an
oil and gas lawyer.

1406
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:22,057
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1407
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:26,186
Why didn't anyone call me?

1408
01:42:26,188 --> 01:42:29,038
We have no record of
your appointment.

1409
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:31,343
What happened?

1410
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:33,737
He was mugged a week ago.

1411
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:36,306
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1412
01:42:36,406 --> 01:42:38,806
Do you have some identification?

1413
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:40,811
He's Security.

1414
01:42:40,911 --> 01:42:42,911
Security for what?

1415
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:44,341
Come with us,

1416
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:46,316
you should see someone else.

1417
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:49,465
After this treatment,
I have no interest...

1418
01:42:49,565 --> 01:42:52,340
...in talking to
anyone in this firm.

1419
01:43:07,938 --> 01:43:09,940
They killed him.

1420
01:43:18,031 --> 01:43:20,031
I can't breathe.

1421
01:43:35,966 --> 01:43:38,468
It's all right.
Just let it go.

1422
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,760
Let it go.

1423
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,892
It's all right.

1424
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:55,862
We ran the story about a week ago.

1425
01:43:55,962 --> 01:43:57,387
It's just another mugging.

1426
01:43:57,487 --> 01:43:59,962
Didn't make the Metro front page.

1427
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:01,725
Curtis Morgan...

1428
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:04,328
...225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1429
01:44:04,912 --> 01:44:07,289
225 Willow Road...

1430
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:09,831
...Bethesda.

1431
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:11,443
That's what I wanted.

1432
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:13,818
Report in before noon tomorrow.

1433
01:44:13,918 --> 01:44:15,918
We're nervous over here.

1434
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:17,574
You know...

1435
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:19,849
...good help is hard to find.

1436
01:44:26,725 --> 01:44:28,725
I'm going with you.

1437
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:34,814
Look at me.

1438
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:45,033
I want you to leave.

1439
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:50,041
And if you need confirmation...

1440
01:44:50,094 --> 01:44:51,442
...for your story?

1441
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,542
I'm on my own.

1442
01:44:56,713 --> 01:44:58,715
What's changed your mind?

1443
01:45:02,553 --> 01:45:04,721
I want you to reach 25.

1444
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:13,353
I'm coming.

1445
01:45:41,258 --> 01:45:42,826
Good evening.

1446
01:45:42,926 --> 01:45:45,579
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1447
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,494
Could we see Mrs Morgan?

1448
01:45:47,594 --> 01:45:49,954
I'm her father.
She won't talk.

1449
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:52,158
I respect her privacy.

1450
01:45:52,258 --> 01:45:54,838
I know she's been
through an ordeal.

1451
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:56,443
When did you people...

1452
01:45:56,543 --> 01:45:58,884
...ever respect anyone's privacy?

1453
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:01,709
I feel that way
about most reporters.

1454
01:46:01,809 --> 01:46:03,909
But her husband called me...

1455
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,031
...3 times before he died.

1456
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:09,225
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1457
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:14,371
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

1458
01:46:16,627 --> 01:46:18,627
You change your mind...

1459
01:46:19,046 --> 01:46:21,046
...I'll be at this number.

1460
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:32,494
Mr Grantham?
Yes.

1461
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:35,203
This is Mrs Morgan.

1462
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:39,209
Do you still want to see me?

1463
01:47:42,045 --> 01:47:44,745
Did you know your
husband called me?

1464
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,551
No. How would he know...

1465
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:51,789
...anything about
those dead judges?

1466
01:47:51,889 --> 01:47:54,016
I have no idea.

1467
01:47:55,058 --> 01:47:57,058
Did he keep any...

1468
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:59,104
...unusual documents...

1469
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:01,396
...or papers?

1470
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:04,375
We have a lock box at the bank...

1471
01:48:04,447 --> 01:48:06,447
...for deed and wills.

1472
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:09,029
I looked at it last Thursday.

1473
01:48:09,129 --> 01:48:11,529
There was nothing unusual in it.

1474
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:14,743
On Saturday morning...

1475
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:16,961
...I was going through his...

1476
01:48:18,749 --> 01:48:20,834
...desk in the bedroom.

1477
01:48:22,044 --> 01:48:24,444
I found something a bit unusual.

1478
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:28,423
A key.

1479
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,760
A key to what?

1480
01:48:32,763 --> 01:48:34,763
Another lock box.

1481
01:48:36,433 --> 01:48:38,433
Which bank?

1482
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:41,102
Riggs Bank.

1483
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:46,441
We've never banked there.

1484
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:49,785
And you knew nothing
about this other...

1485
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:51,140
...box?

1486
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,265
Not until Saturday morning.

1487
01:48:53,575 --> 01:48:55,575
I figured...

1488
01:48:56,119 --> 01:48:58,819
...I'll run by when
I felt up to it.

1489
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:02,640
Maybe you should
check it, Mrs Morgan.

1490
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:07,011
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1491
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:10,592
Are you saying
Curtis was killed...

1492
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:12,542
...because he knew something...

1493
01:49:12,642 --> 01:49:14,037
...about the a ssassinations?

1494
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:16,462
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1495
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:18,908
Do you think there...

1496
01:49:19,008 --> 01:49:22,233
...may be papers in
the safe-deposit box...

1497
01:49:22,312 --> 01:49:24,718
...that may reveal
what Curtis knew...

1498
01:49:24,818 --> 01:49:26,383
...about the a ssassinations?

1499
01:49:26,483 --> 01:49:28,483
There could be.

1500
01:49:31,029 --> 01:49:33,323
My child's lost one parent.

1501
01:49:37,494 --> 01:49:39,669
I can't let her lose another.

1502
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:43,999
I'll check it for you.

1503
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:46,951
No one has to know
you have the key.

1504
01:49:50,924 --> 01:49:53,549
They will only give
it to his wife.

1505
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:56,560
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

1506
01:49:57,848 --> 01:49:59,583
I would have one condition.

1507
01:49:59,683 --> 01:50:02,273
If you find something
that disparages...

1508
01:50:02,373 --> 01:50:04,963
...my husband in any
way, you can't use it.

1509
01:50:05,063 --> 01:50:07,441
You have my word, Mrs Morgan.

1510
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:44,354
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

1511
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:46,454
Down those steps.

1512
01:53:07,204 --> 01:53:09,374
I need access to a box, please.

1513
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:11,542
The number, please?
- 616

1514
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:17,490
This box was rented two weeks ago.

1515
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:18,782
Yes.

1516
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:20,882
I assume you're Mrs Morgan?

1517
01:53:20,886 --> 01:53:21,994
Sara Ann Morgan.

1518
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:23,094
The address?

1519
01:53:23,194 --> 01:53:25,194
225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1520
01:53:26,223 --> 01:53:29,768
Phone number?
- 7984

1521
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:32,171
Who rented this box?

1522
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:34,469
My husband,
Curtis D. Morgan.

1523
01:53:34,569 --> 01:53:36,921
And his social security number?

1524
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:43,156
510-96-8686.

1525
01:53:44,867 --> 01:53:46,892
Will you sign here, please?

1526
01:53:47,286 --> 01:53:48,479
May I help you?

1527
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:50,579
I'd like to rent a box.

1528
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:54,497
Will you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.

1529
01:53:55,627 --> 01:53:56,820
You have a key?

1530
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,920
Yes, I do.

1531
01:54:00,424 --> 01:54:02,424
Follow me.

1532
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:45,035
It's a four-page affidavit...

1533
01:55:45,112 --> 01:55:47,698
...signed under oath.

1534
01:55:47,906 --> 01:55:51,806
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

1535
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:56,193
He worked at White & Blazevich...

1536
01:55:56,293 --> 01:55:59,443
...in the oil and gas
section for 5 years.

1537
01:56:00,002 --> 01:56:01,278
Listen to this.

1538
01:56:01,378 --> 01:56:02,905
During that time...

1539
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:05,102
...he worked for a client who...

1540
01:56:05,202 --> 01:56:07,701
...was engaged in a
lawsuit in Louisiana.

1541
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:11,101
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece...

1542
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,956
...who he's never met.

1543
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:14,567
Lots about the lawsuit,

1544
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:17,187
how desperate Mattiece
was to win it.

1545
01:56:17,227 --> 01:56:19,227
Just as if you wrote it.

1546
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:23,734
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

1547
01:56:23,942 --> 01:56:26,028
...supervised the case for W & B.

1548
01:56:26,128 --> 01:56:28,472
Morgan worked on a
peripherated case.

1549
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:30,391
He took files and documents...

1550
01:56:30,491 --> 01:56:32,309
...that Wakefield left for him...

1551
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:34,144
...not related to the case.

1552
01:56:34,244 --> 01:56:36,614
When he got back to
his own office, he...

1553
01:56:36,714 --> 01:56:39,024
...found a memo on the
bottom of the stack.

1554
01:56:39,124 --> 01:56:42,444
He'd inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk.

1555
01:56:42,544 --> 01:56:45,697
A copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit.

1556
01:56:45,797 --> 01:56:48,457
He copied the memo
and left the memo...

1557
01:56:48,508 --> 01:56:50,369
...under the files on his desk.

1558
01:56:50,469 --> 01:56:52,763
Next stop,
Washington Herald.

1559
01:56:55,432 --> 01:56:57,532
No. Stop.
Get out of the car.

1560
02:00:12,129 --> 02:00:14,212
There was a car explosion...

1561
02:00:14,312 --> 02:00:16,158
...in a garage near
the Riggs Bank.

1562
02:00:16,258 --> 02:00:19,633
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1563
02:00:20,095 --> 02:00:22,795
It was rented
yesterday by Grantham.

1564
02:00:25,058 --> 02:00:27,233
Have you heard from Grantham?

1565
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:30,187
Not since yesterday.

1566
02:00:31,982 --> 02:00:34,551
I should've taken
him off that story.

1567
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:36,651
What story?

1568
02:00:38,989 --> 02:00:40,989
See what you can find.

1569
02:01:02,095 --> 02:01:03,914
Smith Keen...

1570
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:06,014
...meet Darby Shaw.

1571
02:01:07,768 --> 02:01:09,768
So, Mr Grantham...

1572
02:01:09,811 --> 02:01:11,986
...what the hell is going on?

1573
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:24,940
Sweetheart, I'm down here
in the basement.

1574
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,703
It's about two in the morning.

1575
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:33,208
This is...

1576
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:35,335
...an affidavit...

1577
02:01:37,047 --> 02:01:39,972
...concerning a memo
I found on my desk.

1578
02:01:41,176 --> 02:01:45,013
I'm going to trust you
to do with it what you will.

1579
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:49,506
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

1580
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:55,399
It was dated September 28th...

1581
02:01:56,733 --> 02:01:59,583
...addressed to
Wakefield and it read:

1582
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:02,811
'Sims, advise client
research is complete.

1583
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:05,383
The bench will sit much softer...

1584
02:02:05,472 --> 02:02:07,647
...if the old man is retired.

1585
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:10,510
The second retirement
is a bit unusual.

1586
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:12,149
Jensen, of all people.

1587
02:02:12,249 --> 02:02:14,081
Advise further that the pelican...

1588
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:15,903
...should arrive
here in 4 years...

1589
02:02:16,003 --> 02:02:18,088
...assuming other factors.'

1590
02:02:19,047 --> 02:02:21,047
There's no signature.

1591
02:02:21,508 --> 02:02:23,858
Then Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

1592
02:02:23,958 --> 02:02:25,958
...were killed.

1593
02:02:27,389 --> 02:02:29,000
I firmly believe that this is...

1594
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,126
...the work of Mattiece
and his associates.

1595
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:32,754
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,

1596
02:02:32,854 --> 02:02:34,171
but it refers to a client.

1597
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:36,596
Wakefield had no other clients.

1598
02:02:36,815 --> 02:02:39,318
And no client had
as much to gain...

1599
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:41,418
...from the new court.

1600
02:02:41,778 --> 02:02:44,379
I thought that I
was protecting us...

1601
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:46,954
...by not revealing what I found.

1602
02:02:47,284 --> 02:02:49,709
You'll only see this if I'm gone,

1603
02:02:49,809 --> 02:02:51,809
so I will have failed.

1604
02:02:52,789 --> 02:02:54,789
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1605
02:02:59,254 --> 02:03:01,254
I'll always be with you.

1606
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:05,342
Always.

1607
02:03:07,638 --> 02:03:10,431
This is Marty Velmano.
What a pleasure.

1608
02:03:10,531 --> 02:03:12,084
What can I do for you?

1609
02:03:12,184 --> 02:03:15,409
We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece...

1610
02:03:15,979 --> 02:03:18,715
...and his involvement
in the deaths...

1611
02:03:18,815 --> 02:03:20,509
...of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1612
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:22,980
Great. We'll sue you
for the next 20...

1613
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,389
...years. You'll be
named as a defendant.

1614
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:27,574
Oh, this will be great.

1615
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:30,524
Victor Mattiece will
own the Herald.

1616
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:33,227
Have you heard of
the Pelican Brief?

1617
02:03:33,327 --> 02:03:35,065
We have a copy of it.

1618
02:03:35,165 --> 02:03:37,151
We also have a copy of a memo...

1619
02:03:37,251 --> 02:03:39,236
...sent by you to
Sims Wakefield...

1620
02:03:39,336 --> 02:03:41,725
...in which you suggest
your client's...

1621
02:03:41,825 --> 02:03:44,032
...position would be
greatly improved...

1622
02:03:44,132 --> 02:03:46,442
...by the removal of Rosenberg...

1623
02:03:46,531 --> 02:03:48,579
...and Jensen from the court.

1624
02:03:48,679 --> 02:03:51,014
I noticed you waited till five.

1625
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:53,126
An hour earlier,
we could've...

1626
02:03:53,226 --> 02:03:54,877
...run to court,
stopped this.

1627
02:03:54,977 --> 02:03:57,077
You deny you wrote the memo?

1628
02:04:00,315 --> 02:04:02,317
It's a fabrication.

1629
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,510
You have no lawsuit,
Mr Velmano.

1630
02:04:06,196 --> 02:04:07,806
You know it.

1631
02:04:07,906 --> 02:04:09,906
You son of a bitch.

1632
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:14,396
Mr Coal?

1633
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:16,524
Have you read the Pelican Brief?

1634
02:04:16,624 --> 02:04:17,816
I have.

1635
02:04:17,916 --> 02:04:20,264
We're running a story
which verifies...

1636
02:04:20,364 --> 02:04:22,404
...the facts set
forth in that brief.

1637
02:04:22,504 --> 02:04:24,027
We've confirmed Mattiece...

1638
02:04:24,127 --> 02:04:25,824
...contributed over $4 million...

1639
02:04:25,924 --> 02:04:28,077
...to the president's
last campaign.

1640
02:04:28,177 --> 02:04:30,621
4,200,000, all through
legal channels.

1641
02:04:30,721 --> 02:04:31,872
That's right.

1642
02:04:31,972 --> 02:04:34,114
We believe the
White House tried...

1643
02:04:34,214 --> 02:04:36,418
...to obstruct the
FBI investigation...

1644
02:04:36,518 --> 02:04:39,296
...and we wonder
if there are any comments.

1645
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:40,735
The White House denies...

1646
02:04:40,835 --> 02:04:42,841
...any direct or
indirect involvement...

1647
02:04:42,941 --> 02:04:45,194
...in this investigation.

1648
02:04:45,903 --> 02:04:48,678
You've received some
bad information.

1649
02:04:56,163 --> 02:04:58,290
Mr Voyles, it's Grantham.

1650
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:02,569
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

1651
02:05:02,669 --> 02:05:05,114
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1652
02:05:05,214 --> 02:05:07,208
We're naming Mattiece, an oil...

1653
02:05:07,308 --> 02:05:09,493
...speculator, and
two of his lawyers.

1654
02:05:09,593 --> 02:05:12,024
We believe the FBI
knew about Mattiece,

1655
02:05:12,124 --> 02:05:13,664
but didn't investigate...

1656
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:16,339
...at the urging of
the White House.

1657
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:18,439
Any comments?

1658
02:06:29,464 --> 02:06:32,743
I think we'll have great
success with these people.

1659
02:06:32,843 --> 02:06:35,512
They were really very pleased...

1660
02:06:35,846 --> 02:06:38,182
...and genuinely cooperative.

1661
02:06:38,765 --> 02:06:40,765
What's up?

1662
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:26,102
You know Gray Grantham.

1663
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:29,606
And this is Darby Shaw.

1664
02:07:37,616 --> 02:07:39,616
So you're the little lady...

1665
02:07:39,661 --> 02:07:42,286
...who started this
great brouhaha.

1666
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:44,541
I think you have me confused...

1667
02:07:44,628 --> 02:07:46,798
...with the president's friend.

1668
02:07:46,834 --> 02:07:50,420
I have some comments,
for the record.

1669
02:07:59,388 --> 02:08:01,312
First, we got the Pelican Brief...

1670
02:08:01,412 --> 02:08:02,291
...two weeks ago...

1671
02:08:02,391 --> 02:08:04,277
...and submitted it
to the White House...

1672
02:08:04,377 --> 02:08:05,377
...on the same day.

1673
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:08,036
It was not considered
high priority in...

1674
02:08:08,136 --> 02:08:10,632
...the investigation
until Gavin Verheek...

1675
02:08:10,732 --> 02:08:12,726
...Special Counsel
to the Director,

1676
02:08:12,826 --> 02:08:13,886
was found murdered.

1677
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:16,036
Did the White House interfere...

1678
02:08:16,136 --> 02:08:18,515
...in the FBI
investigation of Mattiece?

1679
02:08:18,615 --> 02:08:20,615
I'll discuss it...

1680
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:22,617
...off the record.

1681
02:08:29,793 --> 02:08:32,205
Last Wednesday the
president asked me...

1682
02:08:32,305 --> 02:08:34,656
...to ignore Victor
Mattiece as a suspect.

1683
02:08:34,756 --> 02:08:36,756
In his words...

1684
02:08:36,925 --> 02:08:39,100
...he asked me to 'back off.'

1685
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,678
I have a tape...

1686
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,340
...which I will allow
no one to hear...

1687
02:08:44,391 --> 02:08:47,466
...unless the president
first denies this.

1688
02:08:48,145 --> 02:08:50,145
So what do you do now?

1689
02:08:50,898 --> 02:08:52,998
There'll be a grand jury by...

1690
02:08:53,091 --> 02:08:55,791
...noon tomorrow.
Quick indictments.

1691
02:08:56,278 --> 02:08:58,447
And we'll find Mattiece.

1692
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:03,899
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms Shaw.

1693
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,396
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

1694
02:09:06,496 --> 02:09:08,671
I'd like Mr Grantham to stay.

1695
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:31,186
What's next for you?

1696
02:09:31,813 --> 02:09:34,425
Who killed the man
disguised as Verheek?

1697
02:09:34,525 --> 02:09:37,319
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1698
02:09:38,195 --> 02:09:40,000
Off the record,
Khamel was killed...

1699
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:41,390
...by a contract operative...

1700
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:44,040
...hired independently by the CIA.

1701
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:45,769
Rupert?

1702
02:09:45,869 --> 02:09:47,646
He probably has 20 names.

1703
02:09:47,746 --> 02:09:49,746
Why was he following her?

1704
02:09:50,207 --> 02:09:52,036
I think the brief initially...

1705
02:09:52,136 --> 02:09:54,153
...scared Giminski
more than anyone.

1706
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:55,946
And he probably...

1707
02:09:56,046 --> 02:09:57,197
...sent Rupert...

1708
02:09:57,297 --> 02:09:59,297
...to trail Darby...

1709
02:09:59,508 --> 02:10:02,733
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

1710
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:09,226
We can help.
What do you want?

1711
02:10:11,687 --> 02:10:13,787
To leave the country, alone.

1712
02:10:16,733 --> 02:10:18,302
All right.

1713
02:10:18,402 --> 02:10:21,513
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1714
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:23,250
We'll fly you anywhere you want...

1715
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:24,391
...and you can disappear.

1716
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:27,416
But you must allow
me to contact you...

1717
02:10:27,619 --> 02:10:29,104
...through Mr Grantham...

1718
02:10:29,204 --> 02:10:30,579
...if, and only if,

1719
02:10:30,679 --> 02:10:32,929
it becomes urgently necessary.

1720
02:10:34,918 --> 02:10:36,918
That's fine.

1721
02:10:38,922 --> 02:10:41,422
I want no one on the plane but me,

1722
02:10:41,522 --> 02:10:43,410
Gray and the pilots.

1723
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:45,522
After take-off, I'll
tell the pilot...

1724
02:10:45,622 --> 02:10:46,622
...where to go.

1725
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:50,322
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

1726
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:53,061
You're the director of the FBI.

1727
02:10:54,104 --> 02:10:56,104
Set it up.

1728
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,660
Our guest today is
Gray Grantham...

1729
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,821
...who has, as just
about everyone...

1730
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:56,955
...in America knows...

1731
02:14:57,055 --> 02:14:59,435
...revealed the plot behind the...

1732
02:14:59,487 --> 02:15:02,169
...assassinations of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1733
02:15:02,269 --> 02:15:04,486
The ripple effects
of this story...

1734
02:15:04,586 --> 02:15:06,090
...just don't seem to stop.

1735
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:08,346
As of this broadcast,
Victor Mattiece,

1736
02:15:08,446 --> 02:15:10,427
one of the country's
richest men...

1737
02:15:10,527 --> 02:15:12,907
...has been indicted,
along with...

1738
02:15:12,982 --> 02:15:14,306
...4 aides and lawyers.

1739
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:17,066
Fletcher Coal, the
president's Chief...

1740
02:15:17,148 --> 02:15:18,685
...of Staff, has resigned.

1741
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:20,855
And we're getting
strong indications...

1742
02:15:20,955 --> 02:15:22,481
...that the president himself...

1743
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:24,581
...will not run again.

1744
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:28,233
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

1745
02:15:28,921 --> 02:15:31,388
We know the Pelican
Brief was written...

1746
02:15:31,488 --> 02:15:33,325
...by a woman named Darby Shaw...

1747
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:35,900
...but we don't know who that is.

1748
02:15:35,928 --> 02:15:37,930
Who is Darby Shaw?

1749
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:43,018
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1750
02:15:43,227 --> 02:15:44,423
Next question.

1751
02:15:44,523 --> 02:15:47,856
Speaking for many of
our colleagues...

1752
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:50,150
...who are in a
feeding frenzy to...

1753
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:51,093
...interview her...

1754
02:15:51,193 --> 02:15:53,193
...where is Darby Shaw?

1755
02:15:53,237 --> 02:15:55,876
That's also a question
for Darby Shaw.

1756
02:15:55,976 --> 02:15:57,766
But she's not available...

1757
02:15:57,866 --> 02:15:59,280
...to answer questions...

1758
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:01,145
...until the feeding frenzy stops.

1759
02:16:01,245 --> 02:16:02,385
Does that mean...

1760
02:16:02,485 --> 02:16:04,810
...you don't know where she is?

1761
02:16:05,332 --> 02:16:06,734
I didn't say that.

1762
02:16:06,834 --> 02:16:08,834
Then you do know.

1763
02:16:12,339 --> 02:16:14,742
I take it this
cryptic smile means...

1764
02:16:14,842 --> 02:16:16,842
...you're not answering.

1765
02:16:18,762 --> 02:16:22,057
In view of all this,
you know that...

1766
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,376
...there's speculation...

1767
02:16:24,476 --> 02:16:26,856
...that this woman is a figment...

1768
02:16:26,934 --> 02:16:28,297
...of your imagination.

1769
02:16:28,397 --> 02:16:29,978
That you created her...

1770
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:32,703
...from a lot of
different sources.

1771
02:16:33,068 --> 02:16:35,054
Just as there are
people who believe...

1772
02:16:35,154 --> 02:16:36,513
...there was no Deep Throat...

1773
02:16:36,613 --> 02:16:38,569
...there are those who believe...

1774
02:16:38,669 --> 02:16:40,017
...there is no Darby Shaw.

1775
02:16:40,117 --> 02:16:41,209
In other words,

1776
02:16:41,309 --> 02:16:43,634
she's just too good to be true.

1777
02:16:44,872 --> 02:16:46,872
She almost is.
