(chattering indistinctly)

- Dete, hi Dete.

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,818
- Hi Baerbel, how are you?

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,120
- Fine, getting
 used to the village.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,755
How was your trip to Frankfurt?

39
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,257
- Very good.

40
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,526
Heidi, run along ahead and
  I'll catch up with you.

41
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,094
- Okay, Aunt Dete.

42
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,631
- I've been hired
 by a wealthy family

43
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,199
and will work in their home.

44
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,802
- That's wonderful news,
but what about Heidi?

45
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,838
- I'm taking her up
 to her grandfather.

46
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,840
She'll live up on the
 mountain with him.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,308
- The grandfather?

48
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,710
But you know what a
miserable old man he is.

49
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,246
He never speaks to anyone
 when he comes to the village.

50
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,215
Every child here
  is afraid of him.

51
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,617
- Miserable or not,
 he's her grandfather.

52
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,719
I've taken care of Heidi
ever since my sister

53
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,288
and her husband passed away.

54
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,224
Now it's her grandfather's
  turn to do his duty.

55
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,493
(shudders)

56
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,935
(goats bleating)

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,578
- [Heidi] Can I play too?

58
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,513
Can I play with you?

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,431
I can't run with all
 these clothes on.

60
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,041
(bell tinkling)

61
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,644
(Heidi laughs)

62
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,348
- Where is that girl?

63
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,150
I let her out of my sight
  for one minute, and...

64
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,823
Heidi, Heidi.

65
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,730
What do you think you're doing?

66
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,100
- I was just playing.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,901
- And where are your clothes?

68
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,303
- There they are.

69
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,339
- You left them on a rock?

70
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,774
Oh, Heidi.

71
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:39,679
Peter, Peter, go
 get Heidi's clothes.

72
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,149
- Can't, have to take the
  goats to the mountain.

73
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,617
- I'll give you a penny.

74
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,924
(laughs)

75
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,138
I must say you can move fast
 when you want to, Peter.

76
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,073
We're going to the
 grandfather's house.

77
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,308
Will you walk with us?

78
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,542
- I'm going there too.

79
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,512
- Oh, can I play with
the goats along the way?

80
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,047
(sighs)

81
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,948
- Put your clothes on first,
 I'm not going to carry them.

82
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,521
(bell tinkling)

83
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,257
(goats bleating)

84
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,538
Now remember what I told
 you about your grandfather.

85
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,139
- Okay, Aunt Dete.

86
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,174
- [Dete] There he is.

87
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,677
- Hello Grandfather, I'm Heidi.

88
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,345
I'm coming to stay with you.

89
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,848
- Hm, we'll see about that.

90
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,683
What's the meaning
  of this, Dete?

91
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,085
- Good morning, Uncle.

92
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,853
I've brought Heidi
  to stay with you.

93
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,388
I've had her for five years.

94
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,757
It's your turn to
  tend the child.

95
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,292
- Turn?

96
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,728
You there, Peter, take your
 goats up into the mountains

97
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,096
and take mine with you.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,169
I know nothing about children.

99
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,171
- She'll stay with
  you all the same.

100
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,606
If you don't want her,

101
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,874
you'll have to think
  about what to do with her.

102
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,076
She's your responsibility now.

103
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,911
- Don't tell me
  what to do, girl,

104
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,147
and don't tell me
 how to live my life.

105
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,117
Now leave my home
 and don't come back.

106
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,488
- Goodbye to you then, and
  goodbye to you too, Heidi.

107
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,722
Take care of yourself.

108
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,562
- Can I look
 around, Grandfather?

109
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,098
- Hm, suit yourself.

110
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,005
(wind whistling)

111
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,709
- Wow, the trees sound
 like they're singing to me.

112
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,643
(bird chirps)

113
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,078
I wonder if they talk too.

114
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,962
- Well?

115
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,330
- Can I see the inside of
  your house, Grandfather?

116
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,899
- Ah, come along.

117
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:20,006
- This is a very nice house,
 but there's only one bed.

118
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,240
Where will you sleep?

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,441
- Me?

120
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,510
Why, (laughs) that's my bed.

121
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,680
- Oh, well, where will I sleep?

122
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,482
- Sleep wherever you like.

123
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,184
- I think I'll sleep up here.

124
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,188
(peaceful music)

125
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,268
Look, Grandfather,
  I've made a bed.

126
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,471
- Here, it's not a
proper bed without this.

127
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,041
There, now your bed is made.

128
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,376
I suppose we should
 have some lunch now.

129
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,147
- Thank you, Grandfather,
  but you need a chair.

130
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,215
- I'll make do.

131
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,083
Eat your meal.

132
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,754
- [Heidi] This is the
best milk I've ever had.

133
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,222
- Have some more.

134
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,292
After lunch, I'll build
 you a high stool to sit on.

135
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,898
(goats bleating)

136
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,633
- [Heidi] How did you
  know Peter would be coming

137
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,867
with the goats?

138
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,769
- He brings them
 down from the pasture

139
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,070
every day at this time.

140
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,141
- Peter, let's play.

141
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,709
Come on, over here.

142
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,381
- He's a little
  too busy to play.

143
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,449
- Too busy to play?

144
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,385
- I know that's hard to imagine

145
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,353
but he must finish
  his work first

146
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,322
and take the goats to Dorfli.

147
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,925
- Are these two goats both ours?

148
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,159
- Ours? (laughs)

149
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,627
Yes, they are.

150
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,730
The brown one is Little Bear
 and this is Little Swan.

151
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,432
- Can I play with them?

152
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,701
- It's late, you'll
 have plenty of time

153
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,503
to play with them tomorrow.

154
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,704
- Go, you two.

155
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,472
To the shed with you.

156
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,641
And as for you, off to bed.

157
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,311
- Goodnight Little Bear,
goodnight Little Swan,

158
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,046
goodnight Grandfather.

159
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,953
- [Grandfather]
  Goodnight, Heidi.

160
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,858
- Sweet dreams, Grandfather.

161
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,630
(goat bleating)

162
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,365
(crickets chirping)

163
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,867
(owl hooting)

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,475
(goats bleating)

165
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,944
- [Grandfather] Heidi, you
haven't finished your breakfast.

166
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,581
- But Peter's here with the
goats, and I've got to see them.

167
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,184
(joyous music)

168
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,392
They're so much fun.

169
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,562
Peter, you're so lucky
you have these friends.

170
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,997
- Friends?

171
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,166
Gee, I never thought
 of them like that.

172
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,334
(Heidi sighs)

173
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,537
- [Heidi] The
 mountains are so, so--

174
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,705
- [Peter] Big?

175
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,207
- [Heidi] Beautiful.

176
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,642
- I never really noticed,
  but you're right.

177
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,177
They are beautiful.

178
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,481
- Would you like to go up the
 mountains with Peter today?

179
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,282
- Up there, really?

180
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,785
- As long as you
stay with Peter.

181
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,887
- I will, I will, I promise.

182
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,156
- Peter, here's lunch
 for you and Heidi.

183
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,960
- This is no lunch,
 this is a feast.

184
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,895
- Then earn your
  right to enjoy it

185
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,864
by keeping a good eye on Heidi.

186
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,900
Make sure she doesn't wander
 too close to the cliffs.

187
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,502
- You can count on me.

188
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,936
Come on, Heidi,

189
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,872
those beautiful mountains
  are waiting for us.

190
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,351
(bright piano music)

191
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,559
- I didn't know there
 was this many flowers

192
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,161
in the whole wide world.

193
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,532
The goats sure know how
to have a good time.

194
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,833
- Why shouldn't they?

195
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,401
They have all the
  food they can eat

196
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,602
and these mountains to play in.

197
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,437
(goat bleating)

198
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,438
- What's that?

199
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,972
- It's one of the goats.

200
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,941
Her mother was sold yesterday.

201
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,209
I guess she's crying.

202
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,043
She must miss her.

203
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,013
- Aw, poor little thing.

204
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,181
What's her name?

205
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,415
- Her name's Peppermint.

206
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,550
Where are you going?

207
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,652
Let's eat, I'm hungry.

208
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,588
- You go ahead and eat,
I'll be right back.

209
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,091
Oh, don't cry, please don't cry.

210
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,960
It'll be okay, I'll
 be your friend.

211
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,528
Would that make you feel better?

212
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,399
Oh yes, we're gonna be
 the best of friends.

213
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,507
(goat bleats)

214
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,447
Peter, Peter, wake
 up, it's Little Swan.

215
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,482
- Huh?

216
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,984
(tense music)

217
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,821
Little Swan, stop!

218
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,497
- Oh no, Grandfather's goat!

219
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,170
- No!

220
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,075
(goat bleating)

221
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,547
You stupid goat, I thought
  you knew better than this.

222
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,315
(goat bleating)

223
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,150
- [Heidi] Oh no, no.

224
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,919
- Let go of me, Heidi.

225
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,622
- But you'll fall
  over the cliff.

226
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,024
Come on, Little Swan,
 you have to help.

227
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,362
(grunting)

228
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,203
(breathing heavily)

229
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,239
- You stupid goat.

230
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,407
- Don't yell at her.

231
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,242
Can't you see how scared she is?

232
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,577
(melancholy music)

233
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,045
- Oh, all right.

234
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,514
Now get back to the herd.

235
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,649
(goat bleats)

236
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,350
I guess I should thank you.

237
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,852
If you didn't wake me up,

238
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,488
I wouldn't have seen Little
 Swan going over the cliff.

239
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,322
Thanks.

240
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,859
(soft music)

241
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,733
(bird calling)

242
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,769
- Peter, look at that bird.

243
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,170
- [Peter] It's a robber bird.

244
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,638
- Let's go after it.

245
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,141
- We can't, it lives
  high up in the mountains.

246
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,109
Even goats can't
climb that high.

247
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,811
- Why does it sound like that?

248
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,313
- Who knows?

249
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,449
Come on, I have to take the
 herd back down now, let's go.

250
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,383
(Heidi gasps)

251
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,985
- The mountains are on fire.

252
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,253
(Peter laughs)

253
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,255
- Heidi, sometimes
  you are so silly.

254
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,090
It's just the sun setting.

255
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,093
- You mean it looks
 like this every day?

256
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,328
- Almost.

257
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,463
- I wish I could
  stay here forever.

258
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,131
- You'd be awfully
  cold if you did.

259
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:26,999
Now come on.

260
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,812
(crickets chirping)

261
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,316
- Grandfather, we
 had such a great day.

262
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,553
I saw the pasture and all the
 flowers and a robber bird,

263
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,022
and the mountains looked
like they were on fire.

264
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,590
- On fire?

265
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,593
- Grandfather, it's the
prettiest place I've ever seen.

266
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,161
Can I go there again tomorrow?

267
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,596
- I don't see why not.

268
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:01,834
- Yeah. (laughs)

269
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,170
Grandfather, why does the
 robber bird cry like it does?

270
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,773
- The bird cries because
he's mocking people

271
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,643
who live crowded
 together in the city.

272
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,112
He knows how good life
 is in the mountains,

273
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,481
and he thinks city
  people are foolish

274
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,449
for living the way they do.

275
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,951
- You know what, Grandfather?

276
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,853
I think the robber
  bird is right.

277
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,720
(Grandfather laughs)

278
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,821

- Hi Peter, where have you been?

326
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,701
- [Peter] I've been
 going to school.

327
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,169
- That must be fun.

328
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,206
I bet it's great playing
 with all the other children.

329
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,740
- I'd rather be with my goats.

330
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,142
- You'd have frozen goats

331
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,444
if you tried to
 drive them up there.

332
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,180
(peaceful music)

333
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,455
Come in, Peter, have
 breakfast with us.

334
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,524
- I never refuse a meal.

335
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,428
- So young and yet
  so wise. (laughs)

336
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,705
I'm glad I don't have
 to feed you every day.

337
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,840
- Oh, my grandmother
asked if you'd come down

338
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,842
and visit us for lunch some day.

339
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,377
We don't have much, but--

340
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,645
- Let's go now.

341
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,746
- Now?
 - Now?

342
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,948
Well, how about tomorrow?

343
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,250
- Tomorrow would be great.

344
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,351
- I can't wait.

345
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,055
Is it tomorrow yet?

346
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,825
- We've got to get
 through tonight first.

347
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,794
You know, Heidi, I'm
 not sure about this.

348
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,730
I don't get along with people,

349
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,899
and people don't
  get along with me.

350
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,168
- But you get along
 with me and Peter.

351
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,738
- Well, I'll take
  you down there.

352
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,674
You can visit and I'll
  pick you up at nightfall.

353
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,242
- Okay, Grandfather.

354
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,912
(lulling music)

355
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,449
- Hold on.

356
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,717
- [Heidi] Whoa!

357
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,454
(screaming)

358
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,456
This isn't fun!

359
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,726
(joyous festive music)

360
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,240
- Now, remember,

361
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,776
I'll be back to pick you
up when it gets dark.

362
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,878
- [Heidi] Yes,
 Grandfather, and thank you.

363
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,847
(knocking)

364
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,115
- [Grandmother] Who's there?

365
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,750
- It's me, Heidi.

366
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,653
Peter said you invited
 me for lunch, and I--

367
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:26,124
- Oh, my, yes, you're the
 girl Peter has told me about.

368
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,826
Come closer, child.

369
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,464
My, but you're a little thing.

370
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:36,168
Did you come down the
  mountain all by yourself?

371
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,769
- My grandfather brought me.

372
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,104
- Is he here?

373
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:43,308
- No, but, can't
  you see he's not?

374
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,545
- No, dear, I
 can't see anything.

375
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,747
- No wonder, it's
  too dark in here.

376
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,582
I'll open up the curtains.

377
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,718
- [Grandmother] It won't
do any good, Heidi.

378
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,020
I still won't be able to see.

379
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,222
- How about if I
 light some candles?

380
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,758
- You could light all
the candles in the world

381
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,893
and still I would not see.

382
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,762
I'm blind, Heidi.

383
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,599
- You mean you can never see?

384
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,868
- I see in a different way.

385
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,872
When I hear a kind word, it's
 like seeing a beautiful light.

386
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,709
A friendly hand feels like the
 warm glow of the golden sun.

387
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,544
- Well then, a hug
  and a kind word

388
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,847
is what you'll have every day.

389
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,248
- Thank you, Heidi.

390
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,487
- Grandfather, tomorrow
we've got to come back

391
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,322
and you have to bring
 your tools with you.

392
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,691
- Heidi, what are
  you talking about?

393
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,527
- Well, Peter's grandmother
 told me she can't sleep

394
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,562
because her shutters
 rattle so badly.

395
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,830
The roof has holes in it

396
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,266
and the wind whistles
 through the walls.

397
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,567
- But it's not our house.

398
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,103
- Please, oh
 please, Grandfather?

399
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,438
We have to help her.

400
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,807
- Something told me
 if I came down here

401
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,475
I was going to end
  up paying for it.

402
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,376
- You mean you'll do it?

403
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,946
- I suppose I can.

404
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,648
I'll start tomorrow.

405
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,625
(banging)

406
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,942
(water trickling)

407
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,015
(birds chirping)

408
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,317
(goats bleating)

409
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,920
(bright music)

410
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,760
- [Heidi] Grandfather, you've
 got to come see the mountains

411
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,295
with me and Peter tomorrow.

412
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,863
They're so beautiful.

413
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,867
- You've said that every spring
for the last three years.

414
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,569
- But you have to
  come, it's true.

415
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,008
- Uh oh, looks like
 we've got company.

416
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,384
(bell tinkling)

417
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,555
- [Dete] (gasps)
  Can this be Heidi?

418
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,024
Oh my goodness,
 you're looking well.

419
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,826
Do you remember your Aunt Dete?

420
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,328
- Yes, Aunt Dete.

421
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,765
- Uncle, I must say you've
 taken good care of the child.

422
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,700
- [Grandfather] The
  mountain agrees with her.

423
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,603
- I bring you good news
today for both of you.

424
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,905
I found a home for Heidi.

425
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,540
A friend of the
 mistress I work for

426
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,375
has a child who
  needs a companion,

427
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,911
and of course I at
 once thought of Heidi.

428
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,513
- But this is my home.

429
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,648
- They live in a fine
 house in Frankfurt

430
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,350
and it will be very
 good for Heidi.

431
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,353
- And very good
  for you, no doubt.

432
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,821
How much are they paying you?

433
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,523
- I see you haven't changed.

434
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,825
No matter, Heidi's
  coming with me.

435
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,760
- She stays here.

436
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,428
- She comes with me.

437
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,564
It's time she learned
 to read and write,

438
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,834
and she's not going to do it
 up here surrounded by goats.

439
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,103
- I know what's best for Heidi.

440
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,005
- Don't make me go
 to the courts, Uncle.

441
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,208
I do have papers showing
 that I am the legal guardian.

442
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,811
- You didn't tell me that
  when you left her with me.

443
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,747
You insisted I take the
  child in the first place.

444
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,683
- Only until I could find her
 a permanent home to live in.

445
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,152
Now I have and now
  I will take her,

446
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,555
unless you want the
  police brought into this.

447
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,489
- Take her.

448
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,391
Take her and leave my mountain.

449
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,892
- Grandfather?

450
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,294
- Let him go.

451
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,129
Come along with me, Heidi.

452
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,698
- No, I won't, I'm staying here.

453
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,866
- Didn't you hear him?

454
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,734
He doesn't want you here.

455
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,270
- He just said that
  because you made him mad.

456
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,941
- Heidi, listen to me,
  this is for your own good.

457
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,442
Now get your things.

458
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,177
We've got a train to catch.

459
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,047
(dog barking)

460
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,349
- [Clara] Oh, isn't she
 here yet, Madam Rottenmeier?

461
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,317
- [Madam Rottenmeier]
I'm sure they'll be here

462
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,451
any moment, Clara.

463
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,323
(knocking)

464
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,525
- Yes, may I help you?

465
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,427
- [Dete] I'm here to
 deliver the girl Heidi

466
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,028
to Madam Rottenmeier.

467
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,598
- Very well, you are expected.

468
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,537
- So this is the child.

469
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,639
- Yes, her name is Heidi.

470
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,074
- Very well.

471
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,976
You will be Miss
 Sesemann's companion.

472
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,412
You will study with Clara,
  read stories to her, and--

473
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,448
- But I can't read.

474
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,382
- What?

475
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,683
Our bargain was for a child

476
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,952
who could read and
  entertain Clara.

477
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,421
- You said nothing about
her being able to read.

478
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,224
As for entertaining, you'll
 find her amusing enough.

479
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,159
I leave her in your hands.

480
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,327
- Just a moment, Dete.

481
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,762
I have further words for you.

482
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,132
- Hi, I'm Heidi.

483
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,367
- That's a pretty name.

484
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,868
Mine's Clara.

485
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,437
- I'm sorry I can't read,
 but I live in the mountains.

486
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,972
I've never had to.

487
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,207
- The mountains?

488
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,642
You've lived in the mountains?

489
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,811
Have you ever seen
 any tigers or lions?

490
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,247
- (laughs) No, just goats.

491
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,850
- Well, don't worry about
  not being able to read.

492
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,685
My tutor will take care of that.

493
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,354
He talks too much but
he'll teach you to read.

494
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,623
- I hope so, I would love that.

495
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,558
- Well, let's not
 worry about it today.

496
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,294
It's your first day here.

497
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,795
I bet you're hungry.

498
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:07,232
- I am, I could drink five
 bowls of Little Swan's milk.

499
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,466
- Little Swan?

500
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,502
- Little Swan's one of
my grandfather's goats.

501
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,171
She makes the sweetest
milk you've ever tasted.

502
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,572
I'll tell you all about her.

503
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,977
(grunting)

504
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,184
(breathing heavily)

505
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,887
Grandfather? (sighs)

506
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,823
I almost forgot that
 I'm not at home.

507
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,034
What happened to the
trees and the mountains?

508
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,936
There's nothing to
 look at but houses.

509
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,073
Maybe if I can
 open up the window,

510
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,241
I can look out and
  see the mountains.

511
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,943
(grunting)

512
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,046
Oh, I wish I could
breathe the outside air.

513
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,749
What kind of a place has
Aunt Dete taken me to?

514
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,054
(crying)

515
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,796
May I please have another one?

516
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,933
- Take the roll, Heidi,
 you needn't ask permission.

517
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,136
- But my Grandfather said
 you should always ask first.

518
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,605
- Well, he's not here, I am,

519
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,074
and in the future you will
  come to breakfast on time.

520
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,176
You took a full 20
 minutes to get dressed

521
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,511
and down to the table.

522
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,447
- Madam Rottenmeier,
 didn't you forget?

523
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,182
- Forget what?

524
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,752
- Please, you forgot
 to say please.

525
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,454
- Heidi's right, I didn't
  hear it either. (laughs)

526
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,389
Did you, Sebastian?

527
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,258
- You know, I didn't.

528
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,527
- Well, I, (stuttering)

529
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,962
I need to speak with the cook.

530
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,701
(laughing)

531
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,679
- You're right, Heidi.

532
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,683
Good manners are important,
 no matter how old you are.

533
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,293
- How did you sleep
 last night, Heidi?

534
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,930
- The bed was nice but the
window in my room doesn't open.

535
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,433
- Well, just ask Sebastian,
 he'll open it for you.

536
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,470
This must seem very
  different from your home.

537
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,038
Tell me about Switzerland.

538
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,840
I know you lived on a mountain.

539
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,608
- You can't imagine it, Clara.

540
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:31,976
The fir trees
 would whistle to me

541
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,378
when the wind blows through them

542
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,280
and every day I'd
 go up to the pasture

543
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,248
with Peter and his
goats and pick flowers.

544
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,850
There were so many flowers,

545
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,252
and the mountains turn red
  when the sun sets and--

546
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,488
- It sounds spectacular.

547
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,423
Oh, it is, it is.

548
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,725
- But where are you going?

549
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,159
- To show you why
  it took me so long

550
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,661
to get down for breakfast.

551
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,232
- [Madam Rottenmeier]
Imagine, the cook asking

552
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,835
if this new girl has
 any favorite meals.

553
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,237
- A kind gesture, I'd say.

554
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,738
- Kind gesture.

555
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,374
The child will eat whatever
Clara eats and be lucky for it.

556
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,943
I've never heard
of such a thing.

557
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:09,848
(cat meowing)
 (clattering)

558
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:13,985
(laughing)

559
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,654
(playful music)

560
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,762
- Beasts, we have
 beasts in the house.

561
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,664
- They're not beasts,
 Madam Rottenmeier.

562
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,966
They're just kittens.

563
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,467
- They're animals,

564
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,303
and animals belong either
 in the zoo or the wilderness

565
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,473
which is exactly where I'm
 beginning to think you belong.

566
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,775
- Oh, but they're harmless,
 Madam Rottenmeier.

567
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,377
Can't I keep them?

568
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,912
- I should say not.

569
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,981
Who knows what diseases
they might have?

570
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,716
Sebastian, catch these creatures

571
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,217
and toss them out
  into the street.

572
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,386
(meowing)

573
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,056
(laughing)

574
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,928
How on earth could they
 have gotten into this house?

575
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,997
- I put them in,
  Madam Rottenmeier.

576
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,032
- You brought them
  into this house?

577
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,868
- Well, I heard them
  meowing outside my window

578
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,904
and I thought they'd
  make nice pets for Clara,

579
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,940
so I ran down and brought them
 to my room before breakfast.

580
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,708
- This is the absolute end.

581
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,144
Sebastian, after you've
disposed of the animals

582
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,713
you will take Miss
 Clara up to her room.

583
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,149
- (sighs) But we
 were just having fun.

584
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,419
- You've had quite
enough fun for one day.

585
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,523
As for you, I expect you to
 stay in your room all day.

586
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,660
That is, after you've
 cleaned up this mess in here.

587
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,801
- Don't worry, I'll keep
the kittens in my room.

588
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,937
Maybe when Mr. Sesemann returns

589
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,139
we can convince him
 it might be nice

590
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,808
to have some pets around
the house for Clara.

591
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,010
- Oh, thank you, Sebastian.

592
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,413
- [Sebastian] They are cute
 little things, aren't they?

593
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,582
(meowing)

594
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,687
- I've missed you
  so much, Father.

595
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,655
- And I you, Clara.

596
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,390
My time home is to be short.

597
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,793
I must leave for Paris
 tomorrow on business,

598
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,229
but I have a few
  surprises for you,

599
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,598
so let's make the
  most of it today.

600
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,133
- Mr. Sesemann, I have a
  matter of great importance

601
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,635
which I must discuss with you.

602
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:14,372
- Ah, but first let's
 meet this young lady.

603
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,074
You were the girl
 who was brought here

604
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,009
to be my Clara's companion.

605
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,711
- Companion?

606
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,579
I thought we were friends.

607
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,880
- Yes, that's right, Father.

608
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,349
We're friends.

609
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,050
- Well, friends it is.

610
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,520
- That is precisely what I
want to talk to you about, sir,

611
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,556
if we could speak privately.

612
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,957
- Yes, yes.

613
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,692
I'll only be a moment, my dear.

614
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,736
Now, what is it,
  Madam Rottenmeier?

615
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,772
- Sir, I've made a terrible
 mistake with this girl.

616
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,207
She cannot read
  and she is having

617
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,009
a bad effect on your daughter.

618
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,211
- Really, in what way?

619
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,380
- She's clumsy and
  she behaves badly.

620
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,881
Why, the other day I
 heard the two of them

621
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,251
laughing hysterically, and that
excites Clara far too much.

622
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,486
If you'll listen to me,

623
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,087
you'll send the girl
 home this very night.

624
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,124
- Sounds like it's
just what Clara needed.

625
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,792
- Where are you going, sir?

626
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,227
- To speak with my daughter.

627
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,164
So, Clara, how are you doing?

628
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:17,168
- Well, Father, I've never
 had so much fun in my life.

629
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,870
Heidi and I laugh and we play

630
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,105
and she tells me all
 sorts of stories.

631
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,641
She's the best friend
anyone could ever have.

632
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,310
- That goes for me too.

633
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,678
(laughing)

634
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,945
- Then it's settled.

635
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,315
Heidi will stay as
  long as she likes.

636
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,616
- You mean it?

637
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,785
- Madam Rottenmeier,
 from this day forth,

638
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,821
Heidi is to be treated as you
 would treat my own daughter,

639
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,424
and see to it that
 she has new clothes.

640
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,693
- Don't forget to say please.

641
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,828
(laughing)

642
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,830
- Please, Madam Rottenmeier.

643
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,265
Oh, and by the way,

644
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,567
Clara's grandmother
  arrives in two days, and--

645
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:50,668
- Grandmother?

646
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,503
Grandmother's coming here?

647
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,306
- I told you I had a
 few surprises for you.

648
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,109
- Heidi, Heidi, my
 grandmother's coming.

649
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,877
Oh, you'll love her,
 I just know you will.

650
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,013
- Oh, and one last thing.

651
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,816
We'll have two new
additions in the house,

652
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,551
a pair of kittens.

653
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,221
- You may have new clothes

654
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,923
and Mr. Sesemann
may have told me

655
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,925
to treat you like I
 do his own daughter,

656
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,762
but remember, you are not
 Mrs. Sesemann's granddaughter.

657
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,098
- Yes, Madam Rottenmeier.

658
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,633
- You are not to
address her as Grandmama

659
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,736
but as Gracious Lady.

660
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,004
- Yes, Madam Rottenmeier.

661
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,407
- Good, we understand
 each other.

662
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,145
(gentle music)

663
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,149
(knocking)

664
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,384
- Mrs. Sesemann,

665
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,387
what a great pleasure
it is to see you again.

666
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,056
- Nice of you to
  say so, Sebastian.

667
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,326
Now, where is that
 granddaughter of mine?

668
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,827
- [Clara] Here I am, Grandmama.

669
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,163
- Indeed you are.

670
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,664
Oh.

671
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,466
- You're looking
 well, Mrs. Sesemann.

672
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,202
- I'm looking like an
 old lady, Rottenmeier,

673
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,570
since that's what I am.

674
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,407
- But, but--

675
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,975
- Oh, but nothing.

676
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,344
I want to talk to
  my granddaughter.

677
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,981
- Grandmama, I want you to
  meet my new friend, Heidi.

678
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,583
- How nice to meet you, Heidi.

679
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,219
- It's nice to meet
you too, Gracious Lady.

680
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,054
(laughs)

681
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,890
- My my.

682
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,324
Gracious Lady?

683
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,060
Hm, there can be only one person

684
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,196
who told you to call me that.

685
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,032
Come now, Rottenmeier, confess.

686
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:31,235
- Well, I only thought the
  child should address you

687
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,870
with the respect you deserve.

688
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,440
- And I do thank you so.

689
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,642
(laughing)

690
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:41,145
Oh, but you must
  call me Grandmama.

691
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,981
- I can see I'm not needed
 anymore so I'll say goodnight.

692
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,821
- I admit I am
 amazed, Mrs. Sesemann.

693
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,590
I never thought the child
  could be taught to read.

694
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,694
- Your problem, Rottenmeier,
is you don't believe in people.

695
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:00,898
I believe one can do anything
 if one tries hard enough.

696
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,935
Perhaps we can even
 teach you to smile.

697
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,770
See, it's not so hard.

698
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,273

- [Clara] Happy birthday, Heidi.

730
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,948
- [Sebastian] You must
 blow out the candles.

731
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,452
- Sebastian's right, but
 you must make a wish first.

732
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,920
Then if you close your eyes

733
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,723
and blow out all the
 candles in a single breath,

734
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,625
the wish will come true.

735
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,727
- My wish will really come true?

736
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,695
- I'm sure of it.

737
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,763
(inhales deeply)

738
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,465
(blows)

739
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,633
- What's this?

740
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,167
- Open it and find out.

741
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,506
- Happy birthday, Heidi.

742
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,776
You have been such
 a good friend to me.

743
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,078
I want to give you
  something special.

744
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,216
A train ticket

745
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,617
to Switzerland?

746
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,119
(laughs)

747
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,253
- It's what you want most
  of all, isn't it, Heidi?

748
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,155
To go home to your grandfather.

749
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:15,092
- But I, I...

750
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,994
But who will be your friend?

751
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,197
- Oh, Heidi, you will always be.

752
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,234
- Heidi, the doctors have
 decided Clara is well enough

753
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,404
to go to a special school
  now with other children,

754
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,207
and I'm sure the reason she's
 stronger is because of you.

755
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,809
- You did so much for me.

756
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,711
I just wanted to do
 something for you.

757
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,914
- You will come
 visit me, won't you?

758
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,383
- Heidi, of course.

759
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,619
(laughing)

760
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,492
- Clara, the clothes you
  gave me are so beautiful.

761
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,327
- I'm glad you like them.

762
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,430
Remember me when you wear them.

763
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,166
- Oh, Clara, I'll
  never forget you.

764
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,167
(sighs)

765
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,401
- Oh, I know you have to go,

766
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,571
but (sighs) I'm going
 to miss you so much.

767
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,873
- [Heidi] And I'm
 gonna miss you too,

768
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,842
but you are coming to visit me.

769
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,079
- When spring comes I'll have
 Grandmama take me to see you.

770
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,582
- You'll love the mountains and
you'll love Grandfather too.

771
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,251
(gentle music)

772
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,522
(birds chirping)

773
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,307
- Heidi?

774
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,141
My Heidi?

775
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,249
- [Heidi] I missed you so much.

776
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,317
- And I, you.

777
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,695
(goats bleating)
(bell tinkling)

778
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,364
(water trickling)

779
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,837
(goats bleating)

780
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,573
- Hurry, Grandfather,
 they'll be here any minute.

781
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,375
Peter, Peter.

782
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,777
Will you stop for dinner
tonight and meet Clara?

783
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,423
He didn't even say a
word to me, Grandfather.

784
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,891
Why is he so angry?

785
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,260
- He's not angry, he's jealous.

786
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,530
He's had your friendship
  to himself for many years.

787
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,000
I think he's afraid you like
 Clara more than him now.

788
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,202
- But that's silly.

789
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,903
They're both my friends.

790
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,873
- Silly or not, I think
that's how he feels.

791
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,707
(horse whinnying)

792
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,042
Oh, we've got visitors.

793
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,982
- Clara, Grandmama!

794
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,784
(laughs)

795
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,620
(horse whinnying)

796
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:36,827
- Oh, this truly is
 a wonderful place.

797
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,264
Heidi was right, it's
 every bit as beautiful

798
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,632
as she said it was

799
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,801
and you are all
  she said you were.

800
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,104
She's a lucky girl to have
  you as her Grandfather.

801
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,672
- I'm the lucky one.

802
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,541
- Indeed you are.

803
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,277
We've had such a
marvelous visit.

804
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,046
Unfortunately it's time to go.

805
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:59,049
- Oh, Grandmama, can't we
  stay just a little longer?

806
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,051
The day went so fast.

807
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,753
- Yeah, please, Grandmama?

808
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,122
I don't want my best
 friend to leave yet.

809
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,191
- Then she can stay.

810
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,492
- What?
- What?

811
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,494
- I've arranged with
 your Grandfather

812
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:13,297
to have Clara stay with
you for a few weeks

813
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,599
while I stay down
  in the village.

814
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,735
Oh, that is, if you want to.

815
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,007
(laughing)

816
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,844
I think that means yes.

817
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,448
(goats bleating)

818
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,420
(tense music)

819
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,844
- Peter?

820
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,415
What have you done?

821
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:12,122
I'm afraid we've
  no choice, Clara.

822
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,325
I'd like for you to stay, but--

823
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,761
- Without my wheelchair,
I can't get around.

824
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,698
- I'll go down to the village
 and fetch your grandmother.

825
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,466
- I wanted Clara
  to see the pasture

826
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,635
and the mountains so badly.

827
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,539
- I came all this way and
  now I won't get to see it.

828
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,907
- Yes you will.

829
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,510
(peaceful music)

830
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,346
I'll leave you both
 up in the pasture,

831
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,047
then go get your grandmother.

832
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,084
At least you'll have a few
  hours to spend up there.

833
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,857
I shouldn't be too long.

834
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,459
Enjoy yourselves.

835
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,462
- I'll never forget this
day as long as I live.

836
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,896
You were right, Heidi.

837
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,532
This is the most beautiful
  place in the world.

838
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,935
- The meadow's even
 more beautiful.

839
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,471
It's filled with flowers.

840
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,072
- Oh, I wish I could see it.

841
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:06,010
- Maybe you can't see it but I
 can bring the flowers to you.

842
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,910
I'll be back.

843
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,296
Peter, how can you even talk
 to Clara after what you did?

844
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,765
- But I--

845
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,099
- How could you break
  her wheelchair like that?

846
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,568
- He did it because
 he likes you, Heidi.

847
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,170
He was afraid you
 wouldn't stay friends

848
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,205
with him now that I was here.

849
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,342
- Honestly, your goats have
 more sense than you do.

850
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,045
- I've forgiven him,
 Heidi, can't you?

851
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,313
- I'll do anything
  to make up for it.

852
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,314
- Anything?

853
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,582
- Anything.

854
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,985
- Good, you can help me
get Clara to the meadow.

855
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,386
We'll help her walk there.

856
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,889
- Oh, Heidi, I don't think so.

857
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,157
- We can do it.

858
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,892
Just wrap one arm
  around my shoulder

859
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,827
and the other around Peter's.

860
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,096
(grunting)

861
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,000
- I can't do it.

862
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,536
- Yes you can, you
 have to try, Clara.

863
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,104
- I am, but--

864
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,573
- Then stop saying
 but and just believe.

865
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,108
Remember what Grandmama says.

866
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,910
If you believe,
 anything can happen.

867
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,315
- Oh, I'm doing it, I'm walking.

868
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm really walking.

869
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,755
- Yes, you are, Clara.

870
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,290
Now wait for us.

871
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,525
(laughing)

872
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,532
- I don't understand it.

873
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,167
This is where I left them.

874
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,203
- But where can they be?

875
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:44,208
- I don't know, unless,
no, she couldn't.

876
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,110
They couldn't.

877
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,911
- Wait for me.

878
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,481
(joyous music)

879
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,457
Oh, she's walking.

880
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,227
My Clara is walking.

881
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,129
- Grandmama!

882
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:05,963
- Clara.

883
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,018
- It really is the most
 beautiful place in the world.

884
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,108
♪ Take a little sunshine

885
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,877
♪ Everywhere you go
