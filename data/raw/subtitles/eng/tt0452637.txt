1
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:31,283
<i>Once, man and those in the water</i>
<i>were linked.</i>

2
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,721
<i>They inspired us.</i>

3
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:36,157
<i>They spoke of the future.</i>

4
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:41,061
<i>Man listened and it became real.</i>

5
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,603
<i>But man does not listen very well.</i>

6
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:51,573
<i>Man's need to own everything</i>
<i>led him deeper into land.</i>

7
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,202
<i>The magic world of the ones</i>
<i>that live in the ocean...</i>

8
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,781
<i>... and the world of men...</i>

9
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,180
<i>... separated.</i>

10
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:04,652
<i>Through the centuries, their world,</i>
<i>and all the inhabitants of it...</i>

11
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:06,792
<i>... stopped trying.</i>

12
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:11,055
<i>The world of man became more violent.</i>

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,100
<i>War upon war played out,</i>
<i>as there were no guides to listen to.</i>

14
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:22,435
<i>Now those in the water</i>
<i>are trying again...</i>

15
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:25,236
<i>... trying to reach us.</i>

16
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,371
<i>A handful of their precious young ones</i>
<i>have been sent into the world of man.</i>

17
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,245
<i>They are brought in the dead of night...</i>

18
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:36,752
<i>... to where man lives.</i>

19
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,823
<i>They need only be glimpsed...</i>

20
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:43,758
<i>... and the awakening of man</i>
<i>will happen.</i>

21
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,296
<i>But their enemies roam the land.</i>

22
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:50,993
<i>There are laws that are meant</i>
<i>to keep the young ones safe...</i>

23
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,072
<i>... but they are sent</i>
<i>at great risk to their lives.</i>

24
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,038
<i>Many...</i>

25
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,234
<i>... do not return.</i>

26
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,942
<i>Yet still they try...</i>

27
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:08,177
<i>... try to help man.</i>

28
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:15,082
<i>But man may have</i>
<i>forgotten how to listen.</i>

29
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,875
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

30
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:43,720
Well, it's some kind
of a b... b... b... Bug.

31
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,880
It's very big.

32
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,627
It's very hairy.

33
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:57,701
My other daughter says
it's some kind of creature the devil made.

34
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,201
Tell her it's not a creature.

35
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:02,602
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

36
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,405
You...

37
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,101
You might wanna turn away.

38
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:23,384
Sorry this is taking so long.

39
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:39,267
It's over. It's over.

40
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,275
It's... It's safe.

41
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:53,384
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

42
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:00,188
Mr. Farber?

43
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,301
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

44
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,693
Mr. Heep!

45
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,006
You are new tenant?

46
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:16,705
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

47
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,340
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon Choi.
She lives with her mother in 8A.

48
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,886
She's a student at the university.

49
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:26,754
Young-Soon, you don't know...

50
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:30,691
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

51
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,127
No, Mr. Heep.

52
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:36,528
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

53
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,294
You're welcome.

54
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,736
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

55
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:48,007
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

56
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,549
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

57
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:56,148
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

58
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,721
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

59
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,119
No.

60
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,489
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

61
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:09,129
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

62
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:13,032
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

63
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:18,040
I hear sp... sp... sp...
Splashing some nights.

64
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,175
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

65
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:34,789
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

66
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,525
I could give you a vein like that.

67
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:41,359
I could make it look just like this. Right?

68
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,395
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

69
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,403
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

70
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:52,203
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

71
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,615
This morning I measured my bicep.

72
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,014
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

73
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,782
Look at that.

74
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,223
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

75
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:11,127
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

76
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,764
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

77
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:16,694
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

78
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,497
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

79
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,003
Here we go. Come on.

80
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,607
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

81
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,043
- Okay.
- All right.

82
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:34,584
Just... People might trip.

83
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:35,811
All right.

84
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:38,923
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

85
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,355
He's working out
only one side of his body.

86
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,291
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

87
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:46,328
<i>- Be inside within minutes.</i>

88
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,726
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

89
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,631
<i>Those soldiers are only now beginning</i>
<i>to wonder how long they'll end up staying.</i>

90
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:55,739
<i>If this does come to combat, we will not</i>
<i>be in the battle for the sake of the battle.</i>

91
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,500
He's been here f... f... Forever.

92
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,076
<i>- Will not be reached any other way.</i>

93
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:06,214
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

94
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,415
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

95
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,082
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

96
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,697
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

97
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,800
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

98
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,128
What? Are you...?

99
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,998
This is you.

100
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,803
There's no smoking inside.

101
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:39,607
And there's no swimming after 7.

102
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:47,591
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

103
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,922
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

104
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,087
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

105
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:57,599
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

106
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,321
<i>Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.</i>

107
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,483
<i>I smell something awful</i>
<i>coming from the upstairs apartment.</i>

108
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:27,928
<i>I think someone may have died</i>
<i>and the body is decomposing.</i>

109
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,467
<i>I know I said this last week, but...</i>

110
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,741
<i>Not everyone here</i>
<i>spent Sunday practicing for war.</i>

111
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:49,944
<i>At Sunday church services,</i>
<i>chaplains rallied the troops.</i>

112
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:52,647
<i>For these Marines,</i>
<i>a moment for prayer...</i>

113
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:58,421
<i>... at a service that many here believe</i>
<i>will be their last before going to war.</i>

114
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:03,765
<i>U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,</i>
<i>estimated at 3 to 4000...</i>

115
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:05,562
<i>... may be willing...</i>

116
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,676
<i>- a major... a major confrontation.</i>

117
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:19,579
<i>At the same time, the U.S. Military</i>
<i>will be fighting a propaganda war.</i>

118
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:23,619
<i>If there were a silver bullet,</i>
<i>we would've shot that a long time ago.</i>

119
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,042
Hey! I saw you!

120
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,347
I saw you!

121
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,654
Come out of that pool right now!

122
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,388
Hey!

123
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,564
I'm gonna wait.

124
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:50,932
Hey.

125
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,004
Hey.

126
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,782
Come on out, now. It's...

127
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:07,491
It's... It's not safe.

128
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:12,791
Come on out. This is not f...

129
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,624
This is not funny.

130
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,831
Please sto...

131
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,965
God.

132
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:02,102
Did you pull me out?

133
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:11,377
Where are you from?

134
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,810
The Blue World.

135
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,315
Is that an apartment?

136
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,217
Do you feel an awakening?

137
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,820
I'm sorry?

138
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:26,452
It will feel like pins and needles...

139
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:29,066
...inside.

140
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,164
It is not you.

141
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,440
It's late.

142
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,978
You really...

143
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,883
You shouldn't be here.

144
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:55,754
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

145
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,622
My name is Story.

146
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,957
I didn't mean for you to tell...

147
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,761
Why am I not stuttering?

148
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:09,406
What?

149
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,647
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

150
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,785
"From the cliffs."

151
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,881
That is what your name means.

152
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,886
Where did you learn that?

153
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:27,991
From my studies.

154
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:35,294
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

155
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,263
I am scared.

156
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:43,802
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

157
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,834
Why are you scared?

158
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,989
You can wait here for a little bit...

159
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,755
...until you feel not so scared.

160
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,799
Are you okay?

161
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,738
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

162
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,358
Hello.

163
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:58,712
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

164
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:08,381
Okay.

165
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,085
I think you need some fresh air.

166
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm just gonna take you outside.

167
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,896
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

168
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,433
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

169
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,833
...and then you can wake up.

170
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,437
Then I'll walk you home.

171
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,015
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

172
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,621
- Narf.
- What?

173
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:48,423
Okay. Come on.

174
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,459
Here we go.

175
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,438
Okay.

176
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:26,363
It was sort of h... h... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

177
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:29,227
And it was kind of g... green.

178
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,368
- You say green?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:35,028
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

180
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:40,542
It was f... f... flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

181
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:46,045
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

182
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:51,484
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

183
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:55,490
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

184
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,254
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

185
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,422
I mean, are there any w... w...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

186
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,127
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

187
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:12,036
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

188
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,407
I'll look around the forest
and check behind the dumpsters and stuff.

189
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,810
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

190
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,779
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

191
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,681
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

192
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:34,253
Cleveland.

193
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,383
Hey.

194
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:37,959
Got a lot of homework, huh?

195
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,597
University gives many pages of reading.

196
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,598
What they think, I have no social life?

197
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:46,603
I got more books for you.

198
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,730
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

199
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:55,577
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

200
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:56,941
I do not remember it.

201
00:20:57,115 --> 00:21:00,084
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

202
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,776
A b... b... b...

203
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,152
Bedtime story?

204
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:08,224
What's the story?

205
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,423
I do not remember.

206
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:15,655
How about your mother?

207
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:30,105
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

208
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,751
She wants to know
who told you this word.

209
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,485
Oh, j... just a friend.
I don't... I don't... I don't know her very well.

210
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,060
She said that her grandmother...

211
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:56,332
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

212
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:03,141
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

213
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,111
Saw one what?

214
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:13,487
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

215
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:20,595
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

216
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,531
No. Mrs...

217
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:40,316
In the bedtime story...

218
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,888
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

219
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:55,063
This person is called the vessel.

220
00:22:55,233 --> 00:23:00,330
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

221
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,406
If she's successful in this...

222
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:10,674
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

223
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,282
...and become free.

224
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,882
She won't tell me more.

225
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:20,990
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

226
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:37,101
Story?

227
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,939
Story?

228
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:45,643
Cleveland.

229
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:54,550
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

230
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,966
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

231
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:18,379
Is somebody supposed to see you?

232
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,180
Is...?

233
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,551
I...

234
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,832
It is a writer.

235
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,399
Do you know his name?

236
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,878
Do you know what he looks like?

237
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:59,412
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

238
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:06,994
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

239
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:18,104
Is this person
writing something important?

240
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,917
When do you have to leave?

241
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:30,986
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

242
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,453
I'm gonna help you get home.

243
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,925
Thank you, Cleveland.

244
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,829
I have to go.

245
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,866
Hello. I... I...

246
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:53,535
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

247
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:57,147
Your c... c... critic work.

248
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:01,081
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

249
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:06,189
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

250
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,882
So you... you...
You haven't written anything yet?

251
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,891
Haven't written anything
for some time.

252
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,989
You were right about that one tenant.

253
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:16,258
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

254
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:20,200
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

255
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:23,364
You know she wrote a book?

256
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:28,543
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

257
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,741
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

258
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:35,814
Lookie here.

259
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:41,318
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

260
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:46,992
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

261
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:53,432
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

262
00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:55,196
Now, where'd you hear such things?

263
00:26:56,006 --> 00:27:01,945
Maybe I read your book.

264
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:05,913
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

265
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,541
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

266
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,247
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

267
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,685
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

268
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:23,095
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

269
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:28,937
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

270
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:32,005
You'll figure it out, Dad.

271
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,035
I...

272
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,738
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

273
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,441
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

274
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,280
Incarnate.

275
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:50,250
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

276
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:53,955
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

277
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,259
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

278
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:00,666
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

279
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:02,328
A book, maybe?

280
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,700
No, I...

281
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:08,709
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

282
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:12,546
That's some serious reekage, man.

283
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,310
You don't even speak English anymore.

284
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,115
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

285
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,520
There's no "reekage," man.

286
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:27,153
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

287
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,594
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

288
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:34,863
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

289
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,375
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

290
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,478
Blim-blam.

291
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,978
What? Blim-blam?

292
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:47,208
Somebody already said that.

293
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:53,121
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

294
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,057
...any of you have written
anything lately.

295
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:03,459
An essay or something?

296
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,231
Something important?

297
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:09,235
No essays here, my man.

298
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:15,904
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

299
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,571
...and stop smoking.

300
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,120
Baby's on the half-tip.

301
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:31,823
- Snap!
- Yeah.

302
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:34,396
There you go. There you go.

303
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:35,654
Mr. Heep.

304
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:39,234
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

305
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,597
Young-Soon.

306
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:44,239
You're not writing anything, are you?

307
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,900
A p... p... p... paper, maybe?

308
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,569
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

309
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:56,050
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

310
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:00,786
She told me about a bad guy in story.

311
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:04,291
These creatures are called scrunts.

312
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:08,192
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

313
00:30:08,365 --> 00:30:10,993
They can lay completely flat.

314
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:13,898
Their back is covered in grass.

315
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:17,734
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

316
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:21,173
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

317
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,620
Vick. Anna.

318
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:17,289
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

319
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:20,699
I promise I'll get to it. How's the writing?

320
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:24,500
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

321
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,645
How long have you been writing, Vick?

322
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:31,979
Six months.

323
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:35,444
What? I should finish, right?

324
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,816
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

325
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:40,854
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

326
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,358
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

327
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:48,590
I can fix that light now, if you want.

328
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,872
A cookbook.

329
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,076
This has gotten s... s...

330
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:44,081
Silly.

331
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:51,284
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

332
00:32:51,462 --> 00:32:52,724
I fixed the light.

333
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,864
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

334
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,431
You're both cooks?

335
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,798
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

336
00:33:06,844 --> 00:33:08,835
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

337
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,572
I'm sorry. My... my ladder...

338
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,410
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

339
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:19,113
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

340
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,950
It said <i>The Cookbook</i>.

341
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,389
I know, it's a bad title, right?

342
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,657
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

343
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,062
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

344
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:34,204
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

345
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:38,273
That is not how you fold.

346
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:52,344
Your thoughts are very sad.

347
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,453
Most are of one night.

348
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,089
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

349
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,895
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

350
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:14,043
That is when you stopped being happy.

351
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:19,106
You were a doctor.

352
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:24,281
I am very sorry for you.

353
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:28,687
You believe you have no purpose.

354
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:31,458
You help all that live here.

355
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:34,495
Anybody can do this job, Story.

356
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,963
You have a purpose.

357
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:40,531
All beings have a purpose.

358
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,768
I know who you are.

359
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:53,779
And I think that I've found your vessel.

360
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,881
You know what I'm talking about, right?

361
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,990
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

362
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,423
...or does he just need to see you?

363
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:16,931
Cover yourself up.

364
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:22,739
Hey.

365
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,473
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

366
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,049
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

367
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:32,481
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

368
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:36,686
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

369
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,320
Hi.

370
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,572
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

371
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:02,351
Great.

372
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,657
You all right? You look a little...

373
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,627
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

374
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:19,131
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

375
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,367
Yeah, kind of.

376
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,998
Yeah.

377
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:30,042
Maybe you should go lie down.

378
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:37,747
Nice meeting you.

379
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,823
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

380
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:07,342
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

381
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,749
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

382
00:37:11,922 --> 00:37:13,549
Is that okay?

383
00:37:13,724 --> 00:37:16,352
Your words are very beautiful.

384
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,953
Your heart is very big.

385
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,706
No one knows about my family here.

386
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:41,707
Please do not bring it up again.

387
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,189
Coming.

388
00:37:56,533 --> 00:38:01,266
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

389
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:02,837
Come on.

390
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:08,937
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

391
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,340
Don't tell him I told you.

392
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:13,415
I... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

393
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:18,247
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

394
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,152
Don't tell him I told you.

395
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,320
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

396
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:29,556
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

397
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:32,827
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

398
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:36,267
It's... It's... It's okay.

399
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,035
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

400
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,774
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

401
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,781
There are laws. It will be safe.

402
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,545
I'm allowed to leave this night.

403
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:02,257
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

404
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,694
You must not watch.

405
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:06,335
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

406
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:08,599
I won't watch.

407
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:11,866
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

408
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,737
You keep it.

409
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:47,102
What happened?

410
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,065
Okay. Okay.

411
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:55,803
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

412
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:58,106
How'd you get those scratches?

413
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,380
Did the eagle come?

414
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,120
Did something go wrong? Story.

415
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:09,725
Story. Was it that dog again?

416
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:19,763
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

417
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:36,713
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

418
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:41,321
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

419
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:43,288
She's beautiful.

420
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,690
She's not feeling that well:

421
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:47,693
So she's lying down in my room.

422
00:41:47,864 --> 00:41:50,298
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

423
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,630
Well,
she got sick in the stairwell downstairs.

424
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:59,037
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

425
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:00,642
Blim-blam.

426
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:05,781
Mr. Heep is a player.

427
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:15,722
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

428
00:42:15,892 --> 00:42:17,621
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

429
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:20,558
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... f... f...
- Fine?

430
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:23,364
Thank you.

431
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:26,028
No, she just needs some rest.

432
00:42:26,202 --> 00:42:28,534
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

433
00:42:29,906 --> 00:42:32,204
You started writing again?

434
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:35,768
Yeah.

435
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,940
I'll be right back. Okay?

436
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:51,726
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

437
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:53,260
No home.

438
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,194
Great. Unbelievable.

439
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,863
Hey. Hey.

440
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,567
Thanks.

441
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:12,103
- Yeah, hello?
<i>- Mr. Heep?</i>

442
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:14,807
- Where are you?
<i>- At a club.</i>

443
00:43:14,984 --> 00:43:17,509
<i>Don't tell my mother.</i>
<i>She thinks I'm at a dance class.</i>

444
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:18,949
Okay.

445
00:43:19,356 --> 00:43:22,621
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

446
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:26,819
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Put my mother on, I'll ask her.</i>

447
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:30,630
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

448
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:47,748
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

449
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,580
Oh, she... she... she...
She doesn't look happy.

450
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,383
<i>She said the story</i>
<i>her grandmother told...</i>

451
00:43:54,557 --> 00:43:57,754
<i>... said a scrunt has poison</i>
<i>that kill narfs.</i>

452
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:02,159
<i>But she said</i>
<i>narfs can protect themselves.</i>

453
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:06,098
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

454
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,601
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

455
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:11,496
Okay, okay.

456
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:17,874
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

457
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,880
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

458
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:25,214
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

459
00:44:25,388 --> 00:44:26,946
<i>You're funny, Mr. Heep.</i>

460
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:29,421
- Yeah, I know.
<i>- You really thought about this.</i>

461
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:31,787
<i>Put my mom on.</i>

462
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,214
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

463
00:44:56,786 --> 00:44:58,014
Yes?

464
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:01,248
<i>She said only a rogue scrunt</i>
<i>will break the law of that night...</i>

465
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:03,221
<i>... because most scrunts are afraid.</i>

466
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:05,156
Afraid of what?

467
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:10,163
<i>Tartutic. They are the law keepers</i>
<i>in this bedtime story.</i>

468
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,166
<i>Her grandmother said</i>
<i>there are three of them...</i>

469
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,499
<i>... but they are called one name:</i>
<i>Tartutic.</i>

470
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:20,905
<i>They live in the trees.</i>
<i>They are said to look like monkeys.</i>

471
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:26,509
<i>No one knows for sure because</i>
<i>no one who has seen them has lived.</i>

472
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:30,710
<i>The legend says</i>
<i>that they were born so evil...</i>

473
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:34,448
<i>... that they killed their parents</i>
<i>on the night they were born.</i>

474
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:39,857
<i>The fear of them has kept justice</i>
<i>in The Blue World for centuries.</i>

475
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,997
<i>Bye, Mr. Heep.</i>

476
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:50,061
Thanks.

477
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:11,424
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

478
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,926
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

479
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:16,475
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

480
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:18,443
She tell me more of the story.

481
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:21,310
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

482
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:27,922
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

483
00:49:28,224 --> 00:49:31,716
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

484
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:34,863
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

485
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:37,622
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

486
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:41,465
<i>A Thousand Narfs</i> is about a rare narf...

487
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,037
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

488
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:47,199
...who is called the Madam Narf.

489
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:50,868
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

490
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:55,882
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

491
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:59,544
She's considered
a queen to her people.

492
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:03,453
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

493
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:07,153
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

494
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,026
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

495
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,600
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

496
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,166
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

497
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,969
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

498
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,170
No one is ever told who they are.

499
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:26,315
I think we are linked.

500
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,007
It's more than just a story to me too.

501
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:31,676
I actually want to believe it.

502
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,550
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

503
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:53,501
You have saved my life again.

504
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,472
You made that room.

505
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:03,942
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

506
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,556
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

507
00:51:07,723 --> 00:51:10,453
Well, the door needs a little work.

508
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:16,558
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

509
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:19,257
...that people left around the pool.

510
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:25,471
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

511
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,844
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

512
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:38,714
Why did he break the rules tonight?

513
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:42,881
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

514
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:46,921
...very important to everyone.

515
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:29,699
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

516
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:32,707
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

517
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:34,809
I trust you.

518
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,841
I believe you are here to protect me.

519
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:44,049
Is the Kii working?

520
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,245
Yes, thank you.

521
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:50,158
If it is true that I am...

522
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:52,658
He will keep coming after me.

523
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:55,626
I will not be safe until...

524
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,130
Until Tartutic comes.

525
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:15,317
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

526
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,112
I was the only one who believed her.

527
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:20,755
She's not an apparition, Anna.

528
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,824
I don't know who you are...

529
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,496
...but you did something to me.

530
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:32,666
My thoughts.

531
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:39,230
Everything became clearer.

532
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:44,607
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

533
00:53:45,381 --> 00:53:47,508
I can hear myself.

534
00:53:49,919 --> 00:53:52,547
Do you wish to know your future?

535
00:53:58,427 --> 00:54:01,658
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

536
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:06,234
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

537
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:09,599
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

538
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:13,133
He will grow into a great orator.

539
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,678
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

540
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:19,110
...and throughout the world.

541
00:54:19,915 --> 00:54:24,215
This boy will become
leader of this country...

542
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:27,254
...and begin a movement
of great change.

543
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:31,050
He will speak of you and your words.

544
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:35,629
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

545
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:40,495
It will be the seeds of change.

546
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,097
<i>The Cookbook</i>?

547
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:56,016
One, two, three.

548
00:55:30,352 --> 00:55:32,081
Oh, jeez.

549
00:55:40,863 --> 00:55:45,926
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

550
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:21,560
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

551
00:56:22,938 --> 00:56:26,237
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

552
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:51,924
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

553
00:56:52,101 --> 00:56:55,036
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

554
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:58,230
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

555
00:56:59,742 --> 00:57:04,076
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

556
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,475
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

557
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:12,917
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

558
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:17,616
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

559
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,954
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

560
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:22,359
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

561
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:26,934
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

562
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:31,129
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

563
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:33,867
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

564
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:37,035
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

565
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:41,742
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

566
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:43,444
We're ready.

567
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:49,649
So in this bedtime story...

568
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:53,022
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

569
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:56,722
She must leave from the same spot.

570
00:57:56,899 --> 00:57:59,629
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

571
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,326
...is really very important.

572
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:03,494
And here's the good stuff.

573
00:58:03,672 --> 00:58:07,608
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

574
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,301
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

575
00:58:10,479 --> 00:58:12,640
...to live near the vessel.

576
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:15,340
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

577
00:58:15,517 --> 00:58:18,748
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

578
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:21,719
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

579
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,448
...but don't know who they are?

580
00:58:24,994 --> 00:58:25,983
That's a yes!

581
00:58:28,163 --> 00:58:32,827
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

582
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:34,162
Ask her if that's right.

583
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,566
You want something.

584
00:58:40,376 --> 00:58:43,106
One of them. Vick.

585
00:58:43,279 --> 00:58:47,978
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

586
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:52,015
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

587
00:58:54,189 --> 00:58:56,453
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

588
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:01,190
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

589
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:04,764
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

590
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:07,265
He will interpret messages...

591
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:11,034
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

592
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:14,334
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

593
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,744
That's a no.

594
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,905
And I was told that there is a Guild...

595
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,881
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

596
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:25,987
Does she know who they are?

597
00:59:26,155 --> 00:59:28,350
There is a Guild or something.

598
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:31,322
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

599
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,961
That's another no.

600
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:36,928
All right, there's one other.

601
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,728
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

602
00:59:40,903 --> 00:59:44,395
It's a human, usually a female...

603
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,268
...so full of hope...

604
00:59:46,442 --> 00:59:51,277
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

605
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:53,608
Now, that one is called the Healer.

606
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:55,977
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

607
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:59,086
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

608
01:00:01,023 --> 01:00:03,719
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

609
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,486
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

610
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:15,295
Reading? A book?

611
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:17,405
Learning.

612
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,403
She thinks it has to be learned.

613
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,875
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

614
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,716
Only one last time.

615
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,378
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

616
01:00:31,553 --> 01:00:33,180
You have to find them.

617
01:00:40,629 --> 01:00:42,153
What is it?

618
01:00:42,331 --> 01:00:44,561
You know these walls are paper-thin?

619
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:48,100
I can hear all that bloody noise downstairs
like they were in my kitchen.

620
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,568
Can you do anything about that?

621
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:54,237
Of course not.

622
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:58,973
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

623
01:00:59,148 --> 01:01:03,141
You're an expert on p... p... plots, right?

624
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:08,119
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

625
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,657
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

626
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:13,852
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

627
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:18,591
Well, if there was a mystery...

628
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:22,134
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

629
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,535
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

630
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:28,870
...someone who can
figure out messages...

631
01:01:29,044 --> 01:01:34,983
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

632
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,850
How would you figure that out?

633
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:41,954
The symbol person should be simple.

634
01:01:42,357 --> 01:01:45,849
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

635
01:01:46,028 --> 01:01:47,723
...but required analysis.

636
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:51,297
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

637
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:53,731
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

638
01:01:53,902 --> 01:01:57,998
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

639
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:02,400
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

640
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:08,178
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

641
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,851
Sure, Dad.

642
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:14,321
<i>As for the guild...</i>

643
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:17,618
...look for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

644
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:20,660
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

645
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:23,093
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

646
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:26,666
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

647
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:29,702
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

648
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,635
On occasion.

649
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:38,977
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

650
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:42,348
You talked about that?

651
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:45,487
<i>This is the writer's way</i>
<i>of establishing characters...</i>

652
01:02:45,654 --> 01:02:48,521
<i>... who will be important</i>
<i>further in the story.</i>

653
01:02:48,891 --> 01:02:52,019
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

654
01:02:52,194 --> 01:02:56,028
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

655
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,473
Story, these young men are the Guild.

656
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:17,710
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

657
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:21,750
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

658
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,959
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

659
01:03:27,663 --> 01:03:31,429
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

660
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:35,964
Story wants to go home and she can't.

661
01:03:36,138 --> 01:03:38,663
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

662
01:03:39,508 --> 01:03:41,738
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

663
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:46,370
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

664
01:03:49,238 --> 01:03:53,299
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what to do
if something should go wrong.

665
01:03:53,476 --> 01:03:57,435
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

666
01:03:57,613 --> 01:03:59,478
...to interpret.

667
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,881
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

668
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:05,543
Let's just see what happens.

669
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:09,114
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

670
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:18,666
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

671
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:23,533
And it touches...

672
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,636
...27 down, which is "scheme."

673
01:04:28,811 --> 01:04:31,109
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

674
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,545
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

675
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:38,118
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

676
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:44,986
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

677
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:48,756
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

678
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,796
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

679
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:54,594
Soiree could mean "party." How could a...?
How does a party help us?

680
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,534
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

681
01:04:57,707 --> 01:05:02,872
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

682
01:05:03,045 --> 01:05:05,639
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

683
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:09,649
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

684
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:13,550
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

685
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:17,124
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

686
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:21,024
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

687
01:05:21,197 --> 01:05:22,289
Does that sound right?

688
01:05:22,465 --> 01:05:25,059
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

689
01:05:25,234 --> 01:05:28,294
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

690
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:33,039
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

691
01:05:33,209 --> 01:05:37,009
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

692
01:05:37,346 --> 01:05:40,247
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

693
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:42,543
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

694
01:05:42,718 --> 01:05:44,481
Would I be able to watch now?

695
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:49,622
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

696
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:53,489
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

697
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:58,159
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

698
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:01,826
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

699
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:04,939
It could mean music, a band.

700
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:09,544
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

701
01:06:09,712 --> 01:06:13,148
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

702
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:17,116
...to help her with that thing and...

703
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:19,049
Until she's taken.

704
01:06:20,122 --> 01:06:21,851
He's a prophet.

705
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:25,187
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

706
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:28,057
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

707
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,926
That is why they're the Guild.

708
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,127
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

709
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:37,772
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

710
01:06:38,474 --> 01:06:42,001
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

711
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:45,306
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

712
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:49,008
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

713
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,759
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

714
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:02,520
I'm nervous too.

715
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:06,128
You being out there tomorrow night.

716
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:09,799
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

717
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:16,204
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

718
01:07:17,446 --> 01:07:19,778
Get a little practice with him?

719
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:21,917
Scare him, maybe?

720
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:24,075
Show him who's boss?

721
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,124
I know you wanna get home.

722
01:07:39,368 --> 01:07:41,495
You will need a mirror.

723
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:44,806
<i>Can you hear me? I'm here.</i>

724
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,538
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

725
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:52,409
It is only through a mirror that one
can see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

726
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:57,484
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

727
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,555
<i>Yeah, I... I don't... I...</i>

728
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:04,683
Wait.

729
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:07,058
I see him.

730
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:12,861
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

731
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:15,868
He is a great weapon against him.

732
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:20,703
You should walk backwards
towards him.

733
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:23,936
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

734
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,707
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

735
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,254
I'm facing him.

736
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,358
<i>I am scared.</i>

737
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,590
<i>It is about to get very dangerous.</i>

738
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:41,692
Okay.

739
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:45,263
I'm ready.

740
01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:51,298
You must invoke the ancient words
"<i>Nef Ra Mora</i>."

741
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:56,776
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

742
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:07,753
<i>What is happening?</i>

743
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:11,853
He's rising out of the grass.

744
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:16,628
His legs are bending and coiling...

745
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,263
...underneath him.

746
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:23,732
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

747
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,907
<i>He's standing in front of me.</i>

748
01:09:26,075 --> 01:09:27,770
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

749
01:09:27,943 --> 01:09:30,503
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

750
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:34,308
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

751
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,717
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

752
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:39,354
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

753
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:41,649
- Look into his eyes.
<i>- I am.</i>

754
01:09:41,824 --> 01:09:44,418
- Is he moving away?
<i>- No.</i>

755
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:46,686
The Guardian can control his mind.

756
01:09:46,862 --> 01:09:49,763
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

757
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:54,695
- Okay.
<i>- You must look into his eyes.</i>

758
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,633
I think something's wrong.

759
01:09:56,805 --> 01:09:58,898
<i>He's stepping forward.</i>

760
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:01,100
He's stepping forward?

761
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:03,268
Something's wrong!

762
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:08,206
Cleveland, run!

763
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:17,489
What is it you are doing?

764
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:20,824
Hey there.

765
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:27,693
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

766
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:29,660
No.

767
01:10:36,645 --> 01:10:40,411
So how was the m... Movie?

768
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,244
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

769
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:46,081
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

770
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:47,847
Who does that?

771
01:10:48,023 --> 01:10:49,251
And a typical romance...

772
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:53,657
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

773
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:58,424
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

774
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:01,195
Well, maybe...

775
01:11:01,604 --> 01:11:05,836
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

776
01:11:06,942 --> 01:11:09,775
No. It's not.

777
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,213
Are you okay?

778
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:17,077
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

779
01:11:17,252 --> 01:11:19,379
They're masters of hiding.

780
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:23,491
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

781
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,685
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

782
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:29,456
...I'd have been eaten alive.

783
01:11:31,266 --> 01:11:33,860
I had no powers over him.

784
01:11:34,036 --> 01:11:36,436
You are not the Guardian.

785
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,408
I do not understand.

786
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:49,207
I cannot protect you.

787
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:52,451
Where are the Tartutic?

788
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:54,987
Why isn't he being punished?

789
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,282
Where is the justice?

790
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:19,580
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

791
01:12:23,852 --> 01:12:25,513
I've been busy.

792
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:34,261
You... You coming to the party tonight?

793
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:36,461
I have to study.

794
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,463
Bye, Mr. Heep.

795
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:48,306
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... party?

796
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:54,009
You coming?

797
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:56,048
<i>- A picture here</i>
<i>of the enemy they're...</i>

798
01:12:56,218 --> 01:12:58,584
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

799
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:00,847
- What?
- Man.

800
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:05,849
Yes.

801
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:08,125
That's not the answer I expected.

802
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:11,892
Why'd you a... ask me that?

803
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:14,464
I know about your family.

804
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:17,904
I looked you up
when you started working here.

805
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:20,972
I know someone killed them.

806
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:25,637
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

807
01:13:27,182 --> 01:13:28,706
I know.

808
01:13:28,884 --> 01:13:31,318
You don't wanna become like me.

809
01:13:32,554 --> 01:13:36,490
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

810
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:39,719
There's something strange going on
around this building.

811
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:41,795
Don't think I haven't noticed.

812
01:13:49,004 --> 01:13:50,665
It is finished?

813
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:56,336
You can see things in the future?

814
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:58,503
Some things.

815
01:13:59,014 --> 01:14:01,482
I have a question to ask you.

816
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:05,583
I will do my best to answer it.

817
01:14:05,754 --> 01:14:07,984
You'll tell me the truth, right?

818
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:10,915
Yes.

819
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:15,521
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

820
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:19,292
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

821
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:21,597
I wrote this thing.

822
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:25,433
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

823
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:28,934
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

824
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:33,274
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

825
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:38,075
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

826
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:41,746
...this leader who's just a boy.

827
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:46,885
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

828
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:52,191
There's a lot of things in <i>The Cookbook</i>
people won't like to hear.

829
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:59,972
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

830
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:03,305
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

831
01:15:03,478 --> 01:15:07,437
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

832
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,647
And why didn't he meet me?"

833
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:16,416
And I thought of how it could happen.

834
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:21,829
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

835
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:26,432
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

836
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:28,529
Yes.

837
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:32,734
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

838
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:35,103
It is not true.

839
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:38,009
You are all connected.

840
01:15:38,547 --> 01:15:42,210
One act can one day affect all.

841
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:50,823
What are you guys whispering about?

842
01:15:50,993 --> 01:15:54,019
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

843
01:15:54,196 --> 01:15:57,290
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

844
01:15:57,466 --> 01:16:00,594
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

845
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,396
...that's gonna marry you.

846
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:05,768
Very funny, Herb.

847
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:18,443
Okay.

848
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:22,521
Don't tell my sister.

849
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:57,523
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

850
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,928
I wanted to thank you.

851
01:17:02,397 --> 01:17:07,425
I was completely surprised by all of this.

852
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:11,964
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

853
01:17:13,408 --> 01:17:16,400
But this is beyond my expectations.

854
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:20,907
I'm 13B.

855
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:24,980
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

856
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:29,613
I know of your future, Cleveland.

857
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,218
Do you wanna hear it?

858
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,861
No.

859
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:40,162
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

860
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:43,730
It is only what I have been told
by others.

861
01:17:44,172 --> 01:17:49,542
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

862
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,077
...that the universe will give us signs.

863
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:55,144
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

864
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:58,718
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

865
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:04,318
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

866
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:10,529
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

867
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:15,796
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

868
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:18,371
I don't know how to lead.

869
01:18:20,108 --> 01:18:24,135
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

870
01:18:24,846 --> 01:18:28,179
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

871
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:33,947
There's a storm coming.

872
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:41,755
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

873
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:44,657
I do not have courage.

874
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,460
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

875
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:49,968
You do what you think is right.

876
01:18:50,138 --> 01:18:52,606
You are very brave.

877
01:18:53,475 --> 01:18:56,876
You were always meant to lead, Story.

878
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:01,812
Cleveland...

879
01:19:03,185 --> 01:19:05,847
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

880
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,893
Okay.

881
01:20:23,565 --> 01:20:25,829
I'm glad you read my journal.

882
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:30,699
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

883
01:21:04,706 --> 01:21:07,800
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

884
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:12,139
Do not leave this spot.

885
01:21:14,816 --> 01:21:16,977
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

886
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,790
Find a mirror.

887
01:22:21,816 --> 01:22:25,013
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

888
01:22:25,186 --> 01:22:28,644
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

889
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:32,255
You used up the battery.

890
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,324
Wave to him.

891
01:22:43,938 --> 01:22:46,236
They told her that the universe
would line up...

892
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:50,310
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... path.

893
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:52,907
Why isn't this working?

894
01:23:20,675 --> 01:23:22,267
Okay.

895
01:23:35,623 --> 01:23:39,024
Sometimes animals just look dead.

896
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:47,862
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

897
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:20,868
It is not time for you to go.

898
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:27,699
It is not time for you to go.

899
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:38,185
Isn't this supposed to work?

900
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:46,060
Fourteen across.

901
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:49,723
No. No.

902
01:24:54,736 --> 01:24:56,499
I don't know.

903
01:24:58,039 --> 01:24:59,836
I don't know.

904
01:25:03,244 --> 01:25:07,806
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

905
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:12,282
And the only way to do that
is to find your own voice. You told us that.

906
01:25:12,787 --> 01:25:16,314
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

907
01:25:16,891 --> 01:25:20,122
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

908
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:25,763
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

909
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,130
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

910
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:34,298
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

911
01:25:37,812 --> 01:25:39,780
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

912
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:41,540
Look at what happened at the party.

913
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:44,116
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

914
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:47,914
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

915
01:25:52,627 --> 01:25:55,152
He was so sure.

916
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,763
What?

917
01:25:57,232 --> 01:25:58,893
I...

918
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:02,566
...asked someone.

919
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,967
He acted like he knew.

920
01:26:05,139 --> 01:26:07,107
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

921
01:26:07,275 --> 01:26:10,039
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

922
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,270
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

923
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,149
Hello?

924
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:31,863
Is the bathroom on this level working?

925
01:26:34,202 --> 01:26:36,500
A dog inside the building.

926
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:39,640
Go. Shoo!

927
01:26:44,979 --> 01:26:46,708
Why, you're not a dog at all.

928
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:52,112
My God.

929
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:55,814
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

930
01:26:57,559 --> 01:27:00,790
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

931
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:04,625
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

932
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:08,963
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

933
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:12,334
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

934
01:27:12,507 --> 01:27:16,409
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

935
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:18,978
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

936
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:22,310
...having learned valuable lessons.

937
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:24,784
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

938
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:27,979
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

939
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:33,184
This is where I turn to run.

940
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:35,761
You will leap for me.

941
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:37,955
I will shut the door.

942
01:27:38,132 --> 01:27:42,626
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

943
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:47,604
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

944
01:27:47,775 --> 01:27:51,370
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

945
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:53,013
This has gotta be about faith.

946
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:56,207
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

947
01:27:56,384 --> 01:27:59,353
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

948
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,045
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

949
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:05,624
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

950
01:28:05,793 --> 01:28:08,626
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

951
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:10,821
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

952
01:28:10,999 --> 01:28:13,160
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

953
01:28:13,334 --> 01:28:16,792
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

954
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:20,531
My God.

955
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:24,110
I do.

956
01:28:25,213 --> 01:28:27,408
There is a message.

957
01:28:30,084 --> 01:28:32,518
There is a ceremony to be done.

958
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:34,951
You're doing great, Joey.

959
01:28:36,924 --> 01:28:41,418
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

960
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:44,429
Joey, who is the Guild?

961
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:50,168
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

962
01:28:50,338 --> 01:28:52,898
Sisters? The Guild is women?

963
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:57,201
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

964
01:28:57,378 --> 01:28:59,812
...to bring strength to the moment.

965
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:01,812
Nice, Joey.

966
01:29:04,385 --> 01:29:07,218
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

967
01:29:07,388 --> 01:29:11,154
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

968
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:17,394
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

969
01:29:47,028 --> 01:29:49,519
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

970
01:29:50,198 --> 01:29:55,568
I need to speak with your
f... f... f... f... five daughters.

971
01:30:00,174 --> 01:30:04,235
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

972
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:12,809
Sweetheart?

973
01:30:14,455 --> 01:30:16,855
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

974
01:30:17,024 --> 01:30:18,924
He's got terrible breath.

975
01:30:19,093 --> 01:30:21,653
Don't tell him I told you.

976
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:40,002
<i>- Huge explosions</i>
<i>right in the very heart of the capital.</i>

977
01:30:40,181 --> 01:30:45,414
<i>Several explosions, I felt at least four</i>
<i>very close to the center of the city.</i>

978
01:31:52,954 --> 01:31:55,479
I think we have everybody.

979
01:31:58,392 --> 01:32:02,419
A man who has no secrets...

980
01:32:02,597 --> 01:32:08,058
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

981
01:32:08,236 --> 01:32:12,400
They will be w... w... witnesses.

982
01:32:12,573 --> 01:32:16,942
Will the Guild please come forward?

983
01:32:21,582 --> 01:32:23,140
Yeah.

984
01:32:24,352 --> 01:32:26,343
And you make seven.

985
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:29,045
Seven sisters.

986
01:32:31,592 --> 01:32:33,492
Come, come.

987
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:37,320
Yeah.

988
01:32:38,065 --> 01:32:40,363
Everything's right now.

989
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:47,369
Come back to us now.

990
01:32:48,509 --> 01:32:52,673
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

991
01:32:59,587 --> 01:33:00,815
I can't believe it.

992
01:33:00,988 --> 01:33:04,822
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

993
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,584
She needs to get to a hospital.

994
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:10,993
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

995
01:33:11,165 --> 01:33:13,929
I wanted to believe more than most.

996
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:16,969
I wanna be like a child again.

997
01:33:17,471 --> 01:33:20,440
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

998
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:22,337
...but at some point we have to stop.

999
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:27,675
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1000
01:33:28,749 --> 01:33:30,774
I read it wrong.

1001
01:33:35,723 --> 01:33:37,452
It was my first time.

1002
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:40,617
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

1003
01:33:40,795 --> 01:33:43,127
...to bring strength to the moment."

1004
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:47,529
I looked at it again. It says "he."

1005
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:53,470
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

1006
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:56,940
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1007
01:33:57,111 --> 01:33:59,341
It said the Healer could be a man.

1008
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:02,038
But I... But I...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1009
01:34:02,216 --> 01:34:03,308
Butterflies?

1010
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:06,942
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1011
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:09,589
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1012
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:13,215
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1013
01:34:15,663 --> 01:34:17,096
I did?

1014
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:25,602
Wait, no.

1015
01:34:25,773 --> 01:34:27,570
You must try.

1016
01:34:27,742 --> 01:34:30,939
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

1017
01:34:31,112 --> 01:34:32,704
Shut up...

1018
01:34:33,714 --> 01:34:35,238
...and try.

1019
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:19,655
Say something to bring out your energy.

1020
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:26,656
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1021
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,471
I should have been there.

1022
01:35:34,642 --> 01:35:36,974
I am always gonna regret...

1023
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,571
...just not being there.

1024
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:49,756
I'll miss your faces.

1025
01:35:52,593 --> 01:35:55,255
Oh, they remind me of God.

1026
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:04,370
I'm so lost without you guys.

I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1028
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:19,251
And I think you would've liked her.

1029
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:24,353
I think she might be...

1030
01:36:26,093 --> 01:36:28,084
...an angel...

1031
01:36:30,297 --> 01:36:32,993
...because she has to go home.

1032
01:36:37,872 --> 01:36:40,033
I love you all.

1033
01:36:41,575 --> 01:36:44,237
I love you all so much.

1034
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:33,151
Thank you for all you have done.

1035
01:37:44,638 --> 01:37:47,971
Your sister will have seven children.

1036
01:37:48,142 --> 01:37:50,337
You will see the first two.

1037
01:40:05,846 --> 01:40:09,748
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

1038
01:40:10,284 --> 01:40:11,546
Reggie!

1039
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:13,983
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1040
01:40:14,154 --> 01:40:16,588
Keep looking in his eyes!

1041
01:42:02,763 --> 01:42:05,459
Thank you for saving my life.
