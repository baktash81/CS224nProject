1
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,492
The assistant warden wants this one
out of the block early.

2
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,577
Wants to get it over with fast.

3
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,913
Okay. Let's do it.

4
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,374
Hey, wake up. It's time.

5
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,004
Wake up. Let's go. It's time.

6
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,913
This is it.

7
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,300
7474505B.

8
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,389
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

9
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,557
Standard release?

10
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,101
Parole, three out of five.
Good behaviour.

11
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,771
Give me a minute.

12
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,552
One Timex digital watch, broken.

13
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,765
One unused prophylactic.

14
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,647
One soiled.

15
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,504
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

16
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,468
One black suit jacket.

17
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,306
One pair black suit pants.

18
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,268
One hat.

19
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,104
Black.

20
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,899
One pair sunglasses.

21
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,821
Twenty-three dollars
and seven cents.

22
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,701
Sign here.

23
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,857
- What's this?
- What?

24
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,526
This car.

25
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,528
This stupid car.

26
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,740
Where's the Cadillac?

27
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,036
The Caddy.
Where's the Caddy?

28
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,788
The what?

29
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,542
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.

30
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,043
I traded it.

31
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,880
- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?
- No, for a microphone.

32
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,382
A microphone?

33
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay, I can see that.

34
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,514
- What the hell is this?
- This was a bargain.

35
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,851
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

36
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,855
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

37
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,483
Well, thank you, pal.

38
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,903
The day I get out of prison...

39
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,782
my own brother picks me up
in a police car.

40
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't like it?

41
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,606
No, I don't like it.

42
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,460
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

43
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,546
It's got a cop motor,
a 440-cubic-inch plant.

44
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,300
It's got cop tyres,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

45
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,511
A model made
before catalytic converters...

46
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,138
so it'll run good on regular gas.

47
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,642
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?

48
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,480
Fix the cigarette lighter.

49
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,310
What are we doing here?

50
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,732
You promised you'd visit
the Penguin the day you got out.

51
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,027
Yeah. So I lied to her.

52
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,195
You can't lie to a nun.

53
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,032
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.

54
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,452
No fucking way.

55
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,138
Who is it?

56
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,140
Jake and Elwood.

57
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,437
Come in.

58
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,289
Hello, boys.

59
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,835
Nice to see you.

60
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,921
Please, have a seat.

61
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,063
No, boys.

62
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,315
Come over here in front of me.

63
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,277
I want to see your faces.

64
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,878
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.

65
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,797
They want $5,000.

66
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,716
Won't the church pay?

67
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,095
They would if they were
interested in keeping the place.

68
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,891
But they aren't.

69
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:32,312
The archbishop wants to sell this
building to the Board of Education.

70
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,980
What will happen to you?

71
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,775
I'll be sent to the missions--

72
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:41,196
Africa, Latin America...

73
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,906
- Korea.
- Forget it!

74
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,534
Five grand? No problem. We'll have it
for you in the morning. Let's go.

75
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,289
I will not take
your filthy, stolen money!

76
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,879
Well, then.
I guess you're really up shit creek.

77
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,217
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

78
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,303
I offered to help you.

79
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,641
You refused to take our money.

80
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,145
Then I said,
"I guess you're really up shit creek."

81
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,981
- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.
- Elwood!

82
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,193
- Ow! Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

83
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,861
- Shit!
-Jesus!

84
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,280
- Shit! God dam it!
- Son of a bitch!

85
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,161
You fat penguin!

86
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,375
Fuck this!

87
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,057
You are
such a disappointing pair.

88
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,227
I prayed so hard for you.

89
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,271
It saddens and hurts me...

90
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,815
that the two young men
whom I raised...

91
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,067
to believe
in the Ten Commandments...

92
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,237
have returned to me
as two thieves...

93
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,075
with filthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

94
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,202
Get out!

95
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,830
And don't come back...

96
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,084
until you've
redeemed yourselves.

97
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,428
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

98
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,559
Curtis!

99
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,228
- You look fine!
- Good to see you!

100
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,230
Buy you boys a drink?

101
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,154
Boys, things are bad.

102
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,282
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education...

103
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,368
and I'll be out on the street.

104
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,207
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Office within 11 days.

105
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,045
They wouldn't turn you out,
would they?

106
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:08,176
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

107
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,306
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

108
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,476
You're the only one
that was ever good to us...

109
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,189
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

110
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:26,194
Well, the sister was right. You boys
could use a little churching up.

111
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,030
Slide on down
to the Triple Rock...

112
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,616
and catch Reverend Cleophus.

113
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,619
You boys listen
to what he's got to say.

114
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,001
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher...

115
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,461
talking to me
about heaven and hell.

116
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,716
You get wise.
You get to church!

117
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,192
All I'm saying is,
we got to figure out...

118
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,778
some way
to get that money honestly.

119
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,990
That could be a problem.

120
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,408
Like the Penguin says.

121
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,162
We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.

122
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,749
"We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church."

123
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,208
Bullshit.

124
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,461
Come on.

125
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,858
And now, this week's sermon...

126
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,070
is from our beloved,
the Reverend Cleophus James!

127
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,246
And now, people--

128
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,500
And now, people--

129
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:10,006
When I woke up this morning,
I heard a disturbing sound.

130
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,011
I said,
when I woke up this morning...

131
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,514
I heard a disturbing sound!

132
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,435
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle...

133
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,521
of a thousand lost souls!

134
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,234
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women...

135
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,277
departed from this life!

136
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,364
Wait a minute!

137
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:39,119
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth...

138
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,789
seeking a divine light...

139
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,501
they'll not find
because it's too late!

140
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:52,340
Too late! Yeah! Too late
for them to ever see again...

141
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:57,137
the light they once chose
not to follow! All right!

142
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,390
Don't be lost
when the time comes!

143
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,185
For the day of the Lord cometh...

144
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,938
as a thief in the night!

145
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,941
Amen

146
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,944
Say amen!

147
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,412
- Let us all
-All go back

148
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,122
- To the old
- Old landmark

149
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,631
As we stay
in the service of the Lord

150
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,634
- Let us preach
- Preach the word

151
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:40,263
- Got to preach
- Preach the word all the way

152
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,518
Do it, know it, feel it

153
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,602
Jake, are you all right?

154
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,828
Alleluia

155
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,374
The band.

156
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,004
Do you see the light?

157
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,761
What light?

158
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,846
Have you seen the light?

159
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:50,268
Yes!
Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!

160
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,271
I have seen the light!

161
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,795
The band!

162
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:31,059
- Praise God!
- And God bless the United States!

163
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:40,253
Stay in the service
of the Lord

164
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,223
Yea, Lord

165
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,086
We'll put the band back together,
we do a few gigs...

166
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,464
we get some bread.
Bang-- five thousand bucks!

167
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:29,052
Well, getting the band
back together might not be that easy.

168
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,055
- What are you talking about?
- They split.

169
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,265
They all took straight jobs.

170
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,518
Yeah? So you know
where they are.

171
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,728
You said you were
keeping in touch with them.

172
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,567
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

173
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,696
But, I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you?

174
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,116
They're not the kind of guys
who write letters.

175
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,035
You were outside.
I was inside.

176
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,497
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

177
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,500
I kept asking you
if we were gonna play again.

178
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,546
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

179
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,633
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

180
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,553
I took the liberty
of bullshitting you. Okay?

181
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:16,349
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit.

182
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,239
- Shit.
- What?

183
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,241
- Rollers.
- No.

184
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,951
Shit.

185
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:16,242
- What? What did I do?
- You failed to stop at a red signal.

186
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,661
The light was yellow, sir.

187
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,164
May I see your license, please?

188
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,255
God dam it!

189
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,884
I haven't been pulled over
in six months.

190
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,261
I bet those cops
have got SCMODS.

191
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,644
State County Municipal Offender
Data System.

192
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,673
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

193
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,175
Step out of the car, please.

194
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,700
First you trade the Cadillac
for a microphone.

195
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,036
Then you lie to me
about the band.

196
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,371
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint!

197
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:46,291
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

198
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,520
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

199
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:11,066
Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan
with Illinois plates.

200
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,360
Request assistance.

201
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,387
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the expressway.

202
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,641
This don't look
like no expressway to me!

203
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,603
Don't yell at me.

204
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,939
What do you want me to do,
motor head?

205
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,108
Try not to be so negative
all the time.

206
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,152
Why don't you offer
some constructive criticism?

207
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:04,911
You got us into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!

208
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,872
You want out
of this parking lot?

209
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,711
- Will there be anything else?
- Do you have Miss Piggy?

210
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,568
- There's pants and burgers.
- Yeah, lots of space in this mall.

211
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,624
Disco pants and haircuts.

212
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,987
Baby clothes.

213
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,198
This place has got everything.

214
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,089
New Oldsmobiles
are in early this year.

215
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,486
Pier 1 imports.

216
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,668
Oh, shit!

217
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,751
They broke my watch!

218
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,420
I'm gonna catch that sucker...

219
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,340
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

220
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,845
Nice place, huh?

221
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,858
Hey, Sam.

222
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,247
Hey, Lloyd.

223
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,584
- Anybody call for me on the phone?
- No. No calls.

224
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:12,255
Some guy left his card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

225
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,310
This here's my brother, Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

226
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:28,438
He's gonna be staying with me
for a few weeks.

227
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,190
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,028
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

229
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,928
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

230
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,891
- How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

231
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,713
What are you doing?

232
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,215
Making dinner.
Want some?

233
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,597
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

234
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,517
I'm gonna quit work
in the morning, first thing.

235
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,811
And how are you going
to get to work...

236
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:53,148
Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,
Mr Motor Head?

237
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,734
Those cops took your license away.

238
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,902
They got your name,
your address.

239
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,655
No, they don't got my address.
I falsified my renewal.

240
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,450
I put down 1 060 West Addison.

241
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,875
That's Wrigley Field.

242
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,716
I gotta hit the sack.

243
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,635
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

244
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:14,706
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.

245
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,499
Thanks, Mr Mercer.

246
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:21,254
- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.
- Yeah, real cute.

247
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,598
Hi, Sam.

248
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:46,946
Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?
He failed to report in yesterday.

249
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,490
I don't want trouble.

250
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:52,077
Tell us where they are,
and there'll be no trouble.

251
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,385
Stand back.

252
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:56,016
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

253
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:55,909
Hello, Elwood. Sit down.
What's on your mind?

254
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,203
I gotta quit.

255
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:01,706
Why is that, Elwood?

256
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,959
I'm going to become a priest.

257
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,389
I'll call payroll and have them get
your severance pay ready.

258
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,647
- Good luck.
- God bless you, sir.

259
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,940
Thank you.

260
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:46,167
- What's this?
- This is the last known address...

261
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,962
of Bones Malone
and Blue Lou Marini.

262
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:56,052
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

263
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,600
- Mrs Toronto?
- Tarantino.

264
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:48,271
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

265
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,692
Not any more.
They moved out a long time ago.

266
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:55,195
I don't take in boarders any more.

267
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:00,075
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

268
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,297
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

269
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,300
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

270
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,594
They were good boys...

271
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:23,014
but they made
a lot of racket at night.

272
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,016
Are you the police?

273
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,435
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

274
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:31,064
Mr Man!

275
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:41,408
- Yes, ma'am?
- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.

276
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:56,506
Thanks.

277
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,359
Thank you. You're marvellous.

278
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:02,781
Thank you. I'm Murph,
and these are the Magic Tones.

279
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:05,241
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,
Donald "Duck" Dunn...

280
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:08,453
Willie "Too Big" Hall
and Tom "Bones" Malone.

281
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:10,580
We'll be back with the Magic Tones
for the Armada Room's...

282
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:13,166
two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.

283
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:16,544
Till then, don't you go changing.

284
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:24,177
So you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

285
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,263
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

286
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:29,599
You got the money you owe us,
mother-fucker?

287
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:32,227
Let's get something
straight here.

288
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,688
The reason he got locked in the slam
in the first place...

289
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,732
was for sticking up a gas station
to cover you guys.

290
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:39,442
You're kidding.

291
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:42,445
He pulled that job to pay
for the band's room-service tab...

292
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:45,115
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.

293
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:47,117
- You did?
- That's right.

294
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,537
So I don't want to hear
any more of this small-change shit.

295
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,539
We're putting the band
back together.

296
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,631
Who here at this table
can honestly say...

297
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:05,844
that they played any finer
or felt any better than they did...

298
00:48:05,927 --> 00:48:07,929
when they were
with the Blues Brothers?

299
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,184
You were the backbone...

300
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:17,022
the nerve centre
of a great rhythm-and-blues band.

301
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:21,484
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

302
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,695
Murph and the Magic Tones?

303
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:26,948
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

304
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,617
And I thought
I had it bad in Joliet.

305
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:31,953
At least we got
a change in clothes.

306
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,622
You're wearing the same shit
from three years ago.

307
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:36,708
Jake ain't lying, though.

308
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:40,170
We had a band powerful enough
to turn goat piss into gasoline.

309
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,548
We'll never get that fat sound again
without more horns.

310
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,550
We'll never get Mr Fabulous.

311
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:47,719
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

312
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:50,221
Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'
at the Chez Paul.

313
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,390
He's pullin' down
six bills a week.

314
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,894
- Matt Murphy got married.
- Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?

315
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:58,063
He opened a restaurant with his old lady
on Maxwell Street...

316
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,231
and he took Blue Lou with him.

317
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:05,070
You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous
out of them high-paying gigs.

318
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:07,906
Oh, yeah?

319
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,575
Well, me and the Lord...

320
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:12,994
we got an understanding.

321
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,246
We're on a mission from God.

322
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:30,470
Mainly French cuisine.

323
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:34,432
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer
dines here. He's dead, sir.

324
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,269
Private dining rooms
are available.

325
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:41,856
Oh, no. It was supposed to be
five years.

326
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,776
Didn't you get five years?
No, sir, not you.

327
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,778
And your name, sir?

328
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:51,282
Rizzolo, for eight at 11:30.
Thank you.

329
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:56,579
Mr Fabulous,
how marvellous it is to see you.

330
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,624
- You're looking younger than ever.
- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

331
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,793
Nonsense, my dear fellow.

332
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,920
My brother and I
have come to dine...

333
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,881
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.

334
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:09,801
Wait. Let's talk outside.

335
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:11,886
- Let's have a cup of coffee outside.
- Why, heavens, no.

336
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,056
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.

337
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,058
Come, Elwood.

338
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:19,602
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table...

339
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:23,148
and overlook this establishment's
board of fare.

340
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:27,235
Good evening. Chez Paul.
Wait! Hey!

341
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:31,239
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?

342
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,513
We'll have a table
in a few moments.

343
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,688
Excuse me.

344
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,441
Give us a bottle
of your finest champagne...

345
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:10,028
five shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

346
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:13,865
We have a Dom Pignon '71
at $1 20.

347
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:16,117
That'll be fine, pal.

348
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:24,793
Seriously, the food here is really
expensive. The soup is fucking $1 0!

349
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:27,837
Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

350
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,715
We're putting the band
back together.

351
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:34,219
- Forget it. No way.
- We're on a mission from God.

352
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:37,347
Hold it. Hold it.
What's this?

353
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,349
Waiter? Sir?

354
00:51:39,432 --> 00:51:41,559
Please, waiter?

355
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:45,980
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

356
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:48,608
The salads are fine.

357
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:53,279
It?s just that we'd like
to move to another table...

358
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,782
away from those two gentlemen.

359
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,784
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

360
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:01,579
No. It?s just that--

361
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,041
Well, frankly,
they're offensive-smelling.

362
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,877
I mean, they smell bad.

363
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:13,508
Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate
another table for you.

364
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:15,010
Thank you.

365
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,106
Wrong glass, sir.

366
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,576
How much for the little girl?

367
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,829
- The women? How much for the women?
- What?

368
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,998
I want to buy your women.

369
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:30,502
Your little girl. Your daughters.
Sell them to me.

370
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:33,004
- Sell me your children.
- Maitre d'!

371
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:45,016
Cut it out. The owners are gonna
ask me to call the cops.

372
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,520
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- He just got outta Joliet.

373
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:51,690
He's on parole. You can't
call the cops on him, man.

374
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,734
- We're putting the band back together.
- I said no.

375
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,361
Absolutely not!

376
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,865
How much for your wife?

377
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,288
We're putting the band back together.
We need you, man. We need your horn.

378
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,165
I really can't.

379
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,626
We got everybody except
Matt "Guitar" Murphy and Blue Lou.

380
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,045
- We're getting them next.
- No way.

381
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:22,345
If you say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast...

382
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,473
Lunch and dinner
every day of the week.

383
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:32,188
Okay. I'll play.
You got me.

384
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,068
Sir?

385
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,211
White men!

386
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,589
White women!

387
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:01,634
The swastika is calling you!

388
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:07,557
The sacred and ancient symbol
of your race...

389
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,602
since the beginning of time.

390
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:16,441
The Jew is using the black...

391
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:19,694
as muscle against you.

392
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,532
And you are left there, helpless.

393
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:29,454
-Fuck you!
-What are you gonna do about it, whity?

394
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:34,042
-Just sit there?
- Go back where you came from!

395
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,960
Of course not!

396
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,922
- Son of a bitch!
- You are going to join...

397
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:40,465
with us...

398
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:42,967
the members of...

399
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:47,263
the American Socialist
White People's Party:

400
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:51,851
an organization of decent...

401
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:55,146
Law-abiding white folk...

402
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,691
just like you.

403
00:55:57,774 --> 00:56:00,068
Go to hell, bastards!

404
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:01,611
Go to hell!

405
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,863
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...

406
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:07,992
the immortal leader of our race.

407
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:11,955
To the order for which he stands.

408
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:16,334
One great cause.

409
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,087
Sacred and invincible.

410
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:22,007
Hey, what's going on?

411
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:25,343
Those bums won their court case
so they're marching today.

412
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:28,555
- What bums?
- The fucking Nazi party.

413
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,933
Illinois Nazis.

414
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,687
I hate Illinois Nazis.

415
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,148
Heil Hitler!

416
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:46,740
Ten-hut!

417
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:03,298
- Gruppenfuehrer!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:57:03,381 --> 00:57:06,926
Get that car's license plate number.

419
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,055
We're gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

420
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:38,667
Come on home, babe

421
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:44,047
Oh, come on home, woman

422
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:50,303
Oh, come on home, pretty baby

423
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,305
I love you

424
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:45,233
When she walk that walk

425
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:47,235
And talk that talk

426
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:51,740
And whisper in my ear

427
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:54,743
Tell me that she love me

428
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:57,704
I love that talk

429
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,080
That baby talk

430
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,208
When she talk like that

431
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:05,420
I can?t take it like that

432
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:15,472
Come on home to me, baby

433
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:19,142
Walk your walk
Talk your talk

434
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:23,396
Talk your talk, baby

435
00:59:57,722 --> 00:59:59,516
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,435
That was "Boom, Boom,"
a song that I wrote back in the '50s.

437
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,312
- No, you didn't.
- It was a hit.

438
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,648
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

439
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:09,984
I wrote "Boom, Boom"!
I wrote "Boom, Boom"!

440
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:24,124
- Can I help you, boys?
- You got any white bread?

441
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:25,625
Yes.

442
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:28,503
I'll have some
toasted white bread, please.

443
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,882
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?

444
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,175
No, ma'am. Dry.

445
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:40,515
- Got any fried chicken?
- Best damn chicken in the state.

446
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:43,184
Bring me four fried chickens
and a Coke.

447
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,562
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

448
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:48,231
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

449
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:50,150
And some dry white toast, please.

450
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:52,318
You all want anything to drink
with that?

451
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,070
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

452
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:56,489
Be up in a minute.

453
01:00:56,573 --> 01:01:00,744
We got two honkies out there
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

454
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:04,372
- Say what?
- They look like they're from the CIA.

455
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:09,377
- What they wanna eat?
- The tall one wants white-bread toast.

456
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:12,339
- Dry. With nothing on it.
- Elwood!

457
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:16,885
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens and a Coke.

458
01:01:16,968 --> 01:01:19,346
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

459
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:22,849
- Hi, Jake!
- Matt! How you doing?

460
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:25,643
- How was Joliet?
- Oh, it's bad.

461
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,562
On Thursday night
they serve a wicked pepper steak.

462
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:30,815
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

463
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:33,151
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County slammer.

464
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:35,779
- They're all pretty bad.
- Matt--

465
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,530
Me and Elwood--

466
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:40,033
we're putting the band back together.

467
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:41,618
We need you and Blue Lou.

468
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:44,079
Don't talk that way around here.
My old lady--

469
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:46,081
- She'll kill me.
- Ma'am, you gotta understand.

470
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:50,377
This is a lot bigger than any domestic
problems you might be experiencing.

471
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,462
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

472
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:55,632
- Don't get riled, sugar.
- Don't you "sugar" me!

473
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:57,759
Now, you not going
back on the road no more.

474
01:01:57,842 --> 01:02:00,679
And you ain't playing
any more two-bit, sleazy dives.

475
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:02,305
You're living with me now...

476
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:06,142
and you're not gonna go sliding around
with your white hoodlum friends.

477
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:10,063
But, babes! This is Jake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!

478
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:14,984
The Blues Brothers! Shit!

479
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:18,279
They still owe you money, fool!

480
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:19,489
Ma'am.

481
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:21,616
Would it make you feel better
if you knew...

482
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,994
that what we're asking Matt to do
is a holy thing?

483
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:28,123
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

484
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,959
Don't you blaspheme in here!

485
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,586
Now, this is my man,
my restaurant...

486
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,755
and you two are gonna
walk right out that door...

487
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,966
without your dry, white toast...

488
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:39,926
without your four fried chickens...

489
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:42,637
and without Matt "Guitar" Murphy!

490
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,347
Now you listen to me!
I love you.

491
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,307
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.

492
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:48,435
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

493
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:50,311
You better think about
what you saying.

494
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,939
You better think about
the consequences of your actions.

495
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:54,315
Shut up, woman!

496
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:55,942
You better think

497
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,944
Think about what you?re
trying to do to me

498
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,738
Yeah, think

499
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,365
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

500
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:03,867
Let?s go back

501
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,827
Let's go way on back when

502
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:09,998
I didn't even know you, you couldn't
have been too much more than ten

503
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:13,335
I ain't no psychiatrist
lain 't no doctor with degree

504
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:16,880
It don't take too much high IQ
to see what you?re doing to me

505
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:18,548
You better think

506
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,759
Think about what you?re trying
to do to me

507
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:22,469
Think

508
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,888
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

509
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:26,848
Freedom

510
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:32,187
Yeah, freedom right now

511
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:41,905
Hey, think about it

512
01:03:41,988 --> 01:03:43,531
You, think about it

513
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,534
There ain't nothing you could ask
l could answer you, but I won't

514
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:51,039
But I was gonna change that, I'm not
if you keep doing things l don't

515
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:54,084
Think about what you?re trying
to do to me

516
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:55,377
Damn it

517
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,296
Let your mind go
Let yourself be free

518
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,716
People walking around everyday
playing games and taking scores

519
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,220
Tryin' to make people lose their mind
Now, be careful you don't lose yours

520
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:14,854
You need me

521
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:16,856
And l need you

522
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,235
Without each other
there ain't nothing either can do

523
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,197
- Yeah, think about it, baby
- What you trying to do to me

524
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,200
To the bone
Think about it right now

525
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:29,828
Oh, freedom

526
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:47,220
You, think about it

527
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:50,390
There ain 't nothing you could ask
l can answer you, but I won't

528
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:53,768
But I was gonna change my mind
if you keep doing things l don?t

529
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:03,278
You need me

530
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:05,071
And l need you

531
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:08,658
Without each other
there ain 't nothing either can do

532
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:12,412
- Think about it, baby
- What you?re trying to do to me

533
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:13,913
To the bone, man

534
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,749
Think about it, baby

535
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:17,959
- Yeah, right on
- To the bone

536
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:20,503
- For deepening
- To the bone, for deeps

537
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,260
Deepening

538
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,095
Right now

539
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,014
Think about it, yeah, yeah

540
01:05:31,097 --> 01:05:33,391
To the bone
For deepening

541
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:37,687
Think about it

542
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,315
To the bone

543
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:46,029
Don't give me the Blues Brothers

544
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:47,697
You had better

545
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,492
Stop and think about it

546
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:52,410
Think

547
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,014
Let's boogie.

548
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:28,363
Well, go ahead, damn it!

549
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:43,503
Shit!

550
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:57,952
Pardon me...

551
01:07:58,036 --> 01:08:00,872
but we do have a strict policy
concerning handling the instruments:

552
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:03,333
An employee
of Ray's Music Exchange...

553
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,335
must be present.

554
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:07,087
Now, may I help you?

555
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,090
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.

556
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:12,926
I once rented some column speakers
from you...

557
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:15,053
for my band-- The Blues Brothers.

558
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:17,764
Hey, Ray. It's me. Murph,
of Murph and the Magic Tones.

559
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:19,557
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

560
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:23,687
- Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers.
- Not like these. They were beautiful.

561
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,315
- Upholstered with thick, red shag.
- Right!

562
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:31,111
I remember now.
I'll buy them all back for 350 apiece.

563
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:32,696
Three fifty?

564
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,323
I paid 800 each
not six months ago.

565
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:38,076
You know-- depreciation, man.

566
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,120
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

567
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:43,415
We need pianos, amps, mikes--
the works.

568
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,168
Go on! Get!

569
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:55,051
Breaks my heart:
a boy that young going bad.

570
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:58,638
Tell me a little
about this electric piano.

571
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:00,724
You have a good eye, my man.

572
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:02,851
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.

573
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:05,437
- How much?
- Two thousand bucks and it's yours.

574
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,690
You can take it home with you.
I'll throw in the black keys for free.

575
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:12,318
Two thousand
for this chunk of shit?

576
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,320
Come on, Ray!

577
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,868
Really, Ray. It's used.
There's no action left in this keyboard.

578
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:28,585
Excuse me.

579
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:31,254
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

580
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:42,432
Well, l heard about the fella
you've been dancing with

581
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,559
All over the neighbourhood

582
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,396
So why didn't you ask me, baby

583
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,231
Didn't you think I could

584
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:54,277
Well, I know that the bugaloo
is out of sight

585
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:57,030
But the shing-a-ling's
the thing tonight

586
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:59,908
But if that was you and me
out there, baby

587
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,494
I would have shown you
how to do it right

588
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:04,746
Do it right

589
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:18,259
Twisting

590
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:21,388
Shake it, shake it, baby

591
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,558
Here we go loop-de-loop

592
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:29,145
Shake it out, baby

593
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:32,649
Here we go loop-de-lai

594
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:35,735
Bend over
Let me see you shake your tail feather

595
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,282
Come on
Let me see you shake your tail feather

596
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,792
Come on
Come on, baby

597
01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:59,300
All right

598
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,677
Do the twist

599
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,180
Do the fly

600
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,474
Do the swim

601
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:10,395
And do the bird

602
01:11:10,478 --> 01:11:11,771
Do the duck

603
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:14,983
Do the monkey

604
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,153
Watusi

605
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,489
And what about the frug

606
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:24,242
Do the mashed potato

607
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:26,119
What about the bugaloo

608
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:30,457
Oh, the Bony Maronie

609
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,752
Come on, let's do the twist

610
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:39,716
Twisting

611
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:42,218
Shake it, shake it, baby

612
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:03,365
Okay, man.

613
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,367
We'll take these axes.

614
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:09,120
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

615
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,866
You guys go inside.
Get yourselves a bite.

616
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,035
I've got to make a phone call.

617
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,247
Does this phone call
concern our first gig?

618
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,749
Have I ever lied to you?

619
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,968
What are we gonna do, man?
We don't got no gig.

620
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:07,137
How much money you got?

621
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,264
- I got a quarter.
- That's enough for a phone call.

622
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:11,433
Come on.

623
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:22,652
- What are you doing?
- You said we were gonna make a call.

624
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:24,571
I said I was gonna make a call.

625
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:26,573
Who are you gonna call, Jake?

626
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:28,450
Do you remember Maury Sline?

627
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:31,077
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

628
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:34,164
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.

629
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,833
He got us the Morgan Park.
He got us the Ticktock.

630
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:39,169
I got him laid.
He owes me.

631
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:42,047
Give it a shot.

632
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:14,788
There's got to be at least
seven dollars' worth of change here.

633
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:25,882
Sir.

634
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,887
- What did you find out?
- Okay.

635
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:34,057
I called a friend
at the Motor Vehicle Department.

636
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,560
That license plate is like a rash
all over the computer.

637
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,480
The car belongs
to a known traffic menace.

638
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:43,233
- What's his name?
- His name is Elwood Blues.

639
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:47,362
He's got a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.

640
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,907
- Did you get his address?
- Of course.

641
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,617
1 060 West Addison.

642
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:56,329
Let's go.

643
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:12,637
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

644
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:16,891
I want all party members
in the tristate district...

645
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:22,105
to monitor the city, county
and state police on their CBs.

646
01:15:22,188 --> 01:15:24,482
Mr Blues is gonna fuck up.

647
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:27,068
And when he does...

648
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:31,114
he better pray the police get to him
before we do.

649
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:43,084
We been in this car for three hours now.
Where is this place?

650
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,421
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

651
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:52,052
- What's the name of the place?
- The name of the place is--

652
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,638
Bob's Country Bunker.

653
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:59,309
- Here we are.
- Bob's Country Bunker?

654
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:20,080
The sign says, "Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys."

655
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:23,750
Blues Brothers! It should read,
"Tonight only...

656
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,503
the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return."

657
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:28,046
Must be some kind of mistake.

658
01:16:28,129 --> 01:16:30,048
You guys unload the stuff.

659
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,842
Elwood, come with me.

660
01:16:54,739 --> 01:16:56,533
What can I get you boys?

661
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:59,202
You thirsty, hungry
or just driving through?

662
01:16:59,285 --> 01:17:02,038
Maybe you'd like a beer
or something a little harder?

663
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:04,791
We happen to make
the state's best pepper steak.

664
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:07,002
No, thank you, ma'am.

665
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,713
We may be sucking back
a few beers later on.

666
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:12,549
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

667
01:17:12,632 --> 01:17:15,802
You are?
Gee, that's nice!

668
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:18,096
Hey, Bob, this is the band!

669
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,015
All right!

670
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:23,226
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

671
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:27,147
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

672
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:33,069
Jake, are you sure this is the place?

673
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:35,739
Yeah, sure. This is the place.

674
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:43,788
- Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
- That's us!

675
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,875
The rest of the band's
in the parking lot getting our stuff.

676
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,252
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

677
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:51,463
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

678
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:55,383
Well, it's a beautiful place, Bob!

679
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:59,679
I guess you wanna get your steel guitars
and everything set up on stage.

680
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:02,849
Claire, get up and turn those stage
lights on and get these boys going.

681
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:10,982
Chicken wire?

682
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,276
What do you say
we have a sound check?

683
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:20,325
Excuse me, sonny. I'll give this
to you. You're the tallest one.

684
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,786
Okay. What is it?

685
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:25,163
That there is a list
of the songs...

686
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:27,332
that you boys
will be playing tonight.

687
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:48,687
I don't think we know
any of the songs on this list.

688
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,525
This list doesn't mean anything.
They?re just requests.

689
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:55,193
Do our regular set.
First tune.

690
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:57,779
"Give Me Some Loving."
One, two--

691
01:18:57,862 --> 01:18:59,823
One, two, three, four.

692
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,631
Shit!

693
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:19,050
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

694
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:23,263
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here tonight.

695
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:28,184
We're the Good Old Blues Brothers
Boys Band from Chicago.

696
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:31,438
We hope you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood. This is my brother Jake.

697
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:35,233
Well, my temperature?s rising
And my feet on the floor

698
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:38,361
Crazy people knockin '
'Cause they want some more

699
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,989
Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got

700
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:44,492
Better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot

701
01:19:44,576 --> 01:19:48,413
And I?m so glad we made it

702
01:19:48,496 --> 01:19:51,708
That ain't no Hank Williams song!

703
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,753
Give me some loving

704
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:56,796
Get off the stage!

705
01:19:58,548 --> 01:19:59,841
Everyday

706
01:20:01,092 --> 01:20:03,511
Why'd they turn off the lights?

707
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:06,139
- Maybe they blew a fuse.
- I don't think so.

708
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:08,141
Those lights are off on purpose.

709
01:20:08,224 --> 01:20:11,269
We gotta figure out something
these people like, and fast!

710
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,730
I got it. Remember the theme
from "Rawhide"?

711
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:15,231
Old favourite. Rowdy Yates.

712
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,151
- What key?
- "A." Good country key.

713
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:19,652
"Rawhide" in "A."

714
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,913
Rollin ', rollin '

715
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:31,956
Though the streams are swollen

716
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,209
Keep them dogies rollin '

717
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,919
Rawhide

718
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,174
Through rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather

719
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:46,388
Wishin' my gal was by my side

720
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:48,431
All the things I'm missin '

721
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:50,809
Good vittles, love and kissin '

722
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:54,521
Are waiting at the end of my ride

723
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:56,731
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

724
01:20:56,815 --> 01:20:58,066
- Head 'em out
- Move 'em on

725
01:20:58,149 --> 01:20:59,275
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

726
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:00,860
Rawhide
Cut 'em out

727
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:02,195
Ride 'em in

728
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:03,613
Cut 'em out

729
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:08,159
Ride 'em in, rawhide

730
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:06,801
Theme from the TV show "Rawhide."
Thank you.

731
01:22:14,642 --> 01:22:17,812
We'd like to do a favourite of the horn
section. We hope it's one of yours.

732
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:27,572
Sometimes it?s hard
to be a woman

733
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,661
Giving all your love

734
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:37,082
To just one man

735
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:42,253
And if you love him

736
01:22:43,254 --> 01:22:46,841
Oh, be proud of him

737
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:49,969
'Cause after all

738
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:52,847
He?s just a man

739
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:59,020
Stand by your man

740
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:03,066
Give him two arms to cling to

741
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:07,779
And something warm to come to

742
01:23:07,862 --> 01:23:11,157
When nights are cold and lonely

743
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:14,160
Stand by your man

744
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:19,624
And tell the world you love him

745
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:24,838
Keep giving all the love you can

746
01:23:27,757 --> 01:23:32,721
Stand by your man

747
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:38,101
Stand by your man

748
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:43,565
And show the world you love him

749
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:50,321
Keep giving all the love you can

750
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,490
Baby

751
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:54,993
Standby

752
01:23:55,076 --> 01:23:58,371
Your man

753
01:24:21,394 --> 01:24:23,480
Well, folks, it's time
to call it a night.

754
01:24:23,563 --> 01:24:26,316
But do what you feel,
and keep both feet on the wheel.

755
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:28,401
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

756
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:29,986
So, till next time.:

757
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,154
- Move 'em on
- Head 'em up

758
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:33,573
- Head 'em up
- Move 'em on

759
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:34,783
Rawhide

760
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,034
- Cut 'em out
- Ride 'em in

761
01:24:36,117 --> 01:24:37,369
- Ride 'em in
- Cut 'em out

762
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:42,165
Ride 'em in, rawhide

763
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:48,880
Let's get the hell out of here.

764
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:59,474
Shit, I wanna tell you, that's some
of the best god dam music we've had...

765
01:24:59,557 --> 01:25:01,768
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

766
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:06,064
Well, sorry we couldn't remember
"The Wreck of the Old 97."

767
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:09,859
Why, hell! You guys can learn it
next time when you come back.

768
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:13,196
Bob, about our money for tonight.

769
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,949
That's right.

770
01:25:16,032 --> 01:25:18,076
Two hundred dollars...

771
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,787
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

772
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:23,164
When we first came in...

773
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:26,084
the bar lady never charged us
for the first round.

774
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:30,213
So, like, we figured
beer was complimentary for the band.

775
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:36,886
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection from the boys.

776
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,597
I sure would appreciate it.

777
01:25:45,937 --> 01:25:48,148
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

778
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:49,816
I say we gotta quit.

779
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:52,944
What? Quit?

780
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,280
I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

781
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:58,950
Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at
the Holiday inn to get our old gig back.

782
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,745
Back at the Armada Room?

783
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:04,748
Listen, they want us
to pay for the beer we drank.

784
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:05,999
So you'd better split.

785
01:26:06,082 --> 01:26:10,003
The next gig is gonna be dynamite!

786
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:12,505
Huge! You'll see.

787
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:19,804
I say we give the Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

788
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:22,474
Why not? If the shit fits, wear it!

789
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:24,684
Scoot over, god dam it!

790
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,276
Boys look a little upset.

791
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:37,030
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple of days.

792
01:26:37,113 --> 01:26:39,282
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

793
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:43,411
I mean, look. We got an appointment
to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

794
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,413
Everything's gonna be all right.

795
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:47,082
Let's skate.

796
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:51,503
God dam it.

797
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:56,383
Excuse me. Are you
the Good Ole Boys?

798
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:59,552
That's right. I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer, driver of the Winnebago.

799
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:02,180
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

800
01:27:02,263 --> 01:27:06,518
I?m Jacob Stein, American Federation
of Musicians Union, Local 200.

801
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:09,020
I've been sent here to see
if you?re carrying your permits.

802
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:10,689
Our what?

803
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:13,483
Your union cards.
May I see your cards, please?

804
01:27:14,984 --> 01:27:17,779
Suppose we ain't got no union cards,
and we go in and start playing anyway?

805
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:21,032
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us?

806
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,284
Stein!

807
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:27,205
You gonna look funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

808
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:33,253
Listen, let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

809
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:36,381
See if we can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

810
01:27:36,464 --> 01:27:39,134
I don't want you to move
from this spot.

811
01:27:39,217 --> 01:27:41,136
Just let me handle this.

812
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:46,891
We'll talk to Bob.

813
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:53,106
Get in the car and start her up.

814
01:27:56,776 --> 01:27:59,863
You know you boys owe me
a lot of money for that beer you drank!

815
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:03,074
- God dam it!
- Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

816
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:05,869
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveller's check...

817
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:07,746
to cover the bar tab.

818
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:09,581
I sure would appreciate it.

819
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:13,168
I'd better check up, see how he's doing.
I have to sign it too.

820
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:18,131
I usually sit in the car and write it
out on the glove compartment lid.

821
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:24,095
Need a pencil.

822
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,609
- Were them guys from the union?
- What the hell, "union"?

823
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:40,945
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

824
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:43,406
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

825
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:44,991
We're the Good Ole Boys!

826
01:28:45,075 --> 01:28:48,161
You're the Good Ole Boys?

827
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:10,016
"A.F.M." Shit!

828
01:29:28,284 --> 01:29:31,371
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

829
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,513
I don't believe it!
It's that shit-box Dodge again.

830
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:51,016
The bastards are ours now!

831
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,538
Holy shit!

832
01:30:23,256 --> 01:30:26,468
Boys, you in big trouble.

833
01:30:29,804 --> 01:30:31,890
Maury, you owe me.

834
01:30:31,973 --> 01:30:34,809
We'll play anywhere, anytime,
for anybody.

835
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:38,605
Put us in the Double Up Lounge, or
the Morgan Park Theatre, or the Crystal.

836
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:41,107
We always knocked them dead
in those joints.

837
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:44,736
Discos. They're all discos.

838
01:30:46,196 --> 01:30:49,449
Singles. Mixed singles.
Gay singles.

839
01:30:49,532 --> 01:30:52,452
These people like to dance
with each other.

840
01:30:52,535 --> 01:30:54,412
We are a dance band.

841
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:57,040
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

842
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:00,210
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

843
01:31:01,294 --> 01:31:03,296
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

844
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,215
You wear
the same farkakte suits.

845
01:31:05,298 --> 01:31:08,134
You'll scare people away.

846
01:31:08,218 --> 01:31:10,053
Don't you ever wear blue jeans
or jump suits...

847
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:12,639
Like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

848
01:31:12,722 --> 01:31:14,307
You gotta come through for us.

849
01:31:15,433 --> 01:31:17,686
We need 5,000 bucks fast.

850
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,730
Five thousand bucks?

851
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,565
Who do you think you are?
The Beatles?

852
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:26,861
You know the size hall you gotta work
to take in that kind of money?

853
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:29,489
We'll fill any hall in the country.

854
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:34,077
You guys familiar
with the Palace Hotel ballroom?

855
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:38,498
- Never heard of it.
- Nice place up north.

856
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:41,751
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

857
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,670
That seats 5,000.

858
01:31:43,753 --> 01:31:46,172
You guys fill that place,
you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.

859
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:50,010
- Book us for tomorrow night.
- Hold it! Tomorrow night?

860
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:52,846
A gig like that, you gotta prepare
the proper exploitation.

861
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:55,849
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

862
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:58,393
Forget it. There's no way
with you guys. Forget about it.

863
01:32:01,354 --> 01:32:04,774
Say, how's Mrs Sline?

864
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:06,860
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

865
01:32:11,865 --> 01:32:13,742
You blackmailing me?

866
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:17,537
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!

867
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:19,205
We're on a mission from God.

868
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:25,628
Get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in for miles around.

869
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,464
What do you say?

870
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:31,176
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

871
01:32:32,594 --> 01:32:35,430
I'll print up show bills. I'll make
the place look real pretty, okay?

872
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:39,476
I don't think you guys
are gonna gross dollar one.

873
01:32:40,894 --> 01:32:43,021
But if you do, I want a taste
of the gig, okay?

874
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:44,773
Thanks, Maury.
Let's go, boys!

875
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:56,618
Listen, you boys heard me talk
about Jake and Elwood.

876
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:59,079
They used to live here,
just like you.

877
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:01,664
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

878
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:05,460
Tonight Jake and Elwood are going out
to sing and play...

879
01:33:05,543 --> 01:33:07,587
to raise money
to help you children.

880
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,589
Your lazy butts are in this too!

881
01:33:09,673 --> 01:33:11,675
So get up on that wagon.

882
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:15,011
We're going up north
to put the word on the streets.

883
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:39,869
Tonight only,
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

884
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:42,664
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

885
01:33:42,747 --> 01:33:47,377
at the Palace Hotel ballroom,
Route 16...

886
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,879
Lake Wazapamani.

887
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:52,048
The fabulous Blues Brothers...

888
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:54,634
Show Band and Revue.

889
01:33:58,888 --> 01:34:02,017
There you go, boy.

890
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,269
All right, man!

891
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:06,146
Check it out!

892
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:08,523
- Tonight only!
- From Chicago!

893
01:34:08,606 --> 01:34:11,651
- The Blues Brothers.

894
01:34:11,735 --> 01:34:13,361
One night only!

895
01:34:13,445 --> 01:34:16,197
Blues Brothers Show Band
and Revue.

896
01:34:20,952 --> 01:34:23,413
You! On the motorcycle!

897
01:34:23,496 --> 01:34:25,915
You two girls!

898
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:28,752
- Tell your friends!
- Free parking.

899
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:32,464
Two-dollar cover charge only, folks!

900
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:35,800
- That?s a lot of entertainment.
- For two dollars.

901
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:41,097
Will you please put this in the window,
'cause it's real important.

902
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:55,945
Tonight only, from Chicago...

903
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:59,366
the fabulous Blues Brothers...

904
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:01,868
Rhythm and Blues Revue...

905
01:35:01,951 --> 01:35:04,412
for your dancing pleasure.

906
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:08,875
And it's ladies? night tonight.

907
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:10,877
at the Palace Hotel ballroom.

908
01:35:19,969 --> 01:35:22,138
"Tonight only, the Blues Brothers...

909
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:24,474
genuine Rhythm and Blues Show
and Revue.

910
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:28,103
Palace Hotel ballroom.
Tonight only."

911
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:31,064
How we doing?

912
01:35:31,147 --> 01:35:36,945
So far we covered Lake, McHenry...

913
01:35:37,028 --> 01:35:38,822
and part of Du Page County.

914
01:35:38,905 --> 01:35:41,324
Good. Let's get to the gig.

915
01:35:43,743 --> 01:35:45,620
What is it?

916
01:35:45,704 --> 01:35:47,997
We're out of gas.

917
01:35:49,082 --> 01:35:51,835
Oh, shit.

918
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:17,485
Wow! A classic. What a room!

919
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:19,154
This place is gonna swing tonight.

920
01:36:19,237 --> 01:36:21,114
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.

921
01:36:21,197 --> 01:36:23,700
We've gotta fill this hall tonight.

922
01:36:23,783 --> 01:36:25,827
A lot of young children
are depending on it.

923
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:28,246
Young children?
What do you mean?

924
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:32,208
Jake and Elwood are donating
the band's share of the door money...

925
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,836
to pay the taxes
on the St. Helen's orphanage...

926
01:36:34,919 --> 01:36:36,546
in Calumet City.

927
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:38,089
What?

928
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:42,510
- We're out of gas.
- Yep. Mind if we fill her up?

929
01:36:42,594 --> 01:36:45,555
Nope. I said "we're" out of gas.

930
01:36:45,638 --> 01:36:48,558
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

931
01:36:48,641 --> 01:36:51,770
It's always late on Thursdays.

932
01:36:51,853 --> 01:36:55,690
I guess we'll have to wait.

933
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,800
Excuse me, sir.

934
01:37:23,718 --> 01:37:27,597
Yes, you. Could you fill it up
with premium, and check under the hood?

935
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:32,936
Sure.

936
01:37:33,019 --> 01:37:36,064
You want I should wash
the dead bugs off the windshield?

937
01:37:37,232 --> 01:37:39,150
No. I'm in kind of a hurry.

938
01:37:49,285 --> 01:37:51,121
Where in the hell are they?

939
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:55,750
So maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

940
01:37:55,834 --> 01:37:59,838
I'm awfully sorry, but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.

941
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:09,973
Thanks, Marvin.

942
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:16,730
Get me Troopers Daniel and Mount.

943
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:25,822
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

944
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:27,991
We'll wait.

945
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:32,620
Okay, you're all set.

946
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:36,833
That'll be $94.

947
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:41,129
Here's 95.
Thank you.

948
01:38:41,212 --> 01:38:44,424
Okay. And that's a dollar change.

949
01:38:44,507 --> 01:38:48,136
- Oh, keep the change.
- Thanks.

950
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:53,391
So, look. If your date...

951
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:55,977
don't work out tonight
for any reason...

952
01:38:56,061 --> 01:39:00,357
there's a motel
up on the interstate.

953
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,361
Maybe we could, say, meet...

954
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:07,197
around midnight?

955
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:10,700
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

956
01:39:12,911 --> 01:39:14,579
Bye.

957
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:30,553
Son of a bitch!

958
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:33,640
Come on!

959
01:40:06,965 --> 01:40:09,259
We're really late.
You'd better step on it.

960
01:40:18,393 --> 01:40:21,479
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

961
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:23,106
You can't quit now.

962
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:24,691
What can they be doing?

963
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,461
My head hurts.

964
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:47,297
That Night Train's a mean wine.

965
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,299
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

966
01:40:49,382 --> 01:40:51,801
Then we gotta figure out
some way to collect that gate money...

967
01:40:51,885 --> 01:40:56,097
get it to the County Assessor's office
as soon as they open in the morning.

968
01:41:04,397 --> 01:41:06,316
We want the show!

969
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:19,245
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

970
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:21,664
Man, we were so close.

971
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:23,833
Hey, you guys know
"Minnie The Moocher"?

972
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:26,252
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.

973
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:28,797
No! The song "Minnie the Moocher."

974
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,299
- Yeah. So what?
- Hit it!

975
01:42:01,246 --> 01:42:07,293
Hey, folks, here?s a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher

976
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:12,215
She was a low-down hoochie coocher

977
01:42:12,298 --> 01:42:16,219
She was the roughest, toughest frail

978
01:42:16,302 --> 01:42:18,972
But Minnie had a heart

979
01:42:19,055 --> 01:42:20,974
As big as a whale

980
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:46,207
She messed around
with a bloke named Smokey

981
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:49,961
She loved him
though he was cokey

982
01:42:51,254 --> 01:42:54,299
He took her down to Chinatown

983
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:59,763
And he showed her how
to kick the gong around

984
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:44,849
She had a dream
about the King of Sweden

985
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:49,938
He gave her things
that she was needin '

986
01:43:50,021 --> 01:43:54,776
He gave her a home
built of gold and steel

987
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:59,406
A diamond car
with the platinum wheels

988
01:44:57,839 --> 01:45:00,800
This is glue. Strong stuff.

989
01:45:08,183 --> 01:45:10,060
What the hell are you doing?

990
01:45:10,143 --> 01:45:12,437
This can is from
a surplus disposal run.

991
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,523
Fifteen overcharged ounces
of pure, uncompounded...

992
01:45:15,607 --> 01:45:18,401
isopropyl butane monosulfate.

993
01:45:18,485 --> 01:45:20,779
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat...

994
01:45:20,862 --> 01:45:23,114
it will cause a rapid expansion.

995
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:53,687
Poor Min, poor Min

996
01:46:37,355 --> 01:46:39,315
- Let's take them!
- Wait a minute.

997
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:43,236
I've never even heard
these boys sing, all right?

998
01:46:43,319 --> 01:46:45,155
All right.

999
01:46:45,238 --> 01:46:47,449
They're not going no place.

1000
01:46:47,532 --> 01:46:50,285
All right, cover all exits! Let's go!
Come on! Hurry up!

1001
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:55,915
Move it!

1002
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:17,645
Who wants an Orange Whip?
Orange Whip?

1003
01:47:19,606 --> 01:47:21,566
Three Orange Whips.

1004
01:47:40,293 --> 01:47:42,629
Excuse us.

1005
01:47:42,712 --> 01:47:44,881
Good evening, ladies.

1006
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:23,878
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

1007
01:48:47,193 --> 01:48:51,031
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the
distinct pleasure of the management...

1008
01:48:51,114 --> 01:48:55,201
to present to you
the evening's star attraction.

1009
01:48:55,285 --> 01:48:59,706
Here they are, back after
their exclusive three-year tour...

1010
01:48:59,789 --> 01:49:03,877
of Europe, Scandinavia
and the subcontinent.

1011
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,714
Won't you welcome
from Calumet City, Illinois...

1012
01:49:07,797 --> 01:49:13,178
the show band
of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues.

1013
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:15,805
The Blues Brothers!

1014
01:49:52,592 --> 01:49:55,053
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1015
01:50:05,355 --> 01:50:08,149
We're so glad to see
so many lovely people here tonight.

1016
01:50:08,233 --> 01:50:10,902
We'd like to welcome
all the representatives...

1017
01:50:10,985 --> 01:50:12,737
of Illinois' law enforcement
community...

1018
01:50:12,821 --> 01:50:16,408
who have chosen to join us in
the Palace Hotel ballroom at this time.

1019
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:18,743
We certainly hope you all
enjoy the show.

1020
01:50:18,827 --> 01:50:20,912
And remember that
no matter who you are...

1021
01:50:20,995 --> 01:50:23,415
and what you do
to live and survive...

1022
01:50:23,498 --> 01:50:26,418
there's still some things
that make us all the same.

1023
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:30,463
You. Me. Them. Everybody.

1024
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,426
Everybody

1025
01:50:34,509 --> 01:50:36,928
Needs somebody

1026
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:39,431
Everybody

1027
01:50:39,514 --> 01:50:43,184
Needs somebody to love

1028
01:50:43,268 --> 01:50:45,020
Someone to love

1029
01:50:46,354 --> 01:50:48,857
Sweetheart to miss

1030
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:51,443
Sugar to kiss

1031
01:50:51,526 --> 01:50:53,653
I need you, you, you

1032
01:50:58,783 --> 01:51:00,994
In the morning

1033
01:51:01,077 --> 01:51:03,538
When my soul?s on fire

1034
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:06,875
Sometimes feel

1035
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:10,003
I feel a little sad inside

1036
01:51:10,086 --> 01:51:13,506
When my baby mistreats me
I never, never

1037
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:15,133
Find a place to hide
I need you

1038
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:37,530
Sometimes feel

1039
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,699
I feel a little sad inside

1040
01:51:39,783 --> 01:51:42,035
When my baby mistreats me

1041
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:46,247
I never, never find a place to hide
I need you

1042
01:51:54,756 --> 01:51:57,258
People, when you do find
that special somebody...

1043
01:51:57,342 --> 01:51:59,511
you gotta hold that man,
hold that woman...

1044
01:51:59,594 --> 01:52:01,179
Love him, please him,
squeeze her, please her!

1045
01:52:01,262 --> 01:52:03,598
Signify your feelings
with every caress.

1046
01:52:03,682 --> 01:52:05,934
Because it's so important
to have that special somebody...

1047
01:52:06,017 --> 01:52:08,269
to hold, kiss, miss...

1048
01:52:08,353 --> 01:52:10,063
to squeeze and please!

1049
01:52:10,146 --> 01:52:14,442
Everybody needs somebody

1050
01:52:14,526 --> 01:52:16,945
Everybody

1051
01:52:17,028 --> 01:52:19,864
Needs somebody to love

1052
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:22,367
Someone to love

1053
01:52:23,535 --> 01:52:25,912
Sweetheart to miss

1054
01:52:25,995 --> 01:52:28,206
Sugar to kiss

1055
01:52:28,289 --> 01:52:30,542
I need you, you

1056
01:52:38,216 --> 01:52:40,301
In the morning

1057
01:52:40,385 --> 01:52:42,470
When my soul?s on fire

1058
01:52:43,805 --> 01:52:47,475
When there ain 't no one around
I need you

1059
01:53:19,299 --> 01:53:21,718
Thank you.
That was for Wilson Pickett.

1060
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:27,766
This is dedicated
to the late, great Magic Sam.

1061
01:53:27,849 --> 01:53:31,644
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1062
01:53:38,985 --> 01:53:43,490
Come on
Baby, don?t you wanna go

1063
01:53:54,042 --> 01:53:56,836
Back to that same old place

1064
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,214
Sweet home Chicago

1065
01:54:02,592 --> 01:54:04,511
Six and three is nine

1066
01:54:04,594 --> 01:54:06,346
Nine and nine is eighteen

1067
01:54:06,429 --> 01:54:09,683
Look there, brother, baby
and see what I see

1068
01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:17,625
- The Mafia's after us now.
- You guys were hot!

1069
01:55:17,709 --> 01:55:20,837
You were great!
I've got to record you.

1070
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,965
- Bullshit.
- I don't bullshit.

1071
01:55:24,049 --> 01:55:25,884
I'm president of Clarion Records...

1072
01:55:25,967 --> 01:55:28,261
the largest recording company
on the eastern seaboard.

1073
01:55:28,345 --> 01:55:30,847
- So what?
- Here's $1 0,000.

1074
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:33,933
An advance on your first
recording session.

1075
01:55:36,311 --> 01:55:37,437
Is it a deal?

1076
01:55:38,521 --> 01:55:40,774
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

1077
01:55:40,857 --> 01:55:43,818
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

1078
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:46,696
Listen, all these cops out here--
they're waiting for us.

1079
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:50,116
We gotta get out with nobody
seeing us. You know a back door out?

1080
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:53,286
Sure. I used to be head bouncer here
back in the '70s.

1081
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:57,165
There's an electrical service duct
behind your drummer's riser.

1082
01:55:57,248 --> 01:55:59,250
Do us a favour.

1083
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:02,504
Take $1 ,400 and give it
to Ray's Music Exchange...

1084
01:56:02,587 --> 01:56:05,423
in Calumet City,
and give the rest to the band.

1085
01:56:05,507 --> 01:56:07,175
- You got it.
- Thanks.

1086
01:56:07,258 --> 01:56:09,135
Bye.

1087
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:29,531
Me and Elwood are gonna make a break
for it. You and the band keep playing.

1088
01:56:46,923 --> 01:56:50,552
- Something's wrong.
- Where?s Jake?

1089
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:55,765
Where'd they go?

1090
01:57:08,945 --> 01:57:11,364
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.

1091
01:57:11,448 --> 01:57:14,117
Elwood, we're gone, man.

1092
01:57:22,459 --> 01:57:25,045
Who is that girl?

1093
01:57:25,128 --> 01:57:27,422
Well, Jake.

1094
01:57:27,505 --> 01:57:30,383
You look just fine down there...

1095
01:57:30,467 --> 01:57:32,635
slithering in the mud
like vermin.

1096
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:34,637
No problem.

1097
01:57:35,722 --> 01:57:37,891
You're not gonna get away from me
this time.

1098
01:57:43,313 --> 01:57:44,814
Check that out! Let's go!

1099
01:58:04,459 --> 01:58:07,170
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

1100
01:58:08,254 --> 01:58:10,256
You contemptible pig.

1101
01:58:12,008 --> 01:58:15,345
I remained celibate for you.

1102
01:58:15,428 --> 01:58:18,223
I stood at the back
of a cathedral...

1103
01:58:18,306 --> 01:58:20,809
waiting, in celibacy, for you...

1104
01:58:20,892 --> 01:58:24,521
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.

1105
01:58:24,604 --> 01:58:27,857
My uncle hired the best
Rumanian caterers in the state.

1106
01:58:27,941 --> 01:58:30,360
To obtain the seven limousines...

1107
01:58:30,443 --> 01:58:33,738
my father used up his last favours
with Mad Pete Trullo.

1108
01:58:34,781 --> 01:58:37,701
So for me, for my mother...

1109
01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:41,830
my grandmother, my father,
my uncle and for the common good...

1110
01:58:41,913 --> 01:58:45,291
I must now kill you
and your brother.

1111
01:58:58,805 --> 01:59:01,850
Oh, please don't kill us!

1112
01:59:03,643 --> 01:59:07,564
You know I love you, baby! I wouldn't
leave you! It wasn't my fault!

1113
01:59:07,647 --> 01:59:09,524
You miserable slug!

1114
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:13,069
You think you can talk your way
out of this? You betrayed me!

1115
01:59:13,153 --> 01:59:16,072
No, I didn't. Honest!

1116
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:18,074
I ran out of gas!

1117
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:21,286
I had a flat tyre!
I didn't have money for cab fare!

1118
01:59:21,369 --> 01:59:23,413
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

1119
01:59:23,496 --> 01:59:25,331
And old friend came in
from out of town!

1120
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:29,836
Someone stole my car! There was
an earthquake! A terrible flood!

1121
01:59:29,919 --> 01:59:34,924
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,
I swear to God!

1122
01:59:57,572 --> 01:59:59,532
Jake, honey.

1123
02:00:12,462 --> 02:00:14,464
Let's go.

1124
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:19,177
Take it easy.

1125
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:36,695
You're now going to
totally demolish that car.

1126
02:00:39,781 --> 02:00:43,952
You want to maybe consider
going after the Blues Brothers?

1127
02:00:54,254 --> 02:00:56,589
It's 1 06 miles to Chicago.

1128
02:00:56,673 --> 02:00:59,509
We got a full tank of gas,
half a pack of cigarettes...

1129
02:00:59,592 --> 02:01:02,345
it's dark
and we're wearing sunglasses.

1130
02:01:02,429 --> 02:01:03,346
Hit it.

1131
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:50,977
Shit, man. Can't this damn thing
go any faster than this?

1132
02:01:51,061 --> 02:01:53,396
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

1133
02:01:56,066 --> 02:01:57,984
God dam, boy.

1134
02:02:21,925 --> 02:02:23,343
Shit.

1135
02:02:50,286 --> 02:02:53,707
Don't you say a fuckin' word.

1136
02:03:31,703 --> 02:03:35,165
All units, we have a ten-seven-niner.

1137
02:03:35,248 --> 02:03:36,833
Officers are in pursuit:

1138
02:03:36,916 --> 02:03:40,420
a black-and-white
1 974 Dodge sedan...

1139
02:03:40,503 --> 02:03:42,422
southbound on 47.

1140
02:03:42,505 --> 02:03:45,967
Respond to signal, ten-seven-niner.

1141
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:49,262
Occupants of vehicle.:
one Joliet Jake Blues...

1142
02:03:49,346 --> 02:03:51,431
one Elwood Blues.

1143
02:03:51,514 --> 02:03:53,725
- Considered extremely dangerous.
- Gruppenfuehrer!

1144
02:04:06,196 --> 02:04:09,407
Jake, I gotta pull over.

1145
02:04:18,249 --> 02:04:20,794
Southbound on State Highway 47.

1146
02:04:46,403 --> 02:04:49,364
Hi! Wanna hand me the mike?

1147
02:04:49,447 --> 02:04:51,491
Thanks a lot.

1148
02:04:51,574 --> 02:04:55,036
This is car--
What number are we?

1149
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:56,746
Five-five.

1150
02:04:56,830 --> 02:05:00,542
Car 55. We're in a truck.

1151
02:05:07,799 --> 02:05:10,677
Signal ten-seven-niner
still engaged.

1152
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:14,431
Vehicle travelling southbound
approaching Chicago city limits.

1153
02:05:14,514 --> 02:05:17,475
Commander advises will contact
Chicago precincts...

1154
02:05:17,559 --> 02:05:19,144
for a local intercept.

1155
02:05:19,227 --> 02:05:20,645
Maintain pursuit.

1156
02:05:27,527 --> 02:05:29,571
Use of unnecessary violence...

1157
02:05:29,654 --> 02:05:33,491
in the apprehension
of the Blues Brothers has been approved.

1158
02:06:01,686 --> 02:06:05,023
Well, this is definitely
Lower Wacker Drive.

1159
02:06:05,106 --> 02:06:07,901
If my estimations are correct...

1160
02:06:07,984 --> 02:06:12,530
we should be very close to
the Honourable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

1161
02:06:12,614 --> 02:06:15,283
- That's where they got that Picasso.
- Yep.

1162
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,480
Son of a bitch!

1163
02:08:57,195 --> 02:08:59,447
There they are.

1164
02:09:39,779 --> 02:09:41,656
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck was that?

1165
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:44,200
The motor. It's thrown a rod.

1166
02:09:44,284 --> 02:09:47,078
- Is that serious?
- Yep.

1167
02:10:15,357 --> 02:10:17,108
Faster.

1168
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,287
Holy shit!

1169
02:11:32,475 --> 02:11:33,893
I've always loved you.

1170
02:11:46,406 --> 02:11:47,449
There it is!

1171
02:12:32,202 --> 02:12:33,870
Come on!

1172
02:13:15,245 --> 02:13:19,374
Sir, where's the office
of the assessor of Cook County?

1173
02:13:19,457 --> 02:13:21,710
Down the hall. Turn right.

1174
02:13:21,793 --> 02:13:23,420
Take the elevator to 1102.

1175
02:13:23,503 --> 02:13:25,255
Thank you, sir.

1176
02:15:44,728 --> 02:15:46,896
Excuse me.
Did you see two guys...

1177
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:49,065
with black suits and hats,
one carrying a briefcase?

1178
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:51,109
Yeah. I just sent them down there.

1179
02:15:51,192 --> 02:15:53,111
Thank you.

1180
02:16:12,005 --> 02:16:13,923
Hold the door.

1181
02:16:42,911 --> 02:16:44,829
Let's go.

1182
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,358
Can I help you?

1183
02:17:58,778 --> 02:18:01,364
- This is where they pay taxes, right?
- Right.

1184
02:18:01,448 --> 02:18:03,199
This money is for
the year's assessment...

1185
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:06,411
on the St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud
Orphanage in Calumet City, Illinois.

1186
02:18:06,494 --> 02:18:08,872
Five thousand bucks.
It's all there, pal.

1187
02:18:16,296 --> 02:18:18,673
Stand back!

1188
02:18:18,757 --> 02:18:20,008
Fire!

1189
02:18:43,031 --> 02:18:45,950
And here is your receipt.

1190
02:19:04,469 --> 02:19:07,055
Warden threw party
in the county jail

1191
02:19:07,138 --> 02:19:09,683
Prison band was there
and they began to wail

1192
02:19:09,766 --> 02:19:12,852
The band was jumping
and the joint began to swing

1193
02:19:12,936 --> 02:19:14,562
You should of heard those
knocked-out jailbirds sing

1194
02:19:14,646 --> 02:19:16,439
Let's rock

1195
02:19:16,523 --> 02:19:18,525
Everybody, let's rock

1196
02:19:19,609 --> 02:19:22,195
Everybody on the whole cellblock

1197
02:19:22,278 --> 02:19:25,031
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

1198
02:19:25,115 --> 02:19:27,867
Spider Murphy played
the tenor saxophone

1199
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:30,161
Little Joe was blowin '
on the slide trombone

1200
02:19:30,245 --> 02:19:32,914
The drummer boy from Illinois
went crash, boom, bang

1201
02:19:32,997 --> 02:19:35,166
The whole rhythm section
was the Purple Gang

1202
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:38,670
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock

1203
02:19:40,338 --> 02:19:42,966
Everybody on the whole cellblock

1204
02:19:43,049 --> 02:19:45,635
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

1205
02:20:53,244 --> 02:20:55,246
Sad Sack was sitting
on a block of stone

1206
02:20:55,330 --> 02:20:58,166
Way over in the corner
weeping all alone

1207
02:20:58,249 --> 02:21:00,460
The warden said
Buddy, don?t you be no square

1208
02:21:00,543 --> 02:21:03,046
If you can't get a partner
use a wooden chair

1209
02:21:03,129 --> 02:21:04,798
Let's rock

02:21:04,881 --> 02:21:07,801
Everybody, let's rock

Everybody on the whole cellblock
