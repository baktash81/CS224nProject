00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,999
( Song Title: Real In Rio )

2
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,230
<i>All the birds of the feather </ i></i>

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,231
<i>Do what they love most of all </ i></i>

4
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>We are the best at rhythm and laughter </ i></i>

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,801
<i>That's why we love Carnival </ i></i>

6
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:47,400
<i>All so clear we can sing to </ i></i>

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,201
<i>Some adventures reborn </ i></i>

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,050
<i>Dance to the music, passion and knowledge </ i></i>

9
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,850
<i>Show us the best you can do </ i></i>

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,450
<i>Everyone here is on fire </ i></i>

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,150
<i>Get up and join in the fun </ i></i>

12
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,570
<i>Dancing with strangers, don't mess with danger </ i></i>

13
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,565
<i>Magic could happen for Rio </ i></i>

14
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,151
<i>In Rio, all by itself (itself) </ I></i>

15
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,750
<i>Your dancing and knowing </ i></i>

16
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,251
<i>You can't find it anywhere else </ i></i>

17
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:25,252
<i>Yes Rio, in Rio </ i></i>

18
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:28,450
<i>You know something else </ I></i>

19
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>You can feel it happening </ i></i>

20
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,464
<i>You can feel it all by yourself </ i></i>

21
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,780
It's okay, it's okay.

22
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,860
Shhh.

23
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,680
I'll take care of you.

24
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,340
Stupid clock!

25
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,940
Good morning Blu.

26
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,350
You...

27
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:38,784
Tyler Blu Gandersen.

28
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:41,140
You know these vitamins
are good for you.

29
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,180
Uuh, what's this?

30
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,260
Gotcha.

31
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,940
Arghhh!

32
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,700
Enjoy the new book.

33
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
Thanks Linda.

34
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,100
Bye now.

35
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes, Mum.
I love to visit.

36
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,300
But who'll take care of Blu?

37
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,900
Mum, they don't have
candles for parrots.

38
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,240
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu.

39
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
Just how you like it.

40
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,340
Because I don't trust leaving
Blu with just anyone.

41
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,160
No, I don't have a bird sitter.

42
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,420
What is a bird sitter...

43
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,340
This is the life.

44
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,380
The perfect marshmallow
to cocoa ratio.

45
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,800
One, two, three,
four, five,...Six!

46
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,440
Well, if it isn't
my favorite nerd bird.

47
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Very funny, real mature.

48
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,392
Hey Pet, where are you
migrating to this year?

49
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,093
The 'broad-first' nook?

50
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,140
Throw all the snow
balls you want.

51
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm protected by this magical
force field, called "glass".

52
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,154
It's what keep us so
toasty and warm in here,

53
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,980
while you guys are out
there freezing your...

54
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Classy.

55
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,941
Ara-ara!
Ara-ara!

56
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,260
Are you all right?

57
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm not really built for this weather.

58
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,260
Oh, are you looking for some books?

59
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,360
Books?

60
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,940
No, no.

61
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,480
I've come six thousand miles
looking for him.

62
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,960
Doctor of Ornithology?

63
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,640
Ooh, he's magnificent.

64
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,380
Linda, a little help here.
Linda!

65
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow, you're actually communicating.

66
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,760
Yes, I introduced myself and
shook my tail feathers,

67
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,400
counter-clockwise,
thus referring to his dominance.

68
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,479
I did not get that at all.

69
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
So, Dr Monteiro.

70
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,887
No Dr. please, just call me Tulio.

71
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,680
You know your Macaw
is a very special bird.

72
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,840
In fact, as far as we know,

73
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,260
Blu is the last male of his kind.

74
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,240
Really?
- Yes.

75
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,940
Recently we found a female.

76
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:36,600
And our hope is to bring the two
of them together to save their species.

77
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,440
Well sure, when can she come over?

78
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,257
Oh, no, she is in Brazil.

79
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,427
Blu must come to Rio De Janeiro.

80
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,840
Rio, Brazil?

81
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

82
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,974
I never let Blu out of my sight.

83
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,051
He needs me.

84
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,190
Oh no.
You misunderstand.

85
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,760
It's all arranged. You'll be
with him every step of the way.

86
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
And I'll be with you.

87
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,600
Look, I know you're doing your job.

88
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,120
But... well, Blu's very particular...

89
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,705
And we have our little routine here

90
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:14,505
and we're not big on travel.

91
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,200
Heck, he doesn't even fly.

92
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,718
Of course he can fly.

93
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,900
He's a perfect specimen.

94
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
What are you doing?

95
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,190
Don't worry, their natural
instincts always take over.

96
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,580
Wait, no!

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, almost always.

98
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,400
Blu!

99
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,330
What kind of doctor are you?

100
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,780
Are you okay?

101
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
Perhaps he's too domesticated.

102
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,700
It was very nice of you to step in,

103
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,260
squawk around and throw my bird,

104
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,860
but now it is time for you to go.

105
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm very sorry.

106
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,780
I'm very sorry, but wait, Linda.

107
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,200
This could be our last chance.

108
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,940
Have a safe flight.

109
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,200
Linda, please listen to me!

110
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,460
If we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone.

111
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,840
Just think about it.

112
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
Natural instincts.

113
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,140
There is nothing natural about being
thrown half way across the room.

114
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,660
Hah, I'll show him.

115
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,020
I can do this.
I just have to work out the physics.

116
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,105
I have quadrated my vector angles.

117
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,750
I have adjusted for wind shear,
house every reinforcement.

118
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
Good.

119
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,900
Okay, let's see.

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,620
Flaps open, perfect.

121
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,380
Landing gear, checked.

122
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,745
Tail flaps, operational.

123
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,600
And actually, not bad.

124
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,420
This is it. Let's fly.

125
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,100
Just keep it simple.

126
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,140
Thrust, lift, drag, and wait.

127
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,060
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

128
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,380
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

129
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,540
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

130
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
Blu?

131
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,420
I promised I'll always
look out for you.

132
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,940
Didn't I?

133
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,240
Have I ever broken a promise?

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm scared too.

135
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,920
But I wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

136
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,220
What do you say Blu?

137
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,280
That's my big brave boy.

138
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,740
We will be back home
before we even know it.

139
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,160
Your turn Blu.
You don't want to get 'beak-burn'.

140
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,680
Wow, what's going on here?

141
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,400
You arrive in time for carnival.
- Carnival?

142
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,940
Yes, it's the biggest
party in the world.

143
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,200
You know a time to
have fun and dance.

144
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
Oh mine!

145
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,480
Is she a performer?

146
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,200
No, in fact she's my dentist.

147
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,900
Dr. Barbosa!

148
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,160
Do not forget to floss, Tulio.

149
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160
You got it.

150
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,300
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

151
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,020
Oh, not me.

152
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,339
Oh, wait.

153
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,160
I am not from here.

154
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,950
Hey Nico, he's a tourist.

155
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,490
Funny, you don't look like one.

156
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,020
Really? I don't?

157
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,740
Except, you've got pigeon dodo
on your nose.

158
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,060
Oh, no, this is just SPF3000.

159
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,680
So, are you here for carnival?

160
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,620
Actually I'm just here to meet a girl.

161
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,140
Huh, a girl?
- Yes.

162
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,820
Little word of advice.
You make the first move.

163
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,780
Brazilian women respond to confidence.
- Oh, right.

164
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,740
Yes, it's all about swagger.

165
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,697
You've got to pop out that chest,

166
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,336
swing that tail,

167
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,965
eyes narrowed look like some
kind of crazy love hawk.

168
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,620
But first we've got to bust you out.
- What?

169
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm gonna pop that cage
open like a soda cap.

170
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,080
No, no...

171
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,740
No, that's okay.

172
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,280
You call that popping?

173
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,910
This thing's robust.

174
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,940
No, guys really, I'm fine.
The cage is great.

175
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,060
Love the cage.

176
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,720
Dabbo, suit yourself.

177
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,860
Don't forget, love hawk.

178
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes and to you as well.

179
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,780
This is the heart
and soul of our aviary.

180
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,260
Our treatment room.

181
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,580
They really like you.

182
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,836
A lot.
- Yes!

183
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,700
I'm their great big mama bird.

184
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,320
You want some?
- No, I'm good.

185
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,220
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

186
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,280
Smugglers?
- Yes.

187
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,540
Unfortunately, the poor
birds are often hurt.

188
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
or even killed in the process.

189
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,780
But with proper care,
they can be saved.

190
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,060
Look here.

191
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,980
This poor guy was found last night.

192
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,880
Hey buddy, you're looking great today.

193
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,100
Much better,
much better.

194
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Get well soon.

195
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,560
So, where is Jewel?

196
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, we have a special place for Jewel.

197
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,760
She's a very spirited bird.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,440
I'll say.

199
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,920
She did that?

200
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,975
Charming.

201
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,860
Okay, I want to go home now.

202
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,580
No, don't worry.

203
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

204
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,360
Help! Help!
Let me out of here!

205
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,280
Linda!

206
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,100
Maybe I should...
No, give it a chance.

207
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,180
Hello?

208
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,760
Hello?

209
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,480
I come in peace.

210
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,200
She's beautiful.

211
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,820
What were they talking about?
She's... like an angel.

212
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,280
An angel whose getting really close up!

213
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,320
You're standing on my throat.
- You're an American.

214
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,860
Thanks.

215
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I need my throat for talking,
so thank you.

216
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,380
You look like me.

217
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,260
Hi.

218
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,080
Hi. My name is Blu.

219
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
You know like the cheese
with the mould on it.

220
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,965
No, it smells really bad.

221
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,966
That's stupid, stupid, stupid.

222
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,300
Alright come on,
we don't have much time.

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,360
Wait, wait!
Ouch!

224
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,640
Are you ready?
- For what?

225
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Oh, oh, wow.
Aah... okay.

226
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,619
Confidence!

227
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
Crazy love hawk.

228
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,530
Wow, hey!
What are you doing?

229
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,231
What?
What you want me to.

230
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,960
But just for argument sake,
what are you doing?

231
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,260
I am trying to escape.

232
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,276
Oh..., ya... escape,

233
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:30,477
that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.

234
00:17:30,478 --> 00:17:31,620
Wait, wait.

235
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,820
Did you actually think we were going to kiss?

236
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,500
No, no, no!
- We just met!

237
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,760
Oh mine!
- I think they need a little help.

238
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,660
I know how my feathers look,
but I'm not that kind of bird.

239
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

240
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,640
But, it's actually a pretty good song.

241
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,080
'Naturally...' yes, sing it Lionel.

242
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,250
Wow, That was fast.

243
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,560
Lionel Richie. Works every time.

244
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,640
We should probably
give them some privacy.

245
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,520
I'm not so sure I should
leave Blu here alone.

246
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,990
Oh no, don't worry.

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,440
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

248
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,520
Besides, he's got Jewel.

249
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,500
Help me!

250
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,980
This is the final countdown to Carnival!
Let's Samba.

251
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,440
Come here little birdie.

252
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,520
It's okay. I got you.

253
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,400
Excuse me!

254
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,260
Please, I'm trying to sleep.

255
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm sorry sleepy head,
I'm trying to escape.

256
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,300
Escape, why?
This cage is awesome.

257
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,580
This cage...?
Oh, what was I thinking?

258
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

259
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,340
Pet?
Did you just call me a pet?

260
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,380
For the record, I am not a pet.

261
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,700
I am a companion.

262
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,300
And you know what?
Do what you want.

263
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,201
Cause' tomorrow morning
Linda will come for me,

264
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:10,960
and this whole nightmare will be over.

265
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,362
Incredibly, you rather be with a human

266
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:15,763
than with your own kind.

267
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,700
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years,

268
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,710
whereas my own kind tries
to strangle me after 15 seconds.

269
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,513
Yah, it's because of them,
I've lost everything.

270
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,014
You can't trust them!

271
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,640
Of course, you can trust humans.

272
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,020
Jewel?

273
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,280
Jewel?

274
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,380
Hi there!

275
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
It's nice of you to join me for dinner.

276
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,800
I often eat alone.

277
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,480
Because of my work.

278
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,700
I thought I was the 'bird-mad'
until I met you.

279
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,700
Yes, right.
Do you have a favorite bird?

280
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,920
Well, obviously
I'm a Blue Macaw kind of gal.

281
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,260
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

282
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,640
Actually, it's the brains I'm attracted to.

283
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm not so impressed by fancy feathers.

284
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,180
I know exactly,
what you mean.

285
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,080
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

286
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,627
I've always been mesmerized by those big,

287
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:19,328
round intelligent eyes.

288
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,700
Chicken rolls?

289
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,001
Lambada.

290
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,340
Chicken eyes.

291
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:28,941
Oh gosh!

292
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,320
Hello.

293
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,400
Oh, Blu.

294
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,140
We should have never left.

295
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,780
This is all my fault.
- No Linda, please.

296
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,680
This is not your fault.

297
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,560
You're right,
It's not my fault.

298
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,290
- It's your fault!
- What?

299
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,200
With your little bird talk,

300
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,601
and that whole...

301
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,150
Well, you know what?

302
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,251
Squawk squawking is squawk-squawk!

303
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,820
I am sorry.
I didn't mean to curse.

304
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,594
I don't understand!

305
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:30,680
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

306
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,960
So let me get this straight.

307
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You were attacked
by a little white bird.

308
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,280
Yes, with this rag he held it
to my mouth, like this.

309
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,140
We're doomed.

310
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,600
Okay, there's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

311
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,640
How I wish I was back in my cage

312
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,560
with my mirror and my swing
and my little bell.

313
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,020
How I miss my little bell.
- Ssshh, play dead.

314
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,580
What? I don't need to play dead.
I'm about to have a heart attack.

315
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Just do it!
- Fine.

316
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,540
Stop twitching.
- Come on, its the twitching that sells it.

317
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
Come on in, kid.

318
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,720
Well, what do you know?
Good work, Fernando.

319
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,220
You see boys.
What did I tell you about this one?

320
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,860
That you are going to pay him
half as much as what you said?

321
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,320
No, you idiot.

322
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,220
That he reminds me of myself
when I was that age.

323
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,100
Smart, resourceful.
Here you go, kid.

324
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,740
Hey, it's only half of what
you promised me.

325
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,060
Shut up, kid.

326
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
What the...?

327
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,523
I thought I told you I needed
these birds alive.

328
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,760
Tell me, Fernando.
Does this look alive to you?

329
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,220
Huh?

330
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
Get it!
- Over here!

331
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,600
Jewel!

332
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,305
Hello, pretty bird.

333
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:28,106
What's the matter?

334
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,507
Cockatoo got your throat?

335
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,351
Nigel, alive.

336
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
To be continued.

337
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,400
That was your plan!
To take off and leave me!

338
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,600
Gee, thanks.

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,580
Why didn't you follow me?

340
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,700
Nice work, Nigel.
- Yah, nice work, Nigel.

341
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,320
The last two Macawsan birds.

342
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,960
These are worth a fortune.

343
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,740
Hey, Fernando!
Hang these up in the other room.

344
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,080
Hey, birdie.
Let me out! Let me out!

345
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,220
Let me out of here!

346
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,440
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird.
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird, hahaha!

347
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,130
I was framed.
They got the wrong guy.

348
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,720
Sorry guys.
Nothing personal.

349
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,560
So, what is going to happen to them?

350
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,960
Don't worry.
We're going to find good homes for them.

351
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,900
Now go home to Mama.

352
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,160
But I don't have a Mama.
Father?

353
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
Brother?
Gold fish?

354
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,480
Can we keep him, boss?

355
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,840
No!

356
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,760
So Marcel, what's really going
to happen to those birds?

357
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,240
Dulled, plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares.

358
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,580
All I know is,
we are going to be rich.

359
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,940
We're gonna to be rich.

360
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,540
Come on, the game's starting.

361
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,820
Yes, you be very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

362
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,460
Of course, I have both the Macaws.

363
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,620
Yes, I'll deliver them myself.

364
00:26:58,822 --> 00:27:00,220
Au revoir.

365
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
Alright you two,
we load the truck tonight.

366
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,880
First thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

367
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,640
You got it?
- Yeah, sure, heard you.

368
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,480
And one of you, feed Nigel.

369
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,900
Rock paper scissors, shoot.

370
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,580
Yes!

371
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,249
No-no, scissors cut rock.

372
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,450
Oh man, how come you always win?

373
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,780
Nice birdie.

374
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,820
Here you go.

375
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,180
Ughh, cannibal.

376
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Okay, hold it together.
The key is not to panic.

377
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,525
I'm not panicking.

378
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,560
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to me.

379
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,340
But it's okay.
Any minute now, Linda will find us.

380
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,685
Oh great, and then she'll just stick us
behind another set of bars, right?

381
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,015
Yes, I mean No!

382
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,080
Look, pet cages might work for you
but I don't want to belong to anyone.

383
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,120
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

384
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,140
Would you mind?

385
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,871
Oh, I know I'm not a pretty birdie.

386
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:36,630
But I used to be quite a looker.

387
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,100
The star.

388
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,900
Lights, camera, action.

389
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,120
I was striking svelte.

390
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,280
Ambitious feet-to-beak.

391
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,530
So birdie-licious.

392
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,305
Now I'm vile.
I'm villain and vicious.

393
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,978
Oh, and malicious.

394
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,540
I had it all, tv shows, women too.

395
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,180
I was tall. Over 1'foot 2".

396
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,660
Then they got a pretty
parrot to fill my shoes.

397
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,840
That's why I am so evil,
why I do what I do.

398
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,530
He was a superstar.
So young and vital.

399
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,900
He's nasty.
A Southern American idol.

400
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,380
He's a vicious bird.
Who said that about me?

401
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,980
A very vicious bird.
I'll have you rotisseried.

402
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,935
I am a feathery freak with beak,
a bird murderer.

403
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,540
You think you're better than me.
I've never heard of you.

404
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm evil. I'll feed your
cheese balls with weevils.

405
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,100
I poop on people
and I blame it on seagulls.

406
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,395
It was him.

407
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,720
He's a nasty bird,
I'm invincible.

408
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,998
He's ghastly.

409
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,848
I'm invincible, I'm unwashable, unrinsible.

410
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:35,190
Like an abandoned school, I have no principles.

411
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,402
All of you Brazilian birds

412
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:39,823
All 18 million birds.

413
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,243
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

414
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,829
I'm going to make you...

415
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,800
Shut up now, shut up!

416
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,000
Just me.

417
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,680
I will make you ugly too.

418
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,340
Hey!
- Sweet nightmares.

419
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,920
Not cool man.
Scary, but not cool!

420
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,273
Hey, are you okay?
- No.

421
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm definitely not okay!

422
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,800
What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

423
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,555
You going to help me, or what?

424
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,280
Actually our survival guide said
to sit and wait, and help will come.

425
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,715
No one is coming!

426
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,580
We are on our own and if we just
sit here, we're going to die!

427
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,720
Yes, yes, yes.

428
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
No!

429
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,320
Nigel, get out of the way!

430
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,680
Stop, stop.
Why don't you just open the door?

431
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,720
Are you kidding me?
- Why? It's just a standard flip slide ball.

432
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
What are you doing?

433
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,200
Well I can't...
- What? You can't what?

434
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,440
I can't fly!

435
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,840
You couldn't tell me before now!
It didn't matter before now.

436
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,680
I hate you.

437
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,320
There is something else I need to know?
- Yes!

438
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,520
I can't fly, I pick my beak and
once in a while I pee in the bird bath.

439
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,080
Happy?

440
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,880
There, they are!

441
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:09,000
We got to get out of here!

442
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,075
Wait. Listen to me.

443
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,555
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is. Follow my lead.

444
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,640
Inside right, outside left.
- Okay, I've got it.

445
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,080
Inside, outside, inside, outside.

446
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,320
Yes, yes! Come on!

447
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,400
See, I'm bilingual too.

448
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,828
This is great!

449
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,035
I'm chained to the only bird
in the world who can't fly!

450
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,380
Actually, there are 40 species
of flightless birds.

451
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:48,640
Duck!
No, Ducks can fly!

452
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,400
No! Duck!

453
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,340
Oh yes!

454
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:22,341
Yes!

455
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:23,342
Calm down!

456
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,400
Nooo!
NOoorrr!

457
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,620
Get out of here, you putrid poultry.

458
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,720
Oh, what was that?
- A stick.

459
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,560
Ahh, and that?
- It's just a rock.

460
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,655
Is that a spider on your back?
- Will you quit it?

461
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,320
It's just a leaf.
Turn around.

462
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,600
Leaf.

463
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,780
Told you.

464
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,958
Come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

465
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,440
Safe? Safe!
We're in the jungle!

466
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,380
You know when people say
it's a jungle out there,

467
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,420
I'm sure they don't mean it
as a good thing.

468
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,200
Look, I hate to break it to you but
this is where our kind naturally lives.

469
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,600
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.

470
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,600
I know all about the food chain.

471
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,076
You see, out here
I'm just a hors d'oeuvre.

472
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:45,277
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

473
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,300
That is why we stay on the trees
and not on the ground.

474
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,720
After you.

475
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,380
Oh no, I don't think so.

476
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,220
I'll feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

477
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,840
How about up there?

478
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,900
I can't believe I've to drag
your clumsy butt up there.

479
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,780
Drag me?
Watch and learn.

480
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,460
Blu! Just wait!

481
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,445
Who's dragging who's butt now, huh?

482
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,546
Ha, ha very funny.

483
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,400
You see, who needs flying?

484
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,001
Birds, birds need flying.

485
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,123
Flying is... freedom

486
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:36,868
and not having to rely on anyone.

487
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,460
Don't you want that?

488
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't know.
Sounds a little lonely.

489
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,420
Lets get some sleep.

490
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

491
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,238
Because I'm still on Minnesota's time.

492
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,800
Good night.

493
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,200
Good night Jewel.

494
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,880
Good night Linda.

495
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,200
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen my bird?

496
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,060
Have you seen my bird?

497
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,080
Excuse me, have you seen my bird?

498
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,360
Have you seen my bird?

499
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,060
Lady, American lady.

500
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,900
Blu? Blu?

501
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,020
I know where your birds are.
- You found Blu? Are you sure?

502
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,980
It's his.

503
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,110
Let me see that.

504
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,100
You're right.

505
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,800
Okay, where is he?

506
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,000
Come on, lets go.
I'll take you to him.

507
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,260
No, no Linda, wait.
We don't know this boy.

508
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,680
We can't trust him.

509
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,026
I have to trust him.

510
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:34,327
I don't have a choice.

511
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,540
Do you think I'm an idiot?

512
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,863
There were two birds,
chained together, in a cage.

513
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,280
How could you lose them?

514
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,110
They out smart us boss.
But don't worry.

515
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,640
We'll get them back.
I have a plan.

516
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,620
Oh great.
What are you going to do?

517
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,440
Wonder in the city, calling
"Here birdie-birdie, here birdie!"

518
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,320
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

519
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,360
We have to get birds to
the airport by tonight.

520
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,240
But it's Carnival. All the roads
will be blocked by the parade.

521
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,300
That's why I wanted
to go this morning!

522
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,420
Nigel!

523
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,500
This bird is ten times smarter
than the two of you combined.

524
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,140
If he's so smart why don't you
put him in charge?

525
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,160
I am putting him in charge.

526
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,260
Stop suggesting things!

527
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,020
Go find them, Nigel.

528
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,580
Hmm, if we can't get through the parade,

529
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
we'll have to be in the parade.

530
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,400
Huh?

531
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,260
Are you sure it is going to work?
- Positive.

532
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,820
Check my map.

533
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,380
Yes, that's just comforting.
Thank you.

534
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,860
Look, lets just get this chain broken.

535
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:07,257
Right, then we can go find Linda.

536
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,388
No, you can go find Linda.

537
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,460
Once this chain is off,
I'm going back to being free in the jungle.

538
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,140
Deal?
- Fine, deal.

539
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,180
Nice try Brainiac.

540
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,377
I think something is watching us.

541
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,880
Oh, be careful Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

542
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
Oh, come here.

543
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Attack!

544
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,100
What is going on down there?

545
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,940
Go, go, go. Off with you.

546
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,680
Okay guys, guys.
I told you a thousand times.

547
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Manuela Sofia Kamana, listen to me.
Ow! O'yah, right in the eye.

548
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,760
Oh precious, ain't they?

549
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,540
The kids!
Seventeen of them and one on the way.

550
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,660
Hey,... stop shaking them.

551
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,762
They have given me great feathers.

552
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,163
Oh, this papa needs a break.

553
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,780
So, you two love birds
headed for Carnival?

554
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,480
Wow, love birds?
- We're more like acquaintance birds.

555
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,155
And not even that.
We're more like 'chained-together' birds.

556
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,660
Yes, I mean...
Ouch!

557
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,484
What is it with these kids and the feathers?

558
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,670
We have no idea, we're having them tested.

559
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,540
So, do you think you could
help us get this thing off?

560
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,038
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

561
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,510
Ow! Again in the eye!

562
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,867
Okay, you want me
to call your mother!

563
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:55,868
No!

564
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,320
Works every time.
They are scared to death of her.

565
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,860
Call me for what?

566
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,660
Eva, my love.

567
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,937
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

568
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:04,978
Luiz?

569
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,540
You don't fool me for a second.

570
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,520
You and your amigos just want
to sneak off to Carnival.

571
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,690
Oh Carnival.

572
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:16,840
That magical time when I met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

573
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,630
I still remember the song that was
playing when I first laid eyes on you.

574
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,352
'Tall and tanning, young and lovely,'

575
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:31,060
'the girl from Ipanema goes walking.'

576
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,280
Come on baby, sing it.

577
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,581
'And when she passes'

578
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:37,072
'Each one she passes goes 'Aah!!!''

579
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,260
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

580
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,660
I guess love is deaf too.

581
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,640
Come here, mmm.

582
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,280
Okay, take them to Luiz,
but hurry back.

583
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
You are an angel.

584
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,960
I'll miss you, my juicy little mango.

585
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,500
Oh me too. My pouchy papaya.

586
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,720
Hey! Paco, Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

587
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,639
I can't believe she actually let me go.

588
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,700
So how far is this Luiz?

589
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:09,533
Not far, 30 minutes says the crow flies.

590
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,000
And how long does the Macaw walks?

591
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,887
Bobo here can't fly.

592
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,688
But he's a bird.
- Not all birds fly.

593
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,715
There are Ostriches...
- You're not an Ostrich.

594
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,145
Well, not technically.
- Wait, wait, wait...

595
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,596
My friends, I want to help you,
but to walk the whole way,

596
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:23,305
it...it can't be done!
- Where's daddy...?

597
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,720
Daddy, daddy!

598
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,778
But hey, we might as
well give it a shot.

599
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,800
Let's go, quickly.

600
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:30,960
No, don't back.
They sense fear.

601
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,820
What an adorable monkey.

602
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,820
Hey, my watch!

603
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,095
Hello boys.

604
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,496
Seems like you had a busy day.

605
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,755
Oh, what? This?

606
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,570
This is just some stuff we found.

607
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,256
Right boys?

608
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,141
I'm not interested in
your nicked knickknacks.

609
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,920
Your burgle-bobbles bore me.

610
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,320
There are two blue Macaws out there.

611
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,260
And I need your multitude
of vice to help me find them.

612
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,120
Oh yes, what's in it for us?

613
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,340
That's a fair question.

614
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,380
Let's discuss it.

615
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,039
I certainly see your point.

616
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,671
But what could I possibly
do for you in return?

617
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,450
Save me, save me!

618
00:43:22,455 --> 00:43:24,680
Oh, that's a thought.

619
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,080
This is enough?

620
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:28,211
I don't want to feel
like I'm cheating you.

621
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,930
We'll do it, we'll do it.
Save me, please.

622
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,600
Save me!

623
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,200
Alright, you twisted my wing.
Deal.

624
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,200
Now then, any more questions?

625
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,380
No? Good!

626
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,260
You'll spread out and find these
Macaws by the end of the day.

627
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:49,761
Or it's flying lessons for everyone!

628
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:50,962
Go!

629
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,529
Go do your monkey business.

630
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,620
I changed my mind.

631
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,750
Maybe we can find a bus
schedule or something.

632
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,870
Come on, you are not
going to back out now?

633
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,960
Not in front of a lady.

634
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,670
Okay, yes..., sure.

635
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:24,420
All right, that's the spirit.

636
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:25,950
You sure you're up for this?

637
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,143
I mean it's not like we're hurdling
ourselves off the mountain or something.

638
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,700
Right?

639
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:34,000
Actually that was pretty
much my entire plan.

640
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,640
What?

641
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,220
Don't worry Blu.
It's in your DNA.

642
00:44:37,222 --> 00:44:40,540
And if our featherless friends
can do it, how hard can it be?

643
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,460
Help me!

644
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,209
Fun right?

645
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,050
Yeah, fun.

646
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,960
Okay, I need you
two to get closer.

647
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,940
Closer.

648
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,400
Closer.

649
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,260
Nice.

650
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:00,910
Now, put your wings
around each other.

651
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:01,548
What?

652
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,440
Come on amigos,
Not that she's going to bite.

653
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,700
Will you?
- We'll see.

654
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,980
Now, you flap your right wing
and you flap your left wing.

655
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,100
And together, you fly.

656
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,620
This doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

657
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,220
You think too much.

658
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:20,180
Flying is not what you think up here.

659
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,510
It's what you feel in here.

660
00:45:22,515 --> 00:45:24,075
And when you feel the
rhythm of your heart.

661
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:25,860
It's like samba.

662
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,580
You fly.

663
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,820
See, it's easy.

664
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,915
Easy?

665
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,920
Easy for you to say because
from here, it looks really hard.

666
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,040
Hey, if want to see Linda again,
This is the only way.

667
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,120
Okay, you're right.
- Yes, I am.

668
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,280
This is for Linda.
- Right.

669
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,080
Keep it simple.
- Easy breezing.

670
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,360
Trust, lift, drag...
- Come on, let's go!

671
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,000
Wait!
Outside, inside, outside, inside...

672
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,960
Come on Blu, you can do it!

673
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,920
I can do it, I can do it...

674
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,521
I can't do it!

675
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,400
Not again!

676
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,600
Am I dead?
- No, we are still alive!

677
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,440
This is incredible.

678
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,080
This is the most beautiful
thing I ever seen.

679
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,440
See what you've been missing?
- Yes.

680
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,720
Alright Blu, you're flying.
Sort of.

681
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,000
Not really, but do you feel it?

682
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:59,447
Yes, I do feel it.

683
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,580
No, no, Blu!

684
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,180
Mi Caramba!

685
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,420
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

686
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,940
We're going to die!

687
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,240
You did not feel it in here.
- You think?

688
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,040
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

689
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Hurry you two barbos!

690
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,980
What's to the species here?.

691
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,620
Move it!

692
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,760
Come on love birds.

693
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,020
You made it.

694
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,680
I would love to go five minutes
without getting killed.

695
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,000
Is that too much to ask?

696
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:26,000
For a bird who can't fly, yes.

697
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,400
They're starting to close off
the streets for Carnival.

698
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,181
Better be right kid because
we're running out of time.

699
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,562
Never be able to get my
car through this crowd.

700
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,120
Don't worry, I'm on it.

701
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,176
Hey kid, where did you get this bike?

702
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:01,240
I traded it for your jeep.
- What?

703
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,780
Yes, it's in great condition.

704
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,060
Well, good condition.

705
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,840
Hey, out of the way!

706
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,220
Look out!

707
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,200
Hold on!

708
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,870
I'm going to chew through my own
leg if this doesn't come off soon.

709
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,644
Relax, we find Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

710
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,635
Hey, Ralfie!
If it isn't the king of carnival.

711
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,760
Nico, Pedro!
What a family?

712
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,880
Where've you been hiding yourself bird?
I thought you were dead.

713
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,580
Hold up, rewind.

714
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,000
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

715
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,360
I think our love lesson when down smooth.

716
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,728
You work fast.

717
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,930
Baby got beak.

718
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:53,235
You're locked up and now
you're rolling with a hot wing.

719
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:54,850
I want to be like you.

720
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,340
Don't, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

721
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,145
Hey, I'm not judging you.
Keep us spastic.

722
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,520
Hey guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

723
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,180
Yes, I see him but you didn't.

724
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:07,060
You just missed him. He took
the trolley back to the garage.

725
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,200
Oh great.

726
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,600
Relax baby bird,
you can catch the next one.

727
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,960
It's time to take it to the next level.

728
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,260
What's wrong with this level?

729
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:16,920
Come on, this ain't the level.
Next level is the level.

730
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,995
You got to shake your tail feather.
- Oh yes.

731
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,020
We got to get this chain off.
- Come on love birds, you are in Rio.

732
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:24,380
You should enjoy it. Live a little.

733
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,540
We got them.

734
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,160
Welcome to paradise.

735
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,410
Some party, huh?

736
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,480
This is the coolest place
I've ever seen.

737
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,680
Despite all the RVS health code violations.

738
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,020
I like you.
Nothing you say makes any sense.

739
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,140
Alright everyone listen up.

740
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,810
Ralfi has some special
guests from out of town.

741
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,820
Lets show them some love because
I don't think they get out very much.

742
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,860
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

743
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,040
Clap them, clap them.
I don't care, slap them.

744
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,540
Party in Ipanema baby.

761
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,260
Alright, Blu.

Have you been listening?
- No, I've been watching.

766
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,180

In your little monkey dreams.

780
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,700
That was meant for you.

00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,950
Come on, can we all get along?

This isn't your fight big nose.

You mess with my friend,
you mess with me!

784
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,480
And us!

785
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,620
Yes, little King Kong.

786
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,420
I don't know what's going on here.

787
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,327
Birds vs. Monkeys!
Get them!

Yipee-kay-yay mountain man!

Miss!

We have to go!

791
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,980
Need a lift?

792
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,580
Take that you, funky monkey.

793
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,640
Thank you!
- Any time!

794
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,020
That's what I'm talking about.

795
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,695
Bird man, we threw down!

796
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,860
Yes, we threw down.

797
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:05,700
You guys were like fire and ice.

798
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:06,430
Thunder and lightning.

799

Cheese and sprinkles.

It's a Minnesota thing.

802
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,780
You see, nothing you say
makes any sense.

803
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,960
Come on, follow me.

804
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
What?

805
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,790
But, the birds were here.

806
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,070
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

807
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,346
I swear.
The birds were right here.

808
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:36,535
How do you know?

809
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,710
Because I'm the one who took them.

810
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,235
You?
- I didn't want to hurt anybody.

811
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,150
I just needed the money.

812
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,380
Fernando, I trusted you.
- I know but...

813
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,540
Oh man, that's good.

814
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,800
Hey guys.

815
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,470
What are you doing here?

816
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,640
I just wanted to see if you
have any work for me.

817
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,360
Well, if you were here two hours
go, you could have helped us load...

818
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,740
What? Shut up!

819
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,995
So, why are you guys
dressed for Carnival?

820
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,990
No one will know us when we
smuggle these birds...Ouch!

821
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,260
Shut up!

822
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,580
We need a float.

823
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,640
Oh.

824
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,040
A float!

825
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,290
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can I come?

826
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,840
I'm a great dancer.
- Can he come?

827
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,400
Come on, please.
Three's better than two.

828
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,140
Fine. We got to hurry though.

829
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,730
Wow, I almost forgot.

830
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,320
Where did I put it?
I thought it was right here.

831
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,560
There it is!

832
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,920
Got it!

833
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,420
Let's go.

834
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,175
Hurry up, kid.

835
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,240
Can he go on the plane with us too?
- Shut up.

836
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,520
We can't let them get on the plane.

837
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,080
You can ride a motorcycle, right?

838
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,640
You insult me.

839
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,260
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

840
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,620
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

841
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,860
What happened?

842
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,095
Papa?

843
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,420
What happened?

844
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
Don't hurt me.

845
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,120
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

846
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,780
No, I don't know anything.

847
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,420
When I go biting down your head,

848
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:56,263
will it go pop or will it go crack?

849
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,633
Where are the civilian birds?

850
00:57:59,634 --> 00:58:01,540
That means Blu by the way.

851
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,780
They escaped, went to Luiz.

852
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,180
Anything else?

853
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
They said you were very nice.

854
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,560
Did they?

855
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,540
Liar.

856
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,260
And handsome too?

857
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,920
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

858
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,180
Don't worry, I got it.

859
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,380
There he goes. That's my boy.

860
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,050
Is it hot?
I think I'm sweating.

861
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,940
I don't think it was even biologically possible.

862
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,920
Look
- Oh, wow.

863
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,680
Yes, that's your boy, alright.
- Okay, so he needs a little help.

864
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,070
Oh, let's give him some.

865
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,540
Set the mood.

866
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,686
I'm on it.
I know how to set the Mood.

867
00:59:09,687 --> 00:59:10,650

* Show her, show her how you roll *

870

* Drop it, drop it, drop it low *
* Drop it low, drop drop it, drop it low *

871
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,240
Wow, wow, wow!
What kind of mood is that?

872
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,040
Pedro, Pedro.
A little too aggressively.

873
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:25,920
I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I've got this one.

874
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,180
Follow my lead.

875
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,215

880
00:59:54,482 --> 00:59:58,205
* When I saw you face *

881
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,520
Wow, what a beautiful sunset.
- Yes.

882
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,000
Psst! Blu, down here.

883
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,000
Tell her, you have beautiful eyes.

884
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:11,501
That's good, great idea.

885
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,460
I have beautiful eyes.

886
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,550
Yeah, okay, sure, they are nice.

887
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,415
No! "her eyes," her eyes "!

888
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,860
Your eyes.

889
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,550
Your eyes are great, not mine.

890
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,560
I mean mine are okay but yours,
I bet you can see right through them.

891
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,760
Blu!

892
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,360
Just tell her how you feel.

893
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,620
Jewel.
- Yes?

894
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,885
I've been wanting to tell you, that I...

895
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,759
that I... hoook!

896
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,560
How sweet, you're getting choked up.

897
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,580
You're choking!

898
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,980
Okay! Alright!

899
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,960
Yap, that's my boy.

900
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Luiz's garage.

901
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,600
After you.

902
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,498
No, no, you first.
- Please, I insist

903
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,880
I guess this is it.

904
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,300
Yes, quite an adventure.

905
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,800
End of the line
- Ah, yes.

906
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,354
I guess things like these
don't happen in Tiny-sota.

907
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,550
Tiny-sota?

908
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,820
- Oh wait, Minnesota?
- Yes.

909
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,990
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

910
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,080
Luiz!

911
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,640
Are you here, Luiz?

912
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,870
Hey Buddy.

913
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,040
I got some friends
I want you to meet.

914
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,880
Inside-outside-inside-outside..!

915
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,440
I got you...good.

916
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,799
What?

917
01:02:07,915 --> 01:02:09,788
I could have rip your throats out.

918
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,000
But I didn't.

919
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,080
But I could have.

920
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:15,360
Hey Luiz!

921
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,140
Stop scaring my friends.

922
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,900
Hey Ralfi, come here!
Where have you been?

923
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,900
You look good.

924
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,960
Wait, wait.
Luiz is a bulldog?

925
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,960
You got something against dogs?

926
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,280
I do when they're drooling on me.

927
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,080
It's a medical condition.

928
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,560
No, amigo.
We really need you.

929
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,010
She's mean brother.

930
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,300
Luiz come on, please.
We need your help.

931
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,440
I think I know what to do.

932
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,180
Are you sure this is safe?
- Sure, there's nothing to it.

933
01:02:56,181 --> 01:02:59,509
Now if something goes wrong,
scream really loud.

934
01:02:59,515 --> 01:03:01,680
Because i can't hear
too good with this thing on.

935
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,890
Hey Ralfi!
Get the switch, please!

936
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,260
Don't worry.
It's a professional.

937
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,400
Try not to move. I can't really
see out of this thing either.

938
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,740
Hey, where'd you go?

939
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,460
Gross.

940
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,640
But I'm free.

941
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,760
Jewel, we are free!

942
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,160
Slimey, but free!

943
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,480
Contaminated probably, but free.

944
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,000
Can you believe it, finally.

945
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,600
Over.

946
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,800
Oh yes!

947
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,040
Come on guys, let's go!

948
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,600
What are we standing around for.
It's Carnival!

949
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,300
I know just how you feel.

950
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,630
Watching them up there,
makes you want to chase them,

951
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,400
grab them in your mouth
and bite their heads off.

952
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,640
I'm just kidding, bro.

953
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,000
Chasing them is plenty.

954
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,280
I'm flying, just like a bird.

955
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,140
Jewel, but you are a bird.

956
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,860
Hey, where are you going?

957
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,980
Blu?

958
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,660
Blu, What wrong?

959
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,340
Nothing.
Everything is perfect.

960
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,920
You be off to the rainforest.
I be back to Linda.

961
01:05:25,925 --> 01:05:27,540
Just like we planned.
- I...

962
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:30,510
Hey birds! Stop yapping
and start flapping.

963
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,860
Let's go!

964
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,500
I guess I thought maybe...
- What, that you'll come to Minnesota?

965
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,620
Great, I guess I make you a scarf.

966
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,180
No, that's not what I meant.

967
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:43,280
Look Jewel, I can't spend
my life walking around

968
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:44,980
following you wherever you're going.

969
01:05:44,985 --> 01:05:47,260
Hey, it's not my fault
you can't fly.

970
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,620
Awkward.

971
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,880
Okay, okay.

972
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,900
You know what?
This is good, just clear the air.

973
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,950
Just be completely honest
with each other.

974
01:05:56,955 --> 01:05:59,575
You want honesty!
Fine, I can be honest.

975
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,750
I don't belong here.

976
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,575
In fact, I never wanted to
come here in the first place.

977
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,720
And...and, you know what?

978
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,980
I hate to Samba!

979
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,500
Hey, that's a little too far.

980
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,600
Make the mean bird take it back.

981
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:19,340
Yes, I said it. Every song
sounds exactly the same.

982
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,820
Tiko-tako, yayaya,
Tiko-tako, yayaya. Urghhh.

983
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,280
I'm tiko-tako out of here.

984
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,880
Fine!
See you around Pet.

985
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:29,255
No, no, no, come back!

986
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:33,460
You belong together!
You're Juliet, Blu is Romeo.

987
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,220
Sure, they both die in the end
but you get my point!

988
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,160
Young love, always so melodramatic.

989
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,320
Alright boys, go after her.

990
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,395
Blu!

991
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,420
Come back here, come on!

992
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,223
I'm ready for Carnival!

993
01:06:50,224 --> 01:06:53,768
Who wants to ride on my...fruit?

994
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,220
They left without me.

995
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,860
I'm missed out.

996
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,740
Jewel! Jewel! Wait up!

997
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,550
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

998
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,220
Oh yes!

999
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,980
I was on my way to
crawl your eyes out!

1000
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:19,281
Jewel!

1001
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,540
Temper, temper.

1002
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,940
Now come along my dear,
we are going to the parade.

1003
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:29,400
Everybody loves the parade.

1004
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,440
Let go of me!

1005
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,680
Hey, get back here!

1006
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,695
Nobody messes with a friend of Pedro.

1007
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,925
Ain't happening! It's on! Come on!

1008
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,520
Did you see the talon on that guy?

1009
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:42,480
Talon?

1010
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,880
Maybe it's on, next time.

1011
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:47,381
Ralfi, help, help!

1012
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,940
Rafael, quit following me.

1013
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,060
You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnival that way?

1014
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,020
I'm not going to Carnival.

1015
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:03,020
No, I'm going home.
- But I thought you loved Carnival.

1016
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:05,960
I do, but I love my
family much more.

1017
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,380
And that's a choice I made
with this, and not with this.

1018
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,280
Blu! Blu! Hey Blu!
I was flying,

1019
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:16,030
then I saw this big cockatoo
with big ninja talon.

1020
01:08:16,031 --> 01:08:18,000
This cockatoo was ugly.
Anyway to the point.

1021
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,060
Then Jewel was there, and
he snatched Jewel up.

1022
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:23,340
Then he was like, "You coming
with me you little princess?"

1023
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,380
And Jewel was like, Pssh!, pssh!
"I'm no princess, leave me alone."

1024
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,951
And I was like, "hey!".
Then he was like "what!"

1025
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:29,650
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1026
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:30,820
He got Jewel.

1027
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,440
And he's taking Jewel to the parade.

1028
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,780
This is all my fault.

1029
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,840
Let's fly!

1030
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,440
Carnival, here we come!

1031
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,760
Hey dog, I'm flying back here.

1032
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,760
You'll get wet on this flight!

1033
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,800
Come on, come on, come on.
Where are these guys?

1034
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,700
Yes, nice.

1035
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,900
Very nice.

1036
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,620
Marcel!

1037
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,320
Marcel!

1038
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,860
Oh, boy.

1039
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,980
Bird, chicken.

1040
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,440
Come on Fernando, dance.

1041
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,960
Idiots.

1042
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,180
Excuse me!

1043
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,580
Coming through!

1044
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,900
Watch your feet.

1045
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,360
Oops, sorry.

1046
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,050
Go ahead. Come in.

1047
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,800
Wait, stop please.
Performers only.

1048
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,520
Tulio?

1049
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,520
Linda, I was just a...

1050
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,020
I look ridiculous, don't I?

1051
01:10:22,021 --> 01:10:23,020
(Lionel Richie - Say You Say Me)

1052
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:26,568
* Say you, say me *

1053
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:30,469
* Say it for always *

1054
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,070
* That's the way it should be *

1055
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,720
Sorry.

1056
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,960
The Parade!
It's about to start.

1057
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,780
Ok, one Witch.
Go ahead.

1058
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,660
Okay, just follow my lead.
Act naturally.

1059
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,720
Are you okay?

1060
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,840
Come on.

1061
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,300
Blu!

1062
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,260
Blu!

1063
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,460
Wait, no, no, no.
I'm looking for a blue bird.

1064
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,780
Birdo. What birdo?
Move it, move it...

1065
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,640
Wait, what are you doing?

1066
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,500
Tulio!

1067
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,560
Hey! Let me out!

1068
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,700
Tulio!

1069
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,360
This is not good.
This is not good.

1070
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,440
This is...

1071
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,380
Cheese and sprinkles.

1072
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,960
Okay, you can put me down now.
I think we are done here.

1073
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,380
I think they like my moves.

1074
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,600
Hey, keep dancing my boy.

1075
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,120
One down and one to go.

1076
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,075
You'll never find him.

1077
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,075
He's already gone.

1078
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,380
Oh, I don't need to find him.

1079
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,360
He'll find you.

1080
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,300
This is the spit!

1081
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,275
Yeah, baby.

1082
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,320
Now I can get my freak on.

1083
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,360
Luiz please, rescue first,
freak later.

1084
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,040
Come on.
Out of my way, people!

1085
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,740
All right guys,
I'll fly ahead to look for Jewel.

1086
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,860
Hello ladies.

1087
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,900
There's the big nose, hold up!

1088
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,340
What!

1089
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,260
Linda!

1090
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,380
Excuse me, excuse me.

1091
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,460
Linda!

1092
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,840
Linda!

1093
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,379
Speak English!

1094
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,900
Linda, you got to shake your dooche.

1095
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:19,000
No, I don't shake our dooche in Minnesota.

1096
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,520
Hot dog coming through.

1097
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,940
Blu!

1098
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,300
Tulio!

1099
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,800
Tulio! I saw Blu!
- What?

1100
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,000
Hold on Blu!
I'm coming for you!

1101
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,200
What a view.

1102
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,660
Blu!

1103
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,320
Blu!

1104
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,760
Linda.

1105
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,040
Linda?

1106
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,880
Blu we found her.
She's on some weird chicken float.

1107
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,960
Come on!

1108
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,620
Let's go get Jewel.

1109
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,380
Wait Blu!
Where are you going?

1110
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,600
- I saw Blu. he's riding on a Bulldog.
- What?

1111
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,800
There they are. That's the float.

1112
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,380
That float is a crime in itself.

1113
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,340
There he is!

1114
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,740
Hey Jewel.
- Blu?

1115
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,975
I'm gonna to get you out of here.
- No.

1116
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,880
No Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel is...

1117
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,080
Hello pretty bird.

1118
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,540
So kind of you to join our little charade.

1119
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,380
Oh come on.
You think I came alone.

1120
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,300
I got three of the roughest,
meanest, craziest birds

1121
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,951
in all of Rio right behind me.

1122
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,180
You know that guys, we're saved!

1123
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,560
I think he means us.

1124
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,500
Love, it's such a powerful
and stupid thing.

1125
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,920
Oh, yes.
Well done, Nigel.

1126
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,840
Out of the way.

1127
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,260
Sorry.

1128
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,720
Wait, wait!

1129
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,395
We actually made it!

1130
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,660
Hey Marcel, can we do it
again next year?

1131
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,770
Please, please.

1132
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,260
Right, next year too?

1133
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,540
Wait, come back!

1134
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,500
Get in!

1135
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,960
I don't know how I got up here,
but I'm never coming down!

1136
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,600
Come on, kid.

1137
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,860
I'm going to get you
guys out of here.

1138
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,135
What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

1139
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,775
You shouldn't have done that.

1140
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,860
Come on.

1141
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,680
Just forget him!
Get the birds!

1142
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,560
They're getting away!

1143
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,320
We'll see about that!

1144
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,200
Watch out!

1145
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:22,020
We did it boys!
Yes, we are the best.

1146
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,560
Is that a float?

1147
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,340
Look at the detail on that thing.

1148
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:29,520
Pull up you idiot, pull up!

1149
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,660
Blu!

1150
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,440
Blu!

1151
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,260
Oh Blu.

1152
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,140
Sorry Eva, I'm not going
to be home for dinner.

1153
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,780
What are you doing?

1154
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,180
I'm going to pop this
open like a soda can.

1155
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,560
Now that's pop it!

1156
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,780
Hurry, we got to help the others.

1157
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,780
I'm a pretty bird,
I'm a pretty bird.

1158
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,100
I'm a pretty bird,
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird!

1159
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,520
Come on!

1160
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:41,960
I'm out!

1161
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,840
Oh, the light!

1162
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,120
Go, go, go!

1163
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:07,780
Freedom!

1164
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,380
Come on, we need to get out!
- Wait, wait!

1165
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,740
It's okay.

1166
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
It's okay.

1167
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,660
We'll figure this out together.

1168
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,140
Right?

1169
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,460
Let him go!

1170
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,500
Jewel!

1171
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,780
My wing.

1172
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,540
Oh, pity.

1173
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,960
Now we have two
useless, flightless birds.

1174
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,750
Not cool man, not cool!

1175
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,580
We're going down!

1176
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,200
Okay.
Rock, paper, scissors, - chute!

1177
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,460
Hasta la vista, losers!

1178
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,660
Wait for us!

No!

1182
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:39,580
Blu, you're crazy!
What are you doing?

1183
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,200
I'm not going to let you go.

1184
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,580
We're chained to each other birds, remember?

1185
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,160
Wow.

1186
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:08,060
Blu, you're flying!
- Yes!

1187
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,880
I'm flying, I'm really flying!
You're right.

1188
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,960
I'm not an ostrich!
I'm not an ostrich!

1189
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,660

1192
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,000
Blu?

1193
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,020
It's Blu!
Look Tulio is Blu!

1194
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:54,420
And he's flying.
My Blu is flying.

1195
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,800
He's flying!

1196
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,560
Here, let me see.

1197
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,660

I'll take care of you.

1234
01:25:24,059 --> 01:25:27,678

1238
01:25:38,254 --> 01:25:41,681
* She's the one, she's the one, I'll say it loud *

1239
01:25:41,682 --> 01:25:45,220

1242
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:58,027
* That I've found the girl *

1243

1245
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,600
* To give all the heart *

1246
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:12,250
* A reason to fly *

1247
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,850
* The one I can live for *

1248
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:20,853
* A reason for life *

1249
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:51,057
