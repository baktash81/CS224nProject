You've ruined the nice light on my feet.

To school? Pinocchio?

536
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,250
Yes. Tomorrow.

You know, Papa, I like my old legs.
And I like them on fire.

544

Pinocchio, if you go to sleep,

545
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,583
I'll make you a new pair of legs
in the morning.

546
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,375
Just like the old ones?

547
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,166
[chuckles] Better than the old ones.

548
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,208
Better? Can I have cricket legs, Papa?
Can you make me four of them?

549
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,041
[chuckles] No, no, no, no. No, just two.

550

Two will do. [sighs]

He's no longer alive.

Is that a bad thing?

565
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:03,041
Yes. It's a great burden
for a father to lose a child so young.

00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,166
I get confused.

706
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,041
I don't think
I like school anymore, Sebastian.

707
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,458
Ah! We have found him!

708
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,291
Look, Spazzatura! Our miracle!

709
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,375
- Our sensation!
- [Pinocchio] Hey, watch it!

710
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,125
Our star!

711
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,708
Who? Me?

712
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,291
Yes, <i>mon étoile</i>!

713
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,625
I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen!

714
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,458
Come partake in
the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life

715
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:42,291
as the star of my puppet show!

716
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,000
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio!

717
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,791
You promised your papa
you would go to school! [gasps]

718
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:50,333
Oh, yeah.
I promised my papa I'd go to school.

719
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:53,250
See? He gave me Carlo's book.

720
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,791
Carlo's book? Yes! Yes!

721
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,208
A classical, canonical work.

722
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,666
I can see
you're intrinsically an intellectual!

723
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,166
But then now, book learning cannot compare
to witnessing the wide world

724
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,041
with one's own eyes
from atop the glorious stage.

725
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,000
- [Pinocchio] Wow.
- [Spazzatura screeches]

726
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,583
You shall see all
of the nations of the earth for yourself

727
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,333
as they bow at your feet.

728
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,416
My brand-new feet!

729
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,958
No! No, wait!

730
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,833
You have to go to school!

731
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:29,916
Oh, can we do it tomorrow?

732
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,375
Regretfully, no.

733
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,125
For today's the only day

734
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,625
that our cacophonous carnival
will visit your vicinity,

735
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,125
but if you must go to school,
then you must go to school.

736
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,250
Come, Spazzatura.

737
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,916
We must find someone else

738
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,541
to eat all our ice cream
and popcorn and hot chocolate.

739
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,000
- Hot chocolate?
- Oh no. [screams]

740
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,000
[Volpe] Yes, of course!

741
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,541
All the hot chocolate you can drink
and all the games you can play.

742
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,416
Oh boy, oh boy!

743
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,625
Maybe it'll be okay
if I'm a little bit late for school?

744
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,916
Yeah, perfectly fine.
No one will even notice.

745
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,250
Don't listen to him, Pinocchio! [screams]

746
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:10,500
Ah, we have
one last detail to take care of.

747
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:12,208
Whoa!

748
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,375

749
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,958

752
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,583
Perfect! I will now make you
burn bright like a star!

753
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,583
Follow me, my boy!

754

755

Oh, the pain.

756
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,291
Life is such hideous pain.

757
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:50,666
[Podesta] Master Geppetto,
would you mind coming down?

758
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, at last!

759
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,208
Our savior is restored.

Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

762
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,875
Your boy didn't show up at school today.

763
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,333
But he left this morning.
I... I sent him there.

764
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,291
Obviously, the puppet
is quite a dissident.

765
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,875
An independent thinker, I'd say.

766
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:40,000
- Uh, uh, uh, yes.
- You better look for him.

767
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:44,625
I trust we will see
the wooden boy tomorrow at school.

768
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,083
[splutters] Tomorrow?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

769

[carnival music playing]

770
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,833
Ah!

771
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,208
Boy, the carnival sure is grand.

772
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:59,208
How about some more popcorn?

773
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,250
[Pinocchio] Oh, I couldn't eat
another bite, Mr. Diavolo.

774

776
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,458
I better get going to school, I guess.

777
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,708
- Stay a while, Pinocchio.
- [Volpe laughs]

778
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:15,333
I am sorry to keep you waiting,
my little puppet.

779
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:19,083
[sighs]
I don't like being called a puppet.

780
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:22,958
My boy. Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit!</i>

781
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,333
The tops! Lift your arm.

782
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,375
Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

783
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,875
But I thought it was best
to be a normal boy.

784
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,625
Oh, no, no, no. People love puppets.

785
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,833
Like Il Diavolo, Columbina, Punchinello.

786
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:41,708
Of course, there's but one puppet
who is king of them all!

787
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,125
Oh boy, I'd like to meet that guy.

That's how he really feels.

I don't want to be a burden.

Oh, Pinocchio.

1035
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:19,750
Sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else.

1036
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,666
And they say things,

1037
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:25,166
things they only think they mean
in the moment.

1038
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,875
But with time, they learn that...

1039
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,625
well, that they
never really meant it at all.

1040
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,250

That way, I can help Papa,
and I won't go to war.

I'll leave him a note
explaining everything.

01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:03,000
Can... Can you tell me more?

1401
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:07,875
Please? No! No! No!

1402
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:13,916
[gasps]

1403
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,041
[Podesta] Aha!

1404
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:19,166
I knew it! You came back to life.

1405
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,625
Hi, Candlewick.

1406
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:27,458
Most of us, we have but one life
to give for our fatherland, but you...

1407
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,125
you have no limit!

1408
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,333
- Me?
- [Podesta] Yes!

1409
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:34,416
You!

1410
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:40,125
Follow my orders, learn to obey,
and you will be the perfect soldier.

1411
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:42,750
But, my papa...

1412
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,666
You'll return home a hero.

1413
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,000
Any father would be proud of such a son.

1414
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,125

- [soldier] We're here.

[whistle blows]

1420
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,875
[Pinocchio] Wow!

1421
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,416
What's all this?

1422
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,833
The Elite Military Project
for Special Patriotic Youth.

1423
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,958
- What's an elite?
- We are.

1424
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:39,875
[chuckles]
We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers!

1425
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:41,750
Learn? Like school?

1426
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:46,541
To... To read and write
and do the <i>mulplitication</i> thingies?

1427
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,625
[laughs]

1428
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:49,500
You're funny. [laughs]

1430
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:57,875
[Podesta] Listen up.

1431
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:01,500
They're reporting
hostile planes in the area.

1432
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:06,291
But <i>we</i> will carry on
with the exercises tomorrow.

1433
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,958
Anyone here afraid of the enemy?

1434
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,583
- Uh-huh!
- [boys] No, sir!

1435
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,291
Mm-mm.

1436
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,625
Good.

1437
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:20,208
You may be boys,
but you have the hearts of men.

1438
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,958
Tomorrow, you train
for the glory of Italy!

1439
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:30,750
Tomorrow, you will
make your fatherland proud.

1440
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,750
[sighs]

1441
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,166
[whispers] Pinocchio. Pinocchio.

1442
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:38,666
[Pinocchio] Yeah?

1443
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:41,500
What do you think
my father meant about those planes?

1444
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,041
I don't know.

1445
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:47,000
I still don't really understand
what we're even doing here.

1446
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:51,500
We're preparing to be soldiers. For war.

1447
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,416
But my papa said war is bad.

1448
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,250
That's 'cause he's a coward.

1449
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:59,000
A coward? My papa?

1450
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:01,083
Well, he's afraid of war, isn't he?

1451
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:04,583
My father says if you're afraid to die
for your country, you're weak.

1452
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:05,708
You're a coward.

1453
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:07,208
Are you afraid?

1454
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:08,375
I'm not afraid at all.

1455
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:11,333
Well, neither am I. Or my papa.

1456
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,375
- I love war.
- I love it more!

1457
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:16,916
I love it twenty-four seven,
every day and anytime!

1458
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,458
- So do I!
- Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

1459
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,583
I'll show him I'm no coward.

1460
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,333
I'll make him like me.

1461
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,833
You know,
all fathers love their sons, but...

1462
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:41,625
sometimes fathers feel despair,
like everyone else.

1463
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:45,208
And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

1464
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:51,500
But with time, they learn
they never really meant it at all.

1465
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:58,791
And they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward,

1466
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:00,583
but inside...

1467
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:03,708
they love you.

1468
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,166
Are you scared?

1469
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,500
Of dying?

1470
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,666
Me? Nah.

1471
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,250
I died a couple times.

1472
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,333
It was all right.

1473
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:22,666
There's rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand.

1474
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:24,708
Blue sand.

1475
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,000
[chuckles]

1476
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,333
You're so weird.

1477
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:29,708
No weirder than you, pal!

1478
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,041
[both laugh]

1479
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,166
I'm... I'm glad you're here.

1480
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,500
[sighs]

1481
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,583
Me too.

1482
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,125
[Podesta] And as with all great empires,

1483
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,625
the destiny of Italy will be forged

1484
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,666
in the strength of its youth.

1485
01:20:57,791 --> 01:21:02,083
Today, you'll get your first taste of war.

1486
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:04,791
You'll form two teams.

1487
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:08,958
In the center of the battlefield
is a tower.

1488
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:16,000
The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins.

1489
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,791
And remember,

1490
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,083
no matter who is on the other team,

1491
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:23,250
they are your enemy.

1492
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,708
May the best man win

1493
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:31,208
and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all.

1494
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,666
[adventurous music playing]

1495
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,750
Rifles are loaded with paint.

1496
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:39,791
And the grenades, confetti.

1497
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,875

1518
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,333
Faster! Follow me!

You're both here. Why?

[pants] We both won, Father!

1537

Oh. Is that so?

1538
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:13,583
And how did you come
to that conclusion, may I ask?

1539
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,166
It was a tie.

1540
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,166
We both climbed up fast.

1541
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:20,791
Very good, then.

[soldier 2] We are under attack!

I told you to shoot the puppet!

1558

All my life, Father,
just trying to please you.

But I never will!

1563
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:19,375
You were right.

1564
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:23,791
I'm thin and weak and flimsy,
just like the wick of a candle.

1565
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:24,875
Always afraid.

1566
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:29,208
But even then, with all the fear I feel,
I can say no to you.

1567
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,250
- [gun rattles]
- I can do that.

1568
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,750
I'm not afraid to say no. Are you?

01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:37,125

and make Pinocchio a good boy,

1881
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:50,625
guide him into doing what is right,
you would concede me one wish.

1882

1883
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:56,375
And did you accomplish this task?

1884
01:43:56,458 --> 01:43:59,625
Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great.

1885
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:01,958
Maybe I messed up a little or... a lot,

1886
01:44:02,041 --> 01:44:06,916
but, well, I tried my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.

1887
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,458
Pinocchio taught me that.

1888
01:44:09,125 --> 01:44:12,333
I mean, I taught it to him,
and then he taught it straight back at me.

1889
01:44:12,416 --> 01:44:13,833
And you know why? Because...

1890
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,833
Because he was good.

and wander the earth.

1902
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:57,375
Be his son.

I was trying
to make you someone you were not.

1909
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:33,708
So don't be Carlo or anyone else.

1910
01:45:33,791 --> 01:45:36,375
Be exactly who you are.

And you will be my papa.
