What are you doing?

00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,835
One-step, Sensei.

40
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:51,922
This isn't  Bruce Lee's Jeet kune Do,
it's karate!

41
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,199
Now get with the program ok!

42
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,420
Yes, Sensei.

00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,480
Everyone, continue!

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,304

00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,610
Dismissed.

46
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,701
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,300
Did you think over our proposal,
Mr. Stillwell?

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,402
Yes I did.

49
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,173
And I'm sorry that you came
all the way from New York...

50
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,950
for nothing.

51
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,652
Now I don't want to waste
any more time.

52
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,832
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

53
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:08,915
I must decline your offer.

54
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,952
If money is the problem,
things can be worked out.

55
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,756
That's not it.
I won't join...

56
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,964
your organization.

57
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,477
My superiors will be quite insulted.

58
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,977
I understood
I had a choice in the matter.

59
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,477
Are you that naive,
Mr. Stillwell.

60
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,694
Now you've forced my hand.
An example must be made.

61
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,782
You See?

62
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,953
That doesn't solve anything!

63
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,357
Perhaps it will proove instructive
for others with the same ideas.

64
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,149
I will not fight!

65
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,726
So be it.

66
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:03,236
Karate is not to be used aggressively,
but if I have no other choice.

67
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,454
Ow God!

68
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,618
Dad!

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,808
You bastards!

70
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,332
We'll be back with the contract,
Mr. Stillwell.

71
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,350
Until then, get some rest.

72
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,564
Jason!

73
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:17,264
Jason!

74
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,289
Jason!

75
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,776
Dad, are you okay?
I think my leg is broken.

76
00:06:24,276 --> 00:06:25,790
We'll get them,
we'll make them pay!

77
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,487
No, Jason!

78
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,225
It's over!

79
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,304
Fighting them is not the answer.

80
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:36,960
What is the answer?

81
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,133
That killerâ€¦

82
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,614
it was Krashinski,
the Russian.

83
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,253
They want all the major dojos
as fronts for organized crime.

84
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,907
I know they'll be back.

85
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:07,160
What should I do?
I can't lose my family.

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,766
There's nothing else to do but... leave.

87
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,949
This is it ladies and gentlemen!
The last stop.

88
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:45,319
Yes ma'am!

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,363
Here you go, sir!
Let me help you with that.

90
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,447
That's it! Alright.

91
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,670
Jason, quit screwing around
and get to work.

92
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,628
Jason, come here
and help me with these please.

93
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:09,192
Okay!

94
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:13,318
- I'll get these.
- Get the big ones.
- Okay!

95
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,254
Great!

96
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,149
Yes!

97
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,471
Yes!
Check me out, dude.

98
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,093
Looking good.

99
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:47,810
- Hey nice moves!
- Hey Thanks!

100
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,310
- My name's R.J. how're you doin'?
- Hi Jason.

101
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,810
What's R.J. stand for?
Rafer Jefferson Madison the Third.

102
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,194
- Wow, no wonder you use R.J.
- Yeah.

103
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,596
You moving in?
No, we just came for the weekend!

104
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,492
We travel light.

105
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:08,735
That's good. I was afraid the
property values were going down.

106
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,104
I tell my dad not to worry.

107
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,306
Uh, can I give you a hand
with any of this?

108
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,271
Yeah sure!
we can always use some help.

109
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:17,367
- Don't expect to get paid much, though.
- No sweat.

110
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,851
I'll just have my accountant bill you.

111
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:26,486
Hey dude, remind me next time
not lend out my services so fast.
Alright!

112
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:33,660
Bruce Lee freak!
Just what Kingswood needs. Why me?

113
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:37,900
Yes!

114
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,211
Yo, Jace, check me out!

00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,273

00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:56,950
Again!
Woah!

120
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,958

00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:09,429

Hey, ain't no shelf made to mess

About three years.

Oh then you must be pretty good huh?

141
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,202
I've got some friends who've been doing it
for about two years...

142
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,202
and one is even a second degree black belt!

143
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,208
- I'm not a black belt yet.
- What are you in,
a special slow learners program, or what?

144
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,521
No.

145
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,837
But, some day I'm going
to be just like him.

146
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,348
Hey I hear he's buried in Seattle!

00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:44,438
Yeah.

179
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:50,690
No problem.
Stick with me kids, you'll never go hungry!

180
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,174
What's the matter Scott?

181
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:16,583
It's that slime ball, R.J.

182
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:19,480
Hey, Scott.
Why do you hate that kid so much?

183
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,790
I've got my reasons!
Come here!

184
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,762
Just keep him from going anywhere.
That's all I ask!

185
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,301
Alright.

186
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,944
Well Peewee.

187
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:50,250
Looks like you don't have anywhere else to run!
Do you?

188
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,855
Yeah,
it does look that way.

189
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,390
Get him.

190
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,569
You're scared, punk?

191
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,675
You better be,
cause you got no where else to run!

192
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,929
- Jace!
- Hey, R.J.

193
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,531
Who's the lard ass?

194
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,632
Beat it Brucie!

195
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,674
Go home and play with your wooden dolly!

196
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,674
Take a walk fat boy.

197
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:47,174
You stay out of this or you're gonna get hurt!

198
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,476
That's between him and me!

199
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,512
Get 'em!

200
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,648
No retreat, no surrender.

201
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,450
Break it up!
Break it up!

202
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,856
You better be glad that he came along, Brucie!
Next time I'm going to kill you!

203
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,807
I told you not to fight!

204
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,400
I didn't do it for fun!
I did it for a friend.

205
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,876
That's not an excuse.

206
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,512
What excuse would be good?

207
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,580
Jason, fighting is for punks!

208
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,750
Dad I was helping a friend!
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

209
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:34,289
Fighting is wrong!
It's just gonna get you in more trouble.

210
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,289
It got me out of trouble today!

211
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,949
Sure, trouble you
would have never been in before.

212
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,581
- Dad, you never listen to me!
- I've heard all before Jason!

213
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:43,489
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

214
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,766
Watch your tone of voice
with me young man!

215
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:49,266
It's not my tone of voice Dad!
It's the fact that I don't agree with you, isn't it?

216
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:54,766
Just because I don't agree doesn't mean I'm wrong!
In this house, what I say counts.

217
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:57,344
Are you trying to raise a son or a clone!

218
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,446
I don't know what I've raised!

219
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:00,280
What?

220
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,414
Go to your room!

221
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,617
And you oughtta be ashamed of yourself,
for fighting like some common street punk.

222
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,352
But...

223
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,420
No buts!
Go to your room!

224
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,455
- I'm not a child!
- Oh Adults fighting in the streets?
- I am...

225
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:13,455
Go to your room!

226
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,440
Hey Jace,
check this out!

227
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,602
Ian, congratulations.
Absolutely great match, you were fantastic.

228
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:46,602
"Well Bob, I have fought well,
this national championship is something
I've been training for quite sometime"

229
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:51,602
Well you certainly you deserve it Ian,
and I want you to know we wish You
good luck in the future.

230
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,195
Seattle should be proud of you - great fighter,
Ian Reilly

231
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:55,638
Thank you, thank you very much.

232
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:57,786
You know,
that guy's place is around here.

233
00:24:58,286 --> 00:24:59,232
Yeah, you know where?

234
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,101
Sure, I go by there all the time.

235
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:04,187
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, you bet. We could check it out.

236
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:05,605
- Tomorrow?
- Okay!

237
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,815
Look at these trophies!

238
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,485
Come on, let's go inside!

239
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:32,399
- Hi, can I help you?
- Yeah, I was thinking about joining.

240
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:33,833
What do I do?

241
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,968
- You want to sit down?
- Sure.

242
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,804
All you have to do
is fill these applications out for me

243
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,472
and I'll let you speak with the Sensei.

244
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:40,507
Oh uh, Just him, not me.

245
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:41,410
Alright.

246
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,842
- Thanks.
- Your Welcome.

247
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,613
Hey Yo! Do you need help spelling your name? ha ha

248
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,200
- Finished?
- Yeah.

249
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,934
Huh, Jason Stillwell.
Where'd you study in Los Angeles?

250
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,804
Uh, Sherman Oaks Karate.

251
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:00,481
Did you bring your gear?
Yeah, all set.

252
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:01,592
Good, because we have a class
starting in a few minutes.

253
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:04,798
That way you could take the class,
give it a try, and make a decision.

254
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:06,466
- Sounds fair.
- Alright this way.

255
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,969
- That's Him!
- Yeah That's Sensei.

256
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,275
He just took first at the nationals.

257
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,745
- Yes, I saw it on tv.
- That's why he's not doing this.
That's why I am.

258
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,914
- I'm Dean Ramsey, assistant instructor.
. Hi.

259
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,749
Follow me,
I'll show you the locker rooms.

260
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:33,960
Here's the lockers, just go change into your Gi.
Class starts in about 10 minutes.

261
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,696
That way you know
you can get some warm up before that.

262
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,465
- Okay, thanks.
- Alright.

263
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
Not bad!

264
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Not bad at all!

265
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,927
Yeah, this is a nice dojo.

266
00:26:59,427 --> 00:26:59,863
I'll probably join.

267
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:03,656
I told you,
R.J. always knows where to go.

268
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:10,697
Excuse me, Dean?
Can we talk?

269
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,432
Sure Scott, What's up?

270
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:16,369
Who was that guy?
A new student, why?

271
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:20,340
Did he say he was from L.A.?
Yeah, So what?

272
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:24,944
I had a run-in with that guy.
He did this.

273
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,381
And this.
And that.

274
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,817
What'd you fight about?

275
00:27:31,772 --> 00:27:33,272
Oh, well, um he was...

276
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:36,772
talking how bad Seattle Karate his.

277
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,159
Yeah.

278
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,924
- What?
- Yeah, he putting Seattle Karate down in a big way.

279
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,767
And talking about how wonderful
Los Angeles Karate is.

280
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,392
Then he started, uh...

281
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:53,111
pushing me around and stuff.
- And then the fight started?

282
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:54,379
Yeah.

283
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:59,946
I didn't want to fight,
but you know, what was I supposed to do?

284
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,718
He's pretty good, but he ... fights dirty.

285
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,556
Frank!

286
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,391
Come here.

287
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,547
- Feel like a little kumite?
- Sure, I'm always ready to fight.

288
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:17,510
Good.
There's a good fighter here from L.A.

289
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,581
He wants to fight our best people.

290
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,189
You're our best.

291
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:26,641
Remember though, he's good.
If you relax at all, he'll eat you up.

292
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:27,968
Eat me up?

293
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,887
Don't worry, I'm nobody's lunch!

294
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:36,216
Alright let's bring it in!
Form a circle by the ring right now!

295
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,614
Down!

296
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:54,234
Hey you better get out there
they're waiting for you!

297
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,950
Class, we have with us today
a distinguished visitor who just arrived from L.A.

298
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,818
Hey!

299
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:14,888
And here he wants to see
what Seattle Karate is about.

300
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:19,125
So I thought we might give him
a taste of it.

301
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,954
- Look I don't
- No excuse here Mister,

302
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:25,148
you're in the ring,
let's see what you're made of!

303
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:26,648
Frank Up.

304
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:28,913
To the line.

305
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:30,262
To the line.

306
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,026
Class back!

307
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:38,578
Bow to me.
Bow to each other.

308
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,117
Fighting stances.

309
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:13,313
Get up!

310
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,810
Come on.
Get up.

311
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:34,334
So, this is L.A. Karate?

312
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:52,752
Fight!

313
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,252
But Dean...

314
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:55,588
Why are you afraid of?
Fight!

315
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,836
No Jace Stop!

316
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,800
Later, bro.

317
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:28,121
L.A. Karate!
I'm impressed!

318
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,799
- You guys having fun?
- Yeah we're having a great time.

319
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,799
- Kelly? Hi Happy birthday!
- Oh Thank you!
Oh Your Welcome.

320
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:49,209
- Oh I Hope you guys have a good time!
- Oh the party is terrific, it's beautiful.

321
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,114
I'll tell you guys,
tonight's the night.

322
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:59,786
After this party,
Kelly is gonna be putty in my arms.

323
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:04,958
Hey Jason!

324
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,964
Let me check you out!
Yeah don't we look cute. Here let me fix your...

325
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,632
Don't be messing my hair.

326
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:15,335
She must be pretty special huh?
You better believe it.

327
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,137
Alright!
Tidal Ball Woo!

328
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,598
Alright!
Who peed in the pool?

329
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,419
Hi, Kelly.
Are you having a good time?

330
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,821
I sure I am.
It's gonna be a great party.

331
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,357
Bitchin I think it'll be awesome.

332
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,893
Can't you talk like a human being Dean?

333
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:45,665
Kelly, don't fight it,
it is bigger than the both of us.

334
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,968
The only thing bigger than the both of us
is your ego.

335
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:52,380
I'm not interested,
go find some other girl to pest.

336
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:55,942
- You're the only one I want to pest.
- Give me a break!

337
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,210
Kelly.

338
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:03,583
Kelly!
Happy birthday!

339
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:09,189
How's my little sister?
You know I think I missed you most of all?

340
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,824
I missed you too!

341
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:15,355
I brought this for you!
And this trophy too!
For your room okay?

342
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:16,655
Thanks Ian

343
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,873
- Think of the stories.
- Congratulations Ian!

344
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,663
- How's it going guys?
- Sensei.

345
00:33:23,236 --> 00:33:26,172
Boy, everything went great.
Any problems while I was gone?

346
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:28,054
Nothing I couldn't handle.

347
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:30,554
Boys do I got some stories

348

362
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,601
You made such a fuss over
at the pet store the other day,
I just had to get it.

363
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,403
He's perfect.

364
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:07,540
- It is a he isn't it?
- I don't know, I didn't look! But I think so.

365
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,440
You're so adorable,
I'm gonna love you to death.

366
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:17,350
Thank You, Jason.

367
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,350
How did you get in here?

368
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:56,122
That's not important.
What is Important is that we are here.

369
00:35:56,756 --> 00:36:00,694
I told you in Reno I wasn't interested.
I run my own show.

370
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:03,196
Frankly, Mr. Reilly.

371
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,899
It isn't acceptable.
You must join us.

372
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,836
If you'll Excuse me,
I have a party to attend.

373

Oh Yes, sister Kelly's party.

374
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:18,513
Please, give her our love.

375
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:20,566
How did you know?

376
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:25,285
- I'd hate to see anything happen to her.
- Enough.

377
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:29,389
We don't want any violence Ian.

378
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:35,595

We met last summer.

382
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:04,729
- Jason, they are Cindy, Lonnie and Sharon.
Girls this is Jason.

383
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:07,670
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

384
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:16,369
- Hi Kelly, how's my girl?
- What do you think you're doing?

385
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:21,241
- Well well, look at what the cat drug in.
- Dean Ramsey, this is Jason...

386
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:28,281
- Yeah I Know, we've met.
- We're old pals, aren't we Jason?
How's it going buddy?

387
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:34,422
- What are you guys...
- Kelly, Kelly come open your presents!
Come on girls.

388
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:40,260
- Stay out of the way punk! She's mine.
- I don't see no ring did I?

389
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:44,665
Are you sick? Her brother is my Sensei.
She's spoken for! By Me!

390
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:48,044
- Nobody wants you here.
- We'll see about that.

391
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:49,671
And, uh, this guy was
walking past and knocked.

392
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:53,171
The drink right out of my hand.
I was brave.

393
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:59,412
Is it raining or what?
Oh man they're almost outta cake come on.

394
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:14,961
- Just back off Dean!
- Get out of my face!

395
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:29,376
I told you not to stay.

396
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,390
Calm down, we were just having fun!

397
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,592
Stop it Dean!
Don't hurt him!

398
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:49,295
Hear that punk?
She knows who's the best!

399
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,998
No! Stop it!

400
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,535
Get out of here!

401
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:01,817
Jason!

402
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:05,779
Jason wait for me!

403
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:10,116
- Jason! Listen to me, I'm sorry, I had no idea!
- Yeah right!

404
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:11,685
Do you Think I had something to do...

405
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:12,819
What am I supposed to think?

406
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:13,887
I didn't know anything.

407
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,355
Oh give it a rest Kelly.

408
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,627
Jason don't do this!

409
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,170
Stop it Dean!
Don't hurt him!

410
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:47,554
Hear that punk!?
She knows who's the best!

411
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:07,807
They're out to get me!
I don't know why, I can't handle it!

412
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:13,146
I can't seem to get anything right,
I try, but everything's going wrong!

413
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:18,218
I tried to be like you...

414
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,654
I can't do it!
I need help!

415
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:26,260
Sensei Lee, you have to help me!

416
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:38,238
Sensei Lee, I've got no place else to go!

417
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:42,475
No one but you.

418
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,680
No one but you.

419
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:15,876
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

420
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:20,847
- I asked where you were!
- And I told you, didn't I?

421
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:25,285
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
- Suit yourself, I'll pretend I didn't say it.

422
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,153
- You've been fighting again!
- So what?

423
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,323
You know how I feel about fighting!

424
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:34,522
Yeah, I did.
You're scared to death of it.

425
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,666
Is that what you really think?

426
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:44,337
Maybe if you made a stand!
Instead of running away!

427
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:49,676
If you've been anything but a coward!

428
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:59,819
That's it!
From now on the garage is off limits!
and I don't want you going near it.

429
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:04,157
- You can't do that!
- Can't I? I think you're forgetting whose house this is!

430
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:05,959
It's my house too!

431
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,163
We'll call it your house
when you start paying the rent, ok!

432
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:15,869
- Until then, you do as I say, clear?
- Just Leave me alone!

433
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,185
Useless thug!

434
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,530
Dad!
What are you doing?

435
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,598
- What should have been done long ago.
- Let's go inside and talk, Dad. Please.

436
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:48,702
There's no more to say,
now just get out of the way.

437
00:42:50,337 --> 00:42:53,640
Don't do this!
No.

438
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,359
R.J.

439
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:18,782
R.J.

440
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:22,848
R.J.!

441
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:25,572
What the?

442
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,092
Jace! What happened to you?

443
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,777
Dad trashed out the garage,
everything's in the driveway.

444
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,647
- Wow. What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

445
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:36,516
You got any ideas?

446
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:42,415
Yeah. I know of an empty house near here.
We can take the stuff there if you'd like.

447
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:48,561
- Okay, but how are we going to get it there?
- Don't worry, R.J. will provide! you just wait here.

448
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:42,007
That's the last of it.

449
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:57,793
Hey, let's hurry up and get this set up quickly.
My old man is gonna be pissed.

450
00:44:58,293 --> 00:45:00,271
You go ahead R.J.
I'm gonna stick around here for a while.

451
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:01,793
I thought you were staying at my house tonight.

452
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:05,438
If I don't get home soon,
my old man's not only gonna be pissed, he'll call the cops.

453
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:06,840
I know what you mean.

454
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:11,411
- So, you go on and I'll catch you later.
- Sounds good to me.

455
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:13,374
- Hey, R.J.
- Yo.

456
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:16,047
Thanks. I mean...

457
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:21,221
- I Hope you don't get into any trouble.
- Don't worry about me, I can handle.

458
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:23,923
No retreat.
No surrender.

459
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,894
R.J.
Later!

460
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:19,086
Who's there?
R.J. is that you?

461
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,143
You know, you asked me to come.

462
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,728
I asked you?

463
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:46,599
Sensei Lee?

464
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:50,937
- Lee Da Ge you call me. Shall we begin?
- Begin?

465
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:55,342
- Begin What?
- Your training. You asked me to help.

466
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:59,112
- I'm ready! I've studied alone.
- And!

467
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:05,153
- And I haven't been the best of students.
- I know you can do better.

468
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:07,587
Utilize what's up here...

469
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:11,299
as your way.
That's how you win.

470
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,594
Come over here.

471
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:20,989
This.

472
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:32,579
It's your beginning.
You must to be like the sword.

473
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:35,782
We call it martial arts.

474
00:48:35,982 --> 00:48:40,332
The character "wu" is made up of "qua",
which means violence or force.

475
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:43,385
Plus this character ji, meaning stop.

476
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:46,393
We practice how to stop violence.

477
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:51,529
What you learn from me
is for defense only and should not be misused.

478
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,200
That's the idea.

479
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:59,500
It is your move,
you don't want to listen then, bye.

480
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:04,144
I don't wish revenge.
I only want to learn!

481
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,714
You empty! The cup first!

482
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:10,550
Pardon?

483
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:23,163
This cup as you,
represents your knowledge.

484
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,198
This cup is what I offer.

485
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:27,015
The cup of my knowledge...

486
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:29,453
is more than your cup holds.

487
00:49:29,953 --> 00:49:32,953
No, Lee Da Ge!

488
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,845
Then, the cup now is clean,
you understand?

489
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:40,213
Yes.

490
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:48,121
Hao, get in a stance.

491
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:53,893
Punch and power punch.

492
00:49:57,011 --> 00:50:00,019
No.
This hand, no power.

493
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:04,437
Now, hit here!

494
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:13,546
Stand up!

495
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,485
What was the mistake?

496
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,890
Punch wasn't fast enough?
Easy to defend against?

497
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:27,337
Are you asking or telling me?

498
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:28,561
Now say that to me again!

499
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:31,264
Not fast enough!
Easy to defend against.

500
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:34,934
Hao. Show me where to improve it!

501
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:36,736
Show you?

502
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:41,508
Listen to the warrior inside!

503
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,744
Move and I'll counter.

504
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:50,817
Think of your technique.

505
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:53,820
A Strike!

506
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:58,882
Now my technique is a long move.

507
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,363
See which is first.

508
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:06,707
Again.

509
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,172
Hao.

510
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:15,642
Know why you've been getting hit?

511
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:17,911
No, Lee Da Ge.

512
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:24,884
You lead with the shoulder.
And when your shoulder moves, I see it!

513
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:27,687
You'd be quick and direct!

514
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,900
Utilizing "chi".

515
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,461
The result is power.

516
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,535
"Chi"... Power.

517
00:51:42,702 --> 00:51:45,705
Never can succeed without a surprise.

518
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,441
Your training begins tomorrow.

519
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,174
What's wrong?

520
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,310
I'm not sure Lee Da Ge.

521
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,146
Think of what you are doing.

522
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:05,685
And If you want to improve yourself,
you must concentrate!

523
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:08,722
That's your strength.

524
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:14,761
I just don't feel natural.

525
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:24,137
Now, was that natural enough for you?

526
00:53:24,637 --> 00:53:25,338
Sure.

527
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:29,676
That's because you didn't think about it,
you just reacted.

528
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,879
From now on, be spontaneous.

529
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:36,349
Now, come on.

530
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:48,261
Handling multiple strikes requires timing.

531
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:50,296
Are you ready?

532
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:08,948
Now why are you being hit?
I don't know, but I'm standing here...

533
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:12,542
Lee Da Ge.

534
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:20,253
All these sand bags are your adversaries.
Stay in the center!

535
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:22,526
How.

536
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:25,258
Ready?

537
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:44,394
To fight effectively,
you must empty all yourself.

538
00:55:44,894 --> 00:55:46,066
Your eyes...

539
00:55:46,566 --> 00:55:49,078
must see, in all directions.

540
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,276
Your ears...

541
00:55:51,776 --> 00:55:54,734
shall be aware of all sounds.

542
00:55:55,302 --> 00:56:00,181
And you must learn to feel every movement
before it occurs.

543
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,640
And be ready to react!
Try again!

544
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,290
How's that Lee Da Ge?

545
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,959
Thanks to you.

546
00:56:50,877 --> 00:56:53,279
Is that right Lee Da Ge?

547
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,095
Hey, are you crazy?

548
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,811
Faster!

549
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:31,733
C'mon Jace, man, it's gotta
be faster than that.

550
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:33,420
C'mon, keep moving.

551
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,855
Let's go.

552
00:57:36,523 --> 00:57:38,580
Faster!

553
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:43,663
Kick me!

554
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,539
What now?

555
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:59,713
This time I'll kick you!

556
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:21,134
You weren't ready.
Unexpected moves are hard to counter.

557
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,304
So they present worse danger.

558
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,897
Pretend my arms trapped this leg.

559
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:33,657
That's your adversary.

560
00:58:34,157 --> 00:58:35,505
Kick.

561
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:29,769
- Hey! Get me another beer! Hurry it up!
- Coming right up.

562
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:42,449
No, no, no.
Bring it over here.

563
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:56,290
Come on!

564
00:59:56,529 --> 00:59:58,631
Come on!

565
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:05,165
What took you? boy?
I'm sorry it took so long...

566
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:09,242
What's this I hear you used to teach karate?

567
01:00:10,176 --> 01:00:11,144
Look, I don't want any trouble.

568
01:00:11,344 --> 01:00:12,947
Then answer my question.

569
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,449
What are you, a black belt?

570
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:22,355
No, no I'm not. Now look,
I gotta get back, so.

571
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:29,562
You'll go when I say you can go, karate man!
And no sooner, got that?
yes sir, yes sir.

572
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:37,504
Clean yourself up, You're a mess.

573
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:42,509
That's a good boy.

574
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:49,449
Get back here.
Hey! Get back here.

575
01:00:57,323 --> 01:00:58,925
Don't you ever come back!

576
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:01,227
I'm gonna be back, and I'll get you!

577
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:12,105
Kick it.

578
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:14,441
I'll never be able to hit it

579
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:20,313
If you think that it is impossible,
you won't hit it.

580
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:27,387
Set the images all in your head,
then believe them.

581
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:30,790
And know it can't be stopped.

582
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:39,366
Lee Da Ge, I did it!

583
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,413
Lee Da Ge where are you?

584
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,525
I did it.

585
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:10,124
I did it.

586
01:03:40,587 --> 01:03:42,122
Hey R.J. what's our time?

587
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:54,667
Man... something must be wrong with this watch!

588
01:03:55,468 --> 01:03:59,305
Come on, let's get going!
Yeah, right...

589
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:45,518
Oh Look at the time! Your dad's getting off work now
and I was supposed to be there.

590
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:47,687
- Do you want me to pick him up mom?
- Would you?

591
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:49,789
- Yeah Sure.
- That would give me  time to make dinner!
Ok.

592
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:51,458
Think you can handle it?

593
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:55,428
I'll struggle along without you.

594
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,707
Karate man, we're going to teach you some manners!

595
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:43,677
Ok ok, it won't happen again!

596
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,613
Oh no.
It is too late for that!

597
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:58,425
You will never mess with me again!

598
01:06:47,107 --> 01:06:48,508
Get outta here!

599
01:06:54,715 --> 01:06:56,216
Dad, are you okay?

600
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:59,519
- Yeah I...
- Dad, there are times when you have to fight!

601
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:02,347
I'm very proud of you, son.

602
01:07:02,847 --> 01:07:04,324
I've been such a fool!
I...

603
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:06,793
I haven't exactly helped.

604
01:07:08,595 --> 01:07:11,297
Let's go home, mom's making dinner.
She's waiting.

605
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:39,659
Let's go homeboy!

606
01:07:39,993 --> 01:07:41,327
Let's do it.

607
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,550
Look, there's Kelly!

608
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,280
Hey what's with you man?
There's your lady, and you wanna stand here with me?

609
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:17,697
I don't want to talk to her!

610
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:14,788
Alright.
Everybody get up and dance!

611
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:37,430
Come on, let's dance!

612
01:09:40,947 --> 01:09:43,550
Would you like to dance?
No, thanks.

613
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:50,557
Come On!
Ok.

614
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:21,688
- May I have this dance?
- I thought you'd never ask.

615
01:10:31,965 --> 01:10:33,834
I'm sorry about that day,
I was a real jerk.

616
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:35,538
Go on.

617
01:10:36,038 --> 01:10:38,038
Well, wait a minute. You're supposed
to stop me and say, "No you weren't".

618
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:39,509
But you were a jerk.

619
01:10:40,607 --> 01:10:45,512
- Yeah I was, wasn't I.
- Come on, it's all in the past let's just forget about it, okay?

620
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,480
Sounds good to me.

621
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,742
- Is everything set?
- Yes, sir.

622
01:11:49,409 --> 01:11:52,112
They jumped at the chance
to settle this with a team fight.

623
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:55,482
- He wants a piece of us badly.
- Fine. Fine.

624
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:25,727
Good evening, sir.

625
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:27,800
Thank you.

626
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:33,288
Our ad will be in every paper,
both morning and evening editions.

627
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:35,990
Representatives from print and
T.V. will be there

628
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:40,193
and two local radio stations
will be covering it live.

629
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:43,490
I hear Mr. Reilly
and his team are training very hard.

630
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,080
Will there be any problems?

631
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,537
Don't worry.
Everything is under control.

632
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:49,977
Seattle is already yours.

633
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:51,261
They will lose.

634
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:53,440
Very good. Very good.

635
01:13:43,031 --> 01:13:46,637
- That was so fun the other night.
- I Know, we should all do it again.

636
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:02,794
- Are you guys ready?

- Good! Cause the fun's about to begin.

638
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:15,691
Warm up well, guys.
We gotta look good tonight.

639
01:14:15,922 --> 01:14:18,358
Don't worry man, we always look good.

640
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:24,631
Yeah,
But just remember if all else fails,
you got the big man to fall back on.

641
01:14:34,774 --> 01:14:37,811
That's it. Everything is set.

642
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:58,549
Ladies and gentlemen.

643
01:14:59,049 --> 01:15:02,750

01:20:38,302 --> 01:20:39,439
Well, Jason, don't worry.
We can take him.

686
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:41,372
No I mean it I've seen this guy fight.

687
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:43,376
- Yeah, and you've seen us fight, too, bud.

688
01:20:44,711 --> 01:20:49,215
Relax he's cake.
Sit back and enjoy the show.

689
01:20:49,816 --> 01:20:52,218
Good luck.

690
01:21:02,328 --> 01:21:03,963
Let the destruction begin.

691
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,175
Would you come in the ring please.

692
01:21:13,175 --> 01:21:14,675
You can do it!

693
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:16,436
Knock him out Dean.

694
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,741
Gentlemen, just obey my commands.

695
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:22,479
When I ask you to break,

696
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,352
I want you to break clean and fast.

697
01:21:25,652 --> 01:21:29,456
In event of a knock-down,
I want you to go immediately to a neutral corner

698
01:21:29,589 --> 01:21:33,493
and stay there until I tell you to come out.
Do You understand?

699
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:37,630
Fight!

700
01:22:10,663 --> 01:22:13,800
One, two, three!

701
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,171
Four, five, six, seven...

702
01:22:18,671 --> 01:22:19,671
Get him Dean!

703
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:31,184
Fight's over!

704

707
01:23:04,784 --> 01:23:06,646

Are you ready?

710
01:23:08,855 --> 01:23:09,689

Go!

719
01:24:31,304 --> 01:24:33,406
I'm the best!
I'm The best!

720
01:24:42,882 --> 01:24:48,455
Since we already won both fights,
we gonna make this thing a little more interesting.

721
01:24:49,856 --> 01:24:52,580
The next bout will be winner takes all.

722
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,163
If Reilly wins... Seattle wins!

723
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:09,810
Alright look fellas,
you both know all the rules.

724
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,712
I want a good, clean fight...

725
01:25:12,879 --> 01:25:19,850
You heard this before, yes?
You need? Then we fight!

726
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:37,497
Break it! Break it! I said Break it up!
Get back in your corner!

727
01:26:46,773 --> 01:26:50,927
What are you doing?
Get him! Kill him!

728
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:54,230
Alright.
No problem man. No problem.

729
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:56,376
You got him right where you want him.

730
01:27:11,798 --> 01:27:13,133
Let's go.

731
01:27:15,535 --> 01:27:16,876
Come on, do it Ian!

732
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,642
Fight!

733
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:31,977
Take him!

734
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:33,587
Get him!

735
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:35,769
Kill him!

736
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:37,659
Kill him!

737
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:45,650
Alright That's one point!

738
01:28:10,113 --> 01:28:11,422
Alright! Break!

739
01:28:22,736 --> 01:28:23,837
Stop!

740
01:29:18,858 --> 01:29:23,897
So it is you.
The son. Is it not?

741
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,904
But, this time it'll be different,
Russian.

742
01:29:45,785 --> 01:29:46,759
You're good.

743
01:29:47,259 --> 01:29:48,734
I get better.

744
01:30:02,968 --> 01:30:05,812
And when your shoulder moves I see it.

745
01:30:07,386 --> 01:30:09,749
You'd be quick and direct.

746
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:13,606
Jace! No retreat, no surrender!

747
01:31:40,474 --> 01:31:43,926
You weren't ready.
Unexpected moves are hard to counter.

748
01:31:58,165 --> 01:32:02,368
Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason!
