1
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,193
Submarine launched 12 to 15
megatons. They went to strike status.

2
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,119
The Roosevelt's splashed
six incoming cruise missiles.

3
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,154
The Russians are moving west.
Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered.

4
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,753
Sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk,
Central Russia.

5
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,951
What the hell is in Alyesk?

6
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,597
SS-18 ICBMs. Probable targets:
New York, Washington, here.

7
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,234
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit.

8
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,558
Satellites confirm birds in the air,
first impact estimated 25 minutes.

9
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,716
- Is that accurate?
- It's accurate.

10
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,957
- I advise we go to DEFCON-1.
- Get President Zorkin on the hotline.

11
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,470
Zorkin is missing. We have reports
of a coup in Moscow.

12
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,399
General Bulgakov
is calling the shots now.

13
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,556
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

14
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,320
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya.

15
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,269
Sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time.

16
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,148
Do it.

17
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,158
Mr President.

18
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,478
It'll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order.

19
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,831
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

20
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,235
My ID number is fifth from the top.

21
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,757
- Sir, it's your wife on 2104.
- Thank you.

22
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,239
- Yeah.
- The order must be confirmed

23
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,273
- by someone on the approved list.
- Shit.

24
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,830
Gene Revell,
National Security Advisor.

25
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,476
Is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way.

26
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,109
Can we...

27
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,231
...finish this up some other time?

28
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,559
No.

29
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,469
We've got to update these fire drills,
Billy.

30
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,638
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not going underground.

31
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,115
It's a goddamn tomb down there.

32
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,108
We have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the Russians.

33
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,677
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

34
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,314
It's the guy with one I'm worried about.

35
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,795
I have to send some folks to Russia,

36
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,959
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at Armazas.

37
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,435
- Arzamas.
- Yeah, whatever.

38
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,349
- Someone from your staff should go.
- I'll go.

39
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,795
- Billy, send staff.
- I want to go.

40
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,993
OK.

41
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,115
Don't underestimate Zorkin. Between
his economy, crime, Chechnya...

42
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,517
- His liver.
- What's left of it. How is he?

43
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,952
He's scheduled a press conference
for today, so we know he can sit up.

44
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,358
<i>Chechnya is part of Russia.</i>

45
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,596
<i>Only criminals and their friends</i>
<i>in the West who wish it to be separate.</i>

46
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,031
<i>Mr President, if you will kindly</i>
<i>come back...</i>

47
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,951
Do you guys see what I see?

48
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,238
- His jacket?
- He used to be able to button it up.

49
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,192
He's getting fat.

50
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,631
I know how he feels.
Oh, wow. Look at that.

51
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,398
Maybe it's not the same jacket.

52
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,388
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital.

53
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,990
- He's off the diet.
- And off the wagon. He slurred...

54
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,309
That must be why Cherlinski is there,
to keep him off the sauce.

55
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,748
Where's Cherlinski?

56
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,078
Next to... What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair.

57
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,113
- Elena Rishkov.
- That is not Cherlinski.

58
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,955
Bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski.

59
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,276
You're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him.

60
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,438
- I know. It's Cherlinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me.

61
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,838
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva summit.

62
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,873
Cherlinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was.

63
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,355
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?

64
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,912
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight.
Why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting.

65
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,271
I agree. Write it up.
If he is putting on weight,

66
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,473
that might have health consequences,
so get it in the afternoon brief.

67
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,591
Oh, and somebody find out who is
banging Elena Rishkov. This is good.

68
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,917
What shall we make of Chechnya
asking the West for protection?

69
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,478
She is like a beautiful virgin, escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear,

70
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,831
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood.

71
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,750
A poet once wrote, "Meet the new
boss, same as the old boss."

72
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,236
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21 st century.

73
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,348
Over 50 years of America and Russia

74
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,155
imposing their will
on the European community,

75
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,794
East and West,

76
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,151
and we're still treated like children...

77
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,238
...but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates.

78
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,510
Each day we lose a little bit more

79
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,510
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures

80
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,918
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment

81
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,069
when the beating of a butterfly's wings
unleashes a hurricane...

82
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,188
...God himself cannot stop.

83
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,633
So what is it?

84
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,468
Are you blind?

85
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,028
It's a bomb.

86
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,948
Where's the fuse?

87
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,868
It's warm.

88
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,792
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

89
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,078
It's a dud.

90
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,232
Let's get it on the truck.

91
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,438
But how can we sell it now?

92
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,032
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

93
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,713
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

94
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,669
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

95
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,509
Is that yours or mine?

96
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,272
It must be yours. Mine's just for show.

97
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,036
It's not the hospital.

98
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,956
- Hi.
- You're still here.

99
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,628
Well, I think to be accurate,
it's actually you who's still here.

100
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,432
Oh, right.

101
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,637
Not that I'm complaining.

102
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,318
Jack...

103
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,318
I know this is new and all, but...

104
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,794
...I have something I have to say
or I'm going to explode.

105
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
I don't want you to be scared.

106
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,188
What?

107
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,231
You're in love with me.

108
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,756
Jack, I'm a medical professional.
I can read the symptoms.

109
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,190
You're definitely in love with me.

110
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,193
And that scares you?

111
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,317
Not even a little.

112
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,195
But I think it scares you.

113
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,709
No, not even a little.

114
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,070
And for the record,
you're the one who brought it up.

115
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,433
Forget it.

116
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,549
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way. It'll stop.

117
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,395
I don't know who this is.

118
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,394
- Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks.

119
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,795
Do what you have to do. I understand.

120
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,991
Yes, this is Dr Muller.

121
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,035
Muller. You paged me.

122
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,468
Hello.

123
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,428
Stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan.

124
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,073
Jesus.

125
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,315
OK. I'll be there in half an hour.

126
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,154
I gotta go. I have an emergency
at work.

127
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,157
I have to go. I'm sorry.

128
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,995
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

129
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,553
Yeah.

130
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,991
- How about tomorrow night?
- Jack, I said yes to tonight.

131
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,358
I know.

132
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,478
What kind of emergency
does a historian have?

133
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,152
He died at 0420 Zulu. 8Â½ hours
later, they swore in a new president.

134
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,352
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov.

135
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,030
You're kidding. I wrote a paper
about him a year ago.

136
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,233
- I said he could be the next guy.
- I know.

137
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,351
- Nobody read it.
- They're reading it now.

138
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,437
- Who?
- Cabot.

139
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,200
I've been here 14 months.
He doesn't know what I look...

140
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,510
- Are you Ryan?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,158
What is this? "The Paper Chase"?

142
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,557
- Sir, my...
- Come on, we're late.

143
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,756
You're about to breathe air that's way
over your pay grade, so listen.

144
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,272
You'll be asked for advice. Be sure
you know what you're talking about.

145
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,596
Don't be afraid to say you don't know.

146
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,758
Choose your words carefully.
They could become policy.

147
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,554
Hey, you. Give me your coat.

148
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,990
Come on, you'll get it back.

149
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,908
Tie.

150
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,311
<i>So, intelligence committee?</i>

151
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,112
I've watched these on C-SPAN.
Never actually been to one.

152
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,878
You've never watched
one of these on C-SPAN.

153
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,434
Our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the Kremlin.

154
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,679
In his opinion, Nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military.

155
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,792
Everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot.

156
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,752
I respect that.

157
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,078
This morning, my wife woke up
and said I was old, bald and ugly.

158
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,836
Is that a question, Mr Chairman?

159
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,355
I told her
appearances aren't everything.

160
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,313
- Would you agree?
- I certainly would.

161
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,593
Now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz.
Is that his name?

162
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,436
Nemerov, sir.

163
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,838
Despite what your source says,
we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner.

164
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,076
Is he a hardliner?

165
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,508
No.

166
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,359
It's too soon to make that assessment.

167
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,118
According to CNN,

168
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,032
your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the Russian empire.

169
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,913
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit.

170
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,237
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried.

171
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,790
Sir, Nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back.

172
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,594
If we leave him alone,
Russia will stabilise.

173
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,079
When I asked for your advice, I didn't
mean that you should actually speak.

174
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,430
Mr Cabot?

175
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,316
Some of our assets in the Russian
government who know Mr Nemerov

176
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,317
have not had a chance to report in.

177
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,751
I'd like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you

178
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,269
before characterising him,

179
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,234
but I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving.

180
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,556
You're saying I'm wrong?

181
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,277
Absolutely, Mr Chairman.

182
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,310
I don't think you're ugly.

183
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,077
- I was out of line. I apologise.
- Senators don't like to be surprised.

184
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,831
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then
I give them a while to get used to it.

185
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,156
Then I tell them.

186
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,511
- I understand.
- Good.

187
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,075
But I'm right about Nemerov.

188
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,790
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

189
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,831
What?

190
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,998
Cathy Muller,
second year surgical resident,

191
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,430
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.

192
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,435
Welcome to the CIA, sport.

193
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,757
Your intelligence is a little flawed.
I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet.

194
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,112
- What exactly would you call her?
- Great. Amazing.

195
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,151
She's just afraid to commit.

196
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,918
He's terrified of commitment.

197
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,317
A man who's afraid of commitment
after three dates? Alert the media.

198
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,478
- I know, I know.
- So what does he do?

199
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,877
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back.

200
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,389
- Now he's a historian.
- Yawn.

201
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,070
No. He works for a think tank
across the river.

202
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,793
Double yawn.

203
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,790
All right, Rita. Let's see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight.

204
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,592
He's...

205
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,037
...cute?

206
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,677
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten.

207
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,678
Oh, God. I don't know.

208
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,519
Twelve.

209
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,118
Ask them where they found this.

210
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,149
In the field, in the Golan.

211
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,319
There was a lot of fighting there
in 1973. Did they witness it?

212
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,439
This one says he lost his son.

213
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,791
Does he remember,
was there a plane shot down?

214
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,678
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed.

215
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,796
This is worthless.

216
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,437
But tell him I will give him $400...
because of his son.

217
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,798
Thank... thank you.

218
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,191
Thank you.

219
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,759
<i>How did you come by it?</i>

220
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,592
<i>I found her in the attic of an old</i>
<i>mansion house in Glasgow.</i>

221
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,591
<i>Your little trip to the attic has got you</i>
<i>a piece worth now about</i> Â£ <i>1,000,</i>

222
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,112
<i>even in this condition, and had she</i>
<i>been in better condition, even more.</i>

223
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,595
<i>A jolly nice find.</i>

224
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,468
<i>In fact, what I thought I'd found</i>
<i>was a garden ornament.</i>

225
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,033
Hello, Cathy?

226
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,712
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late.
Can you come a half an hour later?

227
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,357
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.

228
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,673
<i>- It's a last-minute work thing.</i>
- What's that noise?

229
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,032
I'm calling from a plane.

230
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,028
<i>- This just came up. I tried to call you.</i>
- Where are you going?

231
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,830
- I can't tell you that.
- Jack.

232
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,758
You can't tell me?

233
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,319
Jack.

234
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,193
- Hold on. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

235
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,988
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel.

236
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,239
Don't be stupid. Tell her where you're
going. Tell her who you work for.

237
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,954
She'll be impressed.

238
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,196
OK. I work for the CIA.

239
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,951
The director asked me to go with him to
Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection.

240
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,517
- Hello?
- That is so lame.

241
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,032
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure
they're decommissioning their arsenal.

242
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,792
Hello?

243
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,513
Hello?

244
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,276
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

245
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>Zdravstvuyte,</i> William Cabot.

246
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,119
President Nemerov.

247
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,918
Pleasure, sir.

248
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,190
May I present Mrs Lathrop.

249
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,913
Mr President.

250
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,793
- General Rand.
- Mr President.

251
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,195
- Dr Ryan.
- Mr President.

252
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,478
You must be the Dr Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me.

253
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,712
You should not be surprised.
We know quite a bit.

254
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,754
We know how wrong your report was
that I had many girlfriends in college.

255
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,192
I met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since.

256
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,473
I was referring to
the first two years... sir.

257
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,878
Where you received
highest honors in English.

258
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,999
I like him.

259
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,314
Well, in that case, so do I.

260
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,869
I apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour,

261
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,038
but I have a message
for President Fowler.

262
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,708
You could just call him on the phone.

263
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,879
I would like him to hear it from you,
his friend of many years,

264
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,991
who received it personally from me,

265
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,751
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as I spoke it.

266
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,518
I understand.

267
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,036
Chechnya is an internal affair.

268
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,596
What we do there should be
none of your concern.

269
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,399
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree.

270
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,956
Some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me.

271
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,712
Some people in my country say

272
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,674
your war in Chechnya
is exactly your weakness.

273
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,198
Chechnya is a nation of criminals.

274
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,393
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens.

275
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,397
It is none of your concern.

276
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,874
Stability is our concern.

277
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,038
Peace in Chechnya is our concern.

278
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,672
And, if I may speak frankly...

279
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,717
...your control over your military
concerns us too.

280
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,196
For you to get involved here, it's... like
sleeping with another man's wife.

281
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,718
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward

282
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,992
they can all live together
under the same roof.

283
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,914
But what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun.

284
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,157
- That went well.
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?

285
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,828
- Anatoli Grushkov.
- Old KGB?

286
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,955
He's been around since Brezhnev.
Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him.

287
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,037
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

288
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,992
He probably buried them himself.

289
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,751
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas.

290
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,599
Who's who, what their expertise is.

291
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,118
Arzamas-16 is home

292
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,478
to the All-Russian Scientific Research
Institute of Experimental Physics

293
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,593
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb.

294
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,756
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do.

295
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,678
Since 1995,

296
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,395
we have dismantled
over 10,000 nuclear devices.

297
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,834
We tried so hard to get in here
over the years.

298
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,395
I sent three people.

299
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,069
They all died trying.

300
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,949
What does the T-shirt say?

301
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,518
"I am a bomb technician. If you
see me running... try to catch up."

302
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,508
OK.

303
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,918
Sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

304
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,511
According to this, there are
17 senior scientists on duty today.

305
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,239
I only count 14.

306
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,635
Doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky.
They don't seem to be here.

307
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,957
I will make inquiries.

308
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,152
Dr Milinov is out sick.
Orlov is on vacation.

309
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,796
Spassky, I'm grieved to say,
was killed

310
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,912
driving his car to work
just this past week.

311
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,035
We move on, shall we?

312
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,908
Please.

313
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,036
Very impressive. You almost seem
to have that information memorised.

314
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,913
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan.

315
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,828
We touch down at Andrews at 2130.
Tell him to meet me there.

316
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,554
Sir? Those three missing scientists.

317
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,876
Milinov's expertise is detonators.

318
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,913
Spassky's expertise
is the nuclear core.

319
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,712
Orlov is a mathematician

320
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,516
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb.

321
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,269
The exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb.

322
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,278
- Grushkov said...
- Grushkov's a liar.

323
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,790
Milinov is not sick.
Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation

324
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,391
and Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive.

325
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,753
They have no idea
where these guys are.

326
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,355
I'm dying to ask you how you know.

327
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,831
Secure source inside the Kremlin.

328
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,837
Codename Spinnaker.

329
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,873
He gives me stuff, I give him stuff.

330
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,312
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster.

331
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,433
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

332
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,873
No. I don't know how to get out of this.

333
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,628
All right. Invite her to the White House
correspondents dinner Sunday night.

334
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,229
It's the hottest ticket in town.

335
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,319
- Sounds great. How do I get in?
- Trust me.

336
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,155
I'll see you at the car.

337
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,758
Still loving your desk job?

338
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,634
Yeah, I am.

339
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,035
How's your Russian?

340
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,878
Still works. Why?

341
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,518
Three Russian nuclear scientists are
missing. I need to know where they are.

342
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,078
I wasn't doing this any more.

343
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,874
I just need information this time,
Johnny.

344
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,551
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330. Have a nice flight.

345
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,276
Sunday night, 8.00, at the Hilton. The
tickets are in the name of John Clark.

346
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,872
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

347
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,319
My beautiful wife, Julie, is from
New Jersey. 15 electoral votes.

348
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,595
And is, as you know, half-Jewish,

349
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,952
so we'll take Florida's
25 electoral votes and divide by two.

350
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,837
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah. Beautiful.

351
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,676
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was... nice.

352
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,956
Maybe after dinner we can...

353
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,435
...we can get a room here.

354
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,756
I already did.

355
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,468
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

356
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,759
...I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana.

357
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,357
California, 54 electoral votes.

358
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,518
At 0600 Moscow time, the Russians
launched a massive artillery strike

359
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,757
against Grozny,
the capital of Chechnya.

360
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,556
The shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon, a nerve agent.

361
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,275
Saturation, you can see
on the sat photos, took 20 minutes,

362
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,870
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles

363
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,710
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late-stage cerebral palsy.

364
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,388
- Oh, my God.
- How many dead?

365
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,674
Nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare.

366
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,429
- Let's talk response.
- The worst thing we can do is nothing.

367
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,156
If he gets away with chemical weapons,
what's next? Biological, nuclear?

368
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,831
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's the strongest response?

369
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,634
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign.

370
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,630
They requested recognition, so we
give it. Not full diplomatic, provisional.

371
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,436
Then the Chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers.

372
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,950
- How do you get them in there?
- We fly them in from Turkey.

373
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,756
- Over Armenian air space?
- To screw Russia? They won't complain.

374
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,477
Let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it.

375
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,628
Bill?

376
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,351
- Dr Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,516
What do you think?

378
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,679
Conventional wisdom suggests

379
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,633
that Nemerov is playing
the traditional Russian role:

380
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,628
Be aggressive, flex your muscles,
dare the world to stop you.

381
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,196
- But Nemerov isn't conventional.
- He acts like a hardliner.

382
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,709
With respect, I don't think he is one.

383
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,198
He just gassed the capital of another
country. With respect, you're wrong.

384
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,315
- So what are we wasting our time for?
- What if he didn't order the attack?

385
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,397
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

386
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,677
What if it was a... a rogue general?

387
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,793
Or a military unit frustrated they
couldn't get the rebels out of the city?

388
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,915
Have you reason to believe he didn't
order it, or are you just floating this?

389
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,953
You don't know.

390
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,471
I don't think he did it, sir.
I would bet he didn't do it.

391
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,075
Will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes, please?

392
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,230
<i>Russia's newly-installed president,</i>
<i>Alexander Nemerov,</i>

393
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,639
<i>has just begun to address the state.</i>
<i>We join him in progress.</i>

394
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,116
<i>For ten years now,</i>
<i>we have contended...</i>

395
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,198
Excuse me. Could you turn that up?

396
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,430
<i>... toward innocent Russian citizens.</i>

397
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,753
<i>Finally...</i>

398
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,230
<i>... every nation has a right</i>
<i>to defend itself.</i>

399
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,674
<i>This terrorism must end.</i>

400
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,798
<i>The bombing of Chechnya...</i>
<i>was my decision.</i>

401
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,431
Nice going, ace.

402
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,394
Who did it?

403
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,876
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

404
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,832
Bastards.

405
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,952
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

406
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,276
Just disappear them.

407
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,598
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

408
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,794
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

409
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,553
<i>How is our Russian friend</i>
<i>affected by this?</i>

410
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,832
I am not affected.
I remain devoted to our little plan.

411
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,031
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised.

412
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,550
- And the American?
- Mr Mason is a believer.

413
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,309
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him.

414
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,798
- Why?
- He won't live long enough to get it.

415
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,879
- Where is the package?
- It left Haifa a week ago.

416
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,550
I'm told these things can kill you.

417
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,191
But so much has changed.

418
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,993
Perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider... a different approach?

419
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,635
Maybe try to bring Russia
more into Europe,

420
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,673
more into our way of thinking?

421
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,077
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau,

422
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,272
and with your concurrence, rejected it.

423
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,517
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty.

424
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,757
- Perhaps our plan is...
- Is what?

425
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,799
Not perfectly conceived.

426
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,234
Are you crazy? All over
the world, right-wing parties,

427
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,991
nationalist movements,
Nazis, Aryan Nations,

428
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,317
all working together for the first time.

429
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,238
Is that not perfect?

430
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,315
Well, I respect the will and judgment
of my friends.

431
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,959
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown...

432
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,913
...uncomfortable with this plan.

433
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,556
So I must... beg your leave.

434
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,912
Gentlemen.

435
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,269
Herr Haft will help you out.

436
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,159
Your scarf, monsieur.

437
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,871
Watch it with that thing.
You're gonna kill somebody.

438
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,317
Yo, what's up, Mason?

439
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,431
You know, I always wanted to ask
you... Where'd you get that tat, man?

440
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,628
The navy.

441
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,149
The navy? I was in the navy.

442
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,396
Hospital ship, six years. You?

443
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,914
Eight months.

444
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,751
Oh. You wash out?

445
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,515
All right, brother.
You have a good one.

446
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,397
Yeah, brother.

447
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,354
<i>... not realising the rest of the world is</i>
<i>watching and will take a cue from us...</i>

448
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,916
<i>The unprecedented attack</i>
<i>on Chechnya</i>

449
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,394
<i>signals a dangerous</i>
<i>and troubling shift in Russian policy.</i>

450
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,636
<i>It demands the toughest and most</i>
<i>unambiguous response from the West.</i>

451
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,349
<i>NATO forces are on their way to</i>
<i>Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers</i>

452
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:09,157
<i>and to provide humanitarian aid</i>
<i>to victims of this monstrous...</i>

453
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,116
I expected this.

454
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,958
Really?

455
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,759
What will you do?

456
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,076
Nothing.

457
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,829
We will do nothing.

458
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,918
These are four hours old. Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.

459
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,270
Why haven't they moved?

460
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,392
- Nemerov's too smart to move them.
- He speaks.

461
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,628
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 19,000
tanks. No way NATO can match that.

462
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,070
That's why he's not gonna move them.

463
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,068
It's like chess.
He's thinking three moves ahead.

464
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,353
The NATO playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons.

465
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,030
And he won't risk a nuclear war
over this.

466
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,314
I also think he's sending us
a message. He didn't bomb Grozny.

467
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,713
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

468
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,309
At the end of the corridor.

469
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,232
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

470
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,355
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

471
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,997
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

472
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,238
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

473
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,513
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

474
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,553
He has a secret job.

475
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,232
For the government?

476
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,510
For imbeciles with money.

477
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,278
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

478
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,630
They even told him
not to call his mother.

479
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,749
The pigs.

480
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,351
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

481
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,599
But my Sasha, he called.

482
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,791
Just last night.

483
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,714
Clark got us her number. NSA traced
calls to that number back to here.

484
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,835
It's an abandoned Soviet army base
on the Kremenchug reservoir.

485
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,955
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

486
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,355
A fair guess, they're building a bomb.

487
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,997
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.
Why would he build a secret one?

488
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,997
Deniability.

489
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,999
Build one nobody knows about, he can
drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer.

490
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,794
No way to track it, no way to trace it.

491
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,997
He could set it off and say,
"I didn't do it."

492
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,748
With respect, I don't think
that adds up.

493
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,192
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to.

494
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,275
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

495
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,110
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

496
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,311
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

497
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,191
You're crazy.

498
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,838
I'm going out.

499
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,319
<i>The explosive blocks</i>
<i>must be replaced.</i>

500
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,034
<i>Machined to a thousandth</i>
<i>of a millimetre</i>

501
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,959
<i>in a mathematically determined</i>
<i>configuration.</i>

502
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,270
<i>- Do we have a bomb?</i>
<i>- First we must analyse the yield...</i>

503
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,472
<i>Do we have a bomb?</i>

504
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,639
<i>Yes.</i>

505
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,077
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

506
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,032
This is a... a test.

507
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,352
Answer it.

508
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,308
- Answer it.
- Are you sure?

509
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,318
Hello?

510
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,233
Yes.

511
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,594
Yes, sir.

512
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,868
I have to go outside for just a second.

513
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,757
OK? I'll be right back.

514
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,349
I'll be right back.

515
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,794
- Sir, I write reports.
- I reviewed your military records.

516
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,073
- You can take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that.

517
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,310
I'm not asking you to be an operations
officer, just my eyes and ears. I can't go.

518
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,152
So... this isn't sanctioned.

519
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,073
I want you to give this to Clark,
see what he finds out, bring it home.

520
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,628
Yes, sir.

521
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,278
Jack...

522
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,159
...we never had this discussion.

523
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,271
What discussion?

524
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,309
OK. Clark... So this is
three days ago.

525
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,229
It shows vehicles here.
Guards here and here.

526
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,158
I gotta get one of those.

527
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,676
Now, the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago.

528
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,993
That shows guards here and here.

529
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,595
I don't even have e-mail.

530
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,954
There are two at the checkpoint,
between two and five in the barracks

531
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,311
and two with the package,
which we believe to be here.

532
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,876
No problem. Give me a couple
of guys, some tranquilliser darts,

533
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,877
we can be out in six minutes.

534
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,548
- There is a problem.
- What's that?

535
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,070
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all.

536
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,711
Why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?

537
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,391
For two reasons. Either we can't
see them, which is bad,

538
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,795
or worse, they left, and we're too late.

539
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,708
Suit up.

540
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,434
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that.

541
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,389
No, no. I'm an analyst.
I don't go on missions.

542
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,956
Relax, 007. It's not a mission.
It's just a recce.

543
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,709
OK, fine, whatever you call it.
I don't do that. I just write reports.

544
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,356
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up.

545
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,788
Clark, no.

546
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,869
Clark... no.

547
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,793
So, Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner.

548
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,672
Have a good time?
I've never been to one of those.

549
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,678
I was actually looking forward to it.

550
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,513
Clark, no. I'm not going in there.

551
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,838
Goddamn right. You're gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat.

552
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,837
Be right back.

553
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,749
Damn.

554
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,397
Oh, Jesus.

555
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,833
Oh, God. Immigration didn't
call you guys, huh?

556
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,393
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak much Ukrainian.

557
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,950
It's not what you think. I'm an
American citizen. I have my papers...

558
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,308
OK. No papers.

559
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,909
Please. Just put the gun down.

560
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,239
The light? You want
me to put the light down?

561
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,078
OK. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down.

562
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,635
Here we go, I'm putting it down.

563
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,272
Shoot him, Ryan.

564
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,519
Shoot him.

565
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,832
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying.

566
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,318
- Get their shoes.
- What?

567
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,909
Tell them to take their shoes off.

568
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,319
- You speak Ukrainian.
- Yeah. You don't?

569
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,919
Whatever it is they were spray painting
was big, about the size of a fridge.

570
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,112
The imprint it left was deep.
So we know three things.

571
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,757
It was heavy, something was
radioactive, and now it's gone.

572
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,678
- One of them spoke English?
- South African.

573
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,758
So, what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine

574
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,157
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

575
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,117
- Tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa.
- I have a feeling you better hurry.

576
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,669
Most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle

577
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,394
of communism versus capitalism

578
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,797
and that fascism was but a hiccup.

579
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,957
Today we know better.

580
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,674
Communism was a fool's errand. The
followers of Marx, gone from this earth.

581
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,236
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive.

582
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,436
<i>Hitler, however,</i>
<i>had one great disadvantage.</i>

583
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,030
<i>He lived in a time when fascism,</i>
<i>like a virus,</i>

584
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,515
<i>like the AIDS virus,</i>

585
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:59,192
<i>needed a strong host in order to spread.</i>
<i>Germany was that host.</i>

586
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,676
But strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail.

587
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,348
<i>The world was too big.</i>

588
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,189
<i>Fortunately, the world has changed.</i>

589
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,632
<i>Global communications,</i>
<i>cable TV, the internet.</i>

590
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,479
<i>Today the world is smaller</i>

591
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,673
<i>and the virus does not need</i>
<i>a strong host in order to spread.</i>

592
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,431
This virus...

593
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,196
...is airborne.

594
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,318
<i>One more thing.</i>
<i>Let no man call us crazy.</i>

595
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,355
<i>They called Hitler crazy, but Hitler</i>
<i>wasn't crazy. He was stupid.</i>

596
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,028
<i>You don't fight Russia and America.</i>

597
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,835
You get Russia and America
to fight each other

598
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,952
and destroy each other.

599
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,468
- What did you find?
- Ukraine's exports are online.

600
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,511
I pulled up the shipping manifests.

601
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,316
The only crate that size was picked up
at Kiev International ten days ago

602
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,238
and flown to the Canary Islands.

603
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,398
The air force has a nuclear
assessment team. Call them...

604
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,639
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter,
headed for the East Coast.

605
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,553
- What?
<i>- Baltimore. It's coming here.</i>

606
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,076
<i>It's a great view from the Budweiser</i>
<i>blimp as we count down to game time.</i>

607
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,748
<i>We'll have the pre-game festivities</i>

608
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,078
<i>as well as the arrival of the nation's</i>
<i>number one football fan in a moment.</i>

609
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,231
<i>Then conquer we must</i>

610
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,592
<i>For our cause it is just</i>

611
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,830
<i>And this be our motto</i>

612
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,033
<i>In God is our trust</i>

613
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,711
<i>And the star-spangled banner</i>

614
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:38,430
<i>Forever shall wave</i>

615
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,148
<i>O'er the land of the free...</i>

616
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,116
Get me the duty officer!

617
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:54,874
<i>Home of the brave</i>

618
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,075
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the President of the United States,</i>

619
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,430
<i>Robert Fowler!</i>

620
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,158
Showtime.

621
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,788
Shit.

622
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,199
<i>15 yard penalty, first down.</i>

623
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,753
That's the way!

624
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,230
Shit.

625
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:25,950
Hello.

626
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,036
- Hello?
- Sir!

627
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,879
- Hello?
- Sir!

628
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,988
Shit!

629
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,871
- Cabot.
- It's Ryan.

630
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,039
- What?
- The bomb is in play.

631
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,792
The AFRAT team are meeting me at
the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it.

632
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,434
- What docks?
- Baltimore.

633
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,269
- You're breaking up. What did you say?
<i>- Baltimore.</i>

634
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,359
- I'm losing you. I'll call you back...
<i>- Baltimore.</i>

635
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,079
<i>Sir!</i>

636
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,474
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!

637
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,157
Move it! Let's go!

638
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,429
Move! Go, go, go, go! Move!

639
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,757
What the hell is going on?

640
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,192
Some Russian scientists made a
nuclear bomb. It's arrived in Baltimore.

641
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,790
- Get those people out of the stadium.
- Stay down!

642
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,757
<i>The President has been taken</i>
<i>off the field.</i>

643
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,554
- 407.
- Thanks, JJ.

644
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,148
<i>Clearly something has happened</i>
<i>of tremendous proportions.</i>

645
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,514
<i>We have no word as to what but</i>
<i>there is an enormous cloud over...</i>

646
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,118
Go, go, go!

647
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,513
Mr President! Are you all right?

648
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,790
He's stuck. Get out of the way.

649
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,311
Mr President, are you all right?

650
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,830
Are you all right, Mr President?
This is the marines, sir.

651
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,598
I need your help, Danny.

652
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,872
Alvarez, get me a stretcher, now!

653
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,231
You got the stretcher?

654
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,349
- You got the stretcher?
- No, I don't want one.

655
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,358
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

656
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,033
Move it!

657
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,078
Move it!

658
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,073
Go, go! Close them off! Go on up!

659
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,632
Mr President...

660
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,276
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now.

661
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,279
What?

662
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,553
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us.

663
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,799
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us.

664
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,389
We are drafting
a strong denial for you.

665
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,160
And a statement of sympathy.

666
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,636
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert.

667
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,953
Hey! It's Ryan.

668
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,716
- Jack, where are you?
- Somewhere outside Baltimore.

669
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,718
<i>- Cabot got the President out.</i>
- Where is he now?

670
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,675
They're taking him airborne, on NAOC.
They think it might be the Russians.

671
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,712
It wasn't the Russians. I gotta talk to
Cabot. Patch me through to the plane.

672
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,311
Cabot's not on the plane. We don't
know where he is. Call back in an hour.

673
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,559
We don't have an hour.
Fowler's gonna want to hit back now.

674
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,909
Listen. We have to prove it wasn't the
Russians before he's convinced it is.

675
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,951
<i>Can you get back to Langley?</i>

676
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:39,234
There's no time. The radiation
assessment team, where are they?

677
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,954
<i>Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.</i>

678
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,276
<i>The prevailing winds are blowing</i>
<i>the fallout to the east and north.</i>

679
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,436
<i>As long as you stay south you're OK.</i>

680
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:54,474
- Mr President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

681
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,830
- How many casualties?
- We don't know.

682
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,955
- How the hell did it get there?
- We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up.

683
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,630
- Well, how is Cabot? Where is he?
- I don't know.

684
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,559
- What do you know?
- I don't know, all right? I don't know!

685
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,352
I don't know!

686
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,752
- General, Kondor is not on board.
- Send the AFRAT team.

687
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,913
Mr President, I recommend
we move to DEFCON-2.

688
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,633
Where's our intelligence?

689
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,990
Russian air defences
are at their highest level.

690
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,749
Maybe they're afraid of being attacked.
I can't get this goddamn chair open!

691
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,234
We're about to take off.

692
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,954
- We don't know who did it...
- We think the Russians...

693
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,390
- You think?
- Sir, DEFCON-2.

694
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,309
- We're groping in the dark...
- This is too much goddamn bullshit!

695
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,835
And not enough fact.

696
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,190
<i>The blast crater is about</i>
<i>100, 150 yards wide,</i>

697
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,675
<i>which suggests a low-yield device,</i>

698
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,713
<i>quite a bit smaller</i>
<i>than the Hiroshima bomb.</i>

699
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,799
<i>A quarter of a square mile</i>
<i>around the stadium is just gone.</i>

700
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,152
<i>Beyond that, buildings remain, heavily</i>
<i>damaged, for another quarter mile.</i>

701
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,989
<i>The damage tapers off the farther</i>
<i>you get from Ground Zero.</i>

702
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,228
Dubinin.

703
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,150
<i>Herr Haft has left for America.</i>
<i>Now we are counting on you.</i>

704
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,799
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig.

705
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,797
Attention.

706
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,036
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

707
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,435
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

708
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,713
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

709
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:09,632
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

710
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,229
Man your aircraft.

711
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,949
The ash isn't radioactive. The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

712
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,878
Captain. Jack Ryan, CIA.

713
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,878
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside.

714
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,674
I need to know all you know
about the bomb.

715
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,557
We're collecting samples. Get in line
and we'll have the report out tomorrow.

716
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,389
Captain, I need to know now
where this bomb came from,

717
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,957
or even where it didn't come from
or there may not be a tomorrow.

718
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,234
Shit. Wesson, where are you?

719
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,317
<i>About a quarter mile from Ground Zero.</i>

720
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,389
This is about as far as we'll go.
My feet are sizzling.

721
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,512
I'm getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear.

722
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,110
<i>- OK. Cut the rover loose and get out.</i>
- Roger that.

723
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,237
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped
in. Somebody had to sign for it at port.

724
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,989
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name. Where's Cabot?

725
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,714
<i>No one knows.</i>
<i>We're checking the hospitals.</i>

726
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,309
- Have you tried Memorial?
<i>- He wouldn't be there.</i>

727
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,557
No, I mean... Is it still...

728
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,875
It's Cathy's hospital.

729
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,592
<i>As far as I know it's still there,</i>
<i>but the phones are down.</i>

730
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,189
All right. Can you keep checking?
Thanks.

731
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,150
They could have launched
a cruise missile.

732
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,193
- We don't know that this is Russia.
- We don't know it's not.

733
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:09,713
If they were sending us a message,
they'd want us to know it was them.

734
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,629
Except they could inspire
the confusion we're going through now.

735
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,831
Mr President, we're uplinked.

736
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:24,950
President Nemerov, there's been a
major nuclear event in the United States.

737
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,593
Loss of life is severe.

738
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,268
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident.

739
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,711
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't...

740
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:38,358
We have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon. Rest assured...

741
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,156
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon.

742
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,231
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

743
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,515
He's fishing.

744
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,597
Send our reply.

745
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,556
Whoa, that was a little fast.

746
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,752
"Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people."

747
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,111
"If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent."

748
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,232
"What madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose?"

749
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,591
"You must believe that Russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act."

750
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,110
It's canned.
He prepared that in advance.

751
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,398
President Nemerov, we've no reason
to suspect Russian involvement...

752
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,999
...at this time...

753
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:27,673
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

754
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,150
He thinks we did this.

755
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,477
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

756
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,073
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

757
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,750
Increase the alert status.

758
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,479
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar, bearing 020.

759
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,473
Where?

760
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,473
Now it's gone.

761
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,277
There. It's a weak signal.

762
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,391
TAO, inbound contact.

763
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,439
Multiples on the same bearing.

764
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,590
- Vampire, vampire!
- Fast movers inbound.

765
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,109
I got seven, eight, nine of them!

766
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,279
The missiles definitely came
from Russian aircraft.

767
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,677
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are out.

768
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,953
I ordered no such attack.

769
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,833
You must not respond to this action...

770
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,190
"...until we investigate all possibilities."

771
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,311
Like you did in Chechnya?

772
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,671
Mr President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

773
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,958
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

774
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,993
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

775
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,914
Do not lecture me on Chechnya.

776
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,669
"...lecture me on Chechnya."

777
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:03,433
Mr President, we are now at a
de facto state of war with the Russians.

778
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,555
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday.
We have to find him right away.

779
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,557
Wow.
Look at that gadolinium reading.

780
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,194
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge.

781
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,198
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold.

782
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,630
There it is. Savannah River.

783
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,909
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, what?

784
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,758
They had a gadolinium problem.

785
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,589
Hanford does it another way,
and generate too much promethium.

786
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,189
Hold on. Can you translate that
into English?

787
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,198
This plutonium came from the DOE
plant at Savannah River, February '68,

788
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,710
from K reactor. We even know
which part of K reactor.

789
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,277
- Wait. This is our plutonium?
- Made in the USA.

790
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,589
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot.

791
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,914
Are you advocating we launch
a first strike?

792
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,875
It is not a first strike! There's already
been a first strike, and a second.

793
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,275
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't get it!

794
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,995
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable.

795
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,191
Sidney, goddamn it!

796
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,039
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

797
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,710
Their missile silos are hot.
We're getting bullshit from Nemerov.

798
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,596
Let's not forget how this started.
They tried to kill me, remember?

799
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,677
Don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!

800
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,034
<i>Please come to the triage tent</i>
<i>on the side of the building.</i>

801
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,073
<i>We will help you find</i>
<i>who you are looking for,</i>

802
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,113
<i>but we are low on blood supply.</i>

803
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,354
Sir?

804
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,639
Sir?

805
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,070
Hi.

806
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,154
What?

807
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,750
- President?
- The President's fine.

808
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,554
He's fine. Sir...

809
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,914
The bomb. The plutonium...

810
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,315
- Wife.
- What?

811
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,234
Wife.

812
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:43,989
Your wife? I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC.

813
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,953
The blast radius wasn't that...

814
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,151
...it wasn't that wide.

815
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,836
Sir, listen to me.

816
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,593
The plutonium was ours.

817
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,434
John Clark's in Haifa to track down
the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him.

818
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,835
I don't know what to do.

819
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,553
Girl... girlfriend.

820
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,199
She...

821
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,718
She works in Baltimore, so...

822
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,638
...I don't know.

823
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,113
Spinnaker.

824
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,153
- What?
- Spinnaker.

825
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,754
Sir?

826
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,834
Bill?

827
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,392
Yeah. We found the receiver address
for the crate.

828
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,831
<i>Port of Baltimore.</i>
<i>Can you get to the docks?</i>

829
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:21,158
Find the Transcon warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason.

830
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,911
Sorry, I need this truck.

831
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,554
Come on.

832
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,674
Shit.

833
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,398
Sir, we've come up
with another alternative.

834
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,515
A conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated.

835
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,349
- It's a measured response.
- Non-nuclear.

836
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:53,348
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-16s.

837
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,154
Can't afford for them to see us as weak.

838
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,114
They've got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level.

839
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,797
I think they'll get that message.

840
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,639
Hit 'em.

841
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,718
<i>Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.</i>
<i>We have target acquired. Target is lit.</i>

842
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,078
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

843
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,068
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

844
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,559
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

845
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,194
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

846
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,391
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

847
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,354
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

848
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,312
That will be the sign.

849
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,795
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

850
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,994
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

851
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,590
They'd be crazy to attack then.

852
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,350
Can I have your attention?

853
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,074
The generator has gone out.

854
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,990
There's broken glass everywhere. Stay
where you are. We will get back to...

855
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:30,034
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are.
We'll get you one by one.

856
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,431
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you feel your arms and legs?

857
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,757
What have you got?

858
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,359
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

859
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,232
Whatever we can.

860
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,394
What?

861
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,076
Bill Cabot died.

862
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,437
I'm really sorry.

863
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,350
This can't be happening.

864
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,273
Sir, we have a call from Langley.

865
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,232
Thank you.

866
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,596
- Becker.
<i>- This is Jack Ryan.</i>

867
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,916
Great. The Nemerov apologist.

868
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,990
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy.

869
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,472
You said that after Grozny.
Put it in your report.

870
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:58,954
<i>The plutonium...</i>

871
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,509
Seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here.

872
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,711
I have never seen such a thing.

873
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:23,232
That is why we published the case
on the internet, to seek help.

874
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:27,319
- How did he say it happened?
- He will not talk about it.

875
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,999
Was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick?

876
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,712
Mr Ghazi, I'm not the police.

877
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,673
I'm a physician. I assure you
anything you say stays between us.

878
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,669
My friend and I find bomb.

879
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,593
We sell to a man
who buys such things.

880
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,590
Was it this man?

881
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,230
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb.

882
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,271
We must help them.

883
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,113
I am... going to die?

884
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,594
Yes?

885
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,039
Yes.

886
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,836
His name is Olson.

887
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,074
He live in Damascus.

888
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,479
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all.

889
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,352
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

890
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,916
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

891
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,157
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

892
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,437
Three or four hundred thousand.

893
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,349
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

894
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,630
...would be to cross a threshold.

895
01:33:54,840 --> 01:34:01,029
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

896
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,911
I cannot stop what I did not start.

897
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:10,952
Mr President, we need you
to initiate snapcount.

898
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,679
What happens then?

899
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:18,078
We prepare to take out their land-based
missiles with a nuclear strike,

900
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,671
find and kill their subs, knock out
the planes they have on the ground

901
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,158
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air.

902
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,838
What are our chances?

903
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,272
David?

904
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,309
Odds are we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle.

905
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,990
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes,

906
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,395
the ones we can't find.

907
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,276
Mostly the... smaller, more mobile,
less accurate kind.

908
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,948
All those can do is target our cities.

909
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,392
But he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities.

910
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,512
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president.

911
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,955
This is my presidency?

912
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:17,230
Sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor.

913
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,149
I think he'll push back from the table
and call it a night.

914
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,353
I'm giving the order for snapcount.
Maximum readiness.

915
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,598
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

916
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,475
Dillon, find out who Dressler is.
Jack, I want you out of there.

917
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,717
<i>- I'm at the docks.</i>
- Look for the name Dressler.

918
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,549
No. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the
Baltimore PD, give them the address.

919
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,433
- Wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back.

920
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,756
Who's Dressler?

921
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,916
Where is he, goddamn it?

922
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,680
Where is Dressler?

923
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,354
Police! Put your hands up!

924
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,869
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

925
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,629
- Where's Dressler, goddamn it?
- Let him go!

926
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,718
Where's Dressler? Where is he?

927
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,474
Langley said you might need help.

928
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,752
- I gotta get to the Pentagon.
- I think I can help you with that.

929
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,312
Mr President.

930
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,478
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

931
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,558
That is the sign.

932
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,957
Shoot them down.

933
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,876
God protect us.

934
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,395
Mr President, they're scrambling
their fighters. We're out of time.

935
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,070
- Dave!
- He has a heart condition.

936
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,077
- Get a doctor.
- Mr President.

937
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,157
- Where's your nitro?
- I said get a doctor!

938
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,477
- Mr President.
- Take him to my quarters.

939
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,434
Colonel, bring in the launch codes.

940
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,678
<i>Dressler's an Austrian manufacturer,</i>
<i>billionaire.</i>

941
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,269
His father was executed at Nuremberg.

942
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:15,837
He bought a seat in parliament and got
booted out for saying pro-Nazi things.

943
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,519
Rudy, get me through to the President.

944
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,837
I can't do it, Jack.
They're in the snapcount.

945
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,917
<i>- There's no way in.</i>
- Bullshit.

946
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:01,279
- I can do that for you, sir.
- No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it.

947
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:04,199
- Can I see it? We're on high alert.
- I understand.

948
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,994
- Sir, put the card down.
- Back off.

949
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,395
- I am ordering you...
- Back off!

950
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,435
Step back now! I am ordering
you to take a step back! Put...

951
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,954
General, there's a Dr Ryan
from the CIA.

952
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,594
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted.

953
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,711
- What's he want?
- You, sir.

954
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:38,552
I have a message from Director Cabot
that I need to transmit over the hotline.

955
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,194
- What's your authorisation?
- I don't have one.

956
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,914
- Where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir.

957
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:48,716
- I need to get this information sent.
- Not without authorisation. Get him out.

958
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:54,278
Wait! General! The President is basing
his decisions on bad information!

959
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,552
If you shut me out,
your family and my family

960
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,548
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes.

961
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,672
My orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions.

962
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:14,838
I just need to send some information.

963
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,794
What makes you think
the President will listen to you?

964
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,511
He doesn't have to.

965
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,950
How close are the bombers?

966
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:33,676
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

967
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:42,111
Activate the missile regiments.

968
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:52,595
The launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order.

969
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,759
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

970
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:05,150
Mine is the... My number is...

971
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,993
...the third one... third number down
from the top.

972
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,756
Your orders, sir?

973
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,315
- Strike.
- I'm sorry, sir?

974
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,829
I give the order to strike.

975
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,192
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed.

976
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,395
Bob, for the love of God.

977
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,318
Just do it.

978
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:36,199
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down.

979
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,477
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule.

980
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:52,753
NMCC, strike order has been
confirmed. Start the sequence.

981
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,599
- We've got activity on the hotline.
- They've had their chance.

982
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,916
No, somebody's talking to the Kremlin.

983
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,989
It says, "America has been the victim
of a terrorist attack."

984
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,558
As you can imagine, there has
been much confusion here...

985
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,838
...and fear.

986
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,998
But we know the weapon
was not Russian.

987
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,431
"But we know the weapon
was not Russian."

988
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,153
What the hell is going on?

989
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,879
Type exactly what I say.

990
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,640
Who are we talking to?

991
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:42,638
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with
Bill Cabot. He died today in Baltimore.

992
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,752
- Cut him off.
- Launch sequence has begun.

993
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,393
Two months ago,

994
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,110
a neo-fascist named Dressler bought
an A-bomb on the black market.

995
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,790
- Cut him off.
- The system can't be cut off.

996
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,956
Then get someone to stop him.

997
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:01,233
- He paid three disaffected Russian...
- "scientists to make the bomb active."

998
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,238
"He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason"

999
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:08,831
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course.

1000
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,193
This is madness. He is CIA.

1001
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,472
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

1002
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,468
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

1003
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,960
What are you asking of me?

1004
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,794
Back down.

1005
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:44,669
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

1006
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,439
None.

1007
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:53,511
You see? He is wasting time.

1008
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,870
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

1009
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:02,239
Sir, I know you had nothing to do
with the Baltimore bomb

1010
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,718
and you know you didn't, but you're
still about to launch a nuclear strike.

1011
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:10,117
- Yes, sir. That's all, Dr Ryan.
- This is about fear.

1012
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,436
Fear of your missiles,
fear of our subs.

1013
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,517
Fear of being weak,
of making a mistake,

1014
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,713
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place!

1015
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,279
It stopped.

1016
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,479
They cut him off.

1017
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,839
They are going to strike.

1018
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,998
Prepare the launch orders now.

1019
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,752
30 seconds to launch.

1020
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,030
Oh, my God. Mr President?

1021
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,597
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment,

1022
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,439
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn.

1023
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:11,111
"If you match this, I propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours."

1024
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,076
Stop the launch sequence.

1025
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,829
Lasseter here. Flash override.
Stop the sequence!

1026
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,350
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON-3.

1027
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:27,348
And would somebody ask Mr Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

1028
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,871
You're still here.

1029
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,198
There is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy

1030
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,516
than the steps we've taken this week

1031
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,631
<i>toward a multinational campaign</i>

1032
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:14,753
<i>to root out and eliminate</i>
<i>weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1033
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,199
<i>We embarked on this course because</i>
<i>we have learned, at too great a cost,</i>

1034
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:24,597
<i>that if the most powerful weapons</i>
<i>ever created are unleashed,</i>

1035
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,554
<i>they will be fired not in anger,</i>
<i>but in fear.</i>

1036
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,034
Dr Ryan.

1037
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,112
Mr Grushkov.

1038
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,995
It is... a lovely day.

1039
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,233
Yeah.

1040
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,312
- I'm sorry, this is...
- Dr Muller. How do you do?

1041
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:48,510
Nice to meet you.

1042
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,389
Why am I not surprised
you know her name?

1043
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,677
Our friend William thought
I was a spy.

1044
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:00,394
Of course, he could never prove it.

1045
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,232
He never told me you were friends.

1046
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,715
Maybe he didn't know you well enough.

1047
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,874
He told me he had a source in Russia.

1048
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,076
"To keep the back channels open?"

1049
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,911
"In hopes of staving off disaster."

1050
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:25,238
<i>Kennedy said,</i>
<i>"Our most basic common link"</i>

1051
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:29,035
<i>"is that we all inhabit</i>
<i>this small planet. "

1052
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,074
<i>"We all breathe the same air."</i>

1053
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:37,998
<i>"We all cherish our children's future..."</i>

1054
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,034
<i>"...and we're all mortal."</i>

1055
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:46,829
I will miss... so very much
talking to William.

1056
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,119
Me too.

1057
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,356
Perhaps from time to time

1058
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,074
you and I can talk.

1059
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,510
Yeah, I'd like that.

1060
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,399
What is this?

1061
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,229
A modest gift for your engagement.

1062
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,118
He just asked me this morning.

1063
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,914
We haven't told anybody about it.

1064
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,714
How could you possibly know?

1065
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,554
