1
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,447
ALIEN

2
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,531
You've got no professional detachment,

3
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:36,409
and you can't keep your big nose
out of other people's business!

4
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:39,202
ALIEN

5
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:42,287
Did anybody else see those
big letters flying by?

6
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,455
You are hopeless, "Kazoo"!

7
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:48,666
Actually it's "Gazoo." "Ga!"
Let's all say it together.

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:54,296
Silence! We are sending you to a planet
with virtually no civilization to muck up.

9
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,089
Please, no. Anything but...

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,923
Earth!

11
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:02,760
You are to document the earthlings' bizarre
mating ritual of love and marriage.

12
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,303
Why can't they reproduce like we do?

13
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,141
It's a boy!

14
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:17,855
- And so green and slimy.
- Quit sucking up!

15
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:22,317
Wait. Surely there must
be others more qualified than I.

16
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,236
Of course. But why risk losing one of them?

17
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:28,071
Not Earth!

18
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:31,531
<i>They haven't even
invented pants yet!</i>

19
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:33,323
<i>Have you seen my legs?</i>

20
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:38,577
Imagine the moron who's
going to get stuck with "Kazoo."

21
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:13,277
This is an exciting time for us,
isn't it, Barney?

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,569
Sure, Fred.

23
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:18,197
No job, no money, no women.
Things are really looking up.

24
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:24,327
Don't worry. Everything's gonna change
once we pass our finals tomorrow.

25
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:25,494
Uh, Fred?

26
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,537
And I know just how to ace this test.

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,706
All these other mugs are gonna
stay up all night studying.

28
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,582
- Fred...
- Don't interrupt.

29
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:37,085
When they finally do get to sleep, all the
information is gonna fall out of their heads.

30
00:02:37,543 --> 00:02:42,047
Now me, I'm way ahead of everybody.
I'm not gonna study tonight.

31
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:46,592
I'm gonna get a good night's rest,
get up extra early and study in the morning.

32
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:51,554
That way, everything will still be up front
of my noggin by the time I take the test.

33
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:53,930
- That's great. There's just one thing.
- What's that?

34
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,556
The test is today!

35
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,224
Today?

36
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:04,229
Flintstone! You're next!

37
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,274
<i>Next up
on Bronto-simulator</i>

38
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,776
Go!

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,250
You think you can handle
a Brontocrane with a backfiring problem?

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,627
Crane's got trouble, just call Barney Rubble.

41
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:40,925
Oh, my aching tummy!

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,223
Here you go.

43
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,058
You wish.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,153
Look out! She's gonna blow!

45
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,077
Hey, I got three stomachs! Cut me some slack.

46
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:18,538
Yes!

47
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,379
Time!

48
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:33,928
- How'd I do?
- Well, Flintstone...

49
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:38,139
You passed!

50
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,141
Yabba-dabba...

51
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,559
Oooh!

52
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,395
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

53
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,145
Frederick Flintstone.

54
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,396
Way to go, Fred!

55
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,774
- Congratulations, Frederick.
- Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,360
- Melvin Rennick.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:01,570
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,822
Thank you.

59
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:14,164
Gifts, gifts, gifts!

60
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,833
I'm having the best bridal shower
a girl could ever have.

61
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,210
And this one's from Wilma.

62
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:21,961
Oooh!

63
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:27,173
Oh! A vacuum cleaner! Thank you, Wilma.

64
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,675
Yeah, like she's gonna do
any housework, right?

65
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:33,218
I give this marriage six months, tops.

66
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,470
- Wilma?
- Where's Wilma?

67
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:48,189
That girl will be the death of me.

68
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:57,197
Wilma Slaghoople!
Staring at that tar pit bedrock again.

69
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:01,700
There's nothing down there but a bunch
of flat-footed, flat-headed Neanderthals,

70
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:05,327
clubbing each other and grunting.

71
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,661
You know, I hear they're still afraid of fire.

72
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,205
I think they're exactly like you and me.

73
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,123
This is all my fault.

74
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,000
I should never have let you play
with the servants' children.

75
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,210
Darling, please.

76
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:24,047
Come downstairs and at least pretend to be
having a good time like everyone else.

77
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,214
Come.

78
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,845
Look! Oven mitts!

79
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,555
Is that all the presents?

80
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,181
Oh. What do we do now?

81
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:42,184
Ladies, I have an idea.

82
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:47,063
- What do you say we go for a drive?
- To the club!

83
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:52,067
Actually, I was thinking about going
someplace a little different for a change.

84
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,943
Someplace new.

85
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:57,070
Like, going into Bedrock...

86
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,404
And going bowling?

87
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,264
- Isn't she the best?
- Oh, yes, she is!

88
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,516
Yah!

89
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,601
Whoa.

90
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,900
My Wilma! Beautiful and witty,

91
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,526
a prize for any man.

92
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:28,527
Hello, Chip.

93
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:30,736
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,239
I just came by to discuss some
business with Colonel Slaghoople.

95
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:37,325
There's a certain girl
I'm thinking of investing in.

96
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,371
Hello, ladies.

97
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:48,668
Well, I guess the next
bridal shower will be Wilma's!

98
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,212
Oh! Oh, no.

99
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:57,507
Now, ladies,
don't start chiseling those invitations yet.

100
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:01,843
Wilma, you've hooked him. Now reel him in.

101
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,760
If I thought I had a shot at Chip,

102
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,762
I'd club my Eugene
and leave him for the Raptors.

103
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:12,183
Wilma, get real! Chip Rockefeller
was first in his class at Princestone.

104
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,061
- I know, but...
- And he owns half of Rock Vegas.

105
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,228
Colonel.

106
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,897
Wilma, you and Chip
are perfect for each other.

107
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,482
Think of the kind of life he can buy you.

108
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,693
We'll get to spend every day
together shopping...

109
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,318
- Playing tennis...
- Getting facials...

110
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,947
Browbeating our husbands!
We'll be just like our mothers.

111
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,619
Wilma!

112
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:41,911
Wilma!

113
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,417
Hey, Fred!

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,293
Hey, Fred!

115
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,378
Where you been?

116
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,587
I've been lookin' all over for ya.

117
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,964
I didn't feel much like celebrating.

118
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:04,261
Are you kidding? We get to spend
the rest of our lives working in a rock quarry!

119
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,305
Who says dreams don't come true?

120
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:13,268
I know I should be happy, but I guess
I always figured by this point in my life,

121
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:15,728
I'd have somebody special
to share my success with.

122
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,812
You always got me, Fred.

123
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:22,607
Thanks, Barn.
That's not really what I'm talking about.

124
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,528
Yeah, I know.

125
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,072
- What are you talkin' about?
- A girl, Barn!

126
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh, yeah, right. That's what I thought.

127
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,659
But I wouldn't worry about it.
You'll meet somebody.

128
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:42,538
It's like they always say,
"It'll happen when you least expect it."

129
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:45,290
Now, see, that's where you're wrong, Barn.

130
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:48,626
I believe you create
your own opportunities in life.

131
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,296
You gotta go out there
and make things happen.

132
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,839
It's not like something's gonna
just drop out of the sky,

133
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:58,300
land in front of you
and change your whole life.

134
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,071
What was that?

135
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:37,337
Help! Is there anybody out there?

136
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,797
"Gort! <i>Klaatu barada nikto!"</i>

137
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,257
Fred, I think there's somebody in there.

138
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,260
- Come on, let's try to open it up.
- I'm right behind you, pal.

139
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,866
I don't know, Barn, the thing looks empty.

140
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:17,118
Would you mind not holding me
by the antennae?

141
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:20,329
It's not an altogether pleasant sensation.

142
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:24,874
- Oh, Barn, get me outta here. Get me up!
- Come on, pal.

143
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,094
What are you?

144
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:40,471
I am the Great Gazoo.

145
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:44,140
- The great "Kazoo"?
- Gazoo.

146
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,892
I come from a planet too far for you to fathom,

147
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:50,645
and a civilization too advanced
for you to comprehend.

148
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:54,773
- Wait a minute, Fred. I'll bet we get wishes!
- Pardon?

149
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:57,900
We let you out of the fancy bottle.
Now we get wishes, right?

150
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:01,319
Yeah, Barney's right. Let's get this started.
What do we have to rub?

151
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:05,072
Now, look here.
I am not some sort of friendly cartoon genie.

152
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:08,032
And that is not a bottle. It is a spacecraft.

153
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:11,367
I am of a highly-evolved alien species.

154
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,953
I don't do funny voices.
I don't sing catchy songs.

155
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:19,623
And I do not possess a magic carpet for
your big, bloated behinds to float upon!

156
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:23,292
I am here to observe your species'
mating rituals.

157
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,919
- Okay, dum-dums?
- Dum-dums?

158
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:28,004
Hey, was that an insult?

159
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,298
- If the shoe fits...
- What's a shoe?

160
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:34,801
- Yes, it was an insult.
- That's what I thought.

161
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:37,511
- You're here to observe.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:40,847
Well, get ready to observe
your teeth leaving your head.

163
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:44,266
There he is, Fred!

164
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:49,562
Ooh! Violent natives.
That will put a damper on tourism.

165
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,442
Perhaps you can satisfy
my intellectual curiosity.

166
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,068
- Fine. And you?
- Oh, dear.

167
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:08,160
<i>We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out</i>

168
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:12,288
<i>We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream and shout</i>

169
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:15,916
<i>Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock</i>

170
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:18,292
<i>Rock till we pop
We're gonna rock till we drop</i>

171
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,294
<i>We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out</i>

172
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:29,635
I'm Betty. I'll be your waitress.

173
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,221
The fish is fresh, but be careful,
so are the busboys.

174
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:36,932
So, what are you having?

175
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,184
What am I having? Oh!

176
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,019
Ah, gosh.

177
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,312
How much is a glass of water?

178
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,937
Water? Free.

179
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,980
Great. I'll have two.

180
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:54,360
You want a burger to go with your water?

181
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,963
Oh, no. Water's fine. I like water.

182
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:01,383
Because if you're short on cash or something,
I could spot you.

183
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,759
Then you could go home
and get your wallet and pay me back.

184
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,469
No, that's impossible. I can't.

185
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:09,555
I just... I can't go home, so...

186
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:13,933
Oh, my! Are you caveless?

187
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:16,435
But you're so clean!

188
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:20,271
- Oh, no, you see...
- You poor, poor thing.

189
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:24,149
Oh, great. I just called you "poor."
I'm so thoughtless sometimes.

190
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,110
- Listen...
- You're not poor. You're not.

191
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,611
- No, I'm not.
- You're just down on your luck, right?

192
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:34,615
Well, don't you worry. You'll stay with me
till you're back on your feet.

193
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,658
And I'm gonna buy you lunch.

194
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:40,202
- No, absolutely not. That's very sweet, but...
- Please.

195
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:45,206
I used to volunteer at the caveless shelter.
And I know.

196
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,874
I know you're not looking for a handout.

197
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,334
You're just looking for your self-respect.

198
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:53,795
I'm Betty. Betty O'Shale.

199
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:56,088
Just call me Wilma.

200
00:14:56,171 --> 00:15:00,633
Okay, Wilma.
Let's go get you something to eat.

201
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,968
Then we'll set you up at my apartment.

202
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,428
- You live in an apartment?
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,471
That must be so great!

204
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:10,598
I always wondered what it would be like
to live in an apartment.

205
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:15,144
Life can be so cruel sometimes.

206
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:33,702
- Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Barn.

207
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,369
Good night, dum-dums.

208
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:37,162
Oooh!

209
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,457
Oh. Hey, look, it's that Kazoo.

210
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,377
Gazoo. Why is that so difficult?

211
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,503
What are you doing here?

212
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:53,008
I am here to observe your species'
mating rituals. So, get to it!

213
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:56,511
Barney and me don't...

214
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,096
Get off of me!

215
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:05,015
Listen, pal, you've got a lot to
learn about the way things work here.

216
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,642
So who or what do you mate with, hmm?

217
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,017
Girls!

218
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,018
And where are these girls?

219
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,813
I've been asking myself the same thing.

220
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:35,958
<i>Seven nights of rock</i>

221
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,043
<i>Seven nights of roll</i>

222
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:42,463
<i>Seven nights I'm gonna show my face
with a different woman in a different place</i>

223
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:47,634
<i>Seven nights of rock
Well, I got seven nights of roll</i>

224
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,844
<i>Monday
I wanna rock with Jane</i>

225
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,054
<i>Tuesday
It's gonna be Lorraine</i>

226
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,930
Ohhh!

227
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,558
I got it!

228
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,935
Are you hurt, Wilma?

229
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,519
Who's Wilma?

230
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,397
<i>Seven nights of rock
Seven nights of roll</i>

231
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:11,025
<i>Seven nights I'm gonna show my face
with a different woman in a different place</i>

232
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:15,070
<i>Seven nights of rock
Well, I got seven nights of roll</i>

233
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,701
At last, some hormonal activity.

234
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:27,079
Okay, boys, time to get busy.
I don't get paid by the hour.

235
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,704
Keep quiet, Gazoo.

236
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,246
You want to see us meet some girls,

237
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:31,746
you're gonna have to hang back.

238
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:34,790
- We don't want you cramping our style.
- Style?

239
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:39,460
Ha! <i>Numero uno,</i>
if you knew the first thing about style,

240
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,128
you'd know that animal prints are passÃ©.

241
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,753
And secondly, dum-dum...

242
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:46,338
That's another thing.
Enough with the dum-dum.

243
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:50,716
My name is Fred Flintstone.
F-L-I-N...

244
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:52,508
- T...
- Stone.

245
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:56,761
I don't care who you are.
It doesn't give you any reason to shout.

246
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:00,096
- I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to him.
- Who, him?

247
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,098
No, him, the little green guy.
Don't you see him?

248
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:07,726
Wait a minute. He thought I was...

249
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,436
Wait a minute.

250
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,689
Are you telling me we're the only people
who could see you?

251
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,732
Ding-ding-ding. You got one right.

252
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,109
Care to take "prehistoric imbeciles" for 200?

253
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:21,527
So all day, Barn and me
have been talkin' to you,

254
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,778
and everybody probably thought
we were a couple of...

255
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,279
Dum-dums?

256
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:34,245
I got a good feeling.
Today could be my day. Who knows?

257
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:37,872
Why, I could turn around now
and meet the girl of my dreams.

258
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,125
What'll it be, boys?

259
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:46,504
Pay attention, Barn.
You'll never want for companionship again.

260
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,675
Ahhh.

261
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,969
Humina, humina, humina...

262
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,012
Sorry, no substitutions.

263
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,181
No, I...

264
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,186
Oh! You want a date?

265
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,732
Well, I've gone out with men who've said less.

266
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,986
Why not?
You can take me to the carnival tomorrow.

267
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,286
Oh, ah...

268
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:32,746
Your little friend want a date, too?

269
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,167
Oh, help!

270
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:44,296
I got the perfect girl. Be right back.

271
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:47,674
Barney, tonight we shower.

272
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,298
I may not know much
about your courting rituals,

273
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,925
but I'll go out on a limb
and say this can't be going very well...

274
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,816
<i>See the 40-year-old man,
one of nature's miracles.</i>

275
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,734
<i>Step right up! Step right up!</i>

276
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,985
<i>Only one clam gets two of you in.</i>

277
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:49,868
This is amazing! I can't believe it!

278
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,828
- It's so noisy!
- Yeah, I noticed.

279
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,705
That looks like bowling. Barney, can we play?

280
00:20:56,871 --> 00:21:01,250
Yeah, sure,
but Fred and I go bowling all the time.

281
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,587
That's a dumb idea!
Who's gonna pay to see dinosaurs?

282
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,089
I got dinosaurs in my backyard.

283
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:18,973
Wow... You got a really great laugh.

284
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:22,725
Yeah, so do you.

285
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,523
Hey, do you like Brontocoasters?

286
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:34,400
- I'll race you to it.
- You're on.

287
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:51,916
Whew!

288
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,839
This is gonna be fun, huh?

289
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:05,719
So, what do you wanna do first?

290
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,262
Ah...

291
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,971
What was your name again?

292
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:17,937
Come on, pretty boy. Come on!

293
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:27,237
Watch.

294
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:36,245
You don't got it, girl. You couldn't hit
the broad side of a brontosaurus!

295
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,508
That was a good shot. Wasn't it?

296
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:52,218
Well, that's a pretty tough spare...

297
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:54,887
For most people.

298
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,190
We got a winner.

299
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:14,613
Ah, these things
never live longer than a week.

300
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:18,366
Hey, Fred, do you think you could teach me
how to throw like that?

301
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,284
Sure. Let's see what you've got.

302
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:23,577
Oh! Okay.

303
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,330
Okay.

304
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,623
Okay. Whoops!

305
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:32,999
Ooh!

306
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,877
- I'm done.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Let me help you.

307
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:41,589
Give me your hand. Middle fingers.

308
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,382
Okay.

309
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:47,218
Now take the weight. Oh!

310
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,226
Now relax.

311
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,770
It's all in the toes.

312
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,940
And...

313
00:24:24,293 --> 00:24:26,837
I did it!

314
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:29,798
Oh, yeah!

315
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,847
Hey, Fred! Fred!

316
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:39,848
Hey, Fred!

317
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:44,601
Look, I know I ran off with Betty,

318
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,977
but Wilma was kinda my date.

319
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,688
So I was wondering
if it wouldn't be too much trouble if...

320
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:52,522
Well, if, ah...

321
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:55,107
What are you
trying to say, Barn?

322
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,025
Would you mind if I left with Betty?

323
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,903
No! Not at all, buddy. Hey, take the car.

324
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:03,862
Thanks, pal. Thanks a bunch.

325
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:07,198
She says she wants to go back to our place
and cook me breakfast.

326
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,534
I don't know what
we're gonna do until then.

327
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,036
But you know I can't
turn down a good meal!

328
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,798
It's kinda chilly all of a sudden, isn't it?

329
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:30,968
Chilly? Are you kiddin'?
The earth's still coolin' around here.

330
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:36,890
Still, I wish I'd brought something
to drape over my shoulders.

331
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,226
Oh!

332
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,686
Thank you.

333
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,521
Nice opening gambit, lover boy.

334
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:49,523
Now, close the deal so I can
get off this barren rock.

335
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:51,566
I'm ignoring you right now.

336
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,859
What did you say?

337
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:59,739
I said, "I'm adoring you right now."

338
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,575
Oh, Fred! That's so sweet.

339
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:06,744
Come on, come on!

340
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:08,703
You're in the red zone.

341
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:12,664
<i>La, la, la, la, la
Isn't it all so romantic?</i>

342
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:14,998
<i>Now, hurry up and kiss her</i>

343
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,755
Your eyes are like two big eyes.

344
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:42,106
Oh, yuck!

345
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:45,275
That's so cute!
He thinks you're his mother.

346
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,359
Down, boy, down!

347
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:50,236
Whoa!

348
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,281
Heh-heh-heh.

349
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,118
I lead a simple life.

350
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,788
As long as I got a roof over my head,
food on the table,

351
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:06,373
and a sharp shell to shave with,
I'm a happy guy.

352
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:12,587
Fred, you are so different
than the kind of guys I grew up with.

353
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:16,506
- Really? What are they like?
- Real different.

354
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,177
This is it.

355
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,307
I had a great time tonight.

356
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,228
I sure hope you did, too.

357
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:35,771
I wouldn't change a thing.

358
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:41,400
Well... Good night.

359
00:27:43,318 --> 00:27:45,153
Good night.

360
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,243
- Good night.
- Good night.

361
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,039
Good night.

362
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:31,628
Yabba-dabba-doo!

363
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:39,009
<i>One, two, one, two, three, ow</i>

364
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,896
<i>Wake up, kids
We got the dreamers' disease</i>

365
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,483
<i>Age 14, it's got you down on your knees</i>

366
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,486
<i>So polite, we're busy still sayin' please</i>

367
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:07,492
<i>But when the night is falling</i>

368
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:12,330
<i>You cannot find the light</i>

369
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,874
<i>You feel your dreams are dyin'</i>

370
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:19,335
<i>Hold tight</i>

371
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:21,586
<i>You got the music in you</i>

372
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,545
<i>Don't let go</i>

373
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,546
<i>You got the music in you</i>

374
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:29,883
<i>One dance left
This world is gonna pull through</i>

375
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:34,011
<i>Don't give up
You got a reason to live</i>

376
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:39,015
<i>Can't forget
We only get what we give</i>

377
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:48,523
<i>I'm comin' home, baby
One dance left</i>

378
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:09,208
Good mornin', Fred. What a beautiful day!

379
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:13,378
I was just thinkin' the same thing,
Barney boy. Beautiful!

380
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:17,047
So I take it you and Wilma had a nice evening.

381
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,800
Are you kiddin'?
Barn, I've never met anyone like her.

382
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:23,635
This Wilma, I think she may be the one.

383
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:26,137
I feel the same way about Betty.

384
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,430
- She's smart.
- She's hot.

385
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:30,181
- Kind.
- Funny.

386
00:30:30,222 --> 00:30:32,891
- Classy.
- She's hot.

387
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:36,227
Beautiful!

388
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,985
You know, Wilma,
you really should wear your hair up.

389
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:48,613
- Like I need more height!
- No, look.

390
00:30:51,657 --> 00:30:53,784
It really brings out your smile.

391
00:30:55,827 --> 00:31:00,081
Well, I guess I just have a whole lot more
to smile about these days.

392
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:02,833
And I owe it all to you.

393
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,377
You're the first real friend I've ever had.

394
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:09,255
You've had a tough life.
You deserve a few breaks.

395
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,466
Actually, Betty, it hasn't been all that tough.

396
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:20,263
You see, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you...

397
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,182
And I've been real scared, but I think now...

398
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,267
Pizza's here.

399
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:32,522
Good evening. I'm looking for a...

400
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:34,607
Mother?

401
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:37,275
Wilma, is that you?

402
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,944
What is this place?

403
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:44,448
This is an apartment.
It's how a lot of people live.

404
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:47,283
Well, that doesn't make it right.

405
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,118
And who are you? The cleaning woman?

406
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,120
You're obviously doing a terrible job.
You're fired. Go on, shoo!

407
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:58,291
Mother, Mother!
This is my new best friend, Betty.

408
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,127
She's been very good to me.

409
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:03,253
And I've been a regular Joan Crawfish.

410
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:09,466
Wilma, I'm going to take my bath now.
Good luck.

411
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:10,674
Yuck!

412
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:14,010
Mother, how did you find me?

413
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:17,637
I did what any concerned parent would do.
Hired a detective.

414
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,347
- You what?
- We'll discuss everything on the way home.

415
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:22,932
- Come on.
- I am home, Mother.

416
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:25,475
And I'm happier than
I have ever been in my life.

417
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:30,813
You can throw me in a sack and drag
me home, but I'll just run away again.

418
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,982
Fine, Wilma, fine.

419
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,983
You've broken my heart.

420
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:40,111
But I will not allow you to do the same thing

421
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:42,070
to your dear, frail father.

422
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,990
Oh, darling, he misses you so much.

423
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:50,119
And if you're not home
on Sunday to celebrate his birthday,

424
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:54,831
well, I just don't know
how many more birthdays

425
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:58,876
he's going to be around to celebrate.

426
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:11,680
I wonder why Wilma gave us
these suits to wear for the party.

427
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,973
Maybe it's a costume party.

428
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,479
Stay.

429
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,439
Dino, stay.

430
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:29,986
Come on, Barn, let's pick up the girls.

431
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,046
So, Barn, what do you think?

432
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:56,301
Oh, Fred, you shouldn't have.

433
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,761
It's not for you, nitwit. It's for Wilma.

434
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:00,011
Oh.

435
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:01,845
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

436
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:07,183
Dum-dum, there appears to be a tiny flake
of something stuck to your ring.

437
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:09,184
Look. Just there.

438
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:12,353
- That's the stone, Gazoo.
- Oops.

439
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,981
- It's all I could afford.
- Sorry.

440
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:21,902
Well, I'm sure she'll be very
impressed by your frugality.

441
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:26,447
That's the great thing about Wilma.
I don't feel the need to impress her.

442
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:30,575
She's just a simple girl with simple tastes.

443
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:38,374
You know, there are a couple things about me

444
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:42,168
I haven't gotten around
to telling you guys yet.

445
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:46,045
Well, welcome to Slaghoople Manor.

446
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:48,838
Your house has a name?

447
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,438
Fred, look! A Cadi-roc limo!

448
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:18,113
Betty, I'm sorry. I was just so ashamed.

449
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:22,324
I should have realized a caveless girl
couldn't afford to wear Isaac Mizrocki.

450
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:26,452
- Wilma! Wilma's home, everybody.
- Genevieve...

451
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:28,536
Barney.

452
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:33,332
She's loaded.

453
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,458
Fred, it looks like you really lucked out.

454
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:37,792
No, Barn! This is terrible!

455
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,377
I can't give her this measly ring.
Look at her house!

456
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:43,337
A girl like this
is used to the best of everything.

457
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:46,464
She's gonna take one look at this ring
and laugh at me.

458
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,151
Barn, it's a good thing I didn't get
the chance to give it to her sooner.

459
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,319
Hey, what are you doin'? Hey!

460
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,904
This little mug's tryin' to steal my car!

461
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,239
No, sir! I'm the valet!

462
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,867
The ballet? I don't care if you're going to
the opera. You're not going in my car!

463
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:05,078
Fred! Barney! Get off of him!

464
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,455
Fred, he's the valet. He parks the car.

465
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,415
I knew that.

466
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:13,583
Come on, Fred.

467
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:19,797
Valet parking! First, cooked food, now this.
What'll they think of next?

468
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:33,183
Wilma! Wilma, darling, we're over here.

469
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,106
Wilma, darling, you look... Nice.

470
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:43,149
Thank you, Mother. Hello.

471
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:45,442
Happy birthday, Daddy.

472
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:46,943
Huh?

473
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:50,654
Oh, yes, yes. Any news from the front?

474
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:52,947
- Ah. Morale is excellent, sir.
- Good.

475
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:57,408
Mother, Father,
I'd like you to meet my new boyfriend, Fred.

476
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,326
Cavalry, mount up.

477
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:04,287
We're moving out. Charge!

478
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,878
- A pleasure.
- Charmed.

479
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:15,630
Wilma, darling,

480
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:19,842
there's somebody here
who's simply dying to see you again.

481
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:22,469
Chip, over here.

482
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:24,137
Mother, Chip's here?

483
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:26,555
Of course, Chip's here.

484
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,473
- He's practically family.
- Who's Chip?

485
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,515
We used to date. "Used to," Mother.

486
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:35,560
- Wilma, you look lovelier than ever.
- Thank you.

487
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:39,146
I love your hair up like that.

488
00:37:39,312 --> 00:37:43,566
- Oh, I see you've brought a...
- Date.

489
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:46,943
Wilma, Wilma, look, look.
The Rathbones have arrived.

490
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,237
You've got to come and see Tiffany's
new nose. It's between her eyes now.

491
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,321
Come on.

492
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:56,658
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Chip Rockefeller.

493
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,618
Of the Mesozoic Rockefellers.

494
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,952
I'm Fred Flintstone of the, uh,

495
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,578
Fredizoic Flintstone stones.

496
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,831
What line of work are you in?

497
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,750
It so happens I'll be hanging my hat
at the quarry.

498
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,418
Oh, you bought Slate and Company!

499
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,503
No, I'm a Brontocrane operator.

500
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,214
Seriously, what do you do?

501
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:24,300
I work down at the quarry.
I'm a Brontocrane operator.

502
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:29,137
You are serious!
How embarrassing for you.

503
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:32,765
Fellas, Wilma's date works

504
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,307
at the quarry!

505
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,059
He's a Brontocrane operator!

506
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,465
Ahhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh!

507
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,721
Hi, Betty!

508
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:25,102
Did I tell you that that's a really pretty dress?

509
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:26,936
Thank you.

510
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:32,315
- Oh, Betty, you're not still mad at me, are ya?
- Mad?

511
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:38,153
Just because you pretended to be poor,
and I took you in and I felt sorry for you?

512
00:39:40,905 --> 00:39:43,616
Why would that make me mad?

513
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:52,082
Yoo-hoo!

514
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,376
Having fun, princess?

515
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:59,588
- Not really.
- That's my girl!

516
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:05,426
- I have a little something for your birthday.
- Daddy, it's your birthday!

517
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:07,510
It is? Oh.

518
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:10,429
Well, these won't fit me.

519
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:14,681
Oh, they're beautiful!

520
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,223
Yes!

521
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,517
I know you don't like showy things,

522
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,893
but these were your
great-great-grandmother's.

523
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:25,020
- Oh!
- In fact, they came right out of her shell.

524
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,568
Oh, Wilma. Whatever you decide to do,

525
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,777
I want you to know something.

526
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:37,571
Your daddy will always love you.

527
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,449
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Yes!

528
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:57,421
Wow, Wilma, sure are beautiful pearls!

529
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:01,299
- Thank you, Fred.
- They look really expensive.

530
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:09,640
Ladies and gentlemen...

531
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:12,225
I'd like to propose a toast.

532
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,312
To the Colonel on his birthday.

533
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,897
Although he's a man
of great wealth and power,

534
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,150
he has the most precious gifts a man
could ever want. A loving wife...

535
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:28,279
And the most beautiful daughter
the world has ever seen.

536
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,573
- To the Colonel!
- To the Colonel!

537
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:45,333
- I'd also like to propose a toast.
- Must you?

538
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,839
To Mr. Slaghoople...

539
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,841
- "Colonel" Slaghoople!
- Yes?

540
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:57,968
Mrs. Slaghoople,

541
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:01,178
and most of all... Wilma.

542
00:42:03,763 --> 00:42:07,683
Ah, thanks for the invite.

543
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,479
You know, I've never been inside a place
this big without paying admission.

544
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:18,400
At first I felt a little uncomfortable,

545
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:23,070
much the same as you would if you were
to stumble into one of my lodge meetings,

546
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:26,197
the Loyal Order of the Water Buffalos.

547
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,466
Waka, waka, wee!

548
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,634
Waka, waka, who?

549
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:37,973
No, no! Dino, bad!

550
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,649
Dino, no!

551
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,152
Dino!

552
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:00,576
Oh, Dino!

553
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:06,164
You! This is all your fault!
You ruined my entire party.

554
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:10,792
You idiot! You buffoon!
You, you... Commoner!

555
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,709
Get out.

556
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:16,169
Get out of my house now!

557
00:43:16,252 --> 00:43:17,920
Hey, watch it.

558
00:43:18,086 --> 00:43:19,670
Stop it!

559
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:25,008
How can you treat people this way?

560
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:28,177
Is it because they're not like you?
You know what?

561
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:31,846
That is why I like them,
because they're not like you.

562
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:36,600
They like me for who I am, not who I am.

563
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:40,019
I mean...

564
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:42,520
You know what I mean.

565
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,230
How dare you talk to me like that, Wilma!

566
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:49,317
No one has ever talked to me like that before!

567
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:54,154
Well, Mother,
maybe it's about time somebody did.

568
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:55,946
Oh.

569
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:57,864
Let's go, Fred.

570
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:02,326
We're right behind you, Wilma.

571
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:04,869
Thanks, Betty.

572
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:12,834
Wilma? Wilma, wait.

573
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,626
Please don't go.

574
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:18,921
You were right back there. The way I...
The way everyone's behaved today

575
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:21,380
- has been inexcusable.
- Thank you, Chip.

576
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:24,590
Congratulations, Flintstone.
I really mean that. The better man won.

577
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:27,718
And just to show
that there are no hard feelings,

578
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:31,888
I'd like to invite the four of you to
the opening of my new casino in Rock Vegas.

579
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:35,557
You lovebirds can take in the sites,
relax in the luxury accommodations

580
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,018
and enjoy the opening night concert gala
by Mick Jagged and the Stones.

581
00:44:39,184 --> 00:44:40,894
The Stones?

582
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,439
<i>This isn't love
This is destiny</i>

583
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:48,066
What do you say, Wilma?

584
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:51,401
Well, Chip, I...

585
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:55,905
We really appreciate your gesture,
but I don't think now is a good time...

586
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:58,490
Hmm, Rock Vegas, eh?

587
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,458
We'd love to go.

588
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:21,008
<i>Bright light city gonna set my soul</i>

589
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:24,385
<i>Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

590
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:28,221
<i>Got a whole lotta money
that's ready to burn</i>

591
00:45:28,262 --> 00:45:31,265
<i>You better get those stakes up high</i>

592
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:34,851
<i>There's a thousand guys waiting out there</i>

593
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:38,395
<i>And they're all living devil-may-care</i>

594
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:41,981
<i>And I'm just a little devil
with a lot of love to spare</i>

595
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:45,441
<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

596
00:45:45,524 --> 00:45:48,443

597
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:51,946
<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

598
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,625
<i>How I wish that there were many more</i>

599
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:08,585
<i>Than the 24 hours of a day</i>

600
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:12,463
<i>But even if there were 40 more</i>

601
00:46:12,796 --> 00:46:16,800
<i>I wouldn't sleep a minute away
No, no, no</i>

602
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:19,635

00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:23,096

00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:32,853

<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

608
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,109
Way to go, Barney!

609
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:45,155
<i>Viva Rock Vegas with your neon flashing
and your one-arm bandits crashing</i>

610
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,658
<i>And all those hopes down the drain</i>

611
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:52,453
<i>Viva Rock Vegas turning day into nighttime</i>

612
00:46:52,494 --> 00:46:54,329
<i>Night into daytime</i>

00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,874
<i>If you see it once
You'll never be the same again</i>

614
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:01,084
<i>I guarantee it</i>

00:47:02,835 --> 00:47:05,462
<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

616
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,464
<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

617
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,090
<i>Viva</i>

618
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:15,343
<i>Viva Rock Vegas</i>

619
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,323
Great day, huh?

620
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,657
I hope it never ends.

621
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:49,956
Oh, young love!

622
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:53,792
- It's a shame it won't last, hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,257
Just you wait, Roxie, dear.

624
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,594
This man is my puppet,
and I've barely begun to pull the strings.

625
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:10,931
Soon Wilma will see him
for the pathetic primitive primate he really is.

626
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:13,933
You told me you were over this Wilma person.

627
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,185
What do I have to do to convince you?

628
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:21,021
Diamonds? A Maserocki?

629
00:48:21,062 --> 00:48:25,066
Your own show in the Stalactite Lounge?

630
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:28,902
Very nice, Chip! But I prefer cash.

631
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:32,613
- What a coincidence. So do we.
- Yeah.

632
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:36,908
Oh, Rocko and Rocko, my favorite made men!

633
00:48:37,074 --> 00:48:39,242
What can I do for you gentlemen?

634
00:48:39,408 --> 00:48:43,787
The boss wants his money.
He says he don't think you got it.

635
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,415
That's... Not entirely true,

636
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:49,791
nor is it entirely false.

637
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,251
He don't entirely care.

638
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:55,754
But he wants all of his money
by midnight Sunday,

639
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:57,630
or he starts taking your casinos.

640
00:48:57,796 --> 00:49:01,734
- And breaking your legs!
- This is a moot discussion, gentlemen,

641
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:05,070
because by Sunday evening,
I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople

642
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:09,448
and one of the greatest personal fortunes
in the uncivilized world.

643
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:13,493
- You'd better be...
- Or you'll be sleepin' with the Tunasauruses!

644
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,755
The plot thickens.

645
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:45,146
Oh, this is heaven!

646
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:49,733
Could you get between my shoulder blades?
That's where I carry my tension.

647
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:53,569
Ha! She's tense.
I just found out what calamari means.

648
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,739
Wilma, can I ask you something?

649
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,907
Sure, Betty. What's up?

650
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:03,242
Do you think Barney's serious about me?

651
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:07,203
What are you talkin' about?
He's crazy about you.

652
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:09,120
I hope so.

653
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:12,747
I've never met anyone like Bernard Rubble.

654
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,707
He's so loyal.

655
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:21,128
And so sweet! He makes me feel
like I'm the only girl in this whole flat world.

656
00:50:21,753 --> 00:50:26,424
That's exactly how Fred makes me feel.
I mean, Chip,

657
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:29,009
it was always about money.

658
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,472
Fred doesn't have a greedy bone
in his entire body.

659
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:38,892
Yabba-dabba-dough!

660
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,978
Look at all these clams!

661
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:44,980
You got enough there to buy Wilma
a ring for each finger.

662
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:47,065
And maybe a little stud for me too.

663
00:50:47,106 --> 00:50:49,149
So, what do you say we go cash out?

664
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:54,069
What, are you crazy? That's your problem,
Barn. You think too small.

665
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:56,278
I'm not just gonna stop at a ring.

666
00:50:56,444 --> 00:51:00,448
I'm gonna buy her a whole lifestyle,
just like Chip Rockefeller.

667
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:04,534
But she doesn't want some smart, rich,
handsome guy. She wants you.

668
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:08,579
Hey, buzz off, cave boy.
The man's got magic hands.

669
00:51:09,788 --> 00:51:13,666
I know this will be difficult for you,
but let's think for a moment.

670
00:51:13,832 --> 00:51:19,087
Chip Rockefeller flew you to his casino,
in his plane, to play at his tables.

671
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:22,965
And against odds of 247,000 to one,

672
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:25,383
you have rolled 17 straight winners.

673
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,509
Can we connect the dots?

674
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:31,512
Sure! Today's my lucky day!

675
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:36,099
Good luck, dum-dum. You'll need it.

676
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:38,725
Come on, babies!

677
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:43,562
Lucky seven!

678
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:47,148
What did I tell you, Barn? Magic!

679
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:50,192
It's not magic. It's skill.

680
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:54,821
A gentleman gambler like you
should be playing with the high rollers.

681
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,156
The high rollers?

682
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,117
Well, I was just getting warmed up,
building my bankroll.

683
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:03,785
Bankroll? Please! I'll give you a line of credit.

684
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:05,661
- Credit?
- Sure!

685
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:08,830
The house fronts you a little extra,
you pay it back. A man of your skill?

686
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:11,999
Please, I'd be honored
to have you on a house account.

687
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,834
Fred! Don't do it.

688
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,669
That's how my uncle, the gambler,
lost everything.

689
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:20,420
He lost his wife, his house, his kids, his dog...

690
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:23,088
Did you know we have
an all-you-can-eat buffet by the pool?

691
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:26,883
- Fred, please, I... All you can eat?
- Absolutely!

692
00:52:26,966 --> 00:52:29,009
I'd like you to meet Roxie.
She's my lead Rockette.

693
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:31,844
Roxie, would you show Mr. Rubble the buffet?

694
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,388
It would bring me great pleasure.

695
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:38,516
Come on, Flintstone.
I'll show you to your table,

696
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:40,851
and I'll have the pit boss bring you
a big pile of clams.

697
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:43,019
New shooter.

698
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:48,982
Read 'em and weep, boys. Four lovely ladies.

699
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,818
- Fred!
- Make that six. Where have you two been?

700
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,613
We've been waiting for you
at the Kavern Klub.

701
00:52:56,696 --> 00:52:59,740
Oh, right, I'm sorry. I've been on a roll.

702
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:01,699
Hey, where's Barney?

703
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:05,619
Barney? He went off to the buffet
with some showgirl.

704
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:07,036
A showgirl?

705
00:53:13,205 --> 00:53:18,084
You know, when they say, "all you can eat,"
they don't mean till you explode.

706
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,335
I'm just getting started.

707
00:53:21,544 --> 00:53:24,880
Ooh, look at the size of that pie.

708
00:53:25,046 --> 00:53:27,465
Waiter. Waiter, over here!

709
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:29,966
Let me. Waiter!

710
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:41,643
Ooh, uh, let me help.

711
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,111
Get off!

712
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:00,698
Thanks, darling.

713
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:03,533
All right, babes, I love you, but I gotta go.

714
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,618
- Catch you later!
- Ooh!

715
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,459
Hello, love.

716
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:21,171
Are you...

717
00:54:21,337 --> 00:54:24,631
Yeah. Mick Jagged.

718
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:26,257
At your service.

719
00:54:27,716 --> 00:54:28,883
Oh.

720
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:30,050
And you are?

721
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:34,678
Betty. Betty O'Shale.

722
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:38,473
What's a lovely bird like you
doing all on your lonesome, eh?

723
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:42,601
- My boyfriend... He was...
- Yeah?

724
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:46,771
I saw him... With another girl.

725
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:50,625
Aw, sweetheart. I'll tell you what.

726
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,921
If you was my lady, you wouldn't catch me
even touching another girl. Not never!

727
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,381
Unless I'm on the road.
On the road doesn't count.

728
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,592
Here, here, here.

729
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,427
Why don't you try stopping crying

730
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:09,137
and give Mickie a little smile, eh?

731
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,764
There, that's better.

732
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:16,727
You do look lovely when you smile,
Miss Betty O'Shale.

733
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:20,396
Thank you.

734
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:24,650
What do you say we go meet me band mates,

735
00:55:24,816 --> 00:55:28,528
then maybe go somewhere more quiet,
so we can

736
00:55:28,694 --> 00:55:31,279
talk a little bit more, yeah?

737
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:40,621
3,041, 3,042...

738
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,665
What's going on down there?

739
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:48,544
Hey, Fred, look!
There's Mick Jagged and the Stones!

740
00:55:55,592 --> 00:55:58,094
And there's Betty. She's with the band.

741
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:01,388
What would Betty be doing with the Stones?

742
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:04,515
Yeah. She doesn't even play an instrument.

743
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:07,892
Betty! Betty, up here! It's me, Barney!

744
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:09,559
Betty!

745
00:56:13,896 --> 00:56:16,106
- Betty!
- Hello.

746
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,943
Excuse me, excuse me. Betty!

747
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:23,444
Wait a minute, Betty, please!

748
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:28,031
14,542...

749
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:30,449
15,542.

750
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:35,786
Look, Fred, let's do something together, huh?
We could go bowling.

751
00:56:36,286 --> 00:56:38,246
Bowling?

752
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:40,580
Bowling's for poor people.

753
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:45,791
Looks like you and Chip
have a little more in common than I thought.

754
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,293
Why? 'Cause we're both big winners?

755
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:53,256
Here, Fred. Buy yourself a clue.

756
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:56,300
Hey, Wilma. Wilma, wait...

757
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:02,180
Wilma, wait! Wilma!

758
00:57:02,263 --> 00:57:04,306
Wilma!

759
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,392
Honey, baby, what's the matter?

760
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,822
All right, Flintstone, you've lost Wilma.

761
00:57:22,863 --> 00:57:26,533
Now it's time to lose everything else.

762
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:41,003
Place your bets, folks! Place your bets.

763
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,555
One red. One red is the winner!

764
00:58:13,696 --> 00:58:16,407
Hello, Wilma. Been for a walk?

765
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:21,077
- Nothing gets by you, Chip.
- Oh, forgive me for disturbing you.

766
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:29,833
Oh, Chip. I'm so sorry.

767
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:35,713
- I've just got a lot on my mind.
- I've been on edge too.

768
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:41,218
Opening weekend, so many guests,
and now, all the room robberies.

769
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:44,303
- Robberies?
- It's nothing. It's just...

770
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:47,472
But just to be safe, I wish you'd let me

771
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:51,308
put those beautiful pearls
of yours in our safe.

772
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,604
Good idea, Chip.

773
00:58:56,729 --> 00:58:58,856
- They mean a lot to me.
- I know.

774
00:59:18,374 --> 00:59:20,376
It's up to you, baby.

775
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:22,460
Get me started again.

776
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:25,921
No, no, no! No!

777
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:30,633
Mr. Flintstone?
Mr. Rockefeller has extended an invitation

778
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,884
to join him at the fight.

779
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:45,685
More credit? No.

780
00:59:45,768 --> 00:59:47,770
No chance, no way, no how.

781
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:49,938
Do you know how much you owe already?

782
00:59:50,063 --> 00:59:51,439
Owe?

783
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:55,484
One million four-hundred thousand clams.

784
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,779
- Oh.
- It's gonna be a real shame

785
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,240
when Wilma finds out
what a loser her new boyfriend is.

786
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:07,118
Of course, she doesn't have to find out.

787
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:11,914
She doesn't? See that?
I knew you were a good guy.

788
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:14,874
I'm not.

789
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,127
I said I wouldn't tell her.
I didn't say you could still have her.

790
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:23,463
I'll erase your debt, Flintstone,
but you've gotta disappear.

791
01:00:23,504 --> 01:00:29,760
Out of town, out of Bedrock,
and never see or speak to Wilma again.

792
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,053
Wait a minute.

793
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:34,763
You had this planned all along.

794
01:00:34,804 --> 01:00:38,808
Tell me, how do you
even dress yourself in the morning?

795
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:43,020
Normally, I just wear what I fell asleep in.
What's that gotta do with anything?

796
01:00:43,228 --> 01:00:44,812
Goodbye, Flintstone.

797
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:50,400
Hey, you won't get away with this,
Rockefeller!

798
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,156
Rockefeller! Hey, Rockefeller!

799
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,533
You know what?
I don't care what happens to me,

800
01:01:03,824 --> 01:01:07,118
but I'm not gonna
let you weasel your way closer to Wilma.

801
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:10,996
Soon as I find her,
I'm gonna tell her exactly what's going on.

802
01:01:11,037 --> 01:01:13,831
Then we'll see how well your plan worked.

803
01:01:21,587 --> 01:01:22,838
What the...

804
01:01:25,423 --> 01:01:28,259
There has been a robbery.
All guests to the lobby.

805
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,218
Uh-oh, there appears to have been a robbery.

806
01:01:30,676 --> 01:01:35,013
We'll have to continue this conversation later,
Fred. Please, step this way.

807
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,799
Ladies and gentlemen!

808
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:59,677
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you
there is a criminal in our midst.

809
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:03,805
How old did you say you were?

810
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,973
But before I expose him to the public,

811
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,392
I'd like to give him the chance
to step forward and admit his wrongdoing,

812
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:13,228
if only to take the first
tiny step toward absolution.

813
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:18,107
I stole all the towels in my room!

814
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:21,067
Well, that is illegal, but still...

815
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,068
I'm wearing someone else's underwear!

816
01:02:23,276 --> 01:02:24,694
Eww!

817
01:02:25,653 --> 01:02:28,072
No, I was talking about a...

818
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:32,075
I'm systematically poisoning
the dinosaurs' water supply.

819
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:35,953
In a matter of decades,
their entire species will be extinct!

820
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:42,749
All right! This is obviously going nowhere.
I was talking about a necklace.

821
01:02:42,915 --> 01:02:46,001
A very valuable necklace
has been stolen from our hotel safe.

822
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:50,796
A necklace belonging to my dear,
dear friend, Wilma Slaghoople.

823
01:02:52,589 --> 01:02:55,216
- My pearls?
- Wilma.

824
01:02:55,382 --> 01:02:58,009
All right, who did it?

825
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:01,094
So help me, if you don't
step forward right now, I will personally...

826
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,971
I don't think violence
will be necessary, Flintstone,

827
01:03:04,137 --> 01:03:07,181
because I know exactly
who stole Wilma's pearls.

828
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:10,808
A desperate man,
drowning in gambling debts.

829
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:12,058
Lowlife!

830
01:03:12,224 --> 01:03:16,519
Hey, doesn't anybody care about this whole
dinosaurs-becoming-extinct thing?

831
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:17,852
No!

832
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:23,523
Fred, would you mind
emptying your pockets?

833
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:27,109
You think I stole Wilma's pearls?
Chip, that's...

834
01:03:27,192 --> 01:03:28,943
Why? Do you have something to hide, Fred?

835
01:03:29,485 --> 01:03:31,945
Definitely not! See for yourself.

836
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:33,362
I'm not...

837
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:39,158
Fred.

838
01:03:40,701 --> 01:03:43,036
Wait a minute. I didn't take these.

839
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:45,913
Wilma, why would I take your pearls?

840
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:51,250
Do you deny that you owe the casino over
a million clams with no way to pay it back?

841
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:54,544
Fred, is that true?

842
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:57,922
Yeah, but...

843
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:03,427
Wilma, darling, I'm so sorry.

844
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:12,727
Wilma. Wilma.

845
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:15,395
Wilma, you can't believe him! He set me up!

846
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:18,063
Security, take this man to jail!

847
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,648
You're coming with us.

848
01:04:20,814 --> 01:04:24,984
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

849
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,777
You're all making a big mistake.

850
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,905
Fred couldn't have stolen that necklace.
It was locked up in a safe.

851
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:35,658
Fred can't even remember
the combination to his bowling locker.

852
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:37,617
Look, he's gotta write it down
on his hand, see?

853
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:41,327
Ah, great, now everybody's seen it.

854
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,580
Huh? Crack a safe? He couldn't even
crack his knuckles without my help.

855
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:50,500
Thank you, Mr. Rubble, for confessing
to being Mr. Flintstone's accomplice.

856
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,919
You're welcome. What?

857
01:04:54,002 --> 01:04:55,628
Take them both away!

858
01:04:58,922 --> 01:05:01,507
Believe me! I'm innocent!

859
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,550
Everybody, gamble!

860
01:05:11,598 --> 01:05:13,057
Where's my little girl?

861
01:05:13,098 --> 01:05:15,934
Oh, my poor, poor baby.

862
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:18,102
Perfect.

863
01:05:18,143 --> 01:05:21,938
Everything's going to be all right now,
darling. Mummy's here.

864
01:05:22,438 --> 01:05:24,148
And I'm going.

865
01:05:29,153 --> 01:05:34,783
Wilma? I've already talked to Chip,
and he's willing to take you back.

866
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,827
What gives you the right
to interfere with my life?

867
01:05:38,661 --> 01:05:42,998
I'm your mother, and I love you.
And Chip loves you.

868
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:44,457
Chip loves money.

869
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,960
And you have money.
It's a match made in heaven.

870
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:50,586
Oh, Wilma.

871
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,254
Look, I think he's already proven his loyalty.

872
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,672
He saved you from that beast.

873
01:05:55,963 --> 01:05:58,590
Fred is not a beast.
He was just raised by them.

874
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:02,009
Ah, that explains the missing piece
of the puzzle.

875
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:05,970
Wilma, listen to me. Go back to Chip.

876
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:07,428
Please?

877
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:13,599
Darling,

878
01:06:13,765 --> 01:06:16,976
don't let Chip slip through your fingers again.

879
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:21,730
I just don't know how much more
pain that poor boy can endure.

880
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:25,399
I said you'll have your money by midnight.

881
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,568
The boss says he's got his doubts.
See, a little birdie told him

882
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,737
that you ain't even dating
the Slaghoople dame no more.

883
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:35,115
Hey, I might be out of a job tomorrow.

884
01:06:35,156 --> 01:06:37,825
Brother's got to have a little nest egg,
you dig?

885
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:42,704
Ah, that's preposterous!
We're getting married this evening. Honest.

886
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:45,665
Good. But if the bride don't show,

887
01:06:45,748 --> 01:06:47,666
you'll be spending your wedding night...

888
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:49,041
With me.

889
01:06:58,172 --> 01:07:00,299
I miss Betty.

890
01:07:00,465 --> 01:07:05,219
I know, Barn.
I'd do anything to see Wilma again.

891
01:07:05,385 --> 01:07:09,180
We'd be with 'em right now
if I hadn't been so stupid.

892
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:12,033
Now, I could've told you that.

893
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:13,158
Gazoo?

894
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:16,035
Gazoo! Oh, boy, are you a sight for sore eyes!

895
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:18,411
You gotta help us, buddy.
You gotta get us out.

896
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:21,747
"Buddy"? Did I hear that correctly?

897
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:25,166
I'm sorry, but are you not the same
Fred Flintstone who hurt my feelings so,

898
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:29,795
that I spent the rest of my vacation
in my room watching pay-per-view!

899
01:07:29,836 --> 01:07:32,296
You're right, you're right. I was wrong.

900
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:36,716
I tried to impress Wilma with money,

901
01:07:36,882 --> 01:07:39,968
and all I did was ruin everything,
like I always do.

902
01:07:40,468 --> 01:07:42,178
'Cause you know what I am?

903
01:07:42,636 --> 01:07:44,763
I'm nothing but a big...

904
01:07:46,473 --> 01:07:47,974
Yes?

905
01:07:49,308 --> 01:07:50,809
Dum-dum.

906
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:52,685
All opposed?

907
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,895
The ayes have it.

908
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,480
Oh, now, look.

909
01:07:57,563 --> 01:08:00,816
Just because you finally realized
what I knew right away,

910
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:05,611
that doesn't mean
I haven't developed a little soft spot for you.

911
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:09,614
- Really? So you're gonna bust us outta here?
- Whoo-hoo!

912
01:08:09,655 --> 01:08:12,532
<i>Gazoo's gonna bust us out
Gazoo's gonna bust us out</i>

913
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:14,116
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

914
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:18,035
Do I look like the cavalry?
Though those outfits are adorable.

915
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:20,953
No! You two know I can't actually interfere.

916
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:22,912
I'm only here to give you some information

917
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:26,373
I thought you might find enlightening.

918
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:31,503
Hey, I didn't know you could do that.

919
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:34,171
This is a moot discussion, gentlemen,
because by Sunday evening,

920
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:36,172
I shall be married to Wilma Slaghoople

921
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:39,382
and one of the greatest personal fortunes
in the uncivilized world.

922
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:42,134
Wilma's in trouble. We gotta get outta here.

923
01:08:42,217 --> 01:08:46,262
- Come on, you gotta help us, Gazoo.
- I wish I could. I really do.

924
01:08:46,428 --> 01:08:48,221
So you're just gonna let this happen?

925
01:08:48,888 --> 01:08:53,684
I've gotta sit in this cell while Wilma
walks down the aisle with the wrong guy.

926
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:56,895
We were supposed to live happily ever after.

927
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:59,105
Same with me and Betty.

928
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:04,692
Please, don't. Not emotions.

929
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:09,237
My race has prospered for eons without
the slightest trace of personal emotions,

930
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,071
and we couldn't be happier.

931
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:14,407
Well, of course, we don't actually get
happy because we don't have emotions.

932
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:19,285
Oh, this is so sad.

933
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:22,287
Somebody hold me!

934
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,445
- Blow.
- Barney, Barney, you can fit through the bars.

935
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:01,823
I can? I guess I should have
tried that earlier, huh?

936
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,368
Come on, come on, get the keys!

937
01:10:24,134 --> 01:10:26,845
- Hey. Back in your cage, shorty!
- Achoo!

938
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:41,192
Hi, Betty.

939
01:10:42,276 --> 01:10:44,111
Hi, Wilma!

940
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:46,279
I just came to say goodbye.

941
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:49,281
I heard you're going to Stonehenge
with Mick Jagged.

942
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:51,324
Yeah, I can't wait.

943
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:54,826
Chip's going around saying
you're getting back together.

944
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:57,452
I'm so happy for you.

945
01:10:58,411 --> 01:11:01,956
I'm so happy for you, too, Betty.

946
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:06,376
I've never been so happy.

947
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:10,546
Me neither. Oh, Betty!

948
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:14,799
- Oh, Wilma.
- Oh, oh, oh, Betty.

949
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:21,553
Hey, knock it off. You're big girls now.

950
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:25,806
Wilma, darling, you are doing the right thing.

951
01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:29,642
I married the Colonel for his money
and look how happy we are.

952
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:38,650
So... We meet again.

953
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:45,280
Spread out and find these guys.

954
01:11:45,822 --> 01:11:47,532
All right, fellas, let's leave no stone unturned.

955
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:49,033
We'll get 'em.

956
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:55,164
They're looking for us, Barn.
They got guards everywhere.

957
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:58,333
What are we gonna do, Fred?

958
01:11:58,499 --> 01:12:01,835
- We're just gonna have to fight our way in.
- But these guys are armed.

959
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:03,877
This is a war, Barn.

960
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,462
And in war, there's always
gonna be casualties.

961
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:09,714
I just want you to know
how much I appreciate your sacrifice.

962
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,798
Why do I gotta be the one
that gets sacrificed?

963
01:12:11,964 --> 01:12:14,675
Because I know I'm gonna get Wilma back.

964
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:17,552
Face it, Barn, there's no way Betty's gonna
dump Mick Jagged for you.

965
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:21,514
Therefore, I got more reason to live.

966
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:32,858
Come on, girls! Let's go! Come on, come on!

967
01:12:33,024 --> 01:12:35,359
Curtain's going up, curtain's going up!
Let's see you, come on out!

968
01:12:35,442 --> 01:12:38,361
Oh, you look lovely.
Come on, opening night. Let's see smiles.

969
01:12:38,694 --> 01:12:41,947
- There you go!
- See, Fred? Worked like a charm.

970
01:12:42,113 --> 01:12:46,700
- Go!
- Come on, no chitchat! Let's go. And sparkle!

971
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,893
The one near the end looks like a man.

972
01:13:14,934 --> 01:13:18,437
Yeah. Maybe your sister oughta try out.

973
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,747
It's them! Get 'em!

974
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:41,249
Barn, come on, let's get outta here now!

975
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,672
- Look out!
- Excuse me!

976
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:50,631
- Go, go! Get 'em!
- There they are!

977
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:57,762
<i>This isn't love
This is...</i>

978
01:13:57,928 --> 01:14:00,597
What do you think, Betty?
Should I stick my butt out a bit further?

979
01:14:00,638 --> 01:14:02,473
Hmm? Does it look good like that?

980
01:14:02,764 --> 01:14:06,267
Or maybe that's too much butt
for the opening of the show.

981
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:09,811
It's really up to you, Mick. You are the artist.

982
01:14:09,894 --> 01:14:13,480
Yeah, that I am, Betty. That I am.

983
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:17,709
Barney!

984
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:22,212
- Fred?
- Wow, you really are with Mick Jagged.

985
01:14:22,503 --> 01:14:25,172
- I hope you're not the two girls I sent for.
- No.

986
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,090
Actually, the cuter one
used to be my boyfriend.

987
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:29,382
What?

988
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:34,594
Betty, I understand if you want to be
with this famous rock star instead of me.

989
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:38,513
But I just had to come back here
and tell you...

990
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:39,930
I love you.

991
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:46,227
I don't think I ever told you that before.

992
01:14:47,269 --> 01:14:49,646
But now I did, so goodbye.

993
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:53,023
Barney, wait!

994
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:55,232
Do you really mean it?

995
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:58,901
Of course I do.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.

996
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:02,195
Then what about that showgirl you
were with in the restaurant?

997
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:05,072
Roxie? That's Chip Rockefeller's girlfriend.

998
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:08,741
He sent her to take me to the buffet
so I couldn't stop Fred from gambling.

999
01:15:09,324 --> 01:15:13,619
Chip Rockefeller has a girlfriend?
Somebody's gotta tell Wilma.

1000
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:16,996
Don't worry, Betty. I'll handle Rockefeller.

1001
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:20,790
All right, all right, would somebody mind
telling me what the bloody hell's going on?

1002
01:15:20,956 --> 01:15:24,709
This is not cricket.
I'm supposed to be on stage momentarily,

1003
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:30,005
and it's preposterous to expect me to
perform in my present palpitated state.

1004
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:34,675
I'm sorry, Mick.
I had a really great time with you and all...

1005
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:38,886
- Yes?
- But... I love Barney.

1006
01:15:42,762 --> 01:15:46,390
Well, I don't care. I'm in love with Betty too.

1007
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,933
She's the first decent,
honorable woman I've ever met,

1008
01:15:48,974 --> 01:15:52,102
and I am, like, unbelievably turned on
by her naivetÃ©.

1009
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:55,438
Watch your mouth, mister,
or I'll give you a fat lip.

1010
01:15:55,688 --> 01:15:58,941
Although it kinda looks like
somebody already has.

1011
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:05,781
That's it, that's it! Nobody pinches my bird.

1012
01:16:05,822 --> 01:16:08,950
Not after I've gone to all the trouble of
pinching her from him in the first place.

1013
01:16:12,786 --> 01:16:14,204
Take this, you foreigner!

1014
01:16:15,622 --> 01:16:18,750
- Barney?
- Come on, come on, then.

1015
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:21,001
- Come on.
- She's mine.

1016
01:16:21,126 --> 01:16:22,377
Oh, yeah?

1017
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:28,215
Over my ridiculously-thin dead body.

1018
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:50,153
- Wilma... I love you. I always have.
- Oh.

1019
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,654
I lost you once, but I won't lose you again.

1020
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:55,030
- Ah...
- Marry me.

1021
01:16:55,572 --> 01:16:57,824
Tonight.

1022
01:16:59,408 --> 01:17:02,828
Chip. You are terrific.

1023
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:05,997
But...

1024
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:09,207
It's just, a lot of things
have happened recently.

1025
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:13,627
And I need a little time to think, you know?

1026
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:16,503
Wilma, I can't live without you.

1027
01:17:17,295 --> 01:17:21,007
Just say yes. Please.

1028
01:17:21,173 --> 01:17:24,426
That's okay.

1029
01:17:24,592 --> 01:17:28,262
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Tardust Hotel</i>

1030
01:17:28,428 --> 01:17:31,597
<i>is proud to present the world's
only rock n' roll band,</i>

1031
01:17:31,763 --> 01:17:33,890
<i>Mick Jagged and the Stones.</i>

1032
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:56,953
<i>This isn't love</i>

1033
01:17:57,244 --> 01:17:59,871
<i>This is destiny</i>

1034
01:18:02,707 --> 01:18:05,292
<i>Somewhere above</i>

1035
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:08,211
<i>This was planned for me</i>

1036
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:14,133
<i>Life had no meaning</i>

1037
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:17,093
<i>I never knew why</i>

1038
01:18:17,885 --> 01:18:21,889
<i>Till the dream came true</i>

1039
01:18:22,222 --> 01:18:25,558
<i>The dream is you</i>

1040
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:30,271
<i>I never say never</i>

1041
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:33,732
<i>But this love won't ever</i>

1042
01:18:34,524 --> 01:18:36,400
<i>Be over</i>

1043
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:38,401
<i>Together</i>

1044
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:42,404
<i>We'll share love wherever</i>

1045
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:48,576
<i>We go</i>

1046
01:18:51,245 --> 01:18:54,122
<i>This isn't love</i>

1047
01:18:54,205 --> 01:18:57,249
<i>This is ecstasy</i>

1048
01:18:59,918 --> 01:19:02,545
<i>Somehow I knew</i>

1049
01:19:02,586 --> 01:19:05,255
<i>You would come to me</i>

1050
01:19:07,173 --> 01:19:11,010
<i>Never say never</i>

1051
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:13,595
Wilma, honey, I never meant to hurt you.

1052
01:19:14,304 --> 01:19:17,932
I've done some stupid things...
Heck, a lot of stupid things.

1053
01:19:19,642 --> 01:19:22,519
But love makes you do stupid things.

1054
01:19:24,145 --> 01:19:28,816
Wilma, I'd never forgive myself
if I didn't give this one last try.

1055
01:19:33,028 --> 01:19:35,113
Wilma Slaghoople,

1056
01:19:35,655 --> 01:19:40,618
I can't give you diamonds
or fast cars or fancy houses.

1057
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,495
- I can.
- All I can give you

1058
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:47,290
is just plain old Fred Flintstone from Bedrock,

1059
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:51,001
and all the love in my heart.

1060
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:53,377
I hope that's enough.

1061
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:56,754
- It's enough, it's enough.
- No, it's not!

1062
01:19:56,962 --> 01:20:01,091
Wilma, will you...

1063
01:20:03,718 --> 01:20:06,262
Will you...

1064
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,351
Will you... Humina, humina, humina.

1065
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,854
- Spit it out!
- Wilma, will you marry me?

1066
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,399
This is your last chance.

1067
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,817
Stop me, or all the dinosaurs die.

1068
01:20:24,067 --> 01:20:26,152
Shut up!

1069
01:20:26,986 --> 01:20:30,322
Wilma... I am still waiting.

1070
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:35,159
Yes!

1071
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,704
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1072
01:20:58,222 --> 01:21:00,224
And do you, Fred Flintstone,

1073
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:04,394
take Wilma Slaghoople to be your wife,

1074
01:21:04,477 --> 01:21:08,022
to have and to hold from this day forward?

1075
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:10,941
I yabba-dabba-doo.

1076
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:15,779
Do you, Wilma,
take Frederick to be your husband,

1077
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:18,364
to have and to hold, from this day forward?

1078
01:21:18,614 --> 01:21:19,740
I do.

1079
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:27,095
Then, by the power vested in me
by the city of Rock Vegas,

1080
01:21:27,136 --> 01:21:30,514
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1081
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,390
You may kiss the bride.

1082
01:21:34,809 --> 01:21:37,895
- Mrs. Slaghoople.
- Oh, where am I? What is this place?

1083
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:46,068
- Gazoo, are you crying?
- No, no, no, of course not, dum-dum.

1084
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,821
I'm simply overcome with information.

1085
01:21:50,321 --> 01:21:55,909
You see, I finally understand
your complex mating rituals, all the emotions.

1086
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:58,661
All this... Love.

1087
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:05,584
And I've come to the conclusion
that I'll never meet anybody.

1088
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:16,219
Oh, you're very sweet, but believe me,
it would never work out.

1089
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,888
Ladies and gentlemen, I now present to you,

1090
01:22:19,971 --> 01:22:21,389
