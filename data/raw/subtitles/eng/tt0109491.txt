1
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:54,038
Ah, just a minute, Doctor.

2
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,717
The men have taken the hat around,

3
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,260
and we think we've got just
about enough to pay you.

4
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,610
No, no, you keep it.

5
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,614
You'll need something for the funeral.
- It weren't your fault.

6
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,617
There is, um, one thing
you could do for me though.

7
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,663
<i>What's that, Doctor?</i>

8
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,974
You wouldn't have a bottle
lying around, would you?

9
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,058
I could do with a drink.

10
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:19,019
In your saddle bag.
It's three-quarters full.

11
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,305
What do you think?
What was wrong with the other one?

12
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,744
Uh, this one's English, from Bond Street.
<i>They're both nice.</i>

13
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,050
Uncle Jack, there's a feed bill
here that goes back eight months!

14
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,184
We-we have to get things sorted
out before father arrives!

15
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:57,710
Sally, Alex won't give
a damn about feed bills.

16
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:05,370
Perhaps you should wear the other tie,
Uncle Jack.

17
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,199
I-I know this one's Bond
Street and all that, but--

18
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,550
- It's a bit worn. And the jacket--
What?

19
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:13,552
Let's get Violet to give it a press.

20
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,250
Anyone seen Vi?
Oh, Sally dear,

21
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:20,080
you haven't seen the latest copy of
<i>Throne and Country</i> anywhere, have you?

22
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,300
Didn't you lend it to Wally?

23
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,693
- Yes, but I gave it back, Mrs. Dickens.
- I'm sure as eggs, certain.

24
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,783
<i>You see,</i>

25
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:30,351
there's a most important question I want
to put to Alexander as soon as he arrives.

26
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,224
It's about Princess Mary Louise,
but I've forgotten what it is.

27
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,835
Holy Moses, mother.

28
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,751
Alex is a writer, an esteemed
London critic, not a society gossip.

29
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,342
He won't know about
bloody Princess Mary Louise!

30
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,537
Don't swear, Jack.

31
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,628
Alexander won't like it
any more than I do. Ah!

32
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,630
Thank you, dear.

33
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:52,286
Can you imagine! A man on first-name
terms with George Bernard Shaw,

34
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,985
and coming home to live under our roof!
- Vi!

35
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,249
At last, someone in the
district with civilized values!

36
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,841
-- But what about Dr. Askey?
He's very civilized.

37
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,166
- Well, yes, there's Max.

38
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,777
Of course, a medical man, mind you.
Not quite the same thing as Alex.

39
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:05,805
But a true, true friend.

40
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,413
I mean, who's going to meet
the train on his one day off?

41
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,536
The train's due in 15 minutes!

42
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:37,331
Oh, God.

43
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,769
Hmm.
You sure that works?

44
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,163
It works for onions.
It ought to work for whiskey.

45
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,471
Just keep eating it.

46
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,429
Come on.

47
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:01,529
I'm so nervous.

48
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:05,272
What if I don't recognize father?
'Course you will.

49
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:09,668
But I've never seen him!
Not since I was a tiny baby.

50
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,913
- What about his new wife?
- Do you think she'll like me?

51
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:40,220
Getting more to the point,
let's hope you like her.

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,878
- Auntie Joyce! Auntie Joyce!
- Hello, Mum.

53
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:49,229
Hi! How are you?
- Harry.

54
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,579
- There he is!
- Hello, son.

55
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:58,064
John. Johnny!

56
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,634
Peter? Peter, over here.

57
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,724
David! Good to have you back.
How are you, man?

58
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,944
G'day, Doctor. Not too bad. Thanks.
- Good.

59
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,250
<i>This way, son.</i>

60
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:14,298
Someone should tell them the war's over.

61
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:20,260
♪

62
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,494
Go on.

63
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,890
Mother?

64
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,679
- Father?
- Sally.

65
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,377
<i>Can it be?</i>

66
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:54,381
- Yes, of course it is.
- How are you, my child?

67
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,621
I say, do be careful of
that little brown bag.

68
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,908
There's a good fellow.

69
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,477
<i>The contents are extremely fragile!
Now, where have you put it?</i>

70
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,219
Poor Alexander.

71
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,352
We stupidly left his medicine
case in the luggage van,

72
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,789
and he's been in such
desperate need of his drops.

73
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,922
- You must be Deborah.
- Sally.

74
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,535
I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

75
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,928
Dr. Askey?

76
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,063
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

77
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,152
This is our good friend, Dr. Askey.
He's come to help with the luggage.

78
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,720
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Voysey.

79
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,114
How do you do?

80
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,768
Say, I think--
Your--

81
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,946
- My husband?
- Yes. Your husband.

82
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,297
It looks as if, maybe,
we should lend a hand.

83
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,999
Nine, ten, eleven bags.

84
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,349
Hatbox, three trunks...

85
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,351
<i>and my medicine case.</i>

86
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,137
Just coming for the weekend, are we?

87
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,617
Father, this is Dr. Askey.
He's come to help with the luggage.

88
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,142
Oh, how kind.
How do you do?

89
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,363
<i>Oh, so many things.</i>

90
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,540
We poor nomads must travel with all
our goods on our back, so to speak.

91
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,325
Is this it then?

92
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:13,112
- Ah, my books!
- But where's the other crate?

93
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,636
Sally, I think we're going to
need a little extra transport.

94
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,204
I'll scout around town,
see what I can find.

95
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,959
Oh.

96
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:14,217
They're coming.
They're coming!

97
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,611
They're coming!

98
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,179
- They're coming, mother.
- I know. I know, dear.

99
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,660
And that question wasn't about Princess
Mary Louise at all. It was about--

100
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,576
-- Later. - Later, mother, later.
- Where's Hannah? Violet!

101
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:28,492
- Yes, sir?
- Where's my jacket?

102
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,451
<i>Get that out of sight!</i>

103
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:52,777
Violet!

104
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,941
Ah, Hannah. Afternoon tea, please.
They'll be parched.

105
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,336
- My lovely lunch has gone to waste, you know.
- Stone cold.

106
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,338
They're here, Jack.

107
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,994
- Ah, late for lunch.
- Scamps!

108
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,956
My dear, Maud,

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,958
I'm afraid I can't answer you.
- Oh.

110
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,178
That question to someone
of a more elevated station

111
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:50,051
than a mere scribe.
Oh. He's coming.

112
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:55,753
Alex.
How are you?

113
00:10:55,796 --> 00:11:00,366
-<i>Welcome home to Canterbury.
- A pilgrim's return.</i>

114
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:05,850
And nothing has changed it would seem.

115
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,853
Except us, of course,
eh, Jack?

116
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,856
I used to be in perfect health,
and you were once so dapper.

117
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,946
- But I haven't introduced you.
- My wife, Deborah.

118
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,515
<i>Yes, my dear, we used to call
young Jack the dandy of the district.</i>

119
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,734
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

120
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,994
And, uh, th-this is Wally Wells,
who lives with us.

121
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,133
How do you do?

122
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:31,745
Please, come inside.

123
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,747
Wally the lodger, that's me.

124
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:42,408
Where's your tie?

125
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,933
You've all missed lunch, I'm afraid,

126
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,414
but Hannah will provide a
substantial afternoon tea.

127
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,722
- Ah.
- How very kind, Jack.

128
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:55,769
But if you don't mind--
Wh-where's he gone?

129
00:11:55,813 --> 00:12:00,208
- I've no idea.
- Sit down, everybody.

130
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,824
Thank you, Hannah.

131
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:11,089
Oh, Hannah, I'm sure you remember
my famous son-in-law, don't you?

132
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:14,832
Indeed I do.
What, 25 years is it, Hannah?

133
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,225
You've gone gray.

134
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,207
- And this is Mrs. Voysey.
- How do you do?

135
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,258
<i>You've missed lunch, you two,
but I'm not going to waste it.</i>

136
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,360
You'll be having it for supper.

137
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:28,656
Ah,
Hannah's brought in the tea, I see.

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,300
I'm afraid, Jack, I shall have to forgo what
indeed appears to be a substantial repast.

139
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:37,207
But my sinus trouble has
been playing up on the journey,

140
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,248
<i>and there's nothing for it but
my drops and to lie down...</i>

141
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,754
- with the curtains drawn.
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

142
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,623
- No, no, no, no, no.
- An irritating affliction, as much to others,

143
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,626
I'm sure, as to myself.
- Vi, show father his room.

144
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,608
Is there anything we can get you?
- Not a thing.

145
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,611
Well, perhaps, Sally,
just a cup of tea in my room...

146
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,743
<i>in ten minutes time,
if it's not too much trouble.</i>

147
00:12:56,787 --> 00:13:00,617
- Uh, no milk.
- Sugar, two lumps.

148
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,359
Uh, oh, so sorry.

149
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,978
Father, I'm sure you didn't
leave it on the platform.

150
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,807
I distinctly remember you had
it with you outside the station.

151
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,811
Well, where is it then?
I'm absolutely done for without those drops.

152
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,335
How can I possibly replace
them out here in the bush?

153
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,164
If they are lost, I'm sure
Dr. Askey could replace them.

154
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,471
- Dr. Askey?
- Uh, where do you want these?

155
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,073
Father--
Sorry, miss.

156
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:31,675
Those drops were prescribed by Billington,

157
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:34,373
one of the top ear, nose,
and throat men in Harley Street.

158
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:38,959
Merry Christmas.

159
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:42,180
Come on, Cockie.
Merry Christmas.

160
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,201
Merry Christmas.

161
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,184
It's no good, ol' chap.
He's just not in the mood.

162
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,405
<i>Still, he was a lovely
Christmas present, Wally.</i>

163
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:54,332
I kept him hidden in the woolshed for months.
Taught him to say "Merry Christmas" myself.

164
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,201
Jack, pass the rock cakes.
Hmm?

165
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,861
- Rock cake?
- Delicious, but one was more than enough.

166
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:12,863
Come on, Max, someone's

167
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,952
Hannah's in a bad
enough mood as it is.

168
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:18,085
Oh. Got a mallet?

169
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,697
<i>They're like coconuts,
lovely once you get inside.</i>

170
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,700
- Can be said of a lot of things.

171
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,794
Jack! Oh.

172
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,367
Uh, please, sir, Mr. Voysey wants to
know if anyone's seen his medicine case?

173
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,848
He's real upset.
Hmm?

174
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,542
Isn't this it?
Hmm? Hmm?

175
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,503
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

176
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,725
Violet, you clever, clever girl!

177
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,859
I'm indebted to you forever.
Oh, father, what a relief!

178
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,253
We'll get these blinds down, Hannah.

179
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,298
Do you remember this room, father?

180
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,954
Uncle Jack tells me that it was yours
and mother's when you were first married.

181
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:04,392
It was indeed, though
memory plays such odd tricks.

182
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,395
I was certain that it was larger, airier.

183
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,572
It's the best bedroom in the house.

184
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:13,750
My dear, it's a delightful room.
It will make an ideal study.

185
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:19,277
- Now, uh, where will Deborah sleep?
- Well... we thought--

186
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,586
There's this big, double bed here.
Ah, yes, but you see, my work.

187
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,720
This will do very nicely for me,
but I frequently write late into the night.

188
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:31,942
<i>And I'm not so selfish as to expect
Deborah to stay awake with me until dawn.</i>

189
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,292
I see.

190
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:37,164
Tell you what,
my bedroom is right across the corridor.

191
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,602
I'll clear my things out before dinner--
You'll do what?

192
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:43,954
- You'll do nothing of the sort!
- You've had that room since you were a baby.

193
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:46,391
-<i>A tiny baby!
- Shh, Hannah.</i>

194
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:50,003
- When you went off to London and left her!
<i>- Hannah!</i>

195

After her poor mother died!
- Hannah!

196
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,095
There are ten bedrooms in this house!

197
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,924
- Most of them are empty!
- Uncle Jack moved out of his room.

198
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:03,539
- I can perfectly well move out of mine!
- And you and Violet can help me.

199
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,280
It might help, you know?
It always does with my headaches.

200
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,393
Maybe not this afternoon, Jack.

201
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,675

of music, very fond of music.

202
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,677
Oh, extremely fond.
- See?

203
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,593
- He won't hear it up there,will he?
- Well, it'll be distant,

204
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:18,205
but that's all to the good, soothing.

205
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:23,167

I used to know.

313
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,139
I had a birthday regular 'til I was 14.

314
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:42,492
Then I started knockin' about the country,
drivin' fence and shearing and all that.

315
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:45,147
Well, I forgot all about it.

316

every month until you catch up.

00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:22,140
- How could I have forgotten this heat?
- Oh, yes! I'm sorry.

328
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:24,882
Sit-sit down.

329
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,189
This book you're writing though,
Alex, what's it about?

330
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,670
What?
Oh, a specialist affair, Jack.

331
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:33,064
I doubt if you'd find it
in the least to your taste.

332
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:37,373
But those years in London, Alex.
The people you've met.

333
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,986
The intellectuals and the, the pretty,
young actresses too. Eh, old chap?

334
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,597
- Well, yes, I must admit,
there've been one or two of those.

335
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,565
Morning tea?

336
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:58,829
- Lunch.
- At noon?

337
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,093
- Grilled mutton chops.
- Three each.

338
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:05,227
With mashed swede and boiled potatoes.

339
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,408
Braised mutton chops.

340
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:17,152
Make sure you eat 'em up.

341
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:22,200
- Cold mutton with Indian chutney.
- Perfect for this weather.

342
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:25,421
Don't let those flies settle.

343
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:29,076
Boiled fowl.

344
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,950
<i>With carrots, fresh from the garden.</i>

345
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:37,172
- It's the truth.
- Fred dug 'em up this morning.

346
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:45,571
This is what happens when you
cut down all the trees and overstock.

347
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:48,008
And it's not only the small properties.

348
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,010
I noticed that Mr. Pettinger,

349
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,536
the manager of Legaland Imperial
Pastoral Holdings, is with us tonight.

350
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,625
<i>It's good to see you, Mr. Pettinger.</i>

351
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:59,846
You might be interested to see what's
happening over on the northeast boundary...

352
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,153
<i>of your 30,000 acres.</i>

353
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:06,766
<i>Now some of you already know that I have a
thousand acres just west of Legal and Imperial.</i>

354
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:12,163
And on that property I've tried to recreate
the land as it used to be 50 years ago.

355
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,774
<i>There are 11 sorts of
eucalyptus on this slope,</i>

356
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:19,301
<i>and under those gums there's
grazing for kangaroos and wallabies.</i>

357
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:22,173
In my opinion, Dr. Askey, a
sad waste of good grazing land.

358
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:26,873
<i>Legal and Imperial are always prepared to
offer you a very fair price for your holding...</i>

359
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,006
anytime you come to your senses.

360
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,011
And if the aborigines--
the few that are left--

361
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,840
want to camp on my property,
they are free to do so.

362
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:39,712
Oh, why?
So they can climb my fences and eat my sheep?

363
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:43,803
<i>Exactly! It gives me no pleasure
to say this, but aborigines are pests!</i>

364
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:46,328
<i>No less than the rabbits and the foxes!</i>

365
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:49,809
Weren't the rabbits and the foxes
brought over from Britain, Mr. Pettinger?

366
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,858
Ah, you'll find no sympathy
for your anti-British,

367
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,253
<i>antiwar sentiments here, Dr. Askey.
That's right.</i>

368
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,995
- The war's over, Mr. Pettinger.
- Yes! And we won it!

369
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,217
<i>Go on there, Ken! Heigh-ho! Well said!</i>

370
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:09,829
Well, I wonder if we did.
I wonder if we did, Mr. Pettinger.

371
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:14,312
We're saddled with a war debt that, ten years
from now, is going to bankrupt this country.

372
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,314
Bolshevik!
<i>[ Man #2 ] Fuck, yeah, Bolshevik!</i>

373
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,146
I lost my son in the war, Doctor.
I know you did, Mr. Wilson,

374
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:25,628
and no one was sorrier than I was.

375
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,370
I sat with Dick for four nights,
getting him through meningitis.

376
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:32,156
- Do you remember that?
- And are you saying his death was pointless?

377
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:36,116
Nothing is pointless,
if we can learn from it.

378
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,817
And what exactly have we learned from it,
Dr. Askey?

379
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,602
Well, I hope that we've learned...

380
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,083
never to send the finest of our young men...

381
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:50,305
<i>12,000 miles to fight a
war that isn't about politics,</i>

382
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,307
<i>but is about British trade!</i>

383
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,613
But we're all British!
That's right! Yeah!

384
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,050
And I'd like an explanation why wh-when...

385
00:28:57,094 --> 00:29:01,751
- British troops had casualties of 40 percent,
Australian--- ♪ God save our gracious queen

386
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,796
- You have to stand. It's the law.
♪

387
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,756
...under a British high command had-had...

388
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,760
casualties of over 60 percent!
Bolshevik!

389
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:14,503
<i>♪ Bolshevik! Bolshevik!
Bolshevik! Bolshevik!</i>

390
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,291
Bolshevik! Bolshevik!

391
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,392
Well, I'm glad to see you got
the use of your arm back, David.

392
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:36,786
Too right.

393
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:43,053
I'll have to ask you to go now, Dr. Askey.

394
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:46,317
<i>We can't run the risk of more trouble.</i>

395
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,625
<i>Quite understand, Vicar.</i>

396
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:51,670
Thanks for the use of the hall.

397
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,327
Well, Mrs. Voysey,
not quite what you expected, eh?

398
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:59,635
- No.
- Me neither. My apologies.

399
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,637
Lucky father's sinuses were playing up.

400
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,032
- But those awful men!
- What are you going to do?

401
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,513
Well, Mrs. Voysey,
one of the few advantages...

402
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,342
of being the only doctor in
the district is that, eventually,

403
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,432
if you wait long enough, all the
people that say that they hate you,

404
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:18,828
turn up on your doorstep with
kidney stones or an anal abscess...

405
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:21,308
or something that's
giving them terrible bother.

406
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,094
They never seem to want to
talk about Bolshevism then.

407
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,101
- Come on, girl. Good girl. Step on it.
- Come around there, Bluey.

408
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:34,365
- Come around! Come on!
- You know that doctor fella's got me thinking.

409
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,847
- What's that, Fred?
- Well, look at it this way.

410
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,502
If I haven't had a birthday
since I was a kiddie,

411
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:43,418
and let's say I'm 65 now,

412
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:47,073
that's close on 50 birthdays
I've got coming to me.

413
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:50,033
Now the boss gives himself
a day off on his birthday.

414
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:53,384
So I reckon I'm owed
about seven weeks holiday.

415
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,189
It's only justice.

416
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,518
Oh, I don't think Uncle
Jack could do without you...

417
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,868
- for seven weeks, Fred.
- No?

418
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:03,046
No. Why not tell him you got a
21st coming up, and settle for a week.

419
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:16,973
Oh!

420
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:23,588
Come on. Oh!

421
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,723
<i>Hey, Miss Sally, don't get them woolies wet.
They'll shrink!</i>

422
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,958
<i>That looks unpleasant work, Jack.
Should you be doing that?</i>

423
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:50,180
- Well, someone's got to do it.
- We don't want the entire mobfly-blown.

424
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:52,269
<i>Ah, Jack, how I envy you.</i>

425
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,664
- I never had a practical side.
- Yeah, well--

426
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,536
Uh, there's something I-I've been
meaning to discuss with you, Jack.

427
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,408
- Is this a good moment?
- It's as good as any.

428
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,630
This, uh, this Wally fellow--
He's been living at Canterbury how long?

429
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,851
- Two years this winter.
- And he has this job in town?

430
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,854
At the post office, two days a week.
- Ah.

431
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:16,118
And does he, uh, pay rent?
- No.

432
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:18,469
- Well, it's just that, as you know better than I,

433
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:20,906
though the family is quite comfortably off,

434
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,084
we can't really afford, you know,
to carry passengers.

435
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:32,396
Twice a week, Wally brings us mail
and provisions from town.

436
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,485
Every month he gives me a haircut
because he knows...

437
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,923
I can't stand tripping off
to that bloody barbershop!

438
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:41,187
Wally's not only a good friend,
but he's a useful one!

439
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,799
- All right, Jack.
- Don't get excited.

440
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:49,282
You've explained it,
and I understand, perfectly.

441
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:56,681
- Good heavens!
- Hannah will never forgive me.

442
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,336
Afternoon tea.

443
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,653
Fetch my manuscript, will you?

444
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,959
You're nearer. Fetch it yourself.

445
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:16,353
You know very well
I'm trying to rest my leg.

446
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:21,358
-<i>Try exercising it.
- Oh, dear. Stupid of me to forget...</i>

447
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:24,909
that the young haven't the least
comprehension of what it's like to be old.

448
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,101
You're not old.

449
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,192
Hardly the bloom of
youth I would have thought.

450
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:30,367
-<i>And I'm not young.
- Sixty-two.</i>

451
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,806
What's inside--
Oh, all right! You're as old as the hills!

452
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,330
Don't worry.
In a few year's time, I'll be old myself.

453
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:39,855
Frankly, I can't wait!

454
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:46,252
I'll fetch your manuscript.
<i>No, leave it.</i>

455
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:48,733
- Leave it!

456
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,083
<i>Don't trouble yourself.</i>

457
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:54,434
<i>And in a few year's time, I'll be dead.
Then we'll both be happy.</i>

458
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:56,349
Shh.

459
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:59,831
<i>Good Lord, Sally!
What have you been doing?</i>

460
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,964
You look positively filthy.

461
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,096
Any tea left?

462
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,925
Cold.
Violet?

463
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,711
-- I'm parched.
- Sit down. You must be exhausted.

464
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:12,235
Oh, I'll sit over here, thanks.
I'm sopping.

465
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:15,455
- Oh, what have you two been doing?
- Nothing.

466
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:19,938
- Absolutely nothing.
- We're bored to death.

467
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,160
Do something then.
Find something to do.

468
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,250
Here?
Good heavens, what?

469
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:31,471
I have my work, of course.
There's the garden.

470
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,691
<i>If you really want to make yourself useful,</i>

471
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,693
there's the station hand's
children to teach.

472
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:38,174
Half of them can't even read or write.

473
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:42,221
- I'd be no good at that.
- Sometimes I think...

474
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:45,268
I'm the only person in this
house who actually enjoys life.

475
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:48,750
You'd learn. Look at me.

476
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:53,711
I only started working on the property
when the men went off to war. Now I love it.

477
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:57,062
You really expect me
to just drop everything...

478
00:34:57,106 --> 00:35:00,022
and become school teacher
to some dirty children?

479
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:04,156
- You said you were bored.
- I'm not as bored as that.

480
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:08,030
All right.

481
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,775
-<i>Uh, not having any tea, miss?
- I think I'll have a bath.</i>

482
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,951
Right.

483
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:18,780
Uh, is-is that, uh,
fresh tea, Violet?

484
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:23,219
Just made, yes, sir.
No milk, two lumps.

485
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:25,830
<i>Exactement.

00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:34,063
Here.

654
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,862
Hadn't we better be getting back?

655
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,564
Yes.

656
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:59,475
- Back?
- Please.

657
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:06,351
Uncle Jack!

658
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:08,353
<i>We're home!</i>

659
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,409
And you saw the kangaroos?
Yes. Yes, we did.

660
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,367
Aren't they adorable?

661
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:25,022
Hopping about,were they, dear?

662
00:52:25,066 --> 00:52:27,982
Yes, yes.
- Hopping about.
- Oh!

663
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,813
Tea?

664
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:45,521
Sally?
Sal?

665
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:46,957
Good heavens, Jack!

666
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:50,395
<i>Still in your pajamas?</i>

667
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:53,024
- I'm sorry, Sally. The man may
be your father, but he's a fraud.

668
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,531
-<i>A total, bloody fraud!
- Uncle Jack, he'll hear you.</i>

669
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,533
Three hundred and twenty-one pages...

670
00:52:57,576 --> 00:52:59,535
in which there isn't a single
sentence worth reading.

671
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:01,537
- Just listen to this. I'll give you an example.
No, it's all right.

672
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,409
-- I'll put it back. He won't even notice.
- Listen to this.

673
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:08,587
"Miss Gwendolyn Ashley,
she of the twinkling toes,

674
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,895
"has lost none of her vivacious
charm since she won all hearts...

675
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:17,648
as Odette in <i>Parisienne,</i> and I was but
one of the multitude to salute her return."

676
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,077
It isn't even a book!

677
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:22,863
It's just a collection of his rotten,
old press cuttings!

678
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:26,083
He never pretended to be
anything other than a critic.

679
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:28,259
Is this what our work's
been about all these years?

680
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:30,914
During the war when you and I had to
run the property practically on our own?

681
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,416
Is this why, on the fifth of the
month every month for 25 years,

682
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,918
I've sent that check to England?

683
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,791
So that this humbug of a man could
write about "Miss Gwendolyn Ashley,

684
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,271
she of the twinkling toes"?

685
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:43,927
I've wasted my entire life!

686
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,930
<i>He'll hear you, Uncle Jack.</i>

687
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:54,590
- And you, Sally.
- What about you?

688
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:58,246
He didn't think twice about
you when your mother died. No!

689
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:00,297
The gifted member of the family;

690
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:04,034
he had to run off to London
to pursue his important career!

691
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:08,173
Worse things have happened,
Uncle Jack.

692
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:11,417
- What about poor Billy?

693
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:40,157
Come in!

694
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:47,151
I'll be attending to your
midnight needs from now on.

695
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:56,695
Holy smoke, Jack.
Three bull's-eyes in a row!

696
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:59,481
Always said you were
the best shot in the district.

697
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:01,657
Hey, Max, take a look at this.

698
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,833
<i>The best shot in the district.
- What are you killing now?</i>

699
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:06,357
- Parrots.
- Why?

700
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:09,883
<i>They eat the apples on the apple trees.</i>

701
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:13,016
- I don't see any apples, Jack.
- Well, there will be.

702
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,714
They may as well learn now.

703
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:18,244
God.

704
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:24,048
- How's the patient?
- Well, they wouldn't let me see him.

705
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:28,379
I come all this way, now I'm told
he's having a little lie down after lunch...

706
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:30,904
and is not to be disturbed.

707
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:33,210
Him and his wife.

708
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:37,214
Separate rooms,
if it's any consolation.

709
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:39,216
That so?

710
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:44,047
How did he get her in the first place, Max?

711
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:48,747
Beautiful, vibrant,
young woman like that.

712
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,924
Is she faithful to him, do you think?

713
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:52,926
Unfortunately, yes.

714
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:54,928
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Now then, you coves.

715
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:57,060
You shouldn't go talking
about women like that.

716
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,194
Immorality is no joke.

717
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,892
As I know better than most.

718
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:08,071
- When I think of the success that man's
had with women, I tell you, I'm astounded.

719
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,945
<i>First my sister.
And what a lovely girl she was.</i>

720
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:14,425
What a lovely person.

721
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,601
And now this latest one.

722
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:19,082
<i>The most beautiful of the lot!</i>

723
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,345
How about these birds for beauty, Jack?

724
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:23,957
They'll be more beautiful
when there's less of 'em!

725
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,966
Gout?
- Gout.

726
00:56:33,009 --> 00:56:36,056
But good heavens, man,
I drink port once in a blue moon.

727
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,623
Wine?
<i>Well, yes, wine. Of course.</i>

728
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,800
-<i>I don't consider a meal civilized without it.
- How much do you drink?</i>

729
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:45,804
Well, at dinner we'd open
a bottle of Chablis.

730
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:48,677
And then, it goes without saying,
red wine with the meat.

731
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,984
Two bottles a day?
<i>What?</i>

732
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:54,813
You drink two bottles a day?
<i>Well, yes.</i>

733
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:56,815
Well, it's gout, I'm afraid.

734
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:58,948
If you want that pain in your leg to
get better, you'll have to cut down...

735
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:01,951
to two glasses a day,
in a month's time, maybe three.

736
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:05,650
Uh, Dr. Askey, uh, there's one small
matter I'd like to discuss with you.

737
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:09,306
But, first, be so kind as to close the door.

738
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,309
Yes, thank you.

739
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:16,139
Uh, this is a rather delicate matter.

740
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,663
I'm not sure quite how best to put it.

741
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:23,146
- Um...
as you know, I have a young wife,

742
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,322
uh, to whom I owe certain duties.

743
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:27,498
Do you follow me?

744
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:31,502
To whom I have certain marital obligations.

745
00:57:31,546 --> 00:57:34,027
- Ah. Yes.
- Well, lately--

746
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,030
well,
some months now, actually--

747
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:40,163
I've been having difficulty
fulfilling those obligations,

748
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:44,037
and, uh, I was wondering if there
was something you could suggest.

749
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,170
Hmm. Well, physiologically,
I doubt there's much wrong,

750
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,172
for a man of your age that is.
- Hmm.

751
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,349
I'm sure when you cut down on the drinks,
things will... pick up.

752
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:55,439
Well, I was thinking more along
the lines of some sort of medicine,

753
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:57,485
some sort of a pill?

754
00:57:57,528 --> 00:57:59,661
There's nothing that springs to mind.

755
00:57:59,704 --> 00:58:02,664
Dr. Askey, uh, that side of life,

756
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:05,188
it really is quite important to me.

757
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,539
Uh, you must understand
that at one time I was c--

758
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:12,717
This is really too embarrassing.

759
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,893
Yes, well, I'm afraid it's rather
a case of the Lord giveth...

760
00:58:14,937 --> 00:58:17,374
and the Lord taketh away.

761
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,376
But I'm sure when you
cut down on the drink--

762
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,465
Good God! You're supposed
to be a medical man!

763
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:23,554
<i>There must be something you can suggest!</i>

764
00:58:23,598 --> 00:58:26,383
Well, you could try dried kangaroo dung.

765
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:28,516
Aborigines swear by it.

766
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,854
He's a cranky old goat,
your father, isn't he?

767
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,567
Then it's nothing serious?

768
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,393
The pain in his leg is gout.
He drinks too much.

769
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,919
He's not the only one.

770
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:44,575
Uncle Jack hasn't done
a day's work in weeks.

771
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,231
- Well, 20 miles here, 20 miles back.
Another day gone.

772
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,625
- I must be off.
- You said you were staying to dinner.

773
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:53,584
- Too much to do.
- Hannah has cooked a fowl especially--

774
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:57,327
<i>Max, I'm so sorry.
Have I delayed you?</i>

775
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,330
No, not really.
<i>Only it's this heat.</i>

776
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,593
I simply can't keep going
without a lie down after lunch.

777
00:59:02,637 --> 00:59:05,770
I'd love a lie down after lunch.
<i>So, are you staying to dinner?</i>

778
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:09,252
- No, Dr. Askey has to get back to town.
He's got patients to attend to.

779
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,560
<i>Well, then you can leave first thing
in the morning and be in town by 9:00.</i>

780
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:14,518
You haven't asked about your husband.

781
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,607
Alexander?
Oh, he drinks too much.

782
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:19,610
All his doctors have told him,
but he never listens.

783
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:23,136
Now, are you staying?

784
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,965
All right. I suppose it's
pointless rushing away now.

785
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:30,360
<i>There's a man arrived at the door, Miss Sally.
He says it's important.</i>

786
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,940
- That's nice perfume you've got on.
- It's French.

787
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:50,293
I smell of carbolic.

788
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,469
That's nice too.

789
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:55,951
Dr. Askey, you're required at once!

790
00:59:55,994 --> 00:59:59,769
A man's been seriously
injured at the railway station.

791
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:01,043
Oh, dear.

792
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:05,308
And I want to see more of your silly,
old gum trees and the kangaroo.

793
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:08,898
"Hopping about."

794
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,277
Yes, "hopping about."

795
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,666
So when shall we see you again?

796
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,496
Well, as soon as your husband
contracts his next fatal illness, I suppose.

797
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,543
Then in no time at all.

798
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,888
- Didn't you get my message?
- I did indeed, Wal.

799
01:01:03,932 --> 01:01:06,978
But I got more than one patient,
and some of them are actually sick.

800
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:11,940
- Yeah, but Mrs. Voysey says it's real
bad this time. Look, she sent you this note.

801
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,470
Like the smell, Wal?

802
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:25,475
My wife had a soap once smelled like this.

803
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,827
No soap ever smelled like that.
- Can you come?

804
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:33,004
All right, Wal, you win.

805
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:36,486
- Two more patients first though. I'll
meet you outside the post office in an hour.

806
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:39,881
- Yeah, well, don't be too long!
We'll miss dinner!

807
01:01:49,804 --> 01:01:53,851
- No, no, no!
- I will not see your Dr. Askey!

808
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:56,593
The man has the sensibilities of a vet!

809
01:01:56,637 --> 01:02:00,118
Let him minister to the
barnyard animals, not to me!

810
01:02:00,162 --> 01:02:02,599
But you haven't slept a wink.
None of us have.

811
01:02:02,643 --> 01:02:04,949
At least take some
medicine for the pain.

812
01:02:04,993 --> 01:02:07,125
It won't do any good.

813
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:10,433
Oh, very well.

814
01:02:14,176 --> 01:02:18,311
- I'm doing it!
- Here, take two of these it says.

815
01:02:18,354 --> 01:02:21,618
- Oh, not these. The drops, the drops!
- But what are these?

816
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:25,810

984
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:25,934
Remember that hat?

985
01:13:25,978 --> 01:13:28,154
The one with the flowers?

986
01:13:28,197 --> 01:13:32,332
I wore that during the
summer I became engaged.

987
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,161
War broke out in August,

988
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:38,207
and by the end of November he was killed.

989
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:42,037
-<i>My husband.</i>
Oh, Debbie, how terrible.

990
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:45,171
Oh, it was worse later on, I think,

991
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:48,522
when all his friends
started getting killed.

992
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:52,395
After the Somme, it was as
if the whole world was dying.

993
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:54,354
<i>I became so...</i>

994
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:59,098
scared.

995
01:13:59,141 --> 01:14:04,712
- And then I met Alexander, and--
Oh, he was charming then. He really was.

996
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:10,065
And he knew all these
interesting people, and...

997
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:12,850
he was safe.

998
01:14:12,894 --> 01:14:16,376
<i>Yes, that above all, I suppose.</i>

999
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,161
Oh, I wish you'd told me all this before.

1000
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,599
We've never really talked, have we?

1001
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:27,430
Then you'd agree with
Dr. Askey about the war?

1002
01:14:27,474 --> 01:14:29,563
Oh, yes!
Of course, I do.

1003
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:33,088
He's a remarkable man.
That sort of vision.

1004
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:38,093
It takes great courage,
great persistence.

1005
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:43,968
Tell me, it's my turn now,
do you like the doctor?

1006
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,754
Yes.

1007
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:50,888
Yes, I do, very much.

1008
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:53,978
I thought you did.

1009
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,937
Is it that obvious?

1010
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,856
Oh, it's no good.
I can't hide it.

1011
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:05,251
He's just gone to bed,
but I can still hear his voice.

1012
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:08,036
I can still see him.

1013
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:14,738
<i>Am I being silly?</i>

1014
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:17,524
But I'm so happy.

1015
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:19,961
And I'm so unhappy.

1016
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:21,963
We make a good pair.

1017
01:15:22,006 --> 01:15:25,619
<i>Here you are, you old rascal.</i>

1018
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:29,449
A lovely cup of cocoa
help you get to sleep.

1019
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:32,626
To sleep?
With that racket going on?

1020
01:15:32,669 --> 01:15:35,150
Dawn and dusk, like an alarm clock.

1021
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:38,980
There, there, now.
You stop your frettin'.

1022
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:42,636
When I was young, Hannah,
I used to lie in bed...

1023
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:46,988
and listen to the magpies
and swear I'd get away.

1024
01:15:47,031 --> 01:15:49,817
Well, I got away.

1025
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,298
Now I'm back!

1026
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,691
How did it happen?

1027
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,003
I think of Ireland sometimes.

1028
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:05,833
But it's God's will we're here.

1029
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:08,314
Don't be too sure, Hannah.

1030
01:16:08,357 --> 01:16:10,968
Don't be too sure.

1031
01:16:13,797 --> 01:16:16,670
Come on.

1032
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,211
What's going on?
I told you!

1033
01:16:36,255 --> 01:16:39,345
Alexander wants us to meet
under the tree house at 12:00.

1034
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:41,608
Why, for God sake?
Ask him!

1035
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:45,351
You can't make lemon barley
water at a moment's notice.

1036
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:48,049
We'll all help, Hannah.
Just do your best.

1037
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:50,225
There, you young scamp.
Never here when you're needed.

1038
01:16:50,269 --> 01:16:52,227
Garden.
What can I do?

1039
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:55,056
Nothing. Sit down and read a book.
Go back to bed.

1040
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:57,667
Oh, all right.
Take this into the garden.

1041
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,068
Wonderful!
Your husband says, "Jump,"

1042
01:17:07,111 --> 01:17:09,331
and the entire household's in turmoil.

1043
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,151
Is this how you're going to
spend the rest of your life?

1044
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:12,973
Running around,
looking for an old man's slippers?

1045
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:13,949
Oh, shh!

1046
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:16,382
For God sake,
get out now while you can.

1047
01:17:16,425 --> 01:17:18,432
Be cruel if you like,
but don't be mediocre!

1048
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,956
Oh!
Sorry!

1049
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,390
Sorry!

1050
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:28,916
Oh, it's so hot.

1051
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,528
February is going to be worse.

1052
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:39,100
How will we ever
get through the summer?

1053
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:40,241
I thought he'd gone.

1054
01:17:40,265 --> 01:17:43,283
Oh, I let him sleep in.
Then some sick aborigines turned up.

1055
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,459
- Where is he now?
- At the stables.

1056
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,718
Look, I made him sandwiches
for the journey into town.

1057
01:17:48,762 --> 01:17:52,540
I always do. He never notices.
<i>I'm sure he does.</i>

1058
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:56,631
If I was beautiful, he'd notice.
<i>Oh, but you are.</i>

1059
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:59,425
You have beautiful hair.

1060
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:03,864
That's what people always
say when you're plain.

1061
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:06,954
"She has such beautiful hair"...

1062
01:18:06,997 --> 01:18:09,522
or "She has such beautiful eyes."

1063
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:15,441
Oh, Debbie, I love him so much.

1064
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,443
I just want to talk about him all the time,

1065
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:20,315
like now, to anybody who'll listen!

1066
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,839
I'm hopeless.

1067
01:18:22,883 --> 01:18:24,141
I have no pride.

1068
01:18:24,185 --> 01:18:26,622
Even Violet and Hannah
gossip about it.

1069
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:30,926
How long have you felt
this way about the doctor?

1070
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:35,161
Almost six years.

1071
01:18:35,204 --> 01:18:37,111
Oh, but that's ridiculous!

1072
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:40,936
You can't spend
your life just hoping.

1073
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,034
Look, I have an idea.

1074
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:46,167
Why don't I talk to him?

1075
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,301
Don't be embarrassed.

1076
01:18:49,344 --> 01:18:53,870
Nothing direct. Just a hint
or two to see how he feels.

1077
01:18:53,914 --> 01:18:58,135
Hmm?
Yes?

1078
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:09,059
Debbie?
Yes?

1079
01:19:09,103 --> 01:19:11,714
<i>Wouldn't it be better if I didn't know?</i>

1080
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:17,024
The truth is always best.
That's what the doctor says.

1081
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:53,365
Dr. Askey?

1082
01:19:56,803 --> 01:20:00,110
Dr. Askey?
Looking for someone?

1083
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:03,375
Oh! You gave me such a shock.

1084
01:20:03,418 --> 01:20:05,420
What can I do for you?

1085
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:07,640
You just off?

1086
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:11,861
Yes, in a minute.
I'm just, uh, feeding the horse.

1087
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:18,868
Dr. Askey--
I used to be Max.

1088
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:22,481
Max, I was wondering if
we could have a little talk?

1089
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:24,831
Of course.
Fire away.

1090
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:28,400
I-It's a rather private matter.

1091
01:20:28,443 --> 01:20:33,492
Hmm. Well, um...
it would be private in here.

1092
01:20:33,535 --> 01:20:36,146
I couldn't possibly climb over there.

1093
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:38,366
Of course you could.

1094
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:47,419
This is madness.

1095
01:20:47,462 --> 01:20:49,899
<i>Everyone has to take
a risk once in a while.</i>

1096
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:52,380
So people keep telling me.

1097
01:20:57,298 --> 01:20:59,343
I feel quite frightened.

1098
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,737
Well, nothing to be frightened of here.

1099
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:04,305
Look.

1100
01:21:11,486 --> 01:21:15,229
Aren't they adorable?

1101
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,540
Sit down.

1102
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:35,292
Oh, dear.
I don't know how to begin.

1103
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:37,773
I'm going to ask you
some questions,

1104
01:21:37,817 --> 01:21:42,778
and when I've asked them, will you
forget I ever brought the subject up?

1105
01:21:42,822 --> 01:21:44,780
Mm-hmm.

1106
01:21:44,824 --> 01:21:47,304
I'll get straight to the point.

1107
01:21:47,348 --> 01:21:51,613
It's about a certain young
woman you know very well.

1108
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,486
- You?
- Don't be silly.

1109
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:57,793
My stepdaughter, Sally.

1110
01:21:57,837 --> 01:22:00,535
Do you like her?

1111
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:02,537
Yes, I do.
She's a marvelous girl.

1112
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:06,236
Do you like her...
as a woman?

1113
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,892
Am I attracted to her? Is that what you mean?
- Yes.

1114
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:14,070
No.
Not in the least?

1115
01:22:14,114 --> 01:22:18,727
No.
Oh, dear.

1116
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:23,253
Have you noticed that
she likes you a great deal?

1117
01:22:23,297 --> 01:22:27,257
I doubt that very much.
Oh, I assure you, she does!

1118
01:22:27,301 --> 01:22:32,262
Oh, heavens. What an
embarrassing conversation.

1119
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:35,439
Just one more thing.

1120
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,442
How can I--
How can I put it?

1121
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:42,925
I think that,
in the circumstances,

1122
01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:47,582
it would be kinder if,
for the time being,

1123
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:49,976
you stopped coming here to visit her.

1124
01:22:50,019 --> 01:22:53,675
To visit <i>her?</i>

1125
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:58,854
Yes. Well, lately, you seem to have
been here almost every other day.

1126
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:01,506
And you know very well why
I come here every other day.

1127
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,880
It's not to visit Sally.

1128
01:23:04,024 --> 01:23:07,998
<i>Do you know what you are?
A fox.</i>

1129
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:10,000
<i>A beautiful, sleek English fox.</i>

1130
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:12,368
And we're the poor, bloody native wildlife.

1131
01:23:12,412 --> 01:23:14,170
What on earth are you talking about?

1132
01:23:14,214 --> 01:23:16,607
<i>Look at my practice;</i>
 gone completely to hell.

1133
01:23:16,651 --> 01:23:18,122
And Jack-- poor, old Jack.

1134
01:23:18,246 --> 01:23:21,712
He wouldn't know if the sheep
were grazing in the dining room.

1135
01:23:21,756 --> 01:23:23,338
<i>You've gobbled us all up.</i>

1136
01:23:23,362 --> 01:23:26,282
You obviously think I'm contemptible.
I'll go.

1137
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:31,626
Oh, no.
I think you're beautiful.

1138
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:35,499
The thought about you
shimmers and glows for me.

1139
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,501
What lovely wrists.

1140
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,103
Oh, please, let me go.

1141
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,932
I will, I will.
I'll do as you say.

1142
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,934
I'll leave today. I'll never come back.

1143
01:23:44,378 --> 01:23:46,637
Oh.
But listen to me. Listen.

1144
01:23:46,881 --> 01:23:52,069
This may be the only time you and I
ever get to spend some time alone together.

1145
01:23:52,613 --> 01:23:57,052
Nobody knows we're here.
No one can find us.

1146
01:23:57,696 --> 01:24:00,916
Never.

1147
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:11,535
Oh, God, your smell.

1148
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:15,731
These little hairs on the back of your neck.

1149
01:24:15,775 --> 01:24:18,647
<i>Max, you mustn't.
Don't be afraid.</i>

1150
01:24:18,891 --> 01:24:23,199
Don't be frightened.
Don't run away.

1151
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:26,028
You'll only regret it later.

1152
01:24:26,072 --> 01:24:27,878
Don't be frightened.
Sit now.

1153
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:30,686
We can't!
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

1154
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,859
We can.
It's so easy.

1155
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:37,593
It's so easy.

1156
01:24:37,937 --> 01:24:39,343
Yes.

1157
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,257
Mrs. Voysey!

1158
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:54,153
Mrs. Voysey.

1159
01:24:57,978 --> 01:25:03,179
Mrs. Voysey. Miss Sally says Mr. Voysey
says you're wanted under the tree house

1160
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,021
in the garden!

1161
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,511
Deborah.
Shh.

1162
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:21,231
Stay just for a few minutes.
No.

1163
01:25:23,172 --> 01:25:25,610
How could it make any difference?

1164
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,217
No.

1165
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:35,750
It's a hot drink they'll be gettin',
and it's more than they deserve.

1166
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:38,840
Me with a whole lunch still to get ready.
Go on.

1167
01:25:43,802 --> 01:25:47,457
Oh, Mrs. Voysey. Miss Sally said
Mr. Voysey says you're wanted--

1168
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:49,459
Yes, thank you, Vi. I heard you.

1169
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:52,071
Uh, Miss Voysey, you've got
hay on the back of your dress.

1170
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:56,728
Allow me.

1171
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:29,453
I-I-I brought you these for your bedroom.

1172
01:26:31,702 --> 01:26:36,133
<i>Isn't your husband
waiting for us in the garden?</i>

1173
01:26:37,377 --> 01:26:40,772
Under the tree house.

1174
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,607
Is no one punctual in the country?

1175
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:52,958
Dear, oh, dear.
Here they come, father.

1176
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:55,743
Good heavens, at last.
Three cheers.

1177
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,587
It's bad news, isn't it?
I can tell from your face.

1178
01:26:59,611 --> 01:27:00,404
Let's talk later.

1179
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,356
No.
The truth is best, you said.

1180
01:27:07,015 --> 01:27:09,235
He won't be coming here
any more, will he?

1181
01:27:14,153 --> 01:27:17,286
All right, everyone,
find yourselves a seat.

1182
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,562
Make yourselves comfortable.

1183
01:27:21,206 --> 01:27:23,184
Sit down, my dear.

1184
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:27,088
Sally!
Oh, dear, she's not listening.

1185
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:29,090
Sal?

1186
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,605
And Wally.

1187
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,564
Well, now, strictly speaking, this
meeting is meant to be just family.

1188
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:38,917
<i>You're not actually needed,
but since you're here, stay, stay.</i>

1189
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,441
I'm not actually needed, am I?

1190
01:27:41,484 --> 01:27:44,566
My dear Jack, you're the one
person we quite emphatically...

1191
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:47,221
-<i>cannot do without.
- Since when?</i>

1192
01:27:47,664 --> 01:27:51,146
Do as Alexander says.
Sit down, Jack!

1193
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,979
My dear family,
look about you.

1194
01:27:58,623 --> 01:28:00,913
<i>Remember the well-tended lawn?</i>

1195
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:03,680
Remember the famous
Rose Arbor?

1196
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:06,770
Remember the garden in which one
could almost believe one's self to be...

1197
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,738
in some tranquil corner
of Sussex or Kent?

1198
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:12,124
"There is some corner of a foreign field--"

1199
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:15,605
"That is forever England."
Exactly, Maud.

1200
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:17,912
Though no longer, alas,
in this particular case.

1201
01:28:17,956 --> 01:28:20,088
Now, I'm not a practical person.

1202
01:28:20,132 --> 01:28:23,352
My world has been the world
of the theater and the mind!

1203
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:27,617
<i>But even I can see, and no one
regrets it more, that Canterbury...</i>

1204
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:29,793
is not the place it used to be.

1205
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,100
For heaven's sake, Hannah,
couldn't you serve drinks...

1206
01:28:32,144 --> 01:28:34,624
<i>either before or after I've spoken?</i>

1207
01:28:34,668 --> 01:28:38,324
The sooner it's poured,
the sooner it'll cool down.

1208
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:42,458
Merry Christmas.

1209
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:47,289
To resume...
something has occurred to me.

1210
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,118
A little plan, if you like,
which may just be...

1211
01:28:50,162 --> 01:28:52,904
in the very best interests
of the entire family.

1212
01:28:52,947 --> 01:28:56,951
<i>Now, at the moment, this property
gives a return of a miserable...</i>

1213
01:28:56,995 --> 01:28:59,258
<i>two percent of its capital value,</i>

1214
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:04,306
as opposed to the six or even seven
percent that a prudent investment might yield.

1215
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,874
Now, I have been talking--
quite informally, of course--

1216
01:29:06,918 --> 01:29:11,661
<i>to our neighbors and friends,
Legal and Imperial Pastoral Holdings.</i>

1217
01:29:11,705 --> 01:29:15,665
<i>Indeed, I suggested to their Mr. Pettinger
that he pay us a visit later this morning.</i>

1218
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:19,843
<i>And I am the bearer of
some quite remarkable tidings.</i>

1219
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,499
Legal and Imperial are prepared,
should we ever wish to sell,

1220
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:28,504
<i>to offer us a very fair price,
not only for our better grazing land,</i>

1221
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:31,159
but for the whole caboodle,
lock, stock and barrel!

1222
01:29:31,203 --> 01:29:34,989
Ha! Including, would you believe it,
this dilapidated old house.

1223
01:29:35,033 --> 01:29:39,080
<i>Well, just imagine! We would
then be in a position to acquire...</i>

1224
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,518
a pleasant villa in, say,
one of the better parts of Melbourne...

1225
01:29:42,562 --> 01:29:45,521
and be considerably better off.

1226
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:48,437
Hold on, hold on. What was--
what was that again?

1227
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:51,353
With what was left over,
we'd be considerably better off.

1228
01:29:51,397 --> 01:29:55,444
No, no, just before that. What--
what were you saying about Legal and Imperial?

1229
01:29:55,488 --> 01:29:58,360
They'd be prepared to
offer us a very fair price.

1230
01:29:58,404 --> 01:30:02,016
That's it! The whole caboodle!
Lock, stock and barrel!

1231
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,801
Does that include me and my old mother?

1232
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:07,717
Do we go at a knock down
price with the furniture?

1233
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:10,894
For heaven's sake, Jack,
I never suggested any such thing.

1234
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,115
For 25 years I've run this property!
Nobody could have worked harder!

1235
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:18,990
And for 25 years you've had my sister's
share out of it, regular as clockwork,

1236
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:21,775
while the rest of us
scraped by on a pittance!

1237
01:30:21,818 --> 01:30:23,603
I don't really see
the point of any of this.

1238
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:26,475
Oh, don't you? 
Well, allow me to explain.

1239
01:30:26,519 --> 01:30:28,521
In my humble opinion,

1240
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:32,829
you are a shallow, parasitic,
totally self-centered humbug...

1241
01:30:32,873 --> 01:30:35,308
with about as much talent as that cockatoo!

1242
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:38,510
<i>And you've made fools of the lot of us!</i>
Keep quiet, Jack!

1243
01:30:39,053 --> 01:30:43,275
I absolutely insist you hold your tongue.
I will not hold my tongue!

1244
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:47,148
<i>That man is my worst enemy!
That man has robbed me of my life!</i>

1245
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,498
I could have been the one to go to London!

1246
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:52,849
I could have been the one to write
books and sleep with beautiful women!

1247
01:30:52,893 --> 01:30:55,483
Oh, God!
I'm talking balls.

1248
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:58,551
Jack, please!
Alexander knows best.

1249
01:30:58,594 --> 01:31:01,032
Hello, everyone.

1250
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,077
Does he?

1251
01:31:03,121 --> 01:31:06,863
Well, we'll see about that!

1252
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:09,692
<i>We'll see about that!</i>

1253
01:31:15,046 --> 01:31:17,352
The man's mad.
Obviously dotty.

1254
01:31:17,396 --> 01:31:20,486
Ha! I feel sorry for him.
Oh, poor Uncle Jack.

1255
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:36,067
The least we can offer you, my dear
Pettinger, after coming all this way.

1256
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:38,721
<i>We can't just stand out here
in the open indefinitely, Alex.</i>

1257
01:31:38,765 --> 01:31:41,724
For God's sake, go in
and try and calm him down.

1258
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:43,987
Yes, father, go and speak to him.
Try to see it from his point of view.

1259
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,033
Oh, very well, very well!

1260
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:48,079
If Mr. Pettinger will excuse me,
very well.

1261
01:31:48,122 --> 01:31:52,039
Have a little drink first.
Is my tie straight?

1262
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,529
Mr. Voysey! Mr. Voysey, you all right?

1263
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:01,831
Damn!

1264
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,877
Oh, my God, Alexander!

1265
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:10,188
Jack! Jack! Don't shoot again!

1266
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:12,712
<i>Don't be such a fool!
Don't, Jack!</i>

1267
01:32:12,755 --> 01:32:14,670
Don't, Jack!

1268
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:25,028
Missed!
Two chances and bloody missed!

1269
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:39,695
Uncle Jack!
Uncle Jack!

1270
01:32:42,568 --> 01:32:44,874
Where has the silly bugger got to?

1271
01:32:44,918 --> 01:32:48,051
Jack mustn't blame himself.
It was that old rifle of his.

1272
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,358
It needs a good clean.

1273
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:53,709
Well, he's still the
best shot in the district.

1274
01:32:53,753 --> 01:32:57,800
Please, please, Uncle Jack!

1275
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:05,895
He must be hiding.
Anyone looked under the house?

1276
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:09,899
No, he wouldn't be there.
He's scared of spiders.

1277
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,080
All right, Jack. I want it back.

1278
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,387
At once, please.

1279
01:33:19,431 --> 01:33:22,085
I mean it.

1280
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,566
What's he got?

1281
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:27,134
Pinched a bottle of morphia out of my bags.

1282
01:33:27,178 --> 01:33:30,398
<i>Now, look, if you're really so keen
on doing away with yourself, old man,</i>

1283
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:32,748
<i>stop taking pot shots at other people...</i>

1284
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:35,534
and go up to the wool shed and
bloody well blow your own brains out,

1285
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,710
but give me back my morphia!

1286
01:33:37,753 --> 01:33:40,060
Come on.
Hand it over.

1287
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,678
Give it back, Uncle Jack.

1288
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,130
<i>We all have to keep going.</i>

1289
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:09,524
That's the stuff.
Now I can be on my way.

1290
01:34:09,568 --> 01:34:11,309
Yes.

1291
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:14,399
My best suit, ruined.
<i>Oh, nonsense, Boo-Boo.</i>

1292
01:34:14,442 --> 01:34:17,750
Violet gave it a thorough sponge.
That's what's ruined it.

1293
01:34:17,793 --> 01:34:21,326
What time's the motorcar
picking us up, did you say?

1294
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,020
<i>In about an hour.</i>

1295
01:34:22,062 --> 01:34:24,104
Oh.
We'll go straight to the station...

1296
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:27,412
<i>and catch the 9:00 sleeper for Sydney.</i>
But my things, all my books.

1297
01:34:27,455 --> 01:34:29,762
They can follow us to Perth later.

1298
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:33,940
My nephew has quite
a large house, I believe.

1299
01:34:33,983 --> 01:34:36,769
Western Australia's most
up-and-coming barrister.

1300
01:34:36,812 --> 01:34:39,424
Everything will be safe
here in the meantime.

1301
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,296
I suppose we'll have
to leave the wine behind.

1302
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,342
Of course.

1303
01:34:44,385 --> 01:34:47,519
It's just the thought that they won't
have the least idea what they're drinking.

1304
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:51,958
And, Boo-Boo, we mustn't leave
without first making it up with Jack.

1305
01:34:52,001 --> 01:34:54,439
It's quite important, isn't it?
Yes, yes, yes.

1306
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:57,920
Of course it is.
I'm not stupid.

1307
01:34:57,964 --> 01:35:01,228
Now, ring for Violet,
and let's start packing.

1308
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:05,063
Perth.

1309
01:35:08,106 --> 01:35:10,803
Ah, that'll be them,
wantin' their packin' done.

1310
01:35:10,846 --> 01:35:15,155
You better go up to them.
Good riddance, if you ask me.

1311
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:20,682
Now we can go back to
proper hours and decent food.

1312
01:35:23,206 --> 01:35:26,340
<i>But, Mr. Wells, are you sure
that's the best thing to do?</i>

1313
01:35:26,384 --> 01:35:28,473
Safe as houses, Mrs. Dickens.

1314
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:30,997
It will prove to Jack
we still have faith in him.

1315
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,174
He loves that old rifle.

1316
01:35:32,198 --> 01:35:34,479
You're quite sure you've hidden all the bullets?

1317
01:35:34,522 --> 01:35:38,396
<i>All right, everybody, clear off.
Sally and I have got work to do.</i>

1318
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:40,746
Right back where she was, Jack.

1319
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:43,836
<i>Ready for action.
Hmm.</i>

1320
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:47,187
Uncle Jack wants to catch
up on all the back paperwork.

1321
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:52,018
The motorcar has arrived.

1322
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:56,327
We're just leaving.

1323
01:36:01,157 --> 01:36:03,812
Let's go together, Uncle Jack,
and say good-bye.

1324
01:36:03,856 --> 01:36:07,033
We mustn't part on bad terms.

1325
01:36:08,904 --> 01:36:12,691
Come on.
Come and be friends.

1326
01:36:24,093 --> 01:36:27,706
We're just leaving.
Good-bye.

1327
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:30,535
This is rather sudden.

1328
01:36:30,578 --> 01:36:33,886
Are you really that scared?

1329
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:36,715
Yes, I am.
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

1330
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:40,414
Don't be. Change your mind and stay.
What's to be afraid of?

1331
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:44,723
See, sooner or later, your
feelings will get the better of you.

1332
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:48,901
So why not here?
At least it's beautiful country.

1333
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:52,078
You won't even notice the
sunsets where you're going.

1334
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:56,082
Sydney, is it?
Perth.

1335
01:36:56,125 --> 01:37:00,652
<i>Three thousand miles away.</i>
Can we just shake hands and part friends?

1336
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,574
You must be scared.
You do respect me a little?

1337
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:21,455
We probably won't meet again,
so I can say it. I do like you.

1338
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:24,763
I think I've liked you from
the moment that we met,

1339
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:29,942
and...
I wish I wasn't scared.

1340
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:35,426
Oh, probably this way is best.

1341
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,126
Isn't life odd though?

1342
01:37:40,169 --> 01:37:43,129
We've been close and suddenly,
for no very good reason,

1343
01:37:43,172 --> 01:37:45,958
<i>we'll probably never see each other again.</i>

1344
01:37:49,352 --> 01:37:52,617
One final kiss on the cheek here?

1345
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:00,189
Come on in here before Jack shoots us.

1346
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:08,633
First W.C. in the district,
according to Jack.

1347
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:11,685
These tiles were imported from Naples.

1348
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:26,825
Oh!

1349
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:32,352
Oh, dear.

1350
01:38:32,395 --> 01:38:34,485
A souvenir.

1351
01:38:55,156 --> 01:38:57,508
No, no, no, no, Jack.

1352
01:38:57,551 --> 01:39:01,990
What's past is past. Over.
Let's just get on with life.

1353
01:39:02,034 --> 01:39:05,211
Each to his respective labors.
All aboard!

1354
01:39:05,254 --> 01:39:08,040
Good-bye, everyone.
Good-bye, good-bye.

1355
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:11,565
And you'll be getting the usual on the
fifth of every month, the same as always.

1356
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:14,394
My dear, fellow,
let's not even mention it.

1357
01:39:14,437 --> 01:39:16,396
Good-bye, Maud, my dear.

1358
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:19,878
Dear Alexander,
we shall all miss you so much.

1359
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:21,156
And Wally.

1360
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,408
Think of us all sometimes,
out here in the bush.

1361
01:39:24,451 --> 01:39:26,580
Oh, Hannah, Violet.

1362
01:39:26,624 --> 01:39:29,540
Ah, goodness me, yes.

1363
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:33,892
Uh...

1364
01:39:41,464 --> 01:39:44,903
Good-bye.
Perth, is it?

1365
01:39:48,122 --> 01:39:51,109
Sorry if I've been a nuisance or anything.

1366
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:53,912
Jack.

1367
01:39:56,218 --> 01:39:58,264
Good-bye.

1368
01:40:01,484 --> 01:40:03,574
Come along, my dear.

1369
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:06,821
Coming.

1370
01:40:12,234 --> 01:40:13,893
Bye-bye, dear!
Good-bye, sonny!

1371
01:40:14,036 --> 01:40:16,125
<i>Good-bye! Good-bye!
Good-bye, Debbie!</i>

1372
01:40:16,169 --> 01:40:19,172
You're not waving good-bye?
Go to hell!

1373
01:40:19,415 --> 01:40:21,940
Besides,
I've got work to do.

1374
01:40:43,614 --> 01:40:48,488
They've gone.
They've gone.

1375
01:40:50,446 --> 01:40:52,884
I hope they're going to be all right.

1376
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:55,887
What about these accounts, Uncle Jack?

1377
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:59,804
Let's get down to it.
Yes, yes, let's get down to it.

1378
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,328
It's ages since we sat
at this desk together.

1379
01:41:02,371 --> 01:41:05,897
The ink's dried up.
They've gone.

1380
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:10,597
Dinner tonight will be at 7:00 sharp.
You'll be staying, Doctor.

1381
01:41:10,641 --> 01:41:14,079
No, no. I must be off.
It's mutton fricassee.

1382
01:41:14,122 --> 01:41:17,256
A great temptation, Hannah, but, no.
I'm late as it is.

1383
01:41:17,299 --> 01:41:21,390
Oh, well, come out here then.
I've got something for you.

1384
01:41:25,003 --> 01:41:27,048
Well, my friends.

1385
01:41:29,485 --> 01:41:33,359
Be winter there now.
Can you imagine that?

1386
01:41:33,402 --> 01:41:36,318
Log fires and real snow.

1387
01:41:38,494 --> 01:41:40,714
I don't think I'd care for it.

1388
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:48,113
When will we see you again?

1389
01:41:48,156 --> 01:41:53,466
Well, probably not for some time what with
the flu epidemic reaching town and so forth.

1390
01:41:53,509 --> 01:41:57,470
Not for some months.
Thanks for everything.

1391
01:41:57,513 --> 01:41:59,733
I've been practically
living here, haven't I?

1392
01:41:59,777 --> 01:42:03,302
Like Wally.
So--

1393
01:42:03,345 --> 01:42:06,000
You've got your sandwiches.

1394
01:42:06,044 --> 01:42:09,874
Hannah will have packed them.
She never forgets.

1395
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:23,583
Here.

1396
01:42:23,626 --> 01:42:26,064
<i>Don't let them know.</i>

1397
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:29,589
I've topped it up from the
decanter on the sideboard.

1398
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,548
You're a sly one.
Come on, give us a kiss.

1399
01:42:32,592 --> 01:42:36,901
You keep your hanky-panky for others.

1400
01:42:36,944 --> 01:42:41,079
♪

1401
01:42:41,122 --> 01:42:44,082
That's it, Wal.
Give us a song.

1402
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:46,606
Uh, can't think just what though.

1403
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:49,609
Something to match that sunset.

1404
01:42:57,784 --> 01:42:59,401
He's gone.

1405
01:42:59,445 --> 01:43:03,754
Eight-- eight nines.
What-what-what are eight nines?

1406
01:43:03,797 --> 01:43:06,104
What?
♪

1407
01:43:06,147 --> 01:43:08,149
Oh, yes.
Yes, he's gone.

1408
01:43:21,162 --> 01:43:23,643
This bloody country!

1409
01:43:42,531 --> 01:43:47,667
<i>Alex was right.
Look at this garden.</i>

1410
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:49,843
It's a bloody wasteland.

1411
01:43:50,887 --> 01:43:53,847
We could always plant
another garden, Uncle Jack.

1412
01:43:53,891 --> 01:43:56,850
This Rose Arbor took father
years and years.

1413
01:43:59,853 --> 01:44:02,444
And a lot of good it did him.

1414
01:44:07,277 --> 01:44:09,911
We don't need to have roses.

1415
01:44:09,955 --> 01:44:14,977
What about native flowers?
Look, Kangaroo Paw.

1416
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:19,481
That's a weed.
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1417
01:44:19,525 --> 01:44:22,528
Not when you look at it.

1418
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:24,573
It's beautiful.

1419
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,578
Listen, Uncle Jack.

1420
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:34,921
The magpies!

1421
01:44:37,064 --> 01:44:40,328
Isn't that the most
beautiful sound in the world?
