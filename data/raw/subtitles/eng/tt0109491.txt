1
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:54,038
Ah, just a minute, Doctor.

2
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,717
The men have taken the hat around,

3
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,260
and we think we've got just
about enough to pay you.

4
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,610
No, no, you keep it.

5
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,614
You'll need something for the funeral.
- It weren't your fault.

6
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,617
There is, um, one thing
you could do for me though.

7
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,663
<i>What's that, Doctor?</i>

8
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,974
You wouldn't have a bottle
lying around, would you?

9
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,058
I could do with a drink.

10
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:19,019
In your saddle bag.
It's three-quarters full.

11
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,305
What do you think?
What was wrong with the other one?

12
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,744
Uh, this one's English, from Bond Street.
<i>They're both nice.</i>

13
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,050
Uncle Jack, there's a feed bill
here that goes back eight months!

14
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,184
We-we have to get things sorted
out before father arrives!

15
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:57,710
Sally, Alex won't give
a damn about feed bills.

16
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:05,370
Perhaps you should wear the other tie,
Uncle Jack.

17
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,199
I-I know this one's Bond
Street and all that, but--

18
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,550
- It's a bit worn. And the jacket--
What?

19
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:13,552
Let's get Violet to give it a press.

20
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,250
Anyone seen Vi?
Oh, Sally dear,

21
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:20,080
you haven't seen the latest copy of
<i>Throne and Country</i> anywhere, have you?

22
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:22,300
Didn't you lend it to Wally?

23
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,693
- Yes, but I gave it back, Mrs. Dickens.
- I'm sure as eggs, certain.

24
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,783
<i>You see,</i>

25
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:30,351
there's a most important question I want
to put to Alexander as soon as he arrives.

26
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,224
It's about Princess Mary Louise,
but I've forgotten what it is.

27
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,835
Holy Moses, mother.

28
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,751
Alex is a writer, an esteemed
London critic, not a society gossip.

29
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,342
He won't know about
bloody Princess Mary Louise!

30
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,537
Don't swear, Jack.

31
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,628
Alexander won't like it
any more than I do. Ah!

32
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,630
Thank you, dear.

33
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:52,286
Can you imagine! A man on first-name
terms with George Bernard Shaw,

34
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,985
and coming home to live under our roof!
- Vi!

35
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,249
At last, someone in the
district with civilized values!

36
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,841
-- But what about Dr. Askey?
He's very civilized.

37
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,166
- Well, yes, there's Max.

38
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,777
Of course, a medical man, mind you.
Not quite the same thing as Alex.

39
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:05,805
But a true, true friend.

40
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,413
I mean, who's going to meet
the train on his one day off?

41
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,536
The train's due in 15 minutes!

42
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:37,331
Oh, God.

43
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,769
Hmm.
You sure that works?

44
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,163
It works for onions.
It ought to work for whiskey.

45
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:46,471
Just keep eating it.

46
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,429
Come on.

47
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:01,529
I'm so nervous.

48
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:05,272
What if I don't recognize father?
'Course you will.

49
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:09,668
But I've never seen him!
Not since I was a tiny baby.

50
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,913
- What about his new wife?
- Do you think she'll like me?

51
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:40,220
Getting more to the point,
let's hope you like her.

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,878
- Auntie Joyce! Auntie Joyce!
- Hello, Mum.

53
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:49,229
Hi! How are you?
- Harry.

54
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:51,579
- There he is!
- Hello, son.

55
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:58,064
John. Johnny!

56
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,634
Peter? Peter, over here.

57
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,724
David! Good to have you back.
How are you, man?

58
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,944
G'day, Doctor. Not too bad. Thanks.
- Good.

59
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,250
<i>This way, son.</i>

60
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:14,298
Someone should tell them the war's over.

61
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:20,260
â™ª

62
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,494
Go on.

63
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,890
Mother?

64
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,679
- Father?
- Sally.

65
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,377
<i>Can it be?</i>

66
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:54,381
- Yes, of course it is.
- How are you, my child?

67
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,621
I say, do be careful of
that little brown bag.

68
00:06:58,646 --> 00:06:59,908
There's a good fellow.

69
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,477
<i>The contents are extremely fragile!
Now, where have you put it?</i>

70
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,219
Poor Alexander.

71
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,352
We stupidly left his medicine
case in the luggage van,

72
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,789
and he's been in such
desperate need of his drops.

73
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,922
- You must be Deborah.
- Sally.

74
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,535
I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

75
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,928
Dr. Askey?

76
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,063
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

77
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,152
This is our good friend, Dr. Askey.
He's come to help with the luggage.

78
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,720
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Voysey.

79
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,114
How do you do?

80
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,768
Say, I think--
Your--

81
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,946
- My husband?
- Yes. Your husband.

82
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,297
It looks as if, maybe,
we should lend a hand.

83
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,999
Nine, ten, eleven bags.

84
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,349
Hatbox, three trunks...

85
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,351
<i>and my medicine case.</i>

86
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,137
Just coming for the weekend, are we?

87
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,617
Father, this is Dr. Askey.
He's come to help with the luggage.

88
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,142
Oh, how kind.
How do you do?

89
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,363
<i>Oh, so many things.</i>

90
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,540
We poor nomads must travel with all
our goods on our back, so to speak.

91
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,325
Is this it then?

92
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:13,112
- Ah, my books!
- But where's the other crate?

93
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,636
Sally, I think we're going to
need a little extra transport.

94
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,204
I'll scout around town,
see what I can find.

95
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,959
Oh.

96
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:14,217
They're coming.
They're coming!

97
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,611
They're coming!

98
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,179
- They're coming, mother.
- I know. I know, dear.

99
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,660
And that question wasn't about Princess
Mary Louise at all. It was about--

100
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,576
-- Later. - Later, mother, later.
- Where's Hannah? Violet!

101
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:28,492
- Yes, sir?
- Where's my jacket?

102
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,451
<i>Get that out of sight!</i>

103
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:52,777
Violet!

104
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,941
Ah, Hannah. Afternoon tea, please.
They'll be parched.

105
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,336
- My lovely lunch has gone to waste, you know.
- Stone cold.

106
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,338
They're here, Jack.

107
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,994
- Ah, late for lunch.
- Scamps!

108
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,956
My dear, Maud,

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,958
I'm afraid I can't answer you.
- Oh.

110
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,178
That question to someone
of a more elevated station

111
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:50,051
than a mere scribe.
Oh. He's coming.

112
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:55,753
Alex.
How are you?

113
00:10:55,796 --> 00:11:00,366
-<i>Welcome home to Canterbury.
- A pilgrim's return.</i>

114
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:05,850
And nothing has changed it would seem.

115
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,853
Except us, of course,
eh, Jack?

116
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,856
I used to be in perfect health,
and you were once so dapper.

117
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,946
- But I haven't introduced you.
- My wife, Deborah.

118
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:18,515
<i>Yes, my dear, we used to call
young Jack the dandy of the district.</i>

119
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,734
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

120
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,994
And, uh, th-this is Wally Wells,
who lives with us.

121
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,133
How do you do?

122
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:31,745
Please, come inside.

123
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,747
Wally the lodger, that's me.

124
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:42,408
Where's your tie?

125
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:45,933
You've all missed lunch, I'm afraid,

126
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,414
but Hannah will provide a
substantial afternoon tea.

127
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,722
- Ah.
- How very kind, Jack.

128
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:55,769
But if you don't mind--
Wh-where's he gone?

129
00:11:55,813 --> 00:12:00,208
- I've no idea.
- Sit down, everybody.

130
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,824
Thank you, Hannah.

131
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:11,089
Oh, Hannah, I'm sure you remember
my famous son-in-law, don't you?

132
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:14,832
Indeed I do.
What, 25 years is it, Hannah?

133
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,225
You've gone gray.

134
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,207
- And this is Mrs. Voysey.
- How do you do?

135
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,258
<i>You've missed lunch, you two,
but I'm not going to waste it.</i>

136
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,360
You'll be having it for supper.

137
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:28,656
Ah,
Hannah's brought in the tea, I see.

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,300
I'm afraid, Jack, I shall have to forgo what
indeed appears to be a substantial repast.

139
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:37,207
But my sinus trouble has
been playing up on the journey,

140
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,248
<i>and there's nothing for it but
my drops and to lie down...</i>

141
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,754
- with the curtains drawn.
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

142
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,623
- No, no, no, no, no.
- An irritating affliction, as much to others,

143
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,626
I'm sure, as to myself.
- Vi, show father his room.

144
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:51,608
Is there anything we can get you?
- Not a thing.

145
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,611
Well, perhaps, Sally,
just a cup of tea in my room...

146
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,743
<i>in ten minutes time,
if it's not too much trouble.</i>

147
00:12:56,787 --> 00:13:00,617
- Uh, no milk.
- Sugar, two lumps.

148
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,359
Uh, oh, so sorry.

149
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,978
Father, I'm sure you didn't
leave it on the platform.

150
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,807
I distinctly remember you had
it with you outside the station.

151
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,811
Well, where is it then?
I'm absolutely done for without those drops.

152
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,335
How can I possibly replace
them out here in the bush?

153
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,164
If they are lost, I'm sure
Dr. Askey could replace them.

154
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,471
- Dr. Askey?
- Uh, where do you want these?

155
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,073
Father--
Sorry, miss.

156
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:31,675
Those drops were prescribed by Billington,

157
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:34,373
one of the top ear, nose,
and throat men in Harley Street.

158
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:38,959
Merry Christmas.

159
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:42,180
Come on, Cockie.
Merry Christmas.

160
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,201
Merry Christmas.

161
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,184
It's no good, ol' chap.
He's just not in the mood.

162
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,405
<i>Still, he was a lovely
Christmas present, Wally.</i>

163
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:54,332
I kept him hidden in the woolshed for months.
Taught him to say "Merry Christmas" myself.

164
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,201
Jack, pass the rock cakes.
Hmm?

165
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,861
- Rock cake?
- Delicious, but one was more than enough.

166
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:12,863
Come on, Max, someone's
got to eat these things.

167
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,952
Hannah's in a bad
enough mood as it is.

168
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:18,085
Oh. Got a mallet?

169
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,697
<i>They're like coconuts,
lovely once you get inside.</i>

170
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,700
- Can be said of a lot of things.

171
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,794
Jack! Oh.

172
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,367
Uh, please, sir, Mr. Voysey wants to
know if anyone's seen his medicine case?

173
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,848
He's real upset.
Hmm?

174
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,542
Isn't this it?
Hmm? Hmm?

175
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,503
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

176
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,725
Violet, you clever, clever girl!

177
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,859
I'm indebted to you forever.
Oh, father, what a relief!

178
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,253
We'll get these blinds down, Hannah.

179
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,298
Do you remember this room, father?

180
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,954
Uncle Jack tells me that it was yours
and mother's when you were first married.

181
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:04,392
It was indeed, though
memory plays such odd tricks.

182
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,395
I was certain that it was larger, airier.

183
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,572
It's the best bedroom in the house.

184
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:13,750
My dear, it's a delightful room.
It will make an ideal study.

185
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:19,277
- Now, uh, where will Deborah sleep?
- Well... we thought--

186
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,586
There's this big, double bed here.
Ah, yes, but you see, my work.

187
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,720
This will do very nicely for me,
but I frequently write late into the night.

188
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:31,942
<i>And I'm not so selfish as to expect
Deborah to stay awake with me until dawn.</i>

189
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:34,292
I see.

190
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:37,164
Tell you what,
my bedroom is right across the corridor.

191
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,602
I'll clear my things out before dinner--
You'll do what?

192
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:43,954
- You'll do nothing of the sort!
- You've had that room since you were a baby.

193
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:46,391
-<i>A tiny baby!
- Shh, Hannah.</i>

194
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:50,003
- When you went off to London and left her!
<i>- Hannah!</i>

195
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,484
After her poor mother died!
- Hannah!

196
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,095
There are ten bedrooms in this house!

197
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,924
- Most of them are empty!
- Uncle Jack moved out of his room.

198
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:03,539
- I can perfectly well move out of mine!
- And you and Violet can help me.

199
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,280
It might help, you know?
It always does with my headaches.

200
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,393
Maybe not this afternoon, Jack.

201
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,675
Well, Deborah said he's fond
of music, very fond of music.

202
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,677
Oh, extremely fond.
- See?

203
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,593
- He won't hear it up there,will he?
- Well, it'll be distant,

204
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:18,205
but that's all to the good, soothing.

205
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:23,167
Just six drops.
No more, no less.

206
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,867
Six drops in one nostril.
Six drops in the other.

207
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,653
- One.
- Hmm. <i>â™ª</i>

208
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:33,656
They're not eye drops, my dear!
- You moved.

209
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,007
It's no wonder.
What in God's name is that racket?

210
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,009
It's Uncle Jack's Gramophone.

211
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,447
He has the finest collection of
recordings of good music in the district.

212
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,798
- And is this an example?
- It's historic.

213
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:49,280
Well, surely, you recognize it.
â™ª

214
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,984
Alex'll recognize this.

215
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:01,684
A poor recording, of course, by today's
standards, but what an occasion!

216
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,643
Melba's Massenet concert in the
Royal Albert Hall in 1903,

217
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,776
recorded on the very night!

218
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,300
â™ª

219
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:27,361
<i>Sir?
Mr. Voysey!</i>

220
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:29,712
Mr. Voysey, sir!
What?

221
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:32,932
Mr. Voysey!

222
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,979
â™ª
What's this about Mr. Voysey?

223
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:39,852
Sir, Mr. Voysey asked if Mrs. Voysey
could go and give him his nose drops?

224
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:44,683
- Miss Sally isn't doing it right.

225
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:48,078
People often ask me if we're
related to the novelist Charles Dickens,

226
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:52,082
<i>and I have to say, "Oh, dear me, no.
No connection whatever."</i>

227
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,345
We're the Gloucestershire Dickens.
Hmm.

228
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:58,436
Good lord, mother, I should think you'd be
proud to include a great writer in the family.

229
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:01,265
- Though, hopefully, a less sentimental one.
- I so agree, Alexander.

230
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:03,876
Alex?

231
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,662
Oh, heavens, no.
I had more than enough before dinner.

232
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:09,839
I'm sure our friends down
the table won't decline a shot.

233
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,232
- I wouldn't say no, Jack.
- You're right.

234
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,676
<i>Friends, I have an announcement to make.</i>

235
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:25,898
Your new arrivals, Deborah and myself,
would like to make a gift to the household.

236
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:28,052
What would you say to some
French wine from Sydney?

237
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:28,771
Oh.

238
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:32,383
Alex, that's very decent of you!

239
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:34,820
Well, I seem to remember
in your father's day,

240
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,127
this house had the
best cellar in the district.

241
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,607
The best of everything before the crash.

242
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:44,874
<i>Uh, to begin with, I would suggest
at least a dozen cases of good claret.</i>

243
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,878
Chateau Margaux happens to be my favorite,
but some of you may prefer a Pauillac.

244
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,143
- And a dozen cases of white burgundy.
- I'll order it tomorrow.

245
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:57,974
- Oh. Do you hear that, Sally?
French wine.

246
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:00,150
You'll find Canterbury
has a lot to offer you, Alex.

247
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:04,415
Peace and quiet for your work, a good library,
Wally brings us the London magazines.

248
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,419
Oh, and, uh, don't forget
my mouth organ, Jack.

249
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:11,814
â™ª

250
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:15,818
â™ª Give me your answer do â™ª

251
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,081
- Thanks, Wal.

252
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:21,432
There's just one, small request...

253
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:23,695
I'd like to ask in return.

254
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:28,613
- Tonight we dined at 7:00.
- Five to, to be precise.

255
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:33,009
Could I put in a plea to have dinner
served at the more civilized hour of 8:00?

256
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,577
<i>Or even 8:30?</i>

257
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:42,932
We have dinner at 7:00, father, because
we have to get up early to run the property.

258
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,370
Ah.
Uh, no, Sally.

259
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:51,201
- Alex is right. Let's not be set in our ways.
Hannah won't like it.

260
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:55,771
Oh, good God! Hannah will do as she's told.
We don't run the house for the servants!

261
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:07,521
Four, five, six, uh--
Now the other one. Ah.

262
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:11,395
Come in.

263
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:14,398
I just want to say good night,

264
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,835
and make sure that
Deborah's room is all right.

265
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,216
Violet and I have moved
some of the furniture around.

266
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,447
I hope you don't mind.

267
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:23,276
- Oh, no, no, no, of course not.
- It's your room now.

268
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,931
I've left mother's picture behind.

269
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,455
-<i>Do you mind if I get it?
- Oh, please.</i>

270
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:47,621
<i>You can have it if you like,</i>

271
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:50,755
but it's hopelessly out of date.

272
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:04,551
- When I was little, I was just like them.
- I never missed a killing.

273
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:06,684
Now I hate it.

274
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,992
Go on, you kids!

275
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:15,258
Miss Sally? We slaughter once a week,
so I hope you like meat.

276
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,347
- Oh, I love lamb.
- No, mutton. Miss Sally?

277
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,175
Miss Sally, Mr. Dickens wants to see you.
Says it's real urgent!

278
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:23,483
What about?
<i>Don't know. It's real urgent he says.</i>

279
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:26,573
- Hello, Vi.
- Hello, Billy.

280
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,578
Oh, sorry, missus.

281
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:42,589
Max is a nice enough cove, but everywhere
he goes, he leaves a trail of bloody abos!

282
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:46,332
The natives get sick just like
everyone else, Uncle Jack.

283
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:49,727
Yes, but what are Alex and Deborah gonna think?
This place isn't a bloody mission!

284
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,034
Oh, they'll be gone soon enough.

285
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:55,428
Look, you amuse father.
I'll do what I can with Deborah.

286
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:08,572
Yes, Wally is giving me a ride into town.

287
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:11,923
- Who-who is this Mr. Wells?
- Is he a member of the family?

288
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,230
No, no, no,
just a friend.

289
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:18,408
A couple of years ago,
his wife ran off with the local dentist.

290
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,410
Well, Jack was worried he'd
do himself some mischief,

291
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,803
so he took him under his wing.
- Oh.

292
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:25,719
Wait for me!

293
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:28,157
Good grief!

294
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:32,509
It's nothing short of a tragedy.

295
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:36,556
Well, the famous Rose Arbor
needed a lot of attention.

296
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,472
And, first the crash, then the war;
we didn't have the men.

297
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:42,693
- The finest English garden in the district.
- Now look at it!

298
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:46,131
A wasteland.

299
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,614
Do you remember the tree house, Alex?

300
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:54,879
- When we were kids, Ann and I used to
sit up there, pretending we were sailing...

301
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,751
all the way to England.
- And the hollyhocks--

302
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:01,494
I distinctly remember a
riot of color over there.

303
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,844
You're the one who got there, Alex.

304
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:08,066
Twenty-two years as drama critic
on the London Sentinel.

305
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,809
What a wonderful life you've had.
- Huh.

306
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,855
- G'day, Fred. Good news about Billy.
- Yeah.

307
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:17,075
I reckon his new leg'll be ready by Friday.

308
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,818
You met Billy, Fred's youngest.
Lost a leg in the war.

309
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:24,256
Fred, we ought to do something about
organizing that birthday party of yours.

310
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,607
Do right. I reckon I'm
about due for a party.

311
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:30,828
Fred's forgotten how old he is.

312
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:33,831
I used to know.

313
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,139
I had a birthday regular 'til I was 14.

314
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:42,492
Then I started knockin' about the country,
drivin' fence and shearing and all that.

315
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:45,147
Well, I forgot all about it.

316
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,453
Well, I'd start with your 15th birthday,

317
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:50,282
and then I'd have a party
every month until you catch up.

318
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:54,156
Good-bye, all.
Sally, I'll see you at the wildlife lecture...

319
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,158
- on Wednesday, a week.
- Mmm, you know I'll be there.

320
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,856
And if it's of any interest to her,
perhaps...

321
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,163
Mrs. Voysey might like to come.

322
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:03,861
Mmm. And father?

323
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:07,647
Oh, yes, of course.
M-Mrs. Voysey and... Mr. Voysey.

324
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:11,912
Giddyap there.

325
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:15,742
- Delphiniums.
- I seem to remember delphiniums.

326
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:18,963
This book you're working on
at the moment, Alex-

327
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:22,140
- How could I have forgotten this heat?
- Oh, yes! I'm sorry.

328
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:24,882
Sit-sit down.

329
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,189
This book you're writing though,
Alex, what's it about?

330
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,670
What?
Oh, a specialist affair, Jack.

331
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:33,064
I doubt if you'd find it
in the least to your taste.

332
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:37,373
But those years in London, Alex.
The people you've met.

333
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,986
The intellectuals and the, the pretty,
young actresses too. Eh, old chap?

334
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,597
- Well, yes, I must admit,
there've been one or two of those.

335
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,565
Morning tea?

336
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:58,829
- Lunch.
- At noon?

337
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,093
- Grilled mutton chops.
- Three each.

338
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:05,227
With mashed swede and boiled potatoes.

339
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,408
Braised mutton chops.

340
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:17,152
Make sure you eat 'em up.

341
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:22,200
- Cold mutton with Indian chutney.
- Perfect for this weather.

342
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:25,421
Don't let those flies settle.

343
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:29,076
Boiled fowl.

344
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,950
<i>With carrots, fresh from the garden.</i>

345
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:37,172
- It's the truth.
- Fred dug 'em up this morning.

346
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:45,571
This is what happens when you
cut down all the trees and overstock.

347
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:48,008
And it's not only the small properties.

348
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,010
I noticed that Mr. Pettinger,

349
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,536
the manager of Legaland Imperial
Pastoral Holdings, is with us tonight.

350
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,625
<i>It's good to see you, Mr. Pettinger.</i>

351
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:59,846
You might be interested to see what's
happening over on the northeast boundary...

352
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,153
<i>of your 30,000 acres.</i>

353
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:06,766
<i>Now some of you already know that I have a
thousand acres just west of Legal and Imperial.</i>

354
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:12,163
And on that property I've tried to recreate
the land as it used to be 50 years ago.

355
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,774
<i>There are 11 sorts of
eucalyptus on this slope,</i>

356
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:19,301
<i>and under those gums there's
grazing for kangaroos and wallabies.</i>

357
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:22,173
In my opinion, Dr. Askey, a
sad waste of good grazing land.

358
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:26,873
<i>Legal and Imperial are always prepared to
offer you a very fair price for your holding...</i>

359
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,006
anytime you come to your senses.

360
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,011
And if the aborigines--
the few that are left--

361
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,840
want to camp on my property,
they are free to do so.

362
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:39,712
Oh, why?
So they can climb my fences and eat my sheep?

363
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:43,803
<i>Exactly! It gives me no pleasure
to say this, but aborigines are pests!</i>

364
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:46,328
<i>No less than the rabbits and the foxes!</i>

365
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:49,809
Weren't the rabbits and the foxes
brought over from Britain, Mr. Pettinger?

366
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,858
Ah, you'll find no sympathy
for your anti-British,

367
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,253
<i>antiwar sentiments here, Dr. Askey.
That's right.</i>

368
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,995
- The war's over, Mr. Pettinger.
- Yes! And we won it!

369
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,217
<i>Go on there, Ken! Heigh-ho! Well said!</i>

370
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:09,829
Well, I wonder if we did.
I wonder if we did, Mr. Pettinger.

371
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:14,312
We're saddled with a war debt that, ten years
from now, is going to bankrupt this country.

372
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:16,314
Bolshevik!
<i>[ Man #2 ] Fuck, yeah, Bolshevik!</i>

373
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,146
I lost my son in the war, Doctor.
I know you did, Mr. Wilson,

374
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:25,628
and no one was sorrier than I was.

375
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,370
I sat with Dick for four nights,
getting him through meningitis.

376
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:32,156
- Do you remember that?
- And are you saying his death was pointless?

377
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:36,116
Nothing is pointless,
if we can learn from it.

378
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,817
And what exactly have we learned from it,
Dr. Askey?

379
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,602
Well, I hope that we've learned...

380
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,083
never to send the finest of our young men...

381
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:50,305
<i>12,000 miles to fight a
war that isn't about politics,</i>

382
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,307
<i>but is about British trade!</i>

383
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,613
But we're all British!
That's right! Yeah!

384
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,050
And I'd like an explanation why wh-when...

385
00:28:57,094 --> 00:29:01,751
- British troops had casualties of 40 percent,
Australian--- â™ª God save our gracious queen

386
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,796
- You have to stand. It's the law.
â™ª

387
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,756
...under a British high command had-had...

388
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,760
casualties of over 60 percent!
Bolshevik!

389
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:14,503
<i>â™ª Bolshevik! Bolshevik!
Bolshevik! Bolshevik!</i>

390
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,291
Bolshevik! Bolshevik!

391
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,392
Well, I'm glad to see you got
the use of your arm back, David.

392
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:36,786
Too right.

393
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:43,053
I'll have to ask you to go now, Dr. Askey.

394
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:46,317
<i>We can't run the risk of more trouble.</i>

395
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,625
<i>Quite understand, Vicar.</i>

396
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:51,670
Thanks for the use of the hall.

397
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,327
Well, Mrs. Voysey,
not quite what you expected, eh?

398
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:59,635
- No.
- Me neither. My apologies.

399
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,637
Lucky father's sinuses were playing up.

400
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,032
- But those awful men!
- What are you going to do?

401
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,513
Well, Mrs. Voysey,
one of the few advantages...

402
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,342
of being the only doctor in
the district is that, eventually,

403
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:14,432
if you wait long enough, all the
people that say that they hate you,

404
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:18,828
turn up on your doorstep with
kidney stones or an anal abscess...

405
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:21,308
or something that's
giving them terrible bother.

406
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,094
They never seem to want to
talk about Bolshevism then.

407
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,101
- Come on, girl. Good girl. Step on it.
- Come around there, Bluey.

408
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:34,365
- Come around! Come on!
- You know that doctor fella's got me thinking.

409
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:37,847
- What's that, Fred?
- Well, look at it this way.

410
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,502
If I haven't had a birthday
since I was a kiddie,

411
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:43,418
and let's say I'm 65 now,

412
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:47,073
that's close on 50 birthdays
I've got coming to me.

413
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:50,033
Now the boss gives himself
a day off on his birthday.

414
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:53,384
So I reckon I'm owed
about seven weeks holiday.

415
00:30:53,428 --> 00:30:54,189
It's only justice.

416
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,518
Oh, I don't think Uncle
Jack could do without you...

417
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,868
- for seven weeks, Fred.
- No?

418
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:03,046
No. Why not tell him you got a
21st coming up, and settle for a week.

419
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:16,973
Oh!

420
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:23,588
Come on. Oh!

421
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,723
<i>Hey, Miss Sally, don't get them woolies wet.
They'll shrink!</i>

422
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,958
<i>That looks unpleasant work, Jack.
Should you be doing that?</i>

423
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:50,180
- Well, someone's got to do it.
- We don't want the entire mobfly-blown.

424
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:52,269
<i>Ah, Jack, how I envy you.</i>

425
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,664
- I never had a practical side.
- Yeah, well--

426
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,536
Uh, there's something I-I've been
meaning to discuss with you, Jack.

427
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,408
- Is this a good moment?
- It's as good as any.

428
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,630
This, uh, this Wally fellow--
He's been living at Canterbury how long?

429
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,851
- Two years this winter.
- And he has this job in town?

430
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,854
At the post office, two days a week.
- Ah.

431
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:16,118
And does he, uh, pay rent?
- No.

432
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:18,469
- Well, it's just that, as you know better than I,

433
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:20,906
though the family is quite comfortably off,

434
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,084
we can't really afford, you know,
to carry passengers.

435
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:32,396
Twice a week, Wally brings us mail
and provisions from town.

436
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,485
Every month he gives me a haircut
because he knows...

437
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,923
I can't stand tripping off
to that bloody barbershop!

438
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:41,187
Wally's not only a good friend,
but he's a useful one!

439
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,799
- All right, Jack.
- Don't get excited.

440
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:49,282
You've explained it,
and I understand, perfectly.

441
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:56,681
- Good heavens!
- Hannah will never forgive me.

442
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,336
Afternoon tea.

443
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,653
Fetch my manuscript, will you?

444
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,959
You're nearer. Fetch it yourself.

445
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:16,353
You know very well
I'm trying to rest my leg.

446
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:21,358
-<i>Try exercising it.
- Oh, dear. Stupid of me to forget...</i>

447
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:24,909
that the young haven't the least
comprehension of what it's like to be old.

448
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,101
You're not old.

449
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,192
Hardly the bloom of
youth I would have thought.

450
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:30,367
-<i>And I'm not young.
- Sixty-two.</i>

451
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,806
What's inside--
Oh, all right! You're as old as the hills!

452
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,330
Don't worry.
In a few year's time, I'll be old myself.

453
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:39,855
Frankly, I can't wait!

454
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:46,252
I'll fetch your manuscript.
<i>No, leave it.</i>

455
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:48,733
- Leave it!

456
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,083
<i>Don't trouble yourself.</i>

457
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:54,434
<i>And in a few year's time, I'll be dead.
Then we'll both be happy.</i>

458
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:56,349
Shh.

459
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:59,831
<i>Good Lord, Sally!
What have you been doing?</i>

460
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,964
You look positively filthy.

461
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,096
Any tea left?

462
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,925
Cold.
Violet?

463
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,711
-- I'm parched.
- Sit down. You must be exhausted.

464
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:12,235
Oh, I'll sit over here, thanks.
I'm sopping.

465
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:15,455
- Oh, what have you two been doing?
- Nothing.

466
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:19,938
- Absolutely nothing.
- We're bored to death.

467
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,160
Do something then.
Find something to do.

468
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,250
Here?
Good heavens, what?

469
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:31,471
I have my work, of course.
There's the garden.

470
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,691
<i>If you really want to make yourself useful,</i>

471
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,693
there's the station hand's
children to teach.

472
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:38,174
Half of them can't even read or write.

473
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:42,221
- I'd be no good at that.
- Sometimes I think...

474
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:45,268
I'm the only person in this
house who actually enjoys life.

475
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:48,750
You'd learn. Look at me.

476
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:53,711
I only started working on the property
when the men went off to war. Now I love it.

477
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:57,062
You really expect me
to just drop everything...

478
00:34:57,106 --> 00:35:00,022
and become school teacher
to some dirty children?

479
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:04,156
- You said you were bored.
- I'm not as bored as that.

480
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:08,030
All right.

481
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,775
-<i>Uh, not having any tea, miss?
- I think I'll have a bath.</i>

482
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,951
Right.

483
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:18,780
Uh, is-is that, uh,
fresh tea, Violet?

484
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:23,219
Just made, yes, sir.
No milk, two lumps.

485
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:25,830
<i>Exactement.
But first, be a dear...</i>

486
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,528
and pass that folder to me, will you?

487
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:38,669
- Here you are, sir.
- What would I do without you, Vi?

488
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:42,107
My little handmaiden.
[ Chuckling ] Ah, sir.

489
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:55,033
Come on, beauty.
Come on. There.

490
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:59,995
<i>Come on, beauty. There's a good boy.
There's a good boy.</i>

491
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:05,783
<i>There's a good boy. There's a good boy.</i>

492
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,917
There's a beauty.

493
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:43,560
Oh. I'm all right,
I'm all right.

494
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:47,738
I'm... just being silly.

495
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:53,396
It's all right, Jack.
Please, just leave me alone.

496
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,574
Just leave me alone!

497
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:10,326
My dear, great news!

498
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:12,850
Our wine has arrived!

499
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:44,416
<i>Fred's got all that liquor
stowed in the cellar.</i>

500
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,622
<i>Wine, Hannah.</i>

501
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:48,555
And he wants to know if he
can have a bottle for himself.

502
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:50,018
This is his preference.

503
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:54,587
<i>Chateauneuf du Pape, 1911.
Why this one?</i>

504
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:59,244
- He likes the label.
- Oh, very well.

505
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:03,901
He tells me that four bottles of
this same stuff got broke, you know.

506
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:07,122
<i>In the unpacking.</i>

507
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:10,342
You've got a key to
that cellar door, Hannah.

508
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:13,998
Over 500 bottles.
It's a disgrace.

509
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,087
You're gonna drink yourself
to death, you know.

510
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:20,265
â™ª Oh, Danny boy

511
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:25,967
â™ª The pipes, the pipes are calling â™ª

512
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,840
â™ª From glen to glen

513
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:35,541
â™ª And down the mountainside

514
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:39,458
â™ª The summer's gone

515
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:43,375
â™ª And

516
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:47,858
â™ª All the roses dying

517
00:38:47,902 --> 00:38:52,080
But the Chateauneuf du Pape,
of all things!

518
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,560
I've already told you, Alex,
it won't happen again. <i>â™ª</i>

519
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:57,999
A sampling case containing only half
a dozen bottles, of which one remains!

520
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:01,872
<i>How can one possibly build
up a cellar if this goes on?</i>

521
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,048
Father, let's try and enjoy
the wine we're drinking.

522
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,573
- You were telling us about it.
- This is a burgundy?

523
00:39:07,617 --> 00:39:10,620
- Quite delicious!
- Don't you agree, Mr. Wells?

524
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:14,754
Oh, slips down very nicely.
It should be colder, of course.

525
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:16,887
And I believe would be tasted
to better advantage...

526
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:20,369
accompanying a dish other than
Hannah's Tuesday pea soup!

527
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:23,894
â™ª
Yes, this is a white burgundy.

528
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:28,594
A little more, please,
before it warms up.

529
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,165
â™ª Oh, Danny boy
Hannah, do you think we should?

530
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:37,995
Heavens, girl! There are hundreds and
hundreds of bottles down there below.

531
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,173
This is an odd one.
Sure they won't even notice it's gone.

532
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:46,308
Ah, drink up! Strengthens
the blood, this does.

533
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,527
- Chateauneuf du Pape.
- Mm-hmm.

534
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:51,574
Ah, that'll be them,

535
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:54,142
wanting their chops.

536
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:59,451
This is a straight forward claret.
Nothing special.

537
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:02,628
A reliable <i>cru bourgeois
from the Haut-Medoc.</i>

538
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:07,590
Color?
Mmm.

539
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:10,114
Nose?
Interesting.

540
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,900
I hope all that wine you're
drinking's not going to ruin me chops.

541
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:18,079
- On the contrary, Hannah,
- I think it will undoubtedly improve them.

542
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:26,000
<i>â™ª In sunshine</i>
Hannah, would you go to the woodshed...

543
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:28,002
<i>â™ª Or in shadow</i>
and tell Fred to stop singing?

544
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:30,308
It's making the dogs howl.
You're asking the impossible.

545
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:34,225
The man is as drunk as a lord.
Try anyhow.

546
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:39,839
â™ª When summer's on the meadow

547
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:43,843
â™ª And all the valley's hushed

548
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:48,370
â™ª And white with snow â™ª
Fred! Fred Livingstone, do you hear me?

549
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,373
Will you stop that unholy
racket this instant?

550
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,332
What do you mean "racket"?
I'm singing!

551
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:56,508
Aw, be off with you...

552
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:59,946
before the boss comes
hunting you with his rifle.

553
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,298
Bugger off, you stupid old cow.

554
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,648
<i>And bugger off the boss!</i>

555
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:10,317
<i>And bugger off the bloody lot of yous!</i>

556
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:19,736
Fred...
sweetheart.

557
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:23,013
Let's be friends.
Come over here.

558
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:25,624
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

559
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:29,150
It's the last one left.

560
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,115
Not some more of that there
Chateauneuf du Pape stuff?

561
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,944
Aha, that would be telling.

562
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:43,033
<i>Come on here...</i>

563
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:44,991
and see for yourself.

564
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:50,127
Jesus, bloody, Christ!

565
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:55,219
<i>Ya dirty, dilapidated old Irish whore!</i>

566
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,179
<i>You know that du Pape stuff?</i>

567
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:03,271
<i>You can shove it up
your big, fat, Irish ass!</i>

568
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,536
<i>You big, fuckin' trollop.</i>

569
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:10,409
You could've given a man
fuckin' pneumonia, you know!

570
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:13,759
Right, everybody,
I'd like you to...

571
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:16,458
charge your glasses
with some more of this...

572
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:20,157
reliable, straightforward claret,
courtesy of Alex.

573
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:23,856
- No more for me, Uncle Jack. - Debbie?
- Debbie, yes, of course.

574
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,033
Really, this Australian
insistence on diminutives.

575
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,993
My wife's name,
good people, is Deborah.

576
00:42:30,036 --> 00:42:32,822
My name is Alexander.
Maud's name is Maud.

577
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,868
- And Walter's name is Wally.
- Too right.

578
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:38,741
They only called me Walter, as a kid,
when I was due for a thrashing.

579
00:42:38,784 --> 00:42:42,788
Alexander is quite right.
Abbreviations are vulgar.

580
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:46,792
-<i>Deborah now is a lovely name.</i>
- It is indeed...

581
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:49,708
<i>a lovely, lovely name.
Please don't drink any more, Uncle Jack.</i>

582
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:53,582
And I'd like you to charge your glass.
You know you'll regret it. - I'd like you...

583
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,888
<i>to charge your glasses...</i>

584
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:58,935
and drink to that lovely name.

585
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:02,378
And to the lovely person
who's called by that lovely name.

586
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:04,067
- Just sit down, Uncle Jack.

587
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:08,750
So, I'd like you to toast,
not Debbie, not Mrs. Voysey,

588
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:11,388
<i>but lovely Deborah.</i>

589
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:14,077
<i>Everybody,
lovely Deborah.</i>

590
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:21,784
Lovely Deborah.

591
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:24,439
Uncle Jack, you're embarrassing her.

592
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:27,442
Am I?
I'm terribly sorry.

593
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,801
And not another word,
except to say...

594
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:33,074
<i>except to say...</i>

595
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:36,960
Deborah,
you are too lovely...

596
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:38,502
to be sad.

597
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:47,626
- I'm sorry, everyone.
- I have a most terrible headache.

598
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:53,032
- Wh-what have I done?
- Just sit down, Uncle Jack.

599
00:43:53,076 --> 00:43:56,471
It is true. She has been off-color today.
- Poor child.

600
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:59,691
Perhaps I should just, uh--
If you'll all excuse me.

601
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,566
Uh, Sally...

602
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:07,482
would you ask Violet to
bring me coffee upstairs?

603
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:10,224
Uh, I shall be working late.

604
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:22,706
What's the use of me explaining it to you?
You wouldn't understand.

605
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:26,057
How can I possibly understand if you
won't explain to me what the matter is?

606
00:44:26,101 --> 00:44:28,494
Oh, just go away! Go away, all of you!

607
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:30,896
<i>Impossible, impossible, impossible!
Leave me alone!</i>

608
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,073
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

609
00:44:38,861 --> 00:44:42,386
Violet?

610
00:45:21,947 --> 00:45:25,864
â™ª

611
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:55,459
- It's Mr. Voysey's room.
- Merciful Jesus! At 2:00 in the morning!

612
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:02,197
He's having the old stuff, heated up.
Hmm.

613
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,382
And you're not giving him
any biscuits either!

614
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:09,168
Fancy waking us all up in
the black middle of the night!

615
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:16,524
- Over here, over here.
- And close the door, my dear.

616
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:39,219
You're a very pretty girl.
Do you know that, Vi?

617
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:40,591
Yes, sir.

618
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:44,116
- These are very pretty buttons.
- What are they? Velvet?

619
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,119
Are they made of velvet?

620
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:49,600
What have we here, eh?

621
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:52,777
- Something very nice,
- I'm sure.

622
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:56,302
Sugar and spice and all things nice.

623
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,610
That's what little Vi is made of.

624
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,748
All right, Violet, you may go.

625
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,490
- Sir?
- Off to bed with you!

626
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,452
<i>Vi?</i>

627
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:18,673
Our little secret, eh?

628
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,807
<i>Sleep well, my child.</i>

629
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:35,516
You'll enjoy it when you get there, Alex.

630
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,737
You always do.

631
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,490
- Don't be hard on Fred, Uncle Jack.
He's very contrite.

632
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:56,450
And so he bloody should be.
- At least he's dressed.

633
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:38,883
Later, Vi, later.

634
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,335
Ahh.

635
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,560
No, please, all of you, leave this
hopelessly impractical man behind...

636
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:05,195
<i>and go off and enjoy yourselves.</i>

637
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:07,912
<i>But, father, we can't leave
you here with just Fred.</i>

638
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:11,437
<i>Sally, you've forced me to say it.
My leg, as Deborah knows--</i>

639
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,049
My left leg is causing me
considerable pain!

640
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:16,573
<i>No, I-I would prefer to stay here.</i>

641
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:19,010
So you want me to stay here
with you, Alexander, is that it?

642
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:23,232
<i>But, father, that's unfair!
Debbie has never even seen a kangaroo!</i>

643
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:26,888
For heaven's sake, go!
Everyone, go, go, go!

644
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,934
- Shall I stay?
- What?

645
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:34,732
I'll stay.

646
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:38,301
Go off, you two.

647
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:39,995
Go on.

648
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:41,802
Sure?

649
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,104
Go on.

650
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,951
Chablis?

651
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:03,928
Oh, look out.

652
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:26,516
I've got a pebble in my shoe.

653
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:34,063
Here.

654
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,862
Hadn't we better be getting back?

655
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,564
Yes.

656
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:59,475
- Back?
- Please.

657
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:06,351
Uncle Jack!

658
00:52:06,395 --> 00:52:08,353
<i>We're home!</i>

659
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,409
And you saw the kangaroos?
Yes. Yes, we did.

660
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,367
Aren't they adorable?

661
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:25,022
Hopping about,were they, dear?

662
00:52:25,066 --> 00:52:27,982
Yes, yes.
- Hopping about.
- Oh!

663
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,813
Tea?

664
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:45,521
Sally?
Sal?

665
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:46,957
Good heavens, Jack!

666
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:50,395
<i>Still in your pajamas?</i>

667
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:53,024
- I'm sorry, Sally. The man may
be your father, but he's a fraud.

668
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,531
-<i>A total, bloody fraud!
- Uncle Jack, he'll hear you.</i>

669
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,533
Three hundred and twenty-one pages...

670
00:52:57,576 --> 00:52:59,535
in which there isn't a single
sentence worth reading.

671
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:01,537
- Just listen to this. I'll give you an example.
No, it's all right.

672
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,409
-- I'll put it back. He won't even notice.
- Listen to this.

673
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:08,587
"Miss Gwendolyn Ashley,
she of the twinkling toes,

674
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,895
"has lost none of her vivacious
charm since she won all hearts...

675
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:17,648
as Odette in <i>Parisienne,</i> and I was but
one of the multitude to salute her return."

676
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,077
It isn't even a book!

677
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:22,863
It's just a collection of his rotten,
old press cuttings!

678
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:26,083
He never pretended to be
anything other than a critic.

679
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:28,259
Is this what our work's
been about all these years?

680
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:30,914
During the war when you and I had to
run the property practically on our own?

681
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,416
Is this why, on the fifth of the
month every month for 25 years,

682
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,918
I've sent that check to England?

683
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,791
So that this humbug of a man could
write about "Miss Gwendolyn Ashley,

684
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,271
she of the twinkling toes"?

685
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:43,927
I've wasted my entire life!

686
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,930
<i>He'll hear you, Uncle Jack.</i>

687
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:54,590
- And you, Sally.
- What about you?

688
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:58,246
He didn't think twice about
you when your mother died. No!

689
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:00,297
The gifted member of the family;

690
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:04,034
he had to run off to London
to pursue his important career!

691
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:08,173
Worse things have happened,
Uncle Jack.

692
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:11,417
- What about poor Billy?

693
00:54:38,899 --> 00:54:40,157
Come in!

694
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:47,151
I'll be attending to your
midnight needs from now on.

695
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:56,695
Holy smoke, Jack.
Three bull's-eyes in a row!

696
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:59,481
Always said you were
the best shot in the district.

697
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:01,657
Hey, Max, take a look at this.

698
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,833
<i>The best shot in the district.
- What are you killing now?</i>

699
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:06,357
- Parrots.
- Why?

700
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:09,883
<i>They eat the apples on the apple trees.</i>

701
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:13,016
- I don't see any apples, Jack.
- Well, there will be.

702
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,714
They may as well learn now.

703
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:18,244
God.

704
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:24,048
- How's the patient?
- Well, they wouldn't let me see him.

705
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:28,379
I come all this way, now I'm told
he's having a little lie down after lunch...

706
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:30,904
and is not to be disturbed.

707
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:33,210
Him and his wife.

708
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:37,214
Separate rooms,
if it's any consolation.

709
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:39,216
That so?

710
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:44,047
How did he get her in the first place, Max?

711
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:48,747
Beautiful, vibrant,
young woman like that.

712
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,924
Is she faithful to him, do you think?

713
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:52,926
Unfortunately, yes.

714
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:54,928
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Now then, you coves.

715
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:57,060
You shouldn't go talking
about women like that.

716
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,194
Immorality is no joke.

717
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,892
As I know better than most.

718
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:08,071
- When I think of the success that man's
had with women, I tell you, I'm astounded.

719
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,945
<i>First my sister.
And what a lovely girl she was.</i>

720
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:14,425
What a lovely person.

721
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,601
And now this latest one.

722
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:19,082
<i>The most beautiful of the lot!</i>

723
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,345
How about these birds for beauty, Jack?

724
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:23,957
They'll be more beautiful
when there's less of 'em!

725
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,966
Gout?
- Gout.

726
00:56:33,009 --> 00:56:36,056
But good heavens, man,
I drink port once in a blue moon.

727
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,623
Wine?
<i>Well, yes, wine. Of course.</i>

728
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,800
-<i>I don't consider a meal civilized without it.
- How much do you drink?</i>

729
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:45,804
Well, at dinner we'd open
a bottle of Chablis.

730
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:48,677
And then, it goes without saying,
red wine with the meat.

731
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,984
Two bottles a day?
<i>What?</i>

732
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:54,813
You drink two bottles a day?
<i>Well, yes.</i>

733
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:56,815
Well, it's gout, I'm afraid.

734
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:58,948
If you want that pain in your leg to
get better, you'll have to cut down...

735
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:01,951
to two glasses a day,
in a month's time, maybe three.

736
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:05,650
Uh, Dr. Askey, uh, there's one small
matter I'd like to discuss with you.

737
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:09,306
But, first, be so kind as to close the door.

738
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:12,309
Yes, thank you.

739
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:16,139
Uh, this is a rather delicate matter.

740
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,663
I'm not sure quite how best to put it.

741
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:23,146
- Um...
as you know, I have a young wife,

742
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,322
uh, to whom I owe certain duties.

743
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:27,498
Do you follow me?

744
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:31,502
To whom I have certain marital obligations.

745
00:57:31,546 --> 00:57:34,027
- Ah. Yes.
- Well, lately--

746
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,030
well,
some months now, actually--

747
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:40,163
I've been having difficulty
fulfilling those obligations,

748
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:44,037
and, uh, I was wondering if there
was something you could suggest.

749
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,170
Hmm. Well, physiologically,
I doubt there's much wrong,

750
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,172
for a man of your age that is.
- Hmm.

751
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,349
I'm sure when you cut down on the drinks,
things will... pick up.

752
00:57:52,393 --> 00:57:55,439
Well, I was thinking more along
the lines of some sort of medicine,

753
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:57,485
some sort of a pill?

754
00:57:57,528 --> 00:57:59,661
There's nothing that springs to mind.

755
00:57:59,704 --> 00:58:02,664
Dr. Askey, uh, that side of life,

756
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:05,188
it really is quite important to me.

757
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,539
Uh, you must understand
that at one time I was c--

758
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:12,717
This is really too embarrassing.

759
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,893
Yes, well, I'm afraid it's rather
a case of the Lord giveth...

760
00:58:14,937 --> 00:58:17,374
and the Lord taketh away.

761
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,376
But I'm sure when you
cut down on the drink--

762
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,465
Good God! You're supposed
to be a medical man!

763
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:23,554
<i>There must be something you can suggest!</i>

764
00:58:23,598 --> 00:58:26,383
Well, you could try dried kangaroo dung.

765
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:28,516
Aborigines swear by it.

766
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,854
He's a cranky old goat,
your father, isn't he?

767
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,567
Then it's nothing serious?

768
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,393
The pain in his leg is gout.
He drinks too much.

769
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,919
He's not the only one.

770
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:44,575
Uncle Jack hasn't done
a day's work in weeks.

771
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,231
- Well, 20 miles here, 20 miles back.
Another day gone.

772
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,625
- I must be off.
- You said you were staying to dinner.

773
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:53,584
- Too much to do.
- Hannah has cooked a fowl especially--

774
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:57,327
<i>Max, I'm so sorry.
Have I delayed you?</i>

775
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,330
No, not really.
<i>Only it's this heat.</i>

776
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,593
I simply can't keep going
without a lie down after lunch.

777
00:59:02,637 --> 00:59:05,770
I'd love a lie down after lunch.
<i>So, are you staying to dinner?</i>

778
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:09,252
- No, Dr. Askey has to get back to town.
He's got patients to attend to.

779
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,560
<i>Well, then you can leave first thing
in the morning and be in town by 9:00.</i>

780
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:14,518
You haven't asked about your husband.

781
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:16,607
Alexander?
Oh, he drinks too much.

782
00:59:16,651 --> 00:59:19,610
All his doctors have told him,
but he never listens.

783
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:23,136
Now, are you staying?

784
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,965
All right. I suppose it's
pointless rushing away now.

785
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:30,360
<i>There's a man arrived at the door, Miss Sally.
He says it's important.</i>

786
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,940
- That's nice perfume you've got on.
- It's French.

787
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:50,293
I smell of carbolic.

788
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,469
That's nice too.

789
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:55,951
Dr. Askey, you're required at once!

790
00:59:55,994 --> 00:59:59,769
A man's been seriously
injured at the railway station.

791
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:01,043
Oh, dear.

792
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:05,308
And I want to see more of your silly,
old gum trees and the kangaroo.

793
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:08,898
"Hopping about."

794
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,277
Yes, "hopping about."

795
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:15,666
So when shall we see you again?

796
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,496
Well, as soon as your husband
contracts his next fatal illness, I suppose.

797
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,543
Then in no time at all.

798
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,888
- Didn't you get my message?
- I did indeed, Wal.

799
01:01:03,932 --> 01:01:06,978
But I got more than one patient,
and some of them are actually sick.

800
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:11,940
- Yeah, but Mrs. Voysey says it's real
bad this time. Look, she sent you this note.

801
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,470
Like the smell, Wal?

802
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:25,475
My wife had a soap once smelled like this.

803
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,827
No soap ever smelled like that.
- Can you come?

804
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:33,004
All right, Wal, you win.

805
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:36,486
- Two more patients first though. I'll
meet you outside the post office in an hour.

806
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:39,881
- Yeah, well, don't be too long!
We'll miss dinner!

807
01:01:49,804 --> 01:01:53,851
- No, no, no!
- I will not see your Dr. Askey!

808
01:01:53,895 --> 01:01:56,593
The man has the sensibilities of a vet!

809
01:01:56,637 --> 01:02:00,118
Let him minister to the
barnyard animals, not to me!

810
01:02:00,162 --> 01:02:02,599
But you haven't slept a wink.
None of us have.

811
01:02:02,643 --> 01:02:04,949
At least take some
medicine for the pain.

812
01:02:04,993 --> 01:02:07,125
It won't do any good.

813
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:10,433
Oh, very well.

814
01:02:14,176 --> 01:02:18,311
- I'm doing it!
- Here, take two of these it says.

815
01:02:18,354 --> 01:02:21,618
- Oh, not these. The drops, the drops!
- But what are these?

816
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:25,810
- Horse pills. Horse pills from the vet.
Useless.

817
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:37,808
- Here.
- Medicine for the doctor.

818
01:02:37,852 --> 01:02:39,810
Medicinal purposes.

819
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:43,466
You're not the only one
he won't see, old chap.

820
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,165
- Barely spoken a word to me in a fortnight.
- Huh?

821
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:50,168
- Ha!
- Well, that suits me!

822
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,479
Ah, the waste of it, Max.

823
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:01,963
A ravishing, delectable creature like that.

824
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:03,965
Jack.

825
01:03:04,008 --> 01:03:08,491
Dr. Askey, father says he's sorry,
but he'll see you in the morning.

826
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,189
Are you sure he said he's sorry?

827
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:11,787
Hmph!

828
01:03:11,811 --> 01:03:13,496
Would you help me with
these bottles, Doctor?

829
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,021
I get the nose drops and the ear
drops confused, and father gets so angry.

830
01:03:17,065 --> 01:03:21,199
All right.

831
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:25,508
Confounded vet!
Please, Alexander.

832
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,512
<i>Sit down, try to rest and just be quiet.
"Just be quiet"?</i>

833
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:31,862
It's funny, you know.

834
01:03:31,906 --> 01:03:35,518
There used to be a time when people
actually found my conversation amusing.

835
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,696
Now it's, "Be quiet, Alexander."
"Go to sleep, Alexander."

836
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,570
-<i>Even that retched little Violet avoids me.
- No one's avoiding you.</i>

837
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:45,572
To be so completely misunderstood.

838
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:48,836
It's hilarious, really.
<i>Stop it, Alexander! You've worn me out!</i>

839
01:03:48,879 --> 01:03:52,230
Just stop it!
<i>I might as well be in Zululand.</i>

840
01:03:52,274 --> 01:03:55,451
- Worn out?
- I'm the one who's worn out.

841
01:03:55,495 --> 01:03:58,411
<i>Old and ill and worn out.</i>

842
01:03:58,454 --> 01:04:02,719
-- And disgusting to my wife.
- Isn't that so? Don't I disgust you?

843
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,722
Please, please, Alexander.

844
01:04:04,866 --> 01:04:08,525
- When was the last time you
called me "Boo-Boo," eh? When?

845
01:04:08,569 --> 01:04:10,828
<i>When?
Really, father.</i>

846
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:13,552
- Throwing away those pills like that.
- It's a childish thing to do.

847
01:04:14,296 --> 01:04:16,733
- Disgusting.
- You see? "Disgusting."

848
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:20,084
- First my wife, now my daughter.
- Anyone else?

849
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,266
Where's the doctor?

850
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,747
In the kitchen drying off.

851
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:32,749
I have to apologize.

852
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,459
Good evening.

853
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:55,305
What are you laughing at?

854
01:04:57,873 --> 01:05:00,155
I think I'm going out of my mind!

855
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:04,085
What is it?
"What is it?" This household!

856
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:05,630
What's the matter with us all?

857
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:09,082
- It's up to you, you know.
- You, you're half drunk all the time.

858
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:11,962
What's up to me?

859
01:05:12,006 --> 01:05:15,139
To change your life!
To escape!

860
01:05:15,183 --> 01:05:20,493
It's all over for me, but you--
You're young. Men love you.

861
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:23,496
- Oh, don't talk rubbish, Jack.
- I love you.

862
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:25,628
- There, I've said it. You're the
loveliest woman I've ever known.

863
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,239
You're drunk!
Let go of me!

864
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:31,765
The thought of you is the
only thing that keeps me going.

865
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:35,333
God! Is there nowhere
in this house I can go?

866
01:05:35,377 --> 01:05:38,989
Caught with your pants down, eh, Max?
Not the first time, I reckon.

867
01:05:39,033 --> 01:05:41,514
Button up, Wally,
and put some wood on the fire.

868
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:45,996
Ah!

869
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,651
â™ª

870
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:52,046
- You just missed her.
- Who's that?

871
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:56,311
- Well, who do you think? That
"ravishing, delectable creature," of course.

872
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:58,139
That was confidential!

873
01:05:58,182 --> 01:06:00,620
- What's going on?
- That's what I want to know.

874
01:06:00,663 --> 01:06:02,796
Heard any tiptoeing around
the house late at night?

875
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,189
- Have you, Wally?
Any creaking bed springs?

876
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:08,889
<i>That's a bloody offensive remark,
and I'll ask you to take that back!</i>

877
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:12,196
- Oh, no luck yet, eh?
- Well, don't give up, Jack.

878
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,548
- Persistence is what counts with women.
- My oath.

879
01:06:15,591 --> 01:06:18,072
That bloody dentist here
was never out of the house.

880
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:21,205
And it was my house!

881
01:06:21,249 --> 01:06:25,209
Yeah, and it was your wife.
- Too right.

882
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:29,039
Oh, come on, Jack.
Cheer up.

883
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,508
Where's that other bottle
you were talking about?

884
01:06:31,532 --> 01:06:32,565
In the dining room.

885
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:36,046
Well, what are we waiting here for?

886
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,701
Come on, Wally.
Give us a song.

887
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:46,491
â™ª Tavern in the town, in the town â™ª

888
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:50,408
<i>â™ª Where my true love sits her down,
sits her down â™ª</i>

889
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:54,412
â™ª And drinks her wine as merry as can be â™ª

890
01:06:54,456 --> 01:06:58,286
â™ª And never, never thinks of me,
thinks of me â™ª

891
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,984
<i>â™ª Fare-thee-well for I must leave thee â™ª
Uncle Jack!</i>

892
01:07:01,028 --> 01:07:02,986
â™ª Please do not let this party grieve me <i>â™ª
Dr. Askey!</i>

893
01:07:05,946 --> 01:07:08,035
<i>Father is trying to sleep!</i>

894
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:10,777
Now, either go back to
the kitchen or go to bed!

895
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,436
<i>Dr. Askey, can I have a
word with you, please?</i>

896
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,743
Alone, if you don't mind.

897
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:30,875
Look, drink as much as you like,

898
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,277
but please don't encourage Uncle Jack.

899
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:37,107
He gets depressed, and I can't
get him out of bed in the mornings.

900
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:39,457
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

901
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:41,634
Well, I better turn in myself.
- No, no, no.

902
01:07:41,677 --> 01:07:46,464
- Finish your whiskey.
- Here, look, have something to eat.

903
01:07:46,508 --> 01:07:49,729
Hannah's laid out bread
and cheese especially.

904
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:55,125
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

905
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:58,563
You're quite right.
I haven't. I forget.

906
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,697
Jove, I am hungry.

907
01:08:06,702 --> 01:08:10,140
â™ª 
Hmm.

908
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,972
I love midnight feasts.

909
01:08:16,016 --> 01:08:21,499
When I can't sleep, I creep
downstairs and raid Hannah's larder.

910
01:08:21,543 --> 01:08:25,982
â™ª

911
01:08:26,026 --> 01:08:28,506
Why do you drink?

912
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,813
Why?

913
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:35,513
Hmm.
That's a big question.

914
01:08:35,557 --> 01:08:37,515
To improve things, I suppose.

915
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:41,824
Well, for a few hours at least.
- How do you mean?

916
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:45,828
Oh, well, how long have I been
in the district now? Eleven years?

917
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:49,005
I go on talking my head off,
the country's still rotting away.

918
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:52,182
Aborigines still dying off.
- Oh!

919
01:08:52,226 --> 01:08:56,012
And imagine how much worse it
would be if you didn't talk your head off.

920
01:08:56,056 --> 01:08:59,755
"Crank." "Ratbag."
That's what they call me.

921
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:03,454
And maybe that's the truth. Maybe
I go on rocking the boat just to...

922
01:09:03,498 --> 01:09:06,544
just to prove to myself that I'm different.

923
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:09,547
That's not true.

924
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:13,029
Uh, you're sincere.
You really care.

925
01:09:13,073 --> 01:09:15,553
Do I?

926
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:18,731
Sometimes I wonder if I
give a damn about any of it.

927
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:23,344
What you need is someone to look after you.

928
01:09:23,387 --> 01:09:28,392
- Please don't, Dr. Askey.
- Give me one good reason why not.

929
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:30,873
Because you're not that sort of man.

930
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,224
Everyone else drinks and
gambles and fritters away their life,

931
01:09:34,268 --> 01:09:38,272
but you really are different.

932
01:09:44,626 --> 01:09:47,629
Please don't do it, Dr. Askey.

933
01:09:47,672 --> 01:09:51,938
All right, that's it.
It's settled.

934
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:55,245
Find me a Bible.
I will take the pledge.

935
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:59,946
- Do you mean it?
- Cross my heart and hope to die.

936
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:06,169
Dr. Askey,
can I ask you something?

937
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:08,128
<i>Anything.</i>

938
01:10:10,391 --> 01:10:13,350
Suppose I knew of someone--

939
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:15,657
a girlfriend or someone's sister--

940
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:21,532
<i>who, well, I knew
she was very fond of you.</i>

941
01:10:21,576 --> 01:10:25,014
<i>In love with you even.</i>

942
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:27,712
<i>How would you respond?</i>

943
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:31,760
- Matchmaking, are we?
- No. Tell me.

944
01:10:31,804 --> 01:10:34,371
Hannah says I'm losing my looks.

945
01:10:34,415 --> 01:10:38,506
Don't joke.
Tell me.

946
01:10:40,421 --> 01:10:44,555
I'd tell her she could do better.

947
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,213
Well, early to bed, early to rise,

948
01:10:50,257 --> 01:10:52,737
Makes a man healthy,
<i>wealthy...</i>

949
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,696
and wise.

950
01:11:04,358 --> 01:11:07,535
Rain has stopped.

951
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:14,020
At least it's cleared the air.

952
01:11:16,283 --> 01:11:19,764
- Where's the doctor?
- Shh. He's gone to bed.

953
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,897
He has to be away first thing.

954
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:26,902
- So I won't see him then.
- No, not unless you get up when I do.

955
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:30,079
Sally.
<i>What?</i>

956
01:11:30,123 --> 01:11:35,737
- It's so silly being enemies.
- Can't we call it off?

957
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,745
I've wanted to.
I-- I didn't know how.

958
01:11:43,788 --> 01:11:46,008
Well, then let's.

959
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:51,361
Oh!
What a relief!

960
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:54,712
I was wondering if we'd
ever talk to each other again.

961
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:00,283
- What's all this?
- Oh, I made the doctor eat something.

962
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:03,481
Why don't we drink it?
To our friendship.

963
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:04,548
Yes, let's!

964
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:07,116
From the same glass.

965
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,599
- So... friends?
- Friends, Debbie.

966
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:18,127
Isn't it horrible?

967
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:21,478
Why do men drink it?

968
01:12:21,522 --> 01:12:24,960
What is it? What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

969
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:28,311
Oh, Sally.
Oh, oh, there, there.

970
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:31,967
You silly-

971
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:36,015
Now you've got me crying too.

972
01:12:36,058 --> 01:12:39,496
Can I ask you something?

973
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,978
And will you tell me
honestly, as a friend?

974
01:12:43,022 --> 01:12:46,808
- What?
- Are you happy?

975
01:12:46,851 --> 01:12:49,289
â™ª

976
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,987
No.

977
01:12:55,469 --> 01:12:59,386
I didn't think so.

978
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:07,655
Can I ask you something else?

979
01:13:07,698 --> 01:13:10,136
Anything.

980
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:14,009
Don't you ever wish you were
married to someone younger?

981
01:13:14,053 --> 01:13:16,316
Good heavens,
of course I do.

982
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:20,842
And, you know,
I once was.

983
01:13:20,885 --> 01:13:23,018
When?

984
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:25,934
Remember that hat?

985
01:13:25,978 --> 01:13:28,154
The one with the flowers?

986
01:13:28,197 --> 01:13:32,332
I wore that during the
summer I became engaged.

987
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,161
War broke out in August,

988
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:38,207
and by the end of November he was killed.

989
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:42,037
-<i>My husband.</i>
Oh, Debbie, how terrible.

990
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:45,171
Oh, it was worse later on, I think,

991
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:48,522
when all his friends
started getting killed.

992
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:52,395
After the Somme, it was as
if the whole world was dying.

993
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:54,354
<i>I became so...</i>

994
01:13:56,095 --> 01:13:59,098
scared.

995
01:13:59,141 --> 01:14:04,712
- And then I met Alexander, and--
Oh, he was charming then. He really was.

996
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:10,065
And he knew all these
interesting people, and...

997
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:12,850
he was safe.

998
01:14:12,894 --> 01:14:16,376
<i>Yes, that above all, I suppose.</i>

999
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,161
Oh, I wish you'd told me all this before.

1000
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:22,599
We've never really talked, have we?

1001
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:27,430
Then you'd agree with
Dr. Askey about the war?

1002
01:14:27,474 --> 01:14:29,563
Oh, yes!
Of course, I do.

1003
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:33,088
He's a remarkable man.
That sort of vision.

1004
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:38,093
It takes great courage,
great persistence.

1005
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:43,968
Tell me, it's my turn now,
do you like the doctor?

1006
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,754
Yes.

1007
01:14:46,797 --> 01:14:50,888
Yes, I do, very much.

1008
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:53,978
I thought you did.

1009
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,937
Is it that obvious?

1010
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,856
Oh, it's no good.
I can't hide it.

1011
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:05,251
He's just gone to bed,
but I can still hear his voice.

1012
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:08,036
I can still see him.

1013
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:14,738
<i>Am I being silly?</i>

1014
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:17,524
But I'm so happy.

1015
01:15:17,567 --> 01:15:19,961
And I'm so unhappy.

1016
01:15:20,004 --> 01:15:21,963
We make a good pair.

1017
01:15:22,006 --> 01:15:25,619
<i>Here you are, you old rascal.</i>

1018
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:29,449
A lovely cup of cocoa
help you get to sleep.

1019
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:32,626
To sleep?
With that racket going on?

1020
01:15:32,669 --> 01:15:35,150
Dawn and dusk, like an alarm clock.

1021
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:38,980
There, there, now.
You stop your frettin'.

1022
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:42,636
When I was young, Hannah,
I used to lie in bed...

1023
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:46,988
and listen to the magpies
and swear I'd get away.

1024
01:15:47,031 --> 01:15:49,817
Well, I got away.

1025
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,298
Now I'm back!

1026
01:15:52,341 --> 01:15:54,691
How did it happen?

1027
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,003
I think of Ireland sometimes.

1028
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:05,833
But it's God's will we're here.

1029
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:08,314
Don't be too sure, Hannah.

1030
01:16:08,357 --> 01:16:10,968
Don't be too sure.

1031
01:16:13,797 --> 01:16:16,670
Come on.

1032
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,211
What's going on?
I told you!

1033
01:16:36,255 --> 01:16:39,345
Alexander wants us to meet
under the tree house at 12:00.

1034
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:41,608
Why, for God sake?
Ask him!

1035
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:45,351
You can't make lemon barley
water at a moment's notice.

1036
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:48,049
We'll all help, Hannah.
Just do your best.

1037
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:50,225
There, you young scamp.
Never here when you're needed.

1038
01:16:50,269 --> 01:16:52,227
Garden.
What can I do?

1039
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:55,056
Nothing. Sit down and read a book.
Go back to bed.

1040
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:57,667
Oh, all right.
Take this into the garden.

1041
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,068
Wonderful!
Your husband says, "Jump,"

1042
01:17:07,111 --> 01:17:09,331
and the entire household's in turmoil.

1043
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,151
Is this how you're going to
spend the rest of your life?

1044
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:12,973
Running around,
looking for an old man's slippers?

1045
01:17:12,997 --> 01:17:13,949
Oh, shh!

1046
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:16,382
For God sake,
get out now while you can.

1047
01:17:16,425 --> 01:17:18,432
Be cruel if you like,
but don't be mediocre!

1048
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,956
Oh!
Sorry!

1049
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,390
Sorry!

1050
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:28,916
Oh, it's so hot.

1051
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,528
February is going to be worse.

1052
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:39,100
How will we ever
get through the summer?

1053
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:40,241
I thought he'd gone.

1054
01:17:40,265 --> 01:17:43,283
Oh, I let him sleep in.
Then some sick aborigines turned up.

1055
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,459
- Where is he now?
- At the stables.

1056
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,718
Look, I made him sandwiches
for the journey into town.

1057
01:17:48,762 --> 01:17:52,540
I always do. He never notices.
<i>I'm sure he does.</i>

1058
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:56,631
If I was beautiful, he'd notice.
<i>Oh, but you are.</i>

1059
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:59,425
You have beautiful hair.

1060
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:03,864
That's what people always
say when you're plain.

1061
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:06,954
"She has such beautiful hair"...

1062
01:18:06,997 --> 01:18:09,522
or "She has such beautiful eyes."

1063
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:15,441
Oh, Debbie, I love him so much.

1064
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,443
I just want to talk about him all the time,

1065
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:20,315
like now, to anybody who'll listen!

1066
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,839
I'm hopeless.

1067
01:18:22,883 --> 01:18:24,141
I have no pride.

1068
01:18:24,185 --> 01:18:26,622
Even Violet and Hannah
gossip about it.

1069
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:30,926
How long have you felt
this way about the doctor?

1070
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:35,161
Almost six years.

1071
01:18:35,204 --> 01:18:37,111
Oh, but that's ridiculous!

1072
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:40,936
You can't spend
your life just hoping.

1073
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,034
Look, I have an idea.

1074
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:46,167
Why don't I talk to him?

1075
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,301
Don't be embarrassed.

1076
01:18:49,344 --> 01:18:53,870
Nothing direct. Just a hint
or two to see how he feels.

1077
01:18:53,914 --> 01:18:58,135
Hmm?
Yes?

1078
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:09,059
Debbie?
Yes?

1079
01:19:09,103 --> 01:19:11,714
<i>Wouldn't it be better if I didn't know?</i>

1080
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:17,024
The truth is always best.
That's what the doctor says.

1081
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:53,365
Dr. Askey?

1082
01:19:56,803 --> 01:20:00,110
Dr. Askey?
Looking for someone?

1083
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:03,375
Oh! You gave me such a shock.

1084
01:20:03,418 --> 01:20:05,420
What can I do for you?

1085
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:07,640
You just off?

1086
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:11,861
Yes, in a minute.
I'm just, uh, feeding the horse.

1087
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:18,868
Dr. Askey--
I used to be Max.

1088
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:22,481
Max, I was wondering if
we could have a little talk?

1089
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:24,831
Of course.
Fire away.

1090
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:28,400
I-It's a rather private matter.

1091
01:20:28,443 --> 01:20:33,492
Hmm. Well, um...
it would be private in here.

1092
01:20:33,535 --> 01:20:36,146
I couldn't possibly climb over there.

1093
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:38,366
Of course you could.

1094
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:47,419
This is madness.

1095
01:20:47,462 --> 01:20:49,899
<i>Everyone has to take
a risk once in a while.</i>

1096
01:20:49,943 --> 01:20:52,380
So people keep telling me.

1097
01:20:57,298 --> 01:20:59,343
I feel quite frightened.

1098
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,737
Well, nothing to be frightened of here.

1099
01:21:01,781 --> 01:21:04,305
Look.

1100
01:21:11,486 --> 01:21:15,229
Aren't they adorable?

1101
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,540
Sit down.

1102
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:35,292
Oh, dear.
I don't know how to begin.

1103
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:37,773
I'm going to ask you
some questions,

1104
01:21:37,817 --> 01:21:42,778
and when I've asked them, will you
forget I ever brought the subject up?

1105
01:21:42,822 --> 01:21:44,780
Mm-hmm.

1106
01:21:44,824 --> 01:21:47,304
I'll get straight to the point.

1107
01:21:47,348 --> 01:21:51,613
It's about a certain young
woman you know very well.

1108
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,486
- You?
- Don't be silly.

1109
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:57,793
My stepdaughter, Sally.

1110
01:21:57,837 --> 01:22:00,535
Do you like her?

1111
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:02,537
Yes, I do.
She's a marvelous girl.

1112
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:06,236
Do you like her...
as a woman?

1113
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,892
Am I attracted to her? Is that what you mean?
- Yes.

1114
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:14,070
No.
Not in the least?

1115
01:22:14,114 --> 01:22:18,727
No.
Oh, dear.

1116
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:23,253
Have you noticed that
she likes you a great deal?

1117
01:22:23,297 --> 01:22:27,257
I doubt that very much.
Oh, I assure you, she does!

1118
01:22:27,301 --> 01:22:32,262
Oh, heavens. What an
embarrassing conversation.

1119
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:35,439
Just one more thing.

1120
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,442
How can I--
How can I put it?

1121
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:42,925
I think that,
in the circumstances,

1122
01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:47,582
it would be kinder if,
for the time being,

1123
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:49,976
you stopped coming here to visit her.

1124
01:22:50,019 --> 01:22:53,675
To visit <i>her?</i>

1125
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:58,854
Yes. Well, lately, you seem to have
been here almost every other day.

1126
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:01,506
And you know very well why
I come here every other day.

1127
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,880
It's not to visit Sally.

1128
01:23:04,024 --> 01:23:07,998
<i>Do you know what you are?
A fox.</i>

1129
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:10,000
<i>A beautiful, sleek English fox.</i>

1130
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:12,368
And we're the poor, bloody native wildlife.

1131
01:23:12,412 --> 01:23:14,170
What on earth are you talking about?

1132
01:23:14,214 --> 01:23:16,607
<i>Look at my practice;</i>
 gone completely to hell.

1133
01:23:16,651 --> 01:23:18,122
And Jack-- poor, old Jack.

1134
01:23:18,246 --> 01:23:21,712
He wouldn't know if the sheep
were grazing in the dining room.

1135
01:23:21,756 --> 01:23:23,338
<i>You've gobbled us all up.</i>

1136
01:23:23,362 --> 01:23:26,282
You obviously think I'm contemptible.
I'll go.

1137
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:31,626
Oh, no.
I think you're beautiful.

1138
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:35,499
The thought about you
shimmers and glows for me.

1139
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,501
What lovely wrists.

1140
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,103
Oh, please, let me go.

1141
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,932
I will, I will.
I'll do as you say.

1142
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,934
I'll leave today. I'll never come back.

1143
01:23:44,378 --> 01:23:46,637
Oh.
But listen to me. Listen.

1144
01:23:46,881 --> 01:23:52,069
This may be the only time you and I
ever get to spend some time alone together.

1145
01:23:52,613 --> 01:23:57,052
Nobody knows we're here.
No one can find us.

1146
01:23:57,696 --> 01:24:00,916
Never.

1147
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:11,535
Oh, God, your smell.

1148
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:15,731
These little hairs on the back of your neck.

1149
01:24:15,775 --> 01:24:18,647
<i>Max, you mustn't.
Don't be afraid.</i>

1150
01:24:18,891 --> 01:24:23,199
Don't be frightened.
Don't run away.

1151
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:26,028
You'll only regret it later.

1152
01:24:26,072 --> 01:24:27,878
Don't be frightened.
Sit now.

1153
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:30,686
We can't!
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

1154
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,859
We can.
It's so easy.

1155
01:24:35,803 --> 01:24:37,593
It's so easy.

1156
01:24:37,937 --> 01:24:39,343
Yes.

1157
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,257
Mrs. Voysey!

1158
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:54,153
Mrs. Voysey.

1159
01:24:57,978 --> 01:25:03,179
Mrs. Voysey. Miss Sally says Mr. Voysey
says you're wanted under the tree house

1160
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,021
in the garden!

1161
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,511
Deborah.
Shh.

1162
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:21,231
Stay just for a few minutes.
No.

1163
01:25:23,172 --> 01:25:25,610
How could it make any difference?

1164
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,217
No.

1165
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:35,750
It's a hot drink they'll be gettin',
and it's more than they deserve.

1166
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:38,840
Me with a whole lunch still to get ready.
Go on.

1167
01:25:43,802 --> 01:25:47,457
Oh, Mrs. Voysey. Miss Sally said
Mr. Voysey says you're wanted--

1168
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:49,459
Yes, thank you, Vi. I heard you.

1169
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:52,071
Uh, Miss Voysey, you've got
hay on the back of your dress.

1170
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:56,728
Allow me.

1171
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:29,453
I-I-I brought you these for your bedroom.

1172
01:26:31,702 --> 01:26:36,133
<i>Isn't your husband
waiting for us in the garden?</i>

1173
01:26:37,377 --> 01:26:40,772
Under the tree house.

1174
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,607
Is no one punctual in the country?

1175
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:52,958
Dear, oh, dear.
Here they come, father.

1176
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:55,743
Good heavens, at last.
Three cheers.

1177
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,587
It's bad news, isn't it?
I can tell from your face.

1178
01:26:59,611 --> 01:27:00,404
Let's talk later.

1179
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,356
No.
The truth is best, you said.

1180
01:27:07,015 --> 01:27:09,235
He won't be coming here
any more, will he?

1181
01:27:14,153 --> 01:27:17,286
All right, everyone,
find yourselves a seat.

1182
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,562
Make yourselves comfortable.

1183
01:27:21,206 --> 01:27:23,184
Sit down, my dear.

1184
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:27,088
Sally!
Oh, dear, she's not listening.

1185
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:29,090
Sal?

1186
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,605
And Wally.

1187
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,564
Well, now, strictly speaking, this
meeting is meant to be just family.

1188
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:38,917
<i>You're not actually needed,
but since you're here, stay, stay.</i>

1189
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,441
I'm not actually needed, am I?

1190
01:27:41,484 --> 01:27:44,566
My dear Jack, you're the one
person we quite emphatically...

1191
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:47,221
-<i>cannot do without.
- Since when?</i>

1192
01:27:47,664 --> 01:27:51,146
Do as Alexander says.
Sit down, Jack!

1193
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,979
My dear family,
look about you.

1194
01:27:58,623 --> 01:28:00,913
<i>Remember the well-tended lawn?</i>

1195
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:03,680
Remember the famous
Rose Arbor?

1196
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:06,770
Remember the garden in which one
could almost believe one's self to be...

1197
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,738
in some tranquil corner
of Sussex or Kent?

1198
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:12,124
"There is some corner of a foreign field--"

1199
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:15,605
"That is forever England."
Exactly, Maud.

1200
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:17,912
Though no longer, alas,
in this particular case.

1201
01:28:17,956 --> 01:28:20,088
Now, I'm not a practical person.

1202
01:28:20,132 --> 01:28:23,352
My world has been the world
of the theater and the mind!

1203
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:27,617
<i>But even I can see, and no one
regrets it more, that Canterbury...</i>

1204
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:29,793
is not the place it used to be.

1205
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,100
For heaven's sake, Hannah,
couldn't you serve drinks...

1206
01:28:32,144 --> 01:28:34,624
<i>either before or after I've spoken?</i>

1207
01:28:34,668 --> 01:28:38,324
The sooner it's poured,
the sooner it'll cool down.

1208
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:42,458
Merry Christmas.

1209
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:47,289
To resume...
something has occurred to me.

1210
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,118
A little plan, if you like,
which may just be...

1211
01:28:50,162 --> 01:28:52,904
in the very best interests
of the entire family.

1212
01:28:52,947 --> 01:28:56,951
<i>Now, at the moment, this property
gives a return of a miserable...</i>

1213
01:28:56,995 --> 01:28:59,258
<i>two percent of its capital value,</i>

1214
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:04,306
as opposed to the six or even seven
percent that a prudent investment might yield.

1215
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,874
Now, I have been talking--
quite informally, of course--

1216
01:29:06,918 --> 01:29:11,661
<i>to our neighbors and friends,
Legal and Imperial Pastoral Holdings.</i>

1217
01:29:11,705 --> 01:29:15,665
<i>Indeed, I suggested to their Mr. Pettinger
that he pay us a visit later this morning.</i>

1218
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:19,843
<i>And I am the bearer of
some quite remarkable tidings.</i>

1219
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,499
Legal and Imperial are prepared,
should we ever wish to sell,

1220
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:28,504
<i>to offer us a very fair price,
not only for our better grazing land,</i>

1221
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:31,159
but for the whole caboodle,
lock, stock and barrel!

1222
01:29:31,203 --> 01:29:34,989
Ha! Including, would you believe it,
this dilapidated old house.

1223
01:29:35,033 --> 01:29:39,080
<i>Well, just imagine! We would
then be in a position to acquire...</i>

1224
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,518
a pleasant villa in, say,
one of the better parts of Melbourne...

1225
01:29:42,562 --> 01:29:45,521
and be considerably better off.

1226
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:48,437
Hold on, hold on. What was--
what was that again?

1227
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:51,353
With what was left over,
we'd be considerably better off.

1228
01:29:51,397 --> 01:29:55,444
No, no, just before that. What--
what were you saying about Legal and Imperial?

1229
01:29:55,488 --> 01:29:58,360
They'd be prepared to
offer us a very fair price.

1230
01:29:58,404 --> 01:30:02,016
That's it! The whole caboodle!
Lock, stock and barrel!

1231
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,801
Does that include me and my old mother?

1232
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:07,717
Do we go at a knock down
price with the furniture?

1233
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:10,894
For heaven's sake, Jack,
I never suggested any such thing.

1234
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:14,115
For 25 years I've run this property!
Nobody could have worked harder!

1235
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:18,990
And for 25 years you've had my sister's
share out of it, regular as clockwork,

1236
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:21,775
while the rest of us
scraped by on a pittance!

1237
01:30:21,818 --> 01:30:23,603
I don't really see
the point of any of this.

1238
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:26,475
Oh, don't you? 
Well, allow me to explain.

1239
01:30:26,519 --> 01:30:28,521
In my humble opinion,

1240
01:30:28,564 --> 01:30:32,829
you are a shallow, parasitic,
totally self-centered humbug...

1241
01:30:32,873 --> 01:30:35,308
with about as much talent as that cockatoo!

1242
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:38,510
<i>And you've made fools of the lot of us!</i>
Keep quiet, Jack!

1243
01:30:39,053 --> 01:30:43,275
I absolutely insist you hold your tongue.
I will not hold my tongue!

1244
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:47,148
<i>That man is my worst enemy!
That man has robbed me of my life!</i>

1245
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,498
I could have been the one to go to London!

1246
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:52,849
I could have been the one to write
books and sleep with beautiful women!

1247
01:30:52,893 --> 01:30:55,483
Oh, God!
I'm talking balls.

1248
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:58,551
Jack, please!
Alexander knows best.

1249
01:30:58,594 --> 01:31:01,032
Hello, everyone.

1250
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,077
Does he?

1251
01:31:03,121 --> 01:31:06,863
Well, we'll see about that!

1252
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:09,692
<i>We'll see about that!</i>

1253
01:31:15,046 --> 01:31:17,352
The man's mad.
Obviously dotty.

1254
01:31:17,396 --> 01:31:20,486
Ha! I feel sorry for him.
Oh, poor Uncle Jack.

1255
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:36,067
The least we can offer you, my dear
Pettinger, after coming all this way.

1256
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:38,721
<i>We can't just stand out here
in the open indefinitely, Alex.</i>

1257
01:31:38,765 --> 01:31:41,724
For God's sake, go in
and try and calm him down.

1258
01:31:41,768 --> 01:31:43,987
Yes, father, go and speak to him.
Try to see it from his point of view.

1259
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,033
Oh, very well, very well!

1260
01:31:46,077 --> 01:31:48,079
If Mr. Pettinger will excuse me,
very well.

1261
01:31:48,122 --> 01:31:52,039
Have a little drink first.
Is my tie straight?

1262
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,529
Mr. Voysey! Mr. Voysey, you all right?

1263
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:01,831
Damn!

1264
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,877
Oh, my God, Alexander!

1265
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:10,188
Jack! Jack! Don't shoot again!

1266
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:12,712
<i>Don't be such a fool!
Don't, Jack!</i>

1267
01:32:12,755 --> 01:32:14,670
Don't, Jack!

1268
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:25,028
Missed!
Two chances and bloody missed!

1269
01:32:35,909 --> 01:32:39,695
Uncle Jack!
Uncle Jack!

1270
01:32:42,568 --> 01:32:44,874
Where has the silly bugger got to?

1271
01:32:44,918 --> 01:32:48,051
Jack mustn't blame himself.
It was that old rifle of his.

1272
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,358
It needs a good clean.

1273
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:53,709
Well, he's still the
best shot in the district.

1274
01:32:53,753 --> 01:32:57,800
Please, please, Uncle Jack!

1275
01:33:03,066 --> 01:33:05,895
He must be hiding.
Anyone looked under the house?

1276
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:09,899
No, he wouldn't be there.
He's scared of spiders.

1277
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:17,080
All right, Jack. I want it back.

1278
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,387
At once, please.

1279
01:33:19,431 --> 01:33:22,085
I mean it.

1280
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:24,566
What's he got?

1281
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:27,134
Pinched a bottle of morphia out of my bags.

1282
01:33:27,178 --> 01:33:30,398
<i>Now, look, if you're really so keen
on doing away with yourself, old man,</i>

1283
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:32,748
<i>stop taking pot shots at other people...</i>

1284
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:35,534
and go up to the wool shed and
bloody well blow your own brains out,

1285
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,710
but give me back my morphia!

1286
01:33:37,753 --> 01:33:40,060
Come on.
Hand it over.

1287
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,678
Give it back, Uncle Jack.

1288
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,130
<i>We all have to keep going.</i>

1289
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:09,524
That's the stuff.
Now I can be on my way.

1290
01:34:09,568 --> 01:34:11,309
Yes.

1291
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:14,399
My best suit, ruined.
<i>Oh, nonsense, Boo-Boo.</i>

1292
01:34:14,442 --> 01:34:17,750
Violet gave it a thorough sponge.
That's what's ruined it.

1293
01:34:17,793 --> 01:34:21,326
What time's the motorcar
picking us up, did you say?

1294
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,020
<i>In about an hour.</i>

1295
01:34:22,062 --> 01:34:24,104
Oh.
We'll go straight to the station...

1296
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:27,412
<i>and catch the 9:00 sleeper for Sydney.</i>
But my things, all my books.

1297
01:34:27,455 --> 01:34:29,762
They can follow us to Perth later.

1298
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:33,940
My nephew has quite
a large house, I believe.

1299
01:34:33,983 --> 01:34:36,769
Western Australia's most
up-and-coming barrister.

1300
01:34:36,812 --> 01:34:39,424
Everything will be safe
here in the meantime.

1301
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,296
I suppose we'll have
to leave the wine behind.

1302
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,342
Of course.

1303
01:34:44,385 --> 01:34:47,519
It's just the thought that they won't
have the least idea what they're drinking.

1304
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:51,958
And, Boo-Boo, we mustn't leave
without first making it up with Jack.

1305
01:34:52,001 --> 01:34:54,439
It's quite important, isn't it?
Yes, yes, yes.

1306
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:57,920
Of course it is.
I'm not stupid.

1307
01:34:57,964 --> 01:35:01,228
Now, ring for Violet,
and let's start packing.

1308
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:05,063
Perth.

1309
01:35:08,106 --> 01:35:10,803
Ah, that'll be them,
wantin' their packin' done.

1310
01:35:10,846 --> 01:35:15,155
You better go up to them.
Good riddance, if you ask me.

1311
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:20,682
Now we can go back to
proper hours and decent food.

1312
01:35:23,206 --> 01:35:26,340
<i>But, Mr. Wells, are you sure
that's the best thing to do?</i>

1313
01:35:26,384 --> 01:35:28,473
Safe as houses, Mrs. Dickens.

1314
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:30,997
It will prove to Jack
we still have faith in him.

1315
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,174
He loves that old rifle.

1316
01:35:32,198 --> 01:35:34,479
You're quite sure you've hidden all the bullets?

1317
01:35:34,522 --> 01:35:38,396
<i>All right, everybody, clear off.
Sally and I have got work to do.</i>

1318
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:40,746
Right back where she was, Jack.

1319
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:43,836
<i>Ready for action.
Hmm.</i>

1320
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:47,187
Uncle Jack wants to catch
up on all the back paperwork.

1321
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:52,018
The motorcar has arrived.

1322
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:56,327
We're just leaving.

1323
01:36:01,157 --> 01:36:03,812
Let's go together, Uncle Jack,
and say good-bye.

1324
01:36:03,856 --> 01:36:07,033
We mustn't part on bad terms.

1325
01:36:08,904 --> 01:36:12,691
Come on.
Come and be friends.

1326
01:36:24,093 --> 01:36:27,706
We're just leaving.
Good-bye.

1327
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:30,535
This is rather sudden.

1328
01:36:30,578 --> 01:36:33,886
Are you really that scared?

1329
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:36,715
Yes, I am.
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

1330
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:40,414
Don't be. Change your mind and stay.
What's to be afraid of?

1331
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:44,723
See, sooner or later, your
feelings will get the better of you.

1332
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:48,901
So why not here?
At least it's beautiful country.

1333
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:52,078
You won't even notice the
sunsets where you're going.

1334
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:56,082
Sydney, is it?
Perth.

1335
01:36:56,125 --> 01:37:00,652
<i>Three thousand miles away.</i>
Can we just shake hands and part friends?

1336
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,574
You must be scared.
You do respect me a little?

1337
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:21,455
We probably won't meet again,
so I can say it. I do like you.

1338
01:37:21,499 --> 01:37:24,763
I think I've liked you from
the moment that we met,

1339
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:29,942
and...
I wish I wasn't scared.

1340
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:35,426
Oh, probably this way is best.

1341
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,126
Isn't life odd though?

1342
01:37:40,169 --> 01:37:43,129
We've been close and suddenly,
for no very good reason,

1343
01:37:43,172 --> 01:37:45,958
<i>we'll probably never see each other again.</i>

1344
01:37:49,352 --> 01:37:52,617
One final kiss on the cheek here?

1345
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:00,189
Come on in here before Jack shoots us.

1346
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:08,633
First W.C. in the district,
according to Jack.

1347
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:11,685
These tiles were imported from Naples.

1348
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:26,825
Oh!

1349
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:32,352
Oh, dear.

1350
01:38:32,395 --> 01:38:34,485
A souvenir.

1351
01:38:55,156 --> 01:38:57,508
No, no, no, no, Jack.

1352
01:38:57,551 --> 01:39:01,990
What's past is past. Over.
Let's just get on with life.

1353
01:39:02,034 --> 01:39:05,211
Each to his respective labors.
All aboard!

1354
01:39:05,254 --> 01:39:08,040
Good-bye, everyone.
Good-bye, good-bye.

1355
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:11,565
And you'll be getting the usual on the
fifth of every month, the same as always.

1356
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:14,394
My dear, fellow,
let's not even mention it.

1357
01:39:14,437 --> 01:39:16,396
Good-bye, Maud, my dear.

1358
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:19,878
Dear Alexander,
we shall all miss you so much.

1359
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:21,156
And Wally.

1360
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,408
Think of us all sometimes,
out here in the bush.

1361
01:39:24,451 --> 01:39:26,580
Oh, Hannah, Violet.

1362
01:39:26,624 --> 01:39:29,540
Ah, goodness me, yes.

1363
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:33,892
Uh...

1364
01:39:41,464 --> 01:39:44,903
Good-bye.
Perth, is it?

1365
01:39:48,122 --> 01:39:51,109
Sorry if I've been a nuisance or anything.

1366
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:53,912
Jack.

1367
01:39:56,218 --> 01:39:58,264
Good-bye.

1368
01:40:01,484 --> 01:40:03,574
Come along, my dear.

1369
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:06,821
Coming.

1370
01:40:12,234 --> 01:40:13,893
Bye-bye, dear!
Good-bye, sonny!

1371
01:40:14,036 --> 01:40:16,125
<i>Good-bye! Good-bye!
Good-bye, Debbie!</i>

1372
01:40:16,169 --> 01:40:19,172
You're not waving good-bye?
Go to hell!

1373
01:40:19,415 --> 01:40:21,940
Besides,
I've got work to do.

1374
01:40:43,614 --> 01:40:48,488
They've gone.
They've gone.

1375
01:40:50,446 --> 01:40:52,884
I hope they're going to be all right.

1376
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:55,887
What about these accounts, Uncle Jack?

1377
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:59,804
Let's get down to it.
Yes, yes, let's get down to it.

1378
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,328
It's ages since we sat
at this desk together.

1379
01:41:02,371 --> 01:41:05,897
The ink's dried up.
They've gone.

1380
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:10,597
Dinner tonight will be at 7:00 sharp.
You'll be staying, Doctor.

1381
01:41:10,641 --> 01:41:14,079
No, no. I must be off.
It's mutton fricassee.

1382
01:41:14,122 --> 01:41:17,256
A great temptation, Hannah, but, no.
I'm late as it is.

1383
01:41:17,299 --> 01:41:21,390
Oh, well, come out here then.
I've got something for you.

1384
01:41:25,003 --> 01:41:27,048
Well, my friends.

1385
01:41:29,485 --> 01:41:33,359
Be winter there now.
Can you imagine that?

1386
01:41:33,402 --> 01:41:36,318
Log fires and real snow.

1387
01:41:38,494 --> 01:41:40,714
I don't think I'd care for it.

1388
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:48,113
When will we see you again?

1389
01:41:48,156 --> 01:41:53,466
Well, probably not for some time what with
the flu epidemic reaching town and so forth.

1390
01:41:53,509 --> 01:41:57,470
Not for some months.
Thanks for everything.

1391
01:41:57,513 --> 01:41:59,733
I've been practically
living here, haven't I?

1392
01:41:59,777 --> 01:42:03,302
Like Wally.
So--

1393
01:42:03,345 --> 01:42:06,000
You've got your sandwiches.

1394
01:42:06,044 --> 01:42:09,874
Hannah will have packed them.
She never forgets.

1395
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:23,583
Here.

1396
01:42:23,626 --> 01:42:26,064
<i>Don't let them know.</i>

1397
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:29,589
I've topped it up from the
decanter on the sideboard.

1398
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,548
You're a sly one.
Come on, give us a kiss.

1399
01:42:32,592 --> 01:42:36,901
You keep your hanky-panky for others.

1400
01:42:36,944 --> 01:42:41,079
â™ª

1401
01:42:41,122 --> 01:42:44,082
That's it, Wal.
Give us a song.

1402
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:46,606
Uh, can't think just what though.

1403
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:49,609
Something to match that sunset.

1404
01:42:57,784 --> 01:42:59,401
He's gone.

1405
01:42:59,445 --> 01:43:03,754
Eight-- eight nines.
What-what-what are eight nines?

1406
01:43:03,797 --> 01:43:06,104
What?
â™ª

1407
01:43:06,147 --> 01:43:08,149
Oh, yes.
Yes, he's gone.

1408
01:43:21,162 --> 01:43:23,643
This bloody country!

1409
01:43:42,531 --> 01:43:47,667
<i>Alex was right.
Look at this garden.</i>

1410
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:49,843
It's a bloody wasteland.

1411
01:43:50,887 --> 01:43:53,847
We could always plant
another garden, Uncle Jack.

1412
01:43:53,891 --> 01:43:56,850
This Rose Arbor took father
years and years.

1413
01:43:59,853 --> 01:44:02,444
And a lot of good it did him.

1414
01:44:07,277 --> 01:44:09,911
We don't need to have roses.

1415
01:44:09,955 --> 01:44:14,977
What about native flowers?
Look, Kangaroo Paw.

1416
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:19,481
That's a weed.
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1417
01:44:19,525 --> 01:44:22,528
Not when you look at it.

1418
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:24,573
It's beautiful.

1419
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,578
Listen, Uncle Jack.

1420
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:34,921
The magpies!

1421
01:44:37,064 --> 01:44:40,328
Isn't that the most
beautiful sound in the world?
