00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:01,518
You're up next.

00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,503
It's showtime.

00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:32,699
Ladies and gentleman.

5
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:39,283
Feast your eyes on the two ton metal mesh of madness.

6
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:41,594

8
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,625
Watch as they defy gravity
and see typical force of 3Gs.

9
00:02:54,179 --> 00:03:00,399
Watch as they ride their motorcycles
upside down within inches of each other.

10
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:03,594
At speeds which you can hardly comprehend.

11
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,706
Come on everybody give it up for him...

12
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,973

There they go. Come on get them going.

Good work everyone.

17
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,710
Handsome Luke.

18
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,758
There they go revving them up.

19
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,577
Let's here it, come on give him a hand.
Handsome Luke.

20
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:02,720
I gotta go.

21
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Hey.

22
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,269
Do you remember my name?

23
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:23,004
Romina.

24
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,786
I liked to call you Ro.

25
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,650
What are you doing now?
You got plans?

26
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,577
I gotta go home.

27
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,350
Want me to give you a ride?

28
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,644
Thanks.

29
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,762
You don't want to talk or anything?

30
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,640
You know I leave town tomorrow.

31
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,320
After we pack up I'm not going
to be around for another year.

32
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,160
Another year?

33
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,380
Hey you wanna...

34
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,993

35
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,186
I got someone so...

36
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,180
No.

37
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:54,154
I just wanted to see you again.

38
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,377
Thanks.

39
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,418
Ladies and gentleman.

40
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:36,336
Introducing the one, the only, Handsome Luke...

41
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,224
and the Heartthobs.

42
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey.

43
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,022
Is Romina here?

44
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,060
No.

45
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,493
Hold on.

46
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:06,180
She's working.

47
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,620
Okay.

48
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,346
Do you remember me?

49
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,400
Yes I remember you.

50
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,973
Who's that guy?

51
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,750
He's yours.

52
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:31,000
You want to hold him?

53
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,260
Here you go.

54
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,557
His name's Jason.

55
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,846
Hey.

56
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
There you go.

57
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,710
- Thanks.
- Good? Great.

58
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,189
What are you doing here?

59
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,494
Anything you wanna tell me?

60
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,894
Anything you think I might wanna
know before I leave here?

61
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,550
Forever and I never come back?

62
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,564
Let's go outside.

63
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:56,446
Come on.

64
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,994
You weren't gonna tell me?

65
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,132
It was just a fling right?

66
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,966
That means you don't have to tell me?

67
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,850
Just as a common courtesy or...

68
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:33,934
There might even be a law you know.
You gotta fucking tell somebody.

69
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,839
I haven't heard from you for over a year.

70
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,974
You just took off.
Never called me.

71
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,991
I gotta leave in four hours.
I don't know what to do.

72
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,580
You do whatever you need to do.

73
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,007
What are you gonna do?

74
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,373
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

75
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,250
I'm going to school.

76
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,870
I take care of Jason.
I work here.

77
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,800
I have a man.

78
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:15,139
So that's what I'm doing.
That's my life.

79
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,940
You're busy?

80
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,830
Yeah, yeah I'm real busy.

81
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,600
I don't wanna keep you.

82
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
Okay.

83
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,170
Alright.

84
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,725
When does this pay period end Jack?
On Friday?

85
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:58,743
Why?

86
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,806
Cause I gotta get paid.

87
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,740
Just pay me for half the week alright?

88
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,839
I don't give advances out.

89
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:08,090
I'm not asking for a advance Jack.

90
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,890
I'm quitting.

91
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,386
-You can't quit.
-I just did.

92
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:34,725
Wow.

94
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,653
You look like a princess.

95
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,890
What are you still doing here?

96
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,113
I stuck around.

97
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:46,720
This is really not a good time.

98
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,826
-No.
-No.

99
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,853
I was just gonna take him to the park or...

100
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,200
maybe see if I can just sit on the porch.

101
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,140
Say hi to him.

102
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:54,646
We're on the way to church.

103
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,193
You're going to church?

104
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,493
This is Kofi.

105
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,206
-We need to go.
-Yeah.

106
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,960
You should call. You just can't show up, you know.

107
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:07,663
-You ready?
-Yeah.

108
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,510
Hey.

109
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,420
You live here?

110
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,840
Yep. This is my house.

111
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,813
How long you in town?

112
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,410
I'm going to stick around.

113
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,092
What are you looking at?

114
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,340
Are you really gonna do this shit today?

115
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,600
Do what?

116
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,850
By Gods gift through water and the holy spirit

117
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,930
we are reborn to everlasting life.

118
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,770
In his goodness may he continue to
pour out his blessings...

119
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:13,060
upon these sons and daughters of his.

120
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:18,130
May he make them faithful members
of his holy people.

121
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,906
Jason I baptize you in the name of the father...

122
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,710
and of the son and of the holy spirit.

123
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:33,480
This child of yours has been enlighten by Christ.

124
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,023
He is to walk always as a child
of the light.

125
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,953
By the father of our lord Jesus Christ
I free you from sin.

126
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,580
We now anoint you with
the prism of salvation

127
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,730
As Christ was anointed priest, prophet, and king.

128
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,840
So may you always live as a
member of his body

129
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,480
sharing everlasting life.
Amen.

130
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,280
In the name of this child.

131
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,446
In the spirit of a common sonship,

132
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:04,409
let us pray together in the words
our lord has given us.

133
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,160
Our father who art in heaven

134
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:10,658
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come

135
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,320
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

136
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,580
Give us this day, our daily bread, and
forgive us our trespasses

137
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,926
as we forgive those who trespass against us

138
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,166
and lead us not into temptation but
delivery us from evil.

139
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,530
The almighty God, the father, the son,

140
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:35,534
and the holy spirit bless you.
Amen.

141
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,120
Now as we receive our new member

142
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:44,110
into our parish, let us all welcome
him with great joy.

143
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,072
You ride that thing really good.

144
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:26,468
Really good.

145
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,370
You ride good man.

146
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,710
You like a ride into town?

147
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,618
Save you some gas man.

148
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,560
Just passing through?

149
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,606
I'm just settling in.

150
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:02,550
-Where you staying?
-Some fucking motel.

151
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,066
Yeah they're no good around here.
Whole towns gone to shit man.

152
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,693
So you got a job?

153
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,173
No.

154
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,960
You know your way around an engine?

155
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,920
Yeah.

156
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,880
Cause I got a, I got shop.
A repair shop on Marsha Road.

157
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:23,870
Come check it out man.
I could always use a good worker.

158
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:26,266
Alright.

159
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,706
It ain't much. It's...

160
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,150
what it is you know. It's mine.

161
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,699
No one can kick me out of it.

162
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,600
So it's a workshop in there.

163
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,206
This is Tour.

164
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,620
I don't get a whole lot of work here you know.

165
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,930
But if you want you can look for
other jobs or whatever you know

166
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,837
if it's not enough for you.

167
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,033
I do everything.

168
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,753
Everything there is to do to a car
I know how to do.

169
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,740
Anything you don't know,
I can teach you, you know.

170
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,133
And I got a trailer down here.

171
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:06,146
Stay there if you want.

172
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,116
See she's shy.

173
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:19,933
Where is it?
Where's the ball?

174
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:21,930
There's the trailer.

175
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:26,303
Did she get it?
No she ain't gonna get it.

176
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:29,180
-Do you live out here all alone?
-Yeah, I live alone...

177
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:33,836
but sometimes people come stay for
awhile, you know.

178
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,050
That's it.
It's not much, but you know...

179
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,860
its got whatever you need in there.

180
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,626
You must get lonely.

181
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,813
Look Rob I don't want to be ungrateful...

182
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,573
I really appreciate what you're doing
for me and shit...

183
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,570
but I got to make more fucking money.

184
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:25,409
Hey man, if I could pay you more
I would you know you're...

185
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:28,156
good at what you do man.
Really good.

186
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,973
I could fix up that old Mack truck that's sitting
there like your goddamn lawn ornament.

187
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,686
That's good you can go ahead and fix it up
but I don't have the money to pay you.

188
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,091
You know, there are other things that
can be done you know.

189
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,450
Like what?

190
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,026
We could rob a bank.

191
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:51,032
-You're full of shit.
-I'm not full of shit.

192
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,553
I've done it four times myself and
stopped twelve years ago.

193
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,406
It was getting too hot.

194
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:02,534
As long as you don't do it too
many times, your fine.

195
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:06,947
You got a kid?
You want to provide for that kid?

196
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:10,200
You want to maybe edge out your competition?

197
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,745
You got to do that using you're skill set.

198
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,086
And your skill set...

199
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,672
very unique.

200
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:24,590
What do you say?

201
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,644
-Go fuck yourself.
-Okay.

202
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:32,546
Well, good luck supporting your family
on minimum wage.

203
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:39,660
He's my son and I should be around him.

204
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:43,200
I wasn't around my dad and look the
fucking way I turned out.

205
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,570
Look I wanna take care of you.

206
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,509
I want to take care of my son.
That's my job.

207
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,606
Let me do my job.

208
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,486
Okay, how how are you gonna
take care of us?

209
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:58,780
Don't say it like that.

210
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,909
-But how are you gonna take care of me?
-Don't...

211
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,292
Don't talk down to me.

212
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,140
It's a question.
I'm not talking down to you.

213
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:19,290
-It's just a question.
-I'll find... find a way to do it.

214
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,001
You want a house?
I'll get you a house.

215
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:27,294
You wanna get the fuck outta here?
Get outta here.

216
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,046
I got that trailer.

217
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,513
I'll get a truck.
We'll hit the road.

218
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,060
You pick a place you like?
We'll stop.

219
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,153
You don't wanna be there?
Fuck you we're outta there.

220
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:43,370
-What about my mom?
-She can come.

221
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:46,246
-What about Kofi?
-He can stay.

222
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:50,830
He can get his own girl and his own kid.
That's every man's right.

223
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,326
-Sounds like a nice dream.
-Ro.

224
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:42,000
You can umm... use this if you wanna.
But keep in mind that...

225
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:45,830
I did four banks with a note.
In other words you don't need the gun.

226
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,773
I never liked guns man.
They're vulgar.

227
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,686
But you may want to take it.
I don't... whatever you wanna do.

228
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,900
How do we do it?

229
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,520
Okay, first thing is we're gonna go
in there nice and early.

230
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:01,086
Just when the doors open okay?
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers...

231
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,300
Go for the oldest woman you can alright.

232
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,780
Failing that, go to the most meek.

233
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,040
Get her to put the money out on the table.
Why?

234
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:13,040
So that way you can see if there's
a dye pack.

235
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:16,120
You put it in your pocket.
You don't hand anything over to them.

236
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:19,120
You don't show them the gun.
And you go.

237
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,760
Get on your bike.
I'll be about four blocks away.

238
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,580
Ride it into the truck.
Bam we're home, we're done, we're rich.

239
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,960
What happens if you get stopped sitting by
the side of the road with a open cube truck.

240
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,416
What are you gonna say?

241
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,518
-What do you mean what I'm gonna do?
-I'm a officer...

242
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,406
Excuse me sir what are you doing with
a open cube truck?

243
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,580
What are you doing?
Why are you sitting here like this?

244
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:47,386
Oh I'm broken down.
I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs.

245
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,731
Thank you for asking officer.

246
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,340
-That's a nice touch.
-Right.

247
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,746
What are you gonna do if you
get jock itch and you know you...

248
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:58,313
you're riding ninty miles a hour down the street.
You're gonna keep riding right?

249
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,206
Yeah?
I mean we do what we do.

250
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,458
But when we do it together?
Pssshh... Shazam.

251
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,623
I'm just saying.

252
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:12,810
Not since Hall and Oates, has
there been such a team.

253
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,420
Which one do you... oh I know.
So I got to be the dark curly hair guy?

254
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,993
You got to be the good looking one?
I guess that's about right.

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,420
This is going to be good.
You're going to like doing this.

256
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,900
Biggest rush of your life.

257
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:56,590
Everybody who wants to live
put your hands in the fucking air!

258
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,000
Get over here!
Get over here now!

259
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:03,965
Get the fuck over here!
Get on your knees!

260
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,763
Alright, what's your name?

261
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,280
- Max.
- Max is my little fucking dog.

262
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,046
If by get your fucking money and he's going to fetch.

263
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,800
Get it out and put it on the table right now!
Get it out!

264
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,126
Pray!

265
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,900
Pray!

266
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,293
Let me here you fucking pray!

267
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,180
Got that money out boy?

268
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,473
Go fucking fetch.
Fast!

269
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,228
Get it up.
Put it in that bag.

270
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:00,547
They're not turning!

271
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:05,592
How much did you get?

272
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,660
Bag.

273
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,691
Oh baby.
Oh.

274
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,974
Beautiful.
Fucking baby boy!

275
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,473
Are you okay man?
You good?

276
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,486
You did it man!

277
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,940
You did it!

278
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:32,793
Yeah!

279
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,850
Yeah man!
We fucking did it!

280
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,900
We fucking did it!

281
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,746
Tell me about him.

282
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,896
Whats he like eat?

283
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,360
He like, really likes apples.

284
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,986
Though I kind of have
to chew it up for him.

285
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,233
-You chew up his apple?
-Yeah.

286
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:51,620
It sounds gross but it's
not when I'm doing it.

287
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:04,140
Has he ever had ice cream?

288
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,240
Not yet.

289
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,206
You fucking kidding me?

290
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,606
-He's still a baby.
-Bullshit.

291
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,793
What kind of house are you running?

292
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:16,470
No ice cream.

293
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:20,880
Why can't he have that?

294
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:24,666
It's not like he can't have any.
He just hasn't had it.

295
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:26,390
Can I give it to him?

296
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,473
-You want to give him ice cream?
-Yeah.

297
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,490
I want to do something with
him that's his first time.

298
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,306
I want to look at his face
when he tries ice cream.

299
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,130
Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life,
he's going to see my fucking face.

300
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:59,926
- Okay come on.
- Ah he's really funny.

301
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,680
Come on.

302
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,360
Want to hear it on?

303
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:36,640
Okay, surprise.
He cries alot.

304
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,786
Hola senor, you want the bike
in it too?

305
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:42,600
Yeah, just all, you don't say.
Just capture the mood.

306
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,010
-It's a nice bike.
-Bike's part of the family.

307
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,660
You want another one?

308
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:57,060
You sure I should take
it when she's crying?

309
00:32:58,086 --> 00:32:59,120
Okay.

310
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,033
That's a good trick.

311
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,010
Put that fucking money on the counter.

312
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:17,260
Give me the real stuff. Don't give me the
fucking fake stuff. I know what it is.

313
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:23,566
Shit. Come here. Come here.

314
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,066
What is this?

315
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:02,433
-What is this?
-It's presents.

316
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:10,573
-Oh my God. What is that?
-It's a crib.

317
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,446
Easy, easy, easy.

318
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:18,305
Boss, you gotta stay.
You're gonna fall of this bed.

319
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,350
There you go.

320
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,620
Your mom's home.

321
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:43,740
-Hi mama.
-You think she's gonna be mad?

322
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,060
-Hey.
-Hey.

323
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:58,010
What are you doing?

324
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,066
I got him a crib and some toys.

325
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,133
You know this is really nice and all,
but you gotta,you gotta get this outta here.

326
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:10,533
You can't just show up like this.

327
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,233
-Why?
-Cause this is Kofi's fucking house.

328
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:15,333
Just get it out, please.

329
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,030
He can't be sleeping in a bed.

330
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,866
He's going to roll out and bust
his head open. He needs a crib.

331
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,620
What's going on?

332
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:26,298
You okay with this?

333
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,460
I'm talking to you.
You okay with this?

334
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,440
- Kofi, it's his father.
-In our house?

335
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,846
He's gonna roll up in here even
when your not in the house?

336
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,400
-What are you doing here man?
-Shhh.

337
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,920
-I'm making him pr...
-Don't shhh me, your in my house man.

338
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,460
You need to pack all this shit up
and get out the house man.

339
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:45,680
I don't know who you think you are
just coming up in our life and...

340
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,840
changing shit around but this ain't going to work.

341
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,233
-You gotta lower your voice man.
-Excuse me?

342
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,921
-Lower your voice.
-Romina can you, can you step outside please?

343
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:57,120
Pack all this shit up and take it out man.

344
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:01,594
-You're making the baby cry.
-You're making the baby cry.

345
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:06,130
Pick this shit up and get it out of the
house now man. I'm not fucking with you.

346
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,773
Pick up all this shit.
Fuck you man.

347
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,238
Kofi.

348
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:26,840
Kofi... baby.

349
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,313

350
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,200

356
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,340
Call an ambulance.

357
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,790
Okay.

358
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:27,300
It's okay.

359
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,320
It's over.

360
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:07,771
-Is your name Luke Glanton?
-Yes.

361
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,650
Mr. Glanton a complain has been filed...

362
00:38:10,694 --> 00:38:15,063
it alleges assault in the second degree
which is a felony in the state of New York.

363
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,220
When such a complain is filed, you have the right
to an adjournment to obtain a lawyer.

364
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:24,046
Counselor do you wish to waive any
further reading of the arraignment?

365
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:27,730
Would your honor, on behalf of my client,
I enter a not guilty plea.

366
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,733
Given the history that I am aware of this defendant
and as well the allegations...

367
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:36,693
I'm going to set bail in the amount of $2,500.

368
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:39,800
Bail may be posted either in cash
or by bail bondsman.

369
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,733
In the mean time I will issue the temporary
order of protection

370
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,106
requiring this defendant to refrain from
violent, offensive, assaultive, or...

371
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:51,370
harassing conduct, and to remain away from the complainee.

372
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,650
There's your money.
Thanks for bailing me out.

373
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,520

375
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,546

00:39:18,553 --> 00:39:21,846
I'm going to split out the back.
I wanna go down to Rotterdam...

377
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,840
and I want to do that First National.

378
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,820
You know something Luke,
if you ride like lightning...

379
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,980
you're going to crash like thunder.

380
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,100
I'm not going to let you bring us both down.

381
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:42,560
-Fuck that, don't be such a fucking pussy.

383
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,446

391
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,293

You don't love me.
You don't like me.

396
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:48,573
Man I fucking get it.
I'm a piece of shit.

397
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,420
Okay?

398
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm still his father.
I can give him stuff.

399
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,033
I got this for him.
Just give it to him.

400
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,720
Tell him it's from me.

401
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:16,806
You're never going to see him again.

402
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,986
Please give that to him.

403
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:35,766

- Bill Killcullen, D.A.
- Avery Cross, nice to meet you.

521
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,753
-Yeah of course. I know who you are.
-I know your father, you know.

522
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:47,250
-Long time now.
-I apologize.

523
00:53:47,273 --> 00:53:48,873
No, no, no, he's a great guy.

524
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,593
I wouldn't have expected anything
less from his son.

525
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,706
This was ah, above and beyond.

526
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,626
Ah no, I just did what anybody would do.

527
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,740
-Yeah.
-That's right. And better.

528
00:53:56,806 --> 00:53:58,580
-I don't know if I could...
-The whole force is pulling for you man.

529
00:53:58,606 --> 00:54:01,253
Don't you forget that. They're all outside.
Banners and everything.

530
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,970
-What happened to that guy?
-That guys gone. He's dead. It's over.

531
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:07,163
It's the way it happens.

532
00:54:07,364 --> 00:54:09,501
-Right?
-Yeah, but did he leave anybody behind?

533
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:12,147
That's not, it's not for you to
worry about right now.

534
00:54:12,346 --> 00:54:14,240
We got people who are going
to talk to you about that.

535
00:54:14,606 --> 00:54:16,233
There's people talking to his family.

536
00:54:16,313 --> 00:54:19,730
Got rid of another bad guy.
And you're a hero.

537
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:21,660
-Alrighty?
-Yeah.

538
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,260
-Bill wants to ask you a few questions. That alright?
-Just your first impressions, that kind of thing, you know.

539
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:27,126
-I just wa....
-Formalities, you know?

540
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,200
-Yeah, it's pretty simple.
-Sure.

541
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,413
-Yeah.
-Alright I'll leave you to it, get to know each other.

542
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,820
-Alright.
-Alright.

543
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,006
So what happen when you were
just outside the door?

544
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,060
Um, I said "Police uh, drop your weapon."

545
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,250
Um, "Face down on the ground
with your hand spread."

546
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,380
-And uh, nothing.
-Nothing?

547
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,453
Nothing.

548
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,933
-Did you announce yourself again or not?
-No.

549
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,250
No. That's all we need to do is
make ourselves known right?

550
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:59,426
Yeah. But it's sometimes not easy to tell whether
if they've heard you making yourself known.

551
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,793
You know what I mean?

552
00:55:03,393 --> 00:55:05,253
Anway, you were yelling,
is that right?

553
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:08,300
-I was making myself known as we were trained, correct.
-Okay. Alright.

554
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:13,092
Okay.
Then what?

555
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,425
At that point I knew I had to make
entry and I kicked the door down.

556
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:20,040
-Was the door, was the door locked?
-Correct.

557
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,820
And you knew that because?

558
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,826
-What do you mean?
-Did you assume that the door was locked?

559
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,740
-How did I know it was locked?
-Yeah.

560
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:30,113
Is that a trick question?

561
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:32,300
No, no. I'm just wondering why
you didn't turn the thing.

562
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,806
That's how I know it was locked.

563
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,926
Did you tell me that?

564
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,953
-No.
-Okay.

565
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,686
-Alright so you kick it in?
-Right.

566
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,533
Why are why... why did you come down here?

567
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:47,333
-I'm sorry, why did I come down here?
-Yeah, why wasn't it somebody else?

568
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,330
Slow day at the office?

569
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,822
No.

570
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,420
-What happened after that?
-What would you like me to tell you?

571
00:56:00,594 --> 00:56:03,307
-I just need you to tell me what happened?
-You do?

572
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,740
I don't want you to misremember
so tomorrow...

573
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,266
you're trying to match what have
you have thought today.

574
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,173
I only want you to tell me what you saw.
What you remember?

575
00:56:12,846 --> 00:56:15,670
I shot the perpetrator.
He fell out the window.

576
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,340
I know that.
When did he pull his gun?

577
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,599
Did you shoot him first or
did he shoot first?

578
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:30,670
Don't fuck with me. Do the right
thing. Tell me what the fuck happened.

579
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:34,301
It was pretty quick.

580
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,040
Who shot first?

581
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:42,047
His hand comes up. You fire.

582
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,509
His hand comes up.
He fires. You fire.

583
00:56:45,674 --> 00:56:47,718
-Right.
-Like that?

584
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,143
-Yeah.
-Like pop, pop.

585
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:54,040
That sounds like he shot first.

586
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:56,453
Yeah.

587
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,660
It's just a triumphant day for
officer Avery Cross.

588
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:04,130
He left Ellis hospital well enough to go
home and happy to be alive.

589
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,890
With supporters from his Schenectady PD
family cheering him on...

590
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:13,000
His father, State Supreme Court Judge Al Cross
says he's very happy his son is alive today.

591
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,766
It's the life of a cop.
A life my son chose.

592
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,680
Twenty nine year old Cross hasn't
even been on the force for a...

593
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:24,830
full year before he ran head on
into the alleged Moto Bandit.

594
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:29,090
Pursuing Luke Glanton through the streets
of Schenectady after a bank robbery.

595
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,340
Glanton ran into a home.
Then he came face to face with Officer Cross.

596
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:36,340
Glanton fired at Cross,
hitting him in the knee.

597
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,880
Cross fired back. Killing Glanton
and saving the hostages.

598
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:43,710
Glanton was a drifter and at
times a motorcycle stunt rider.

599
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,340
Police say he had a very violent past.

600
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:50,000
The guy had a long track record, you know.
He was a professional criminal.

601
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,420
He moved here last spring and it hasn't been a full
month before he started robbing banks here.

602
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:58,634
He leaves behind an infant son.

603
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,940
Coming up....

604
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:06,879
Was it scary, honey?

605
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,806
It happened so fast.

606
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:11,640
I don't think there was time
to be scared.

607
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:14,879
Scary for me.

608
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:20,799
I just don't understand why you're doing this.
Nobody does.

609
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:25,670
Doing what?
What...what... what am I doing?

610
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:31,158
I was speaking with your father and we...

611
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:36,500
-We both agree.
-Of course...of course... of course he does.

612
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:40,100
-I'm sorry I just saw...
-I'm a cop Jen, I'm a cop.

613
00:58:40,126 --> 00:58:44,090
-I just thought maybe after this maybe you would have
had enough. That's all.
-Hey, there's no more to discuss.

614
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:46,879
I just thought maybe it
would have been enough.

615
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:48,870
That's it.
Okay?

616
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,460
-You...you can't expect me not to think that.
-You guys just don't get it.

617
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,633
-I'm sorry. We're just worried. We're just worried about you. That's all.
-Stop saying that.

618
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:05,340
Stop fucking saying that.

619
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:18,432
Have you been replaying the
incident in your mind?

620
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:20,460
Not really.

621
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,550
Nah, I just try to... I'm trying to uh
put it out of my mind I think.

622
00:59:25,706 --> 00:59:27,026
Does that work?

623
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,673
Yeah.

624
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,426
You think you're ready to go back to duty?

625
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,440
Yes.

626
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,253
Would you want yourself as a partner?

627
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,320
Absolutely.

628
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,040
What have you been thinking
about since the shooting?

629
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,813
Not much um...

630
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:53,570
Have... has... everything's been so crazy
you know.

631
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:57,806
With the rehabilitation and the...

632
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,820
work and everything at home.

633
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:02,613
Everything at home?

634
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:04,066
What's happening at home?

635
01:00:05,626 --> 01:00:07,813
Well, I'm there now.

636
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,933
-It's just much different.
-Who's at home with you?

637
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,866
Well, ah my mother in law ah.

638
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:16,620
My wife and my boy.

639
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:18,560
So there's um...

640
01:00:19,046 --> 01:00:22,030
You know its been hard on my... my wife.
It's a shock.

641
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:27,226
And an um... it doesn't help
that there's a baby around.

642
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,733
But it's okay.
I mean it's okay.

643
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,526
What do you mean that it doesn't
help that there's a baby around?

644
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:38,580
Well I just mean that with everything
that's... that's going on...

645
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,066
We're justing trying to...
to get all this in order.

646
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,973
Before I can take care of that.

647
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:49,066
It... it's been hard it... it... it...

648
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,033
I've just been so busy that its been...

649
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,326
hard to uh...

650
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,366
I've... I've hard time...

651
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:15,465
looking at my son.

652
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,000
-And that's something new since the shooting?
-Mmhm.

653
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,640
You know I... I saw in the police record that
this perp also had a one year old son.

654
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:33,750
His name is Jason.
You been thinking about this?

655
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,133
This you mean...

656
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:47,150
-The fact that he had a boy?
-Yeah.

657
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:49,026
Do you think...

658
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,453
You're having a hard time looking
at your son because...

659
01:01:51,486 --> 01:01:55,780
you're thinking about this other
little boy that won't have his father?

660
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,020
-You expecting somebody?
-No. You?

661
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,133
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:38,453

01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:12,626
-No, come on in. Have some dinner.

01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:18,353

-I'm glad we decided to do this.

682
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,446
Oh good. I'm glad you guys came to visit.

683
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,733
Thanks.

684
01:03:25,966 --> 01:03:27,786
So how's it feel to have the hero home?

685
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,660
Probably can't wait for him to get back to work huh?

686
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:33,933
No. It's... it's great having him home, I just...

687
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,353
Thank God he's okay, you know.

688
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:38,406
God bless that.
I think we should toast on that.

689
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:40,646
-To our hero.
-To hero boy.

690
01:03:40,873 --> 01:03:42,406
-Hero boy.
-Here you go.

691
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:44,810
Glad you're okay.

692
01:03:44,846 --> 01:03:48,720
I've been on the force for twenty two years,
pulled the trigger maybe three, four times.

693
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,960
You're on for six months,
you already got one in the bag.

694
01:03:52,046 --> 01:03:53,460
And he was white.

695
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,960
That's an extra fifty.

696
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,200
-Better him than me right?
-You got that right.
-Absolutely.

697
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,700
You guys have any plans for tonight?

698
01:04:03,746 --> 01:04:06,000
-Um.
-No, we're just um...

699
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:07,913
-This is it.
-Yeah?

700
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,586
This is the big plan.
Having you guys here for dinner.

701
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:17,140
Would you mind if we stole the hero
for a little police work, after this?

702
01:04:19,373 --> 01:04:21,833
-Tonight?
-And we'll have him back by curfew.

703
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:29,580
I don't know honey. You should probably
rest tonight. Maybe tomorrow night.

704
01:04:29,606 --> 01:04:31,890
Yeah... we kind of need him tonight.

705
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,846
-Is there a problem?
-What about your... your leg?

706
01:04:35,473 --> 01:04:38,270
Well, we're not going to be running.
We'll carry him.

707
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,820
What are you gonna do?

708
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:43,773
We just want to introduce him to a bunch of people
who really admire him for what he did.

709
01:04:44,572 --> 01:04:47,592
They just want to congratulate him in person.

710
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,080
Good, it sounds good.

711
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,700
We leave in about twenty minutes.

712
01:04:51,746 --> 01:04:54,933
Not that we want to eat and run
but, we are on duty.

713
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:58,940
No you should go. That's a great idea.
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.

714
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:01,933
-There you have it.
-You're a hero.

715
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,600
I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.

716
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,766
-Me?
-Yeah.

717
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,266
-He is a hero.
-Yeah.

718
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:10,786
-He's a hero around here, that's for sure.
-You don't mind if we take him than, do you?

719
01:05:10,813 --> 01:05:13,280
-Not at all. I think it's a great idea.
-Yeah. Alright.

720
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,466
There you have it.
You're released.

721
01:05:15,853 --> 01:05:18,006
-Release the hounds.
-Yeah.

722
01:05:26,546 --> 01:05:27,453
Hey Avery...

723
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,830
Does she sometimes like to tuck her
balls up at least at night?

724
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,720
Hey, Pete.
Pete.

725
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,080
-What?
-Can you pop the trunk?

726
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:40,473
Sure it's okay with her?

727
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:48,593
-Scott, you know I"m not on active duty right?
-Yeah, we're aware.

728
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,933
It's a little gift I got going for you.

729
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:53,766
Lets go.

730
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,660
Police.

731
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,486
Hi.
Romina Gutierrez please.

732
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:05,706
-That's Romina right there.
-Yeah.

733
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,173
-Hi. Hi I'm Officer Deluca. Romina Gutierrez?
-Yeah.

734
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:14,260
Yeah, we're here to search your house.

735
01:06:14,686 --> 01:06:15,500
What for?

736
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,493
-For evidence.
-Evidence for what?

737
01:06:17,546 --> 01:06:21,080
We're looking for the money that Luke Glanton
may or may have not given to you.

738
01:06:21,113 --> 01:06:23,593
Yeah, we don't have anything thing that that...

739
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:26,426
Ah you can't just walk in here.

740
01:06:26,513 --> 01:06:27,153
Yeah I can.

741
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,686
-No you can't.
-Whys that?

742
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,593
Cause it's my house.

743
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,213
Look...

744
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:36,540
You assume that I have a warrant and I'll
assume that your mother has papers okay?

745
01:06:38,213 --> 01:06:39,620
This won't take long.

746
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:41,586
Come on.

747
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,140
Kofi.

748
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,173
Can we just start upstairs okay?

749
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:46,626
No, no, no, no.
No, no, my baby is upstairs.

750
01:06:46,646 --> 01:06:48,426
-My baby, my baby is upstairs sleeping.
-Baby's upstairs?

751
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,466
-Yeah my baby is upstairs sleeping, so we're not going to start...
-Alright. Well we won't rustle your baby.

752
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,053
No, no, no.
Don't go up there.

753
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,900
-Romina...
-Hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

754
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,920
-He can't go up there.
-Yeah, he can.

755
01:06:56,986 --> 01:07:00,293
You can go up there if you want, but if we
find evidence while you're up there...

756
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,786
-Your under arrest.
-Why?

757
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:05,366
We've done this a lot of times okay.
It'll be quiet.

758
01:07:05,953 --> 01:07:07,833
Go on Scotty.
Be quiet.

759
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,533
-How about a cup of coffee?
-Yes, yes, yes.

760
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,526
That'll be great.

761
01:07:17,273 --> 01:07:19,340
-Go into your living room here?
-Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

762
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,206
Thanks.

763
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:28,990
Sorry for your loss.

764
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,740
Romina, lets go.
Come on.

765
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,053
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?

766
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,700
Hey, this is crazy.

767
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:03,890
-Wait outside.
-I don't want to. We gotta go. This is fucked up.

768
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,953
-Why the fuck are we here?
-Let go of my arm man.

769
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,593
-What the fuck are we doing here?
-Let go of my arm.

770
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:11,260
-Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?
-Shutup.

771
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,613
-About how long did you know Luke?
-A couple of years.

772
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,600
-Did you know he was robbing banks?
-No.

773
01:08:22,653 --> 01:08:24,330
-You didn't know that at all?
-No.

774
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:28,526
Let me just ask you one more time
because this is... this is what we do.

775
01:08:29,293 --> 01:08:32,700
-You have no knowledge to this money?
-No.

776
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,440
-Officer I swear to God.
-It's not here?

777
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:38,390
-No
-It's not outside?

778
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:43,223
If I was gonna hid something
I would hide it closest to my heart.

779
01:08:49,586 --> 01:08:50,680
Scott.

780
01:08:57,193 --> 01:08:58,260
Pick him up.

781
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,786
-Pick up the baby.
-I don't think we should.

782
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:04,970
-I don't want to wake him. I don't wanna pick him up.
-Pick him up, pick him up.

783
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:45,872
I'm good.

784
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:50,000
Put him back.
Lets go.

785
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,613
-What's up?
-Yeah, they're clean.

786
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,353
Alrighty, lets get out of your hair.

787
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:35,013
You got this Scotty, cmon.
Help him out will you.

788
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,620
-Scotty stop, stop.
-Give me a chance to count it.

789
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,026
You... you going to count like that,
we're going to be here till five in the morning.

790
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,833
-How are you gonna count it?
You got a money counter there asshole?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

791
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,726
-Fourteen grand.
-$14,000?

792
01:10:45,853 --> 01:10:50,450
Well it's not going to be a even split because
the lion's share is going to our hero.

793
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:54,110
Consider it unofficial hazard pay.

794
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:58,220
From us to you.

795
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:00,693
Enjoy it.

796
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,620
Cause you're not going to get
it from the department.

797
01:11:04,346 --> 01:11:06,930
Don't spend it all on one place.

798
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:09,593
You fucking earned that.
Don't forget that.

799
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:13,620
Not bad huh?
Not bad for a nights work.

800
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:41,350
We're gathered here to celebrate a
cop who makes other cops proud.

801
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,830
We can all rest a little easier tonight
now that he is on the path to recovery.

802
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:49,356
Ladies and gentleman, Officer Avery Cross.

803
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,613
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Thank you for your support.

804
01:11:58,426 --> 01:12:01,890
When I was in law school,
we used toalways talk about...

805
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,560
Justice.
We had discussions about justice.

806
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:09,460
That's just what they were.

807
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:11,680
Discussions.

808
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,293
I joined the police force because I
wanted to work alonside the...

809
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:19,260
brave men and women who know some
problems can't be solved by talk.

810
01:12:20,123 --> 01:12:23,679
But no one wants to be in the situation
I found myself in a couple of weeks ago.

811
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,570
I certainly wish it had turned out differently.

812
01:12:27,913 --> 01:12:31,850
I'm not going to lie.
Sometimes I haven't wished that...

813
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,560
maybe it wasn't me that was called
upon that house that day.

814
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:38,228
But that's the job.

815
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,693
But I can't think of another line of
work I would rather be in.

816
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,473
Thank you.

817
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,853
How does it feel?

818
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:08,073
I'm not sure it's doing much good.

819
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,560
-How's the spotlight?
-I'm ready for it to end.

820
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:16,080
Don't worry.
It will.

821
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:21,353
You know the police always put on a big
show when something like this happens because...

822
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:24,232
the hero card is the only
one they have to play.

823
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,350
I'm not really thinking about that Dad.
I'm just trying to get back to work.

824
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:31,200
You know if you planned this
it couldn't have turned out any better.

825
01:13:32,193 --> 01:13:35,490
You're not going to make it work for
you in the police department.

826
01:13:35,706 --> 01:13:36,913
I promise you that.

827
01:13:37,406 --> 01:13:39,140
I didn't come here to be lectured Dad.

828
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:43,320
You tricked me.
You said the pool would be good for my knee.

829
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:46,840
-Sorry.
-You know, I'm not as calculated as you are.

830
01:13:47,106 --> 01:13:50,390
My life is not a campaign.
It's much simpler.

831
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:51,453
Yeah.

832
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,630
Though for somebody who's not campaigning,
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.

833
01:13:55,873 --> 01:13:57,890
You certainly have my vote.

834
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:01,766
Plus that knee is a gold mine.

835
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,550
No I mean it.
A limp goes a long way in politics.

836
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,320
Look at Roosevelt.

837
01:14:46,013 --> 01:14:47,673
I got to go see the chief.
I got to go see the chief.

838
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,506
-Where you going brother?
-I don't know. I don't know.

839
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,440
Is it bad news?
Is it gonna be bad news?

840
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,166
Oh Jesus Christ.

841
01:15:02,253 --> 01:15:04,550
Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.

842
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,661
I got a call today from D.A. Killcullen.

843
01:15:15,306 --> 01:15:16,253
Close the door.

844
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:24,960
The state internal investigation into shooting of
Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.

845
01:15:25,713 --> 01:15:27,186
Congratulations officer.

846
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:30,550
You can put it behind you.
Get back to police work.

847
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,986
The question is can you go back
out on patrol anytime soon?

848
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:36,810
And if you could, can you be effective?

849
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,493
I don't think that I can.

850
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:43,053
That's okay. You know what there's a lot
of jobs to be done around here.

851
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,660
That in ways and you know that.

852
01:15:44,693 --> 01:15:47,400
In ways that are much more important
than what happens out on the street.

853
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:51,293
I'm so glad that you said that. Because Chief I've
thought a lot about this and the...

854
01:15:52,546 --> 01:15:57,980
I... I think I can be best utilized as... as lieutenant
in... in charge of special investigations.

855
01:15:58,173 --> 01:16:01,486
There's a lot of restructuring ah within
the division that I've actually formally...

856
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,220
I can't fucking do that.

857
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,493
Well yeah, of course... of course you could.
I mean...

858
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:11,826
Cross come on.
You paid too much for your education to act so stupid.

859
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:14,686
But I think it is the very fact that I do
have a education like this that perhaps...

860
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:17,653
the reason why I thought about
how restructuring the... the unit...

861
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:22,313
-Um, the division can actually benefit you, me, and a couple...
-Cross, I appreciate you ambition. I really do.

862
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,173
Uh and uh I think... you know...you..
I think you are going to be a great cop.

863
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,170
You are a great cop.
You're a hero.

864
01:16:28,206 --> 01:16:31,870
But at this point. Right now.
You gotta get back to real life.

865
01:16:31,893 --> 01:16:34,533
-And in real life you got two choices.
-Which are?

866
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,046
-You can retire on disability.
-I don't want to do that.

867
01:16:38,086 --> 01:16:40,686
Alright, good. I don't want you to do that either.
Or...

868
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:43,960
You can be reassigned at your current rank.

869
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:46,470
That's it.

870
01:16:47,026 --> 01:16:49,010
You gotta work your way up man.

871
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,080
Hey man.
I heard you were down here.

872
01:16:56,406 --> 01:16:57,500
Hey.

873
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,410
What are you doing?

874
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:02,780
What are you doing on plain clothes?

875
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,913
Oh you didn't hear?
I made Vice.

876
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:09,406
-Get the fuck outta here.
-Yeah man, I'm actually paired up with Deluca.

877
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:11,620
Good.
What have you got for me?

878
01:17:11,846 --> 01:17:16,293
Oh yeah. A couple of mutts left this in the back
seat of their car with a leaky substance.

879
01:17:16,326 --> 01:17:17,366
Oh nice.

880
01:17:17,906 --> 01:17:20,820
So when are we going to get together?
Grab a little bite.

881
01:17:20,993 --> 01:17:22,160
I want to talk about some things.

882
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,640
-Sounds great.
-Alright man.

883
01:17:23,946 --> 01:17:25,020
-Page me.
-Okay.

884
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:26,013
Thanks.

885
01:17:27,946 --> 01:17:30,330
What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.

886
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:32,646
The only reason I'm asking you is
because you're my friend.

887
01:17:32,993 --> 01:17:34,293
Well I don't know what I can do to help...

888
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,290
-but yeah. What do you need?
-Alright. Right on.

889
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,773
Deluca and I have been working
on this case right.

890
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:43,693
And uh... I'm going to need you to
keep this to yourself. It's a little private.

891
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:48,513
And uh... I don't want anybody
to know about it, okay?

892
01:17:48,593 --> 01:17:49,673
Okay.

893
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:52,606
Deluca and I have been working
with this fucking hooker.

894
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,126
We gotta fucking head her off
with some coke.

895
01:17:55,806 --> 01:17:58,266
So Deluca and I thought that you know, if...

896
01:17:58,766 --> 01:18:00,986
We need some temporary access
to the evidence room.

897
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,806
We need you to get some shit. We
gotta hit this bitch off. That's what he need.

898
01:18:05,153 --> 01:18:07,846
I really tried to look out for you
with that seven grand.

899
01:18:08,286 --> 01:18:09,833
Now I need you to look out for me.

900
01:18:11,426 --> 01:18:13,920
I'm serious bro.
This is how it works.

901
01:20:04,426 --> 01:20:05,830
Hey.

902
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,160
Hey don't worry.
It's okay.

903
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:13,130
So I didn't mean to startle you.

904
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,640
It's okay.
I just want to give you something.

905
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,306
Alright.
Listen.

906
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:21,493
This is the money we recovered from your house okay.
I want you to have it.

907
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:23,166
I don't know what that is.

908
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,334
You don't have to ever see me again.
Just take the money.

909
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:30,707
I'm not here as a police officer.
I'm here as a regular guy.

910
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,000
Listen, listen, listen.

911
01:20:32,046 --> 01:20:33,726
-Get the fuck away.
-Listen to me. Listen.

912
01:20:33,773 --> 01:20:36,186
You fucked up my son's life.

913
01:20:36,453 --> 01:20:40,420
Therefore you fucked up my life.
Get the fuck away from me.

914
01:20:54,093 --> 01:20:57,340
I should have brought this to you sooner.
I apologize.

915
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,493
This was recovered from...

916
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:00,880
a house during a search.

917
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:05,773
-No, what, what, wait a minute.
-That's just a small fraction of what's going on.

918
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:08,253
Wait a minute, Cross.

919
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,250
Don't say another word.

920
01:21:11,853 --> 01:21:14,000
-What do you mean?
-No, no, no. Don't say another word.

921
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,780
What do you expect me to do with this?

922
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:26,780
-You're joking right?
-This is shit.

923
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,886
Chief.

924
01:21:27,993 --> 01:21:30,006
This ain't my problem.
Alright.

925
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,200
This is your problem.

926
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:36,300
This is our problem of the fucking police department
and I'm bringing it to your attention..

927
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,300
because that's what I should fucking do!

928
01:21:38,346 --> 01:21:39,673
Oh yeah?
-Is that right?

929
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:41,666
-Yeah!
Is that what you should do?

930
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,526
-Rat out other fucking cops?
-Chief...

931
01:21:43,546 --> 01:21:45,460
This is unfucking believable alright.

932
01:21:45,913 --> 01:21:47,546
Get this shit outta here.

933
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:14,300
Fuck.

934
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:34,493
Hey.

935
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,213
Where are you going?

936
01:23:47,753 --> 01:23:48,500
Going home.

937
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,513
You know that thing...

938
01:23:54,713 --> 01:23:57,273
you and Scotty been talking about?

939
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:01,960
Yeah.

940
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:04,720
Sure.

941
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,000
Well you and I have to talk about it.

942
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:10,740
Follow me.

943
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:03,840
Hey!

944
01:26:32,413 --> 01:26:33,553
Hey Pop.

945
01:26:37,346 --> 01:26:38,800
Avery.

946
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,220
There's a way out of this.

947
01:26:49,493 --> 01:26:53,020
You're not going to like it.

948
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,893
You want to hear?

949
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,600
Yeah, I wanna hear it.

950
01:27:04,946 --> 01:27:06,720
We'll start with the precinct.

951
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,053
Anybody there still trust you?

952
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:11,720
Scott.

953
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,806
We'll start with Scott.

954
01:27:23,353 --> 01:27:24,773
Playing shortstop.

955
01:27:25,946 --> 01:27:28,740
Looks good. Looks bigger.
Jesus Christ.

956
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,986
He's ready to dump you.
The whole thing.

957
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,800
Enough with these fucking tests alright.

958
01:27:36,826 --> 01:27:39,100
Either ask me to help you or
just leave me the fuck alone.

959
01:27:42,993 --> 01:27:45,726
I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

960
01:27:45,753 --> 01:27:49,040
It's a... it's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

961
01:27:49,186 --> 01:27:51,540
I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

962
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,533
I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

963
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:57,153
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

964
01:27:57,186 --> 01:27:58,520
"I made a mistake."

965
01:27:58,646 --> 01:28:01,286
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

966
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,506
Nobody's going to question you, okay.

967
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,813
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

968
01:28:09,766 --> 01:28:10,880
No problem.

969
01:28:13,073 --> 01:28:14,933
Alright.
I know I can count on you.

970
01:28:15,686 --> 01:28:16,660
Yeah.

971
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:20,666
Tell Mike I love him.
I gotta go.

972
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,566
I need you to go into the locker.
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

973
01:28:27,673 --> 01:28:30,753
It's a kilo. It's a big brick.
It says Mckillen across it okay?

974
01:28:30,826 --> 01:28:33,320
I need you take break up a chunk.
I need you to put it in a bag.

975
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:35,506
I'm going to come by.
I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

976
01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:36,146
Alright?

977
01:28:36,946 --> 01:28:40,193
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

978
01:28:40,226 --> 01:28:41,640
"I made a mistake."

979
01:28:42,273 --> 01:28:44,800
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer
with a Medal of Honor...

980
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,800
Nobody's going to question you, okay.

981
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,846
You gotta do this for me.
I'm in a jam with these guys.

982
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:53,193
No problem.

983
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,580
Shown this to I.A.?

984
01:29:01,106 --> 01:29:02,353
Of course not.

985
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,740
Handing it to you on a sliver platter.

986
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,573
Got any idea what this means?

987
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:12,500
Are you ready do it?

988
01:29:13,753 --> 01:29:15,560
Are you son?
Are you really ready?

989
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,700
Cause they're going to fucking
tear you in half.

990
01:29:19,913 --> 01:29:22,933
I'm going to need you're assurance
that you're gonna follow through.

991
01:29:24,586 --> 01:29:25,626
Really?

992
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,066
And I'm going to want full immunity when you do.

993
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,166
You can't just walk in here and tell me what the fuck to do.
You understand?

994
01:29:34,213 --> 01:29:36,253
And when you do...

995
01:29:36,433 --> 01:29:39,626
I want to be made assistant district attorney.
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.

996
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,720
-I don't have a spot for you right now.
-Make a spot.

997
01:29:44,853 --> 01:29:45,886
I won't do that.

998
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:49,240
-I can't just snap my fingers and make you assistant D.A.
-You can say no.

999
01:29:49,386 --> 01:29:51,240
You can say no.
I'll walk out this door.

1000
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,720
I walk over to the Gazette.
I'll tell them everything I know.

1001
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,726
-Including this conversation.
-You're not, listen. You're not going anywhere.

1002
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,106
Don't.
Listen.

1003
01:29:57,353 --> 01:29:59,893
Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.

1004
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:05,192
-All three things?
-Alright.

1005
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,073
I'm not going to promise you how
long you're going to stay there.

1006
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:11,833
You're not going to shake my
fucking hand pal.

1007
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,906
I'll make you assistant D.A.

1008
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,900
I'm never going to shake your fucking hand.

1009
01:30:19,006 --> 01:30:21,290
You're too smart for your own good.

1010
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:26,270
Get right in there for a good shot.

1011
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:30,100
Detective, how do you respond to
these allegations?

1012
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,553
Drugs, corruption, and gangs.

1013
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,700
It's not an investigation by the
Schenectady Police Department.

1014
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:42,160
It's an investigation into the
Schenectady Police Department.

1015
01:30:42,633 --> 01:30:45,150
Earlier today, D.A. Killcullen announced...

1016
01:30:45,193 --> 01:30:49,360
that his office, along with the FBI,
will be handing down indictments...

1017
01:30:49,393 --> 01:30:52,460
that would lead to the arrest of
these Schenectady police officers.

1018
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:57,160
The D.A. is making allegations today that the
Vice officers were acting like the gangs...

1019
01:30:57,186 --> 01:30:59,140
that they were suppose to be hunting.

1020
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:05,306
Officer Deluca stole drugs and money,
even guns from inside the evidence room here.

1021
01:31:05,813 --> 01:31:09,526
Officials say that with that stolen evidence,
the cops paid criminals...

1022
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:14,506
to help set up their rivals. Which then
led to those headline robbing arrests.

1023
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,706
The D.A. announced a star witness
in the case today...

1024
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:22,326
Hero cop Avery Cross, who less than
a year ago was shot in the line of duty...

1025
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:26,790
while trying to save two Schenectady residents
from the alledged Moto Bandit.

1026
01:31:26,926 --> 01:31:30,446
-In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton, News Channel 13.
-It's going to be alright.

1027
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:34,230
Thanks Jess. It's the largest case of
fraud this region has seen.

1028
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:28,090
You know when I was a kid, I used to
look at my Dad dressed in judge's...

1029
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:32,400
robes and I used to think that
my father was a superhero.

1030
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,840
And I don't think I was far off.

1031
01:32:36,326 --> 01:32:41,500
He had that quality that judges have
where they have tremendous compassion.

1032
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:44,772
But they are also ferocious
at the same time.

1033
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,006
He wasn't afraid of making enemies.

1034
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:49,540
I think that's probably why
he had so many friends.

1035
01:32:50,786 --> 01:32:53,226
I had the chance right before he
fell into the coma to tell him that...

1036
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:55,673
I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.

1037
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:57,300
And...

1038
01:33:00,073 --> 01:33:03,590
He shook his head no and
I didn't understand why.

1039
01:33:05,233 --> 01:33:09,330
So I leaned in close that he can
whisper and he said to me...

1040
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:12,000
"I'll take the win, not the run."

1041
01:33:15,446 --> 01:33:17,366
That was my dad.
That was Al.

1042
01:33:23,466 --> 01:33:25,630
-Son, you want to come with me?
-Sure.

1043
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,993
-Avery.
-Yeah.

1044
01:33:37,093 --> 01:33:39,540
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure.

1045
01:33:41,173 --> 01:33:42,173
Close the door.

1046
01:33:46,226 --> 01:33:47,546
What's wrong?

1047
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,610
We have to talk about AJ.

1048
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,766
He wants to come and live with you.

1049
01:33:52,906 --> 01:33:54,846
He won't stop asking me about it.

1050
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,780
Really?

1051
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,040
I guess that's uh...

1052
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:04,306
a good idea at some point.

1053
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:05,973
I think he needs you.

1054
01:34:06,006 --> 01:34:10,126
I think if he doesn't come and live with you,
he's going to... completely go off the rails.

1055
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:13,940
It's just that right now, you know,
with the campaign and everything...

1056
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:16,040
It's just not an ideal time.

1057
01:34:16,206 --> 01:34:19,490
I mean, what am I going to do with him?
I don't know what he likes or...

1058
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,833
I just don't think it will be
good for him or anybody.

1059
01:34:23,693 --> 01:34:25,140
I mean, come on.

1060
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:25,633
Okay.

1061
01:34:25,653 --> 01:34:27,630
-You know that.
-Well you can tell him that.

1062
01:34:28,993 --> 01:34:30,886
-Jennifer.
-What am I suppose to tell him?

1063
01:34:30,913 --> 01:34:33,560
I just don't...
Why, why, why are you doing this right now?

1064
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:37,709
You can tell him now.

1065
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,826
Tomorrow we're going to head
to Buffalo in the morning.

1066
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,880
Wednesday outer boroughs in New York City.
Then the Al Smith dinner at night.

1067
01:34:43,913 --> 01:34:44,720
Do we have time to get there?

1068
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,093
We do, absolutely.
We'll get... we'll have our last event,...

1069
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,893
close in Queens. We'll hit the Upper West Side...

1070
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,126
-Then we have to be at the Waldolf.
-How about Youseth that driver we have from Manhattan?

1071
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,306
-We can use Youseth totally.
-What's going on in Queeens?

1072
01:34:53,353 --> 01:34:56,740
In Queens, he's going to do an
event on environmental issues.

1073
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,960
Um... talking about some of the,
protecting the...the Sound...

1074
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,960
and doing some of the environmental stuff...

1075
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:05,580
And Thursday at the Rochester for lunch
you're going to go to a place...

1076
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,420
where you are going to order something
called the Garbage Plate.

1077
01:35:07,453 --> 01:35:09,100
I just want you to be prepared for it.

1078
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:12,620
-Did you see that?
-Yeah, no, I just...

1079
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:15,093
-Then Sunday morning black churches.
-Oh perfect.

1080
01:35:15,113 --> 01:35:16,986
Alright. I think we can get...

1081
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,434
Avery Cross?

1082
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,870
Yeah.
AJ

1083
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:27,786
AJ?

1084
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:29,506
-Yeah.
-Hi AJ.

1085
01:35:29,893 --> 01:35:31,506
So what high school are
you coming from?

1086
01:35:31,546 --> 01:35:32,260
From Troy High School.

1087
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,426
-You're coming from Troy?
-Yeah.

1088
01:35:33,473 --> 01:35:36,286
Okay, so not too far away.
What brings you to Schenectady?

1089
01:35:36,593 --> 01:35:38,246
Um, my dad wanted me here.

1090
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,320
-You're dad wanted you here?
-Yeah, for my senior year he wanted me to move.

1091
01:35:42,386 --> 01:35:44,893
What about you?
Did you want to come here for you're senior year?

1092
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,353
I don't know.
Yeah... eh....

1093
01:35:47,606 --> 01:35:50,393
Nah, I guess not.
Not really.

1094
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,320
-Do you know anybody here at the high school?
-Nah.

1095
01:35:53,386 --> 01:35:55,286
No, don't know anybody?

1096
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:25,200
Just peak over you're shoulder.
Peak over you're fucking shoulder.

1097
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:27,846
There you go.
Hello there, hello.

1098
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,093
Hello.

1099
01:36:33,206 --> 01:36:35,400
You don't like them girls?

1100
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,640
I don't know.
Maybe you're just used to it.

1101
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:41,340
They ain't got girls like that where I come from.
You feel me.

1102
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,373
Where are you from?

1103
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,666
Troy.

1104
01:36:45,773 --> 01:36:46,910
Troy?

1105
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,520
-Yeah. You heard of Troy?
-Yeah, I've heard of Troy.

1106
01:36:49,593 --> 01:36:52,413
-Where's Troy at?
-It's fucking right next door, dude.

1107
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:53,760
Right next door?

1108
01:36:53,846 --> 01:36:56,413
I would have guessed you
were from Long Island.

1109
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,260
Why's that?

1110
01:37:01,513 --> 01:37:04,060
It's where people that talk
like you come from.

1111
01:37:04,253 --> 01:37:05,953
Ah ha ha, see.

1112
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:09,840
I'm bored as a motherfuck around here dude.
I've been here for like fucking three days.

1113
01:37:09,886 --> 01:37:11,593
I'm bored out of my fucking mind.

1114
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,406
Well school can do that to you.

1115
01:37:13,433 --> 01:37:16,126
Well what you dudes do for fun?
Nothing?

1116
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:18,873
This is it? This is what I got?
For a year?

1117
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,500
-No, we got somethings.
-What?

1118
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:25,720
Don't say like a mall.
If you say a fucking mall...

1119
01:37:25,853 --> 01:37:27,306
I swear to God.

1120
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,140
What do you do?

1121
01:37:32,426 --> 01:37:34,140
I get high.

1122
01:37:36,233 --> 01:37:38,160
Well we can do some of
that around here.

1123
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:41,300
I can tell you smoke.
I've seen you from back there.

1124
01:37:41,346 --> 01:37:44,920
You're one of them loner... loner
stoners is what I call them. Right?

1125
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:49,346
You like to get high and like chill in
your room and draw and shit.

1126
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:55,426
Whatcha trying to do with the rest of this day than?
You trying to go to math class?

1127
01:37:57,013 --> 01:37:58,786
You don't want to go get high?

1128
01:38:02,993 --> 01:38:05,233
-Lets go.
-Alright, lets go.

1129
01:38:12,713 --> 01:38:15,400
You know what this reminds me of?
The Goonies.

1130
01:38:15,466 --> 01:38:19,280
You know that movie?
Where like they're all in a cave.

1131
01:38:19,906 --> 01:38:22,700
You want a cigarette, just ask homie.

1132
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,733
I'll take a cigarette.

1133
01:38:25,181 --> 01:38:28,150
I like smoking cigarettes
when I'm high.

1134
01:38:28,313 --> 01:38:30,800
You like smoking when your smoking?

1135
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:37,050
You smoke menthols man?
Like a breath of fresh air.

1136
01:38:37,113 --> 01:38:39,813
Like a breath of fresh air
which you don't care...

1137
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,010
You got the smoke puff glowing everywhere.
I swear.

1138
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,740
Yo, here we go.

1139
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:48,806
I say my spit is my ammo.
My mouth is my gun.

1140
01:38:48,826 --> 01:38:53,173
And I shoot up your whole squadron with
one flip of my tongue and you're done.

1141
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,780
When did you write that?

1142
01:38:54,946 --> 01:38:57,280
Nah I'm not trying to lie.
I wrote that.

1143
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,473
Fucking quiet around here.

1144
01:39:01,892 --> 01:39:05,599
Shit though, when I was a kid, there
was always kid playing here, you know.

1145
01:39:05,626 --> 01:39:07,533
Oh you came here
when you was a kid?

1146
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,213
Yeah man.
I come here with my parents sometimes.

1147
01:39:11,763 --> 01:39:14,932
-Your parents still together?
-Yeah.

1148
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,240
That's cool.

1149
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:20,480
-That they're still together.
-Yeah, it's alright.

1150
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,670
It's not my real dad though.

1151
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,180
Where's your real dad at?

1152
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:32,260
Um... he died actually.
Like in a car accident or something.

1153
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:34,160
Shit.

1154
01:39:37,086 --> 01:39:39,130
Hey this is kinda bud dude.

1155
01:39:40,413 --> 01:39:43,070
But umm, do you know where I
can score some X?

1156
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:50,793
Yeah.

1157
01:39:51,646 --> 01:39:52,973
For tonight?

1158
01:39:53,206 --> 01:39:55,460
Well we just did a downer.
We gotta get up.

1159
01:40:03,293 --> 01:40:06,900
-Remember to come back by yourself alright?
-Yeah man, you got it.

1160
01:40:15,433 --> 01:40:16,500
Lets go.

1161
01:40:20,373 --> 01:40:22,146
-Let me see it.
-What?

1162
01:40:22,233 --> 01:40:25,960
-Let me see the fucking drugs.
-You fucking seriously man?

1163
01:40:26,886 --> 01:40:29,070
Let me see my fucking drugs.

1164
01:40:34,793 --> 01:40:35,840
What the fuck?

1165
01:40:35,873 --> 01:40:39,020
-I gave you five hundo.
-Yeah, that's twenty pills.

1166
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:42,066
Yo that's inflation or something right?

1167
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,486
Oh yo what the fuck son.
Dead ass it's the fucking five-o.

1168
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,726
-Oh fuck!
-Fuck!

1169
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,880
-Police! Let me see your hands!
-Police! Get on the ground!

1170
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:57,633
-Down, on the ground!
-Fuck you alright!

1171
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:01,106
-Get on the ground!
-Interlace your fingers.

1172
01:41:07,426 --> 01:41:10,713
He scored Ecstasy from some Schenectady kid.

1173
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,800
-Who arrested them?
-A couple of beat cops. McCracken and Potter.

1174
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:19,000
-You know these guys?
-Mmhmm. They'll sit on it if I ask them to.

1175
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,493
-Did anybody else see anything in there?
-No, I made sure of that.

1176
01:41:30,453 --> 01:41:34,066
-Didn't you get any sense that the knew this kid or?
-Huh, friends.

1177
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,330
-Just the two of them?
-Yeah.

1178
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:37,579
Okay.

1179
01:41:38,353 --> 01:41:40,100
Whats this other kid's name?

1180
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,720
Jason Kancam.

1181
01:41:42,086 --> 01:41:44,520
-I busted him a few years ago for some shoplifting.
-What's his name?

1182
01:41:45,013 --> 01:41:46,380
Jason Kancam.

1183
01:41:56,513 --> 01:41:59,133
-Gordon, can we kill the mic on three.
-Yeah.

1184
01:42:09,753 --> 01:42:12,846
Dad. I fucked up, I know and....

1185
01:42:12,913 --> 01:42:15,253
And I know you don't have time to deal with this stuff right now.

1186
01:42:15,286 --> 01:42:16,913
Not him.
Okay?

1187
01:42:17,573 --> 01:42:20,820
-What?
-I want you to leave him alone.

1188
01:42:21,686 --> 01:42:23,320
Alright?

1189
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,926
-Okay?
-Why?

1190
01:42:27,226 --> 01:42:30,740
Wipe that fucking smirk off your face!
You hear me!

1191
01:42:31,773 --> 01:42:33,640
I want you to leave that fucking
kid alone, alright?

1192
01:42:33,673 --> 01:42:36,000
Look at me!
Look at me!

1193
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,910
You want to come live with me right?

1194
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:46,150
You think this is easy for me?
During this time? Huh?

1195
01:42:47,306 --> 01:42:52,110
I'm trying to make this work.
I'm doing it... for you.

1196
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,293
You can have anything you want.
But I don't want you to touch that kid.

1197
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:59,653
You leave him alone.
You underfucking stand me?

1198
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,240
-Say yes!
-Yes.

1199
01:43:03,413 --> 01:43:06,460
-Look at me and say yes.
-Yes.

1200
01:43:25,293 --> 01:43:28,613
-Can you state your name for the record?
- Jason Kancam.

1201
01:43:28,913 --> 01:43:31,533
-Jason, how old are you?
-Seventeen.

1202
01:43:31,953 --> 01:43:35,520
-Are your parents here today?
-Yes. Yes.

1203
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,486
Can you come up please?

1204
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,346
-You're Jason's parents?
-Yes.

1205
01:43:45,413 --> 01:43:49,000
Jason, you've been charged with criminal possession
of a controlled substance in the third degree.

1206
01:43:49,293 --> 01:43:51,233
Counselor, do you waive a formal
reading of the charges?

1207
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:54,113
Yes, please your Honor. In regards to my
clients status there has been a discussion...

1208
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,180
with the District Attorney.

1209
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:57,533
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case tentatively resolved today.

1210
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,893
-So i ask if you could put it on for Second Call?
-Second Call.

1211
01:44:00,933 --> 01:44:05,253
This is a C felony, so Jason could do
anywhere between five and fifteen years.

1212
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,713
But I'm getting the impression from the
Prosecutor that they may be willing...

1213
01:44:08,746 --> 01:44:10,866
to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

1214
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:13,233
The offer on his particular case...

1215
01:44:13,293 --> 01:44:16,613
would be time served. Which is the
day he spent in jail. And a fine.

1216
01:44:16,673 --> 01:44:17,560
And that would be it.

1217
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,740
-Can he come home with us today?
-He can.

1218
01:44:19,893 --> 01:44:22,020
Guess it's your lucky day.
Somebody is looking out for you.

1219
01:44:51,713 --> 01:44:54,520
Look, I didn't mean to get you
busted the other night, alright.

1220
01:44:57,986 --> 01:44:59,133
I'm sorry.

1221
01:44:59,953 --> 01:45:02,366
Yeah, that was a pretty shitty fucking night.

1222
01:45:03,533 --> 01:45:05,360
But don't worry about it.

1223
01:45:06,393 --> 01:45:09,340
I was outta there in five fucking minutes still.

1224
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,873
You think I'm going to sit there and
get fucked up the ass all night?

1225
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,820
What happened when you got home?

1226
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:20,246
Huh?

1227
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:23,553
Went upstairs.

1228
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,770
Tried to go to sleep but I was
still tripping like a motherfucker.

1229
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,126
Why?
What happened to you when you got home?

1230
01:45:34,513 --> 01:45:35,833
I'm cool man.

1231
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,653
Ah your moms was all worried and shit?

1232
01:45:39,106 --> 01:45:41,033
Ah man, my moms...

1233
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:45,040
I'm cool man.

1234
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,773
Really?

1235
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:50,286
Cause I saw that guy today.

1236
01:45:52,293 --> 01:45:53,686
What guy?

1237
01:45:54,273 --> 01:45:55,680
Your dad.

1238
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,660
Nice of your fucking dad.

1239
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,433
When did he move in?

1240
01:46:07,086 --> 01:46:09,300
What the fuck are you talking about AJ?

1241
01:46:09,526 --> 01:46:10,320
Huh?

1242
01:46:10,373 --> 01:46:12,750
-I just wanna know. Don't freak out...
-What the fuck is your problem?

1243
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,380
What the fuck is your problem?

1244
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,040
-Chill dude. Chill.
-What's your problem AJ?

1245
01:46:23,373 --> 01:46:24,960
Just fucking around.

1246
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:28,100
Be so serious.

1247
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:34,486
You got a fucking temper B.

1248
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,646
You need to watch that shit.

1249
01:46:36,873 --> 01:46:39,006
It's gonna get you in fucking trouble.

1250
01:46:42,233 --> 01:46:46,930
-How's school Vanessa?
-It's okay. I had trouble with math.

1251
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:50,073
Hey, what's the deal with my dad?

1252
01:46:54,853 --> 01:46:56,186
What?

1253
01:47:00,386 --> 01:47:03,300
What? Did you like really
hate him or something?

1254
01:47:05,853 --> 01:47:07,350
What was his name?

1255
01:47:08,433 --> 01:47:10,093
-God damn it.
-What was his first name?

1256
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:12,000
I'm not doing this.

1257
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,370
How come Mom never talks
to me about my dad?

1258
01:47:23,793 --> 01:47:25,740
I'm your father.

1259
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:29,810
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1260
01:47:35,186 --> 01:47:38,460
It's her business to talk about it.
Not talk about you.

1261
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,780
Grandma used to tell me something.

1262
01:47:42,953 --> 01:47:44,480
Yeah?
What she used to say?

1263
01:47:45,653 --> 01:47:47,293
She said like...

1264
01:47:48,533 --> 01:47:51,360
Just that he was like an outlaw.

1265
01:47:52,273 --> 01:47:53,373
You know.

1266
01:47:53,873 --> 01:47:55,806
Sound cool to you?

1267
01:47:57,593 --> 01:47:58,833
I don't know.

1268
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,940
He's not your father.

1269
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,613
Not really.

1270
01:48:03,846 --> 01:48:05,610
Just some guy with a baby.

1271
01:48:07,393 --> 01:48:08,793
I'm your father.

1272
01:48:12,233 --> 01:48:15,600
Been there since you were born.
I will always love you.

1273
01:48:16,313 --> 01:48:18,253
Can you at least tell me his name?

1274
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:53,140
Hello?

1275
01:50:02,446 --> 01:50:03,400
Yeah?

1276
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:07,513
I'm looking for Robin.

1277
01:50:08,673 --> 01:50:11,266
Yeah I'm Robin.
What can I do for you?

1278
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:16,979
I was hoping to talk with
you about Luke Glanton.

1279
01:50:18,266 --> 01:50:19,773
I'm his son.

1280
01:50:24,426 --> 01:50:26,386
Luke Glanton's son?

1281
01:50:27,013 --> 01:50:27,993
Yeah.

1282
01:50:32,433 --> 01:50:35,730
Well.
Come on back, get a beer.

1283
01:50:36,486 --> 01:50:39,930
Bet he's down here in this box.

1284
01:50:41,066 --> 01:50:43,410
If I remember rightly...

1285
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:44,986
Well...

1286
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,786
Yeah.

1287
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,060
That guys your dad.
That's him there.

1288
01:51:02,106 --> 01:51:05,770
And that's the pig there.
The one that pegged him.

1289
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,273
What happened to him?

1290
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,213
Who?
The cop?

1291
01:51:10,446 --> 01:51:13,813
Ah forget about him man.
Don't, don't start there.

1292
01:51:14,373 --> 01:51:17,420
I'll show you good things.
I'll show you good things.

1293
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:19,126
Come on.

1294
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:25,460
You are standing right where your dad 
used to stand when we used to talk.

1295
01:51:26,786 --> 01:51:29,220
He's a good guy.
Your dad.

1296
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,573
Oh wow.

1297
01:51:31,613 --> 01:51:34,353
Yeah those glasses.
I haven't seen them in a long time.

1298
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:37,033
Them, them. They're his.
Those goofy glasses.

1299
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:38,446
-These were his?
-Yeah.

1300
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,673
You keep those.
He would have wanted you to have them.

1301
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,526
Was he good at anything?

1302
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:47,360
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle
rider I've ever seen in my life.

1303
01:51:47,693 --> 01:51:48,440
Best.

1304
01:51:48,553 --> 01:51:50,100
-Yeah?
-Best.

1305
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:52,920
Never see another one like him.
Best.

1306
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,746
He was like...

1307
01:51:54,813 --> 01:51:57,033
Nothing.
We're here.

1308
01:51:58,013 --> 01:51:59,706
You guys good friends?

1309
01:52:02,606 --> 01:52:04,713
Yeah, I think we were.

1310
01:52:05,666 --> 01:52:07,553
You still got his bike?

1311
01:52:11,693 --> 01:52:14,540
No his bike is gone.

1312
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:17,700
Police took it.

1313
01:52:18,633 --> 01:52:20,460
I think they cut it up.

1314
01:52:21,913 --> 01:52:26,420
They were angry with him. I know that.
They were real mad with him.

1315
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:30,580
I can show you some other things too.
If you want to see more.

1316
01:52:30,633 --> 01:52:31,986
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1317
01:52:37,566 --> 01:52:40,160
-Why don't you put the glasses on?
-Nah.

1318
01:52:40,193 --> 01:52:43,606
For sure, he would have said
they were left there for you.

1319
01:52:44,446 --> 01:52:45,840
No doubt.

1320
01:52:48,486 --> 01:52:50,833
Put em on, if you want.
Go on.

1321
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:54,006
-Yeah?
-Put em on. Come on. I'll tell you.

1322
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,080
Yeah.

1323
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,520
Yeah.

1324
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,740
-Yeah?
-Yeah. You're calling him back.

1325
01:53:19,473 --> 01:53:20,300
You.

1326
01:53:20,653 --> 01:53:21,733
Jason!

1327
01:53:22,453 --> 01:53:24,100
Jaaaasooon.

1328
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,306
Let me talk to you.

1329
01:53:28,826 --> 01:53:32,700
Look man, I want to say I'm sorry
about what happened earlier alright.

1330
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,640
I was a dick.
I won't deny it.

1331
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:37,900
You lost my money.

1332
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:42,060
Alright. Like that's, I think that's
all I need to do to fucking say, alright.

1333
01:53:42,293 --> 01:53:44,600
But I'm willing to fucking squash it, okay.

1334
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,710
If you need to squash it.
I need to squash it.

1335
01:53:48,173 --> 01:53:51,410
I said I'm sorry brother.
I meant that shit.

1336
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,160
Whatcha thinking?

1337
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,500
Okay.

1338
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:57,086
-You dig?
-Okay.

1339
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,680
-We good?
-Alright.

1340
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,360
Dude, dude, yeah listen.

01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,426
-No, but I got stuff I gotta do.

1347
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,906

Alright, sounds like a fucking plan.

1363
01:54:55,283 --> 01:54:56,480
Yo J!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1371
01:57:57,593 --> 01:58:02,100
There it is. Here we go. Here we go.

Who, who is that?

1375
01:59:57,413 --> 02:00:00,333
-Is that AJ's dad?
-I think so.

1376
02:00:13,946 --> 02:00:16,500
Are you feeling alright?

1377
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:27,873

02:00:48,746 --> 02:00:52,440
You got something you need to tell me.

1379
02:00:52,446 --> 02:00:54,546

02:01:52,353 --> 02:01:53,866
Jason...

1387
02:01:53,993 --> 02:01:56,180
Can you hear me baby?

1388
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,080
Vanessa, get your father.

1389
02:02:04,006 --> 02:02:05,340
Baby.

1390
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,493
You're a liar.

1391
02:02:20,533 --> 02:02:22,026
He woke up?

1392
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:25,933

1393
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:30,460
Hey, Jason.

1394
02:02:36,573 --> 02:02:39,140
Why don't you sit down and wait.
I'm going to get the car.

1395
02:02:39,713 --> 02:02:41,046
Okay?

1396
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:36,780
-What the hell happened to you?

You need a gun?

1400
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:45,080
Come on in.

1401
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:44,906
What the fuck?

1402
02:04:47,486 --> 02:04:51,166
-Get on the fucking floor!
-Alright, stop! Fuck!

1403
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:58,170
It's alright.

1404
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,920
-Alright, see you tomorrow.
-Alright.

1405
02:05:51,493 --> 02:05:54,533
-Are you alone?
-What's going on?

1406
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:57,593
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

1407
02:06:00,586 --> 02:06:02,566
We're going to get in your car...

1408
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,540
and you're just going to keep driving.

1409
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:11,066
Don't talk to me, or I'll shoot you
in the back of your head.

1410
02:06:11,753 --> 02:06:12,880
Go.

1411
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:52,900
Turn around.

1412
02:06:57,820 --> 02:06:59,220
Turn around.

1413
02:07:23,366 --> 02:07:25,986
How did you get into my house?

1414
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:32,660
AJ let me in.

1415
02:07:35,486 --> 02:07:36,793
Is he okay?

1416
02:07:43,573 --> 02:07:44,940
Is he?!

1417
02:07:53,913 --> 02:07:55,460
Give me your wallet.

1418
02:07:55,926 --> 02:07:57,140
Where's your wallet?

1419
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:01,433
-It's in my jacket.
-Give me your jacket.

1420
02:08:01,533 --> 02:08:04,490
You want my wallet?
Take the fucking wallet.

1421
02:08:04,646 --> 02:08:07,230
You want my jacket?
Jacket.

1422
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:13,960
Get on your knees.

1423
02:08:14,166 --> 02:08:15,660
What did you do to my son?

1424
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,873
Get on your fucking knees!

1425
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:30,653
Close your eyes.

1426
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:32,720
Close your eyes.

1427
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,446
Please, just tell me my son's alright.

1428
02:08:37,566 --> 02:08:39,650
This isn't about your fucking son.

1429
02:09:10,566 --> 02:09:12,473
I'm sorry Jason.

1430
02:09:15,933 --> 02:09:17,413
I'm sorry.

1431
02:10:54,206 --> 02:10:58,666
It was a tight race for over a
year between Cross and Kellerman...

1432
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:03,760
and then unprecedented events over the last
month will lead to threaten Cross's election bid.

1433
02:11:03,806 --> 02:11:06,560
First allegations of underage drinking at his house...

1434
02:11:06,593 --> 02:11:10,060
and then a violent robbery
from a yet unidentified intruder...

1435
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:13,480
that left his son hospitalized with a concussion.

1436
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:16,900
Remarkably Cross has managed
to right his campaign...

1437
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:21,926
And now as you see, the District Attorney
has just won the election for Attorney General.

1438
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:26,880
We will go live now as Senator Farley
prepares to address the crowds of supporters.

1439
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:32,193
I've had the honor of knowing
Avery Cross since he was a boy.

1440
02:11:39,933 --> 02:11:45,546
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my greatest honor to introduce

1441
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:50,093
the next Attorney General of the state of New York.
Avery Cross.

1442
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:53,473
AJ you gotta go. You gotta go out there.
You gotta go out there.

1443
02:11:53,513 --> 02:11:56,353
There's a flag. Go.
Go where the kid is. Go.

1444
02:12:14,626 --> 02:12:16,180
Thank you.

1445
02:12:16,826 --> 02:12:18,266
Thank you.

1446
02:12:19,953 --> 02:12:21,173
Thank you.

1447
02:12:23,613 --> 02:12:25,020
Thank you.

1448
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:29,840
Thank you.

1449
02:12:31,886 --> 02:12:33,700
Thank you so much.

1450
02:13:03,012 --> 02:13:05,013
Ibu
Ahern Drive 714
Schenectady  NY 12305

1451
02:13:55,626 --> 02:13:56,486
Yeah?

1452
02:13:57,306 --> 02:13:59,366
-Mr. Renfend?
-Yeah.

1453
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:02,273
Hey I ah, I called you.

1454
02:14:02,813 --> 02:14:04,773
Said I was going to be out here today.

1455
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,960
Oh right of course.

1456
02:14:07,586 --> 02:14:08,960
Well you're early.

1457
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:12,646
Yeah, um.
There's only like one bus headed out here.

1458
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,080
So you're not from around here huh?

1459
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:19,313
No, I'm heading out west.

1460
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,546
So you ready?

1461
02:14:21,886 --> 02:14:23,360
-Want to go take a look at it?
-Yeah.

1462
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,460
-Let me just get my coat.
-Alright.

1463
02:14:35,206 --> 02:14:36,966
Runs great.

1464
02:14:37,653 --> 02:14:41,020
It got a lot of miles on it.
But I kept up with the maintenance.

1465
02:14:42,953 --> 02:14:44,360
How much you want for it?

1466
02:14:46,066 --> 02:14:48,000
Well I was thinking I need...

1467
02:14:48,173 --> 02:14:49,346
Five.

1468
02:15:05,306 --> 02:15:07,373
You ever ridden one of these before?

1469
