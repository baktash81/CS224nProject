1
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,733
Hey, Rhonda, please don't go anywhere.
l want to talk to you.

2
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:01,469
Diego, l see you eating the chicken fingers.
l know!

3
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,770
Asshole.

4
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,344
Hey, Bill. Come on, it's lunch. Get moving.
l've got tables that need clearing.

5
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:09,743
Thank you.

6
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:38,405
-Bill.
-Hey.

7
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:42,408
Terry.

8
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:44,780
-Yeah!
-Hey.

9
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:46,580
You work here, huh?

10
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:50,583
No, l'm just...

11
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:56,659
You're just bussing a table
in your free time?

12
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:58,357
What do you want?

13
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,829
Can we talk for a second?

14
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:09,139
-Wow. So, how you been?
-Fantastic.

15
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:10,570
-Cheese stick?
-No.

16
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:15,278
Can l ask you a... Kind of a sensitive...
Are you drinking?

17
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:19,248
-Hey, come on, man. What is this?
-l don't know if you've heard this,

18
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:23,318
but l'm kind of the principal
over at Plainview now, so...

19
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,822
Wow. Congratulations.
That sounds really boring.

20
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:30,025
Okay, before l change my mind,

21
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,460
do you want to coach basketball for us?

22
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,799
Wow. Yeah. That's...

23
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,338
-Yeah.
-l can't believe Buller would leave his team.

24
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,740
He's built such a good program
with those boys.

25
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:48,676
No, no, no.
l want you to coach girls' varsity.

26
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,381
No, hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, we got a great team.

27
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:55,416
You gotta see them, okay?
They're fantastic.

28
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:58,553
My daughter's on the team. Tamra.
She's huge. Big as an ox.

29
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,723
-She has huge hands, like her mom.
-l don't know, Terry. That's...

30
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,891
All right, look, you know how many hoops
l had to jump through

31
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,759
just to be able to offer you this job?

32
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:09,031
All of them.
l had to jump through all of them.

33
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:12,869
l appreciate that, Terry,
but l can't coach girls.

34
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,635
Women hate me, you know that.

35
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:21,478
Yeah. Okay, well,
then just stay here and wash dishes

36
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,216
and eat other people's food,
and, you know, enjoy that.

37
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:29,183
lt's not so bad, you know.
Not a lot of responsibility.

38
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:32,454
You're right. There's no responsibility.

39
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:39,528
-Spreading the love around.
-Can you hold that for two seconds?

40
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:41,162
-l quit.
-What?

41
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,399
-You want to go out with me?
-l'm married.

42
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,066
All right, forget it.

43
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,736
l'm taking Bobby with me.

44
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:53,106
Who's Bobby?

45
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:57,712
Excuse me. Sorry. l'm really sorry.

46
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:02,918
Come on, Bobby, let's go.
We're gonna get you out of here.

47
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:07,354
Have a good meal.

48
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,661
-You hear they finally hired a new coach?
-Yeah?

49
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,899
-Guess who it is.
-Phil Jackson.

50
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,366
-Bill Greaves.
-Who's that?

51
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,270
Remember that guy who used
to coach boys' varsity over in Culver?

52
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,369
No.

53
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,774
Remember? His entire team quit
right in the middle of sectional finals?

54
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,208
So why'd they hire him?

55
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:32,382
-He's probably the only guy they could get.
-We should just quit right now.

56
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:36,151
-Shut up, Mindy. You can't even play.
-You shut up. Neither can you.

57
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,918
l hear he has problems.

58
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:42,926
His team made it to the sectional finals,
okay? He must be good.

59
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:47,129
-Hey.
-You can go now.

60
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:53,601
Lisa, are you kidding?
What is your damage?

61
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,104
Nothing. l just don't see why
they all have to keep moving here.

62
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,772
-You do realize you're black, right?
-Obviously.

63
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,878
Well, our dad says that if we didn't
have illegal's to work the factories,

64
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:04,512
the country's entire infrastructure
would collapse.

65
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,514
-Your dad sounds like a pussy.
-He is.

66
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,416
Hasn't our infrastructure already collapsed?

67
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,717
-Hello.
-Who are you talking to?

68
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:13,587
-Who is she talking to?
-No, l'm just at school.

69
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:15,622
l don't know, some guy she met
at Shoes Etc. Last weekend.

70
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,093
-What guy?
-He has a mustache.

71
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:19,894
Gross! Why does she always go after guys
with facial hair?

72
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,398
-l know, right? It's so disgusting.
-lt's like kissing your dad.

73
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,766
Okay, you just take it to a whole other level.

74
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,269
-That is really unnecessary.
-Shut up.

75
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:40,780
Ladies and gentlemen,

76
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:46,090
welcome to the 1989 Class Triple-A
Indiana State Finals.

77
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:51,027
Starting for the Plainview Chargers,
number 21, Bill Greaves.

78
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:22,790
-ls this girls' varsity?
-Yeah.

79
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:29,665
l'm Bill Greaves. l'm your new coach.
Where's the JV squad?

80
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,298
We don't have a JV squad.

81
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,836
-This is it?
-Yeah.

82
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:42,944
Did Terry put you guys up to this?
This is a joke, right?

83
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,186
What is this, Terry?
That's just six girls, man.

84
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,386
Yeah, yeah.

85
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,223
Those girls, they don't even look
like they're in shape.

86
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:59,528
Well, the girls' program, okay,
it's not as in-depth as the boys' is.

87
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,996
Jesus Christ, what program?

88
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,899
That's just some bored-looking girls
waiting for the tits to come in.

89
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:07,803
Hey, now, come on. You know?
My daughter's on that team.

90
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:11,406
-One of those girls has a broken foot.
-Yeah?

91
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:16,478
Hey. We were just wondering
if you're coming back to practice or not.

92
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,347
No, not today, sweetheart.

93
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,748
Go home, get some rest,
and we'll start tomorrow.

94
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:25,254
Tell everyone to go home
and play with little kitties, okay?

95
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:27,587
-Asshole.
-Hey! Hey, mouth!

96
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:31,594
-See? Girls. They hate me.
-Yeah, it's not just girls.

97
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:46,240
Hi. Sorry we're late.

98
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:48,208
Hey.

99
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,178
Hey, how's it going, kiddo?
How you doing?

100
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,278
-Good.
-Good to see you.

101
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,548
Can we talk for a minute?

102
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:57,318
-Yeah. What do you want?
-l got your message.

103
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,820
-Yeah, thanks for calling me back.
-Don't drunk-dial our daughter.

104
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,455
l'm not drunk-dialing our daughter.

105
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,926
l'm coaching basketball again.
l wanted to tell her that, okay?

106
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,101
-No, we're really happy for you. Yeah.
-Yeah? Why didn't you call me back?

107
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:13,902
-l had a crazy week.
-You don't get 10 minutes to call me back?

108
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:17,940
Look, l gotta go.
Make sure she studies for her algebra test.

109
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:20,842
-That'll be fun.
-She's barely passing.

110
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,342
You could help her if you wanted.

111
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:27,015
-What do l know about algebra?
-More than me.

112
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,585
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetheart. l'll call you.

113
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,684
Don't believe her.

114
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,487
-She doesn't call people back.
-Hey.

115
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:40,362
Beautiful. Beautiful. All right!
You watching this?

116
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:52,606
Shit. Shit.

117
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,881
Hey, get off your phone. Talk to me.
What's new?

118
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,718
-l'm playing ball.
-Basketball?

119
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,855
Yeah. l made varsity.

120
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,596
You made varsity?
Van Hunt's, they got a really good team.

121
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,861
What position?

122
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:20,768
-Shooting guard.
-Shooting guard.

123
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:26,307
-You a starter?
-No.

124
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:31,312
-How's your ball handling coming along?
-lt's fine.

125
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,682
You know, you really limit yourself
when you only drive to the right.

126
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:37,050
We should go over to Woodlawn tomorrow,
see how you're coming along.

127
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:41,325
-l can give you some things to try.
-Yeah, l already have a coach.

128
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:43,923
Doesn't't mean we can't shoot around.

129
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:46,694
Mom really wants me
to study for algebra, so...

130
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:49,830
You know, just 'cause your mom hates me
doesn't mean you have to.

131
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:54,101
She doesn't hate you.
She feels sorry for you.

132
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,037
She feels sorry for me?

133
00:09:57,102 --> 00:10:00,175
She says you're the loneliest man
she's ever met.

134
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah, well, l never felt more lonely
than when l was with her, so...

135
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,055
You know, you really shouldn't say things
like that. It makes me feel weird.

136
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:20,327
-Eat your sandwich.
-Okay.

137
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,104
How many minutes do you get on that?

138
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:09,611
Wow. So, like,
l could take your picture like that?

139
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:14,351
That's great. That's neat-o.
All right, everybody, put your balls away.

140
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,682
Hustle up.

141
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,154
Line up on the baseline.

142
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,458
You guys know what a baseline is?

143
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,797
-Hi.
-Hi.

144
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:38,576
-What's your... What do you do here?
-l don't know.

145
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,377
Why don't you go play in traffic?
Get out of here.

146
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,943
Jerk.

147
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,981
-Wow.
-l hear you think we're losers.

148
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,785
ls that true? Did you say that?

149
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:52,718
Yeah.

150
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:57,927
What's the point?
Why practice if our coach thinks we suck?

151
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,862
l don't know. Prove me wrong.

152
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:05,000
When l blow on this whistle,
l want you to sprint down court

153
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:07,334
towards the other baseline.

154
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,205
Every time you hear the whistle,
l want you to change direction.

155
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,142
You touch a baseline,
you can stop running.

156
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:17,611
Everybody get that?

157
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,144
-What an asshole.
-l bet he has a small penis.

158
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,145
Why would you say that?

159
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:56,183
Because men with small penises
always treat women badly.

160
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,586
-Who told you that?
-My mom.

161
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,651
Oh, God.

162
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:04,626
Oh, my God.
Damon just walked in, you guys.

163
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,427
He looks so cute in his jacket.

164
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:08,628
-Just go talk to him.
-And say what?

165
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:10,296
-''Hello.''
-Are you kidding?

166
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:13,066
-l mean, that's just so obvious.
-This is pathetic.

167
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:15,503
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Oh, my God.

168
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,806
-She's not going over there.
-Yes, she is.

169
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,040
l can't even look.
Is she talking to him or his friend?

170
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,546
-Oh, my God, she's kissing him.
-No, shut up. Okay, l'm not listening to you.

171
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,578
Thank you.

172
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,080
ls she...

173
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:33,254
-He wants to talk to you.
-What? What did you say to him?

174
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,856
Don't be a freak. He's waiting.

175
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:38,960
-Go.
-Go. You have to go.

176
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,062
What did you say to him?

177
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,366
-l just asked if l could borrow his ketchup.
-Oh, no.

178
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,638
-Hey, Damon.
-Hey.

179
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,707
-How's it going?
-lt's all right.

180
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,707
You hungry?

181
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:59,515
-No, no, l'm okay, thanks.
-Do you want to go sit in my car?

182
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:03,484
-Sure.
-All right.

183
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:10,424
-Do you like music?
-Yeah, l love music.

184
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:15,861
This is cool.

185
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,930
-Yeah? You like it?
-Sure.

186
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:21,969
-l could make you a copy if you want.
-Really?

187
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,727
-Hey, what are you doing?
-l'm done.

188
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:51,099
-You're not done. Who says you're done?
-lf she's done, l'm done.

189
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:54,503
Put that away. Keep jumping.
No cell phones.

190
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,870
Keep jumping. Let's go.

191
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:01,242
Let's go.
Come on, buttercup! Keep jumping!

192
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,515
Defense! Slide, slide, slide! Open.
Slide, slide, slide! Open.

193
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:08,347
-Defense!
-Defense!

194
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:11,018
-No, l said, ''Defense!''
-Defense!

195
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,284

00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,191
-Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide!
-Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide!

197
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,126
-Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide!
-Slide! Slide! Slide! Slide!

198
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,961
Check!

199
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:24,464
-Block!
-Block!

200
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,400
All right. That's all you got?

201
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,170
Yeah. Now you're ready to pick up the ball.

202
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,373
Lisa! Ball! Ball, ball, ball!

203
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,478
Over here! Over here!

204
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:42,650
What, are you blind? l'm open!

205
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,015
Yo!

206
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,294
What's going on? Is there a reason
you're not passing it to her?

207
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,763
All right, look,

208
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,199
l don't know what shit you girls have
between each other.

209
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:01,234
l don't give a shit.
l've got enough shit in my own life.

210
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:03,771
l've got a whole universe of shit.

211
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:08,310
l don't need any more of your shit,
so just keep your shirt off the court, okay?

212
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,978
You can't start drawing lines here.

213
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,981
Even if we did, you'd already
be on the wrong side anyways.

214
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:17,151
-What do you mean?
-Listen, l hate to tell you this,

215
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:21,356
but aside from Billie Jean King
and figure skaters,

216
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,824
nobody considers girls real athletes, so...

217
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:27,730
-Who's Billie Jean King?
-She's a golfer. And that's not true.

218
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:32,132
There are lots of people
who like girls' basketball.

219
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,737
Yeah? When's the last time you saw
a girls' basketball game

220
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,173
-playing in a sports bar?
-l can't go to sports bars.

221
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:43,477
Hey, look, if it makes you feel any better,
we're all on the wrong side.

222
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,914
l mean, the game really belongs
to the blacks, so...

223
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:49,015
-The men.
-You're an asshole.

224
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:51,785
Big asshole.

225
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:54,486
What'd you say?

226
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,425
-l said you're an asshole.
-l'm an asshole?

227
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,893
-Yeah.
-Yes.

228
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,665
Hey, let me tell you something.
What you girls know about basketball

229
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:05,631
could fit in a thimble.

230
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:11,841
Now, l can help you with basketball,
and believe me, you girls need help,

231
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,509
but l can't do dick about anything else.

232
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,646
You want to complain
about how unfair that is,

233
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,345
l can just leave right now.

234
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,550
You want to play basketball,
l can teach you how to do that.

235
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:28,322
Why don't you come get me
when you decide what you want to do?

236
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,799
You're not allowed to smoke in here.

237
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay, look.
l'm just gonna be honest with you.

238
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:48,541
-l live with my grandmother.
-Yeah?

239
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:52,114
She watches Jeopardy every night
and goes to bed at 8:OO.

240
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:54,447
-So?
-l need something to do.

241
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:56,983
We all do.

242
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,822
So, you're gonna keep playing
or what? What?

243
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,224
No. Everyone wants to quit.

244
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,600
l can get them to change their minds.

245
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,136
Who says l want them
to change their minds?

246
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,973
-Come on.
-So do it. Change their minds.

247
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,210
Spit it out, sister. What do you want?

248
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,781
You just have to do something for me.

249
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,550
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

250
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:33,722
lt's not my fault, it's the car.
The car is just, like...

251
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,387
Okay, easy on the speed bumps.

252
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,423
-l've got a hangover, okay?
-Sorry. Sorry.

253
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,994
Why hasn't anyone taught you
how to drive?

254
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:42,495
-l don't know.
-Signal. Signal.

255
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:47,302
Well, where are your parents?
Aren't they around at all?

256
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:50,304
They're around somewhere,
just not around me.

257
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:58,281
What about your grandmother? l mean,
why doesn't she teach you how to drive?

258
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,480
Do you think l want to learn how to drive
like an old lady?

259
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:03,350
Yeah, well, you're kind of driving
like an old lady right now.

260
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:05,617
-For God's...
-l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

261
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:08,156
-Okay, l think l need a break.
-Should l stop?

262
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,389
Okay, no... Jesus.

263
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:14,094
-Can l go?
-Yeah.

264
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,166
Why don't you take me to the hospital,
'cause l've got whiplash.

265
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,316
-That is great! That is hot!
-That is great! That is hot!

266
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,752
-Come on, Huskers, make that shot!
-Come on, Huskers, make that shot!

267
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:39,986
-Go, Huskers!
-Go, Huskers!

268
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,190
Bill? Bill Greaves?

269
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,394
Derek Springer. We played
against each other in high school.

270
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,430
l'm sorry. l'm drawing a blank.

271
00:19:50,495 --> 00:19:53,400
l played for Prairie Hill.
l was a grade beneath you.

272
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,770
Okay. You want an autograph
or something?

273
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,971
lt's nice to see you. It's good to see you.

274
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,308
So l hear you're a busboy now.

275
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,113
-What did you say?
-l heard you're a busboy now.

276
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:11,519
Yeah, l heard you were
a girls' basketball coach.

277
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,020
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.

278
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:16,556
All right! Let's play some hoops!

279
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:21,097
H-O-O-P! Hoop!

280
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:26,935
-Plainview Chargers!
-Where's your boyfriend?

281
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,273
-lt's a long drive.
-Yeah. Too long for Damon.

282
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:35,978
All right. All right.
Hey, huddle up. Now, look.

283
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,544
Come on.

284
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,349
That means make a half circle. Let's go.

285
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:45,787
All right. You know, a lot of people say
winning doesn't matter.

286
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,556
l'm not one of those people.
l think it does. l think it matters a lot.

287
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:52,360
in fact, l think it's the only thing in this life
that matters at all

288
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:57,699
and the people who say it doesn't
are just assholes, plain and simple.

289
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,768
The losers in life are always forgotten.

290
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,341
There's absolutely no reason to play unless
you're playing to win. You understand?

291
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:09,911
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Kill!
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Kill!

292
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,815
All right. What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

293
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:16,851
Shouldn't we do something
or say something?

294
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:20,588
-Like what?
-Like something like that?

295
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:23,788
Yeah. Okay.

296
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:30,531
Okay. ''Go, fight, win'' on three.
One, two, three.

297
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,067
-Go, fight, win.
-Go, fight, go, fight!

298
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,468
Let's do it. You guys are great.

299
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:40,240
Bill. You can't say ''A-holes.''

300
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:43,242
-You can't say the A word.
-What do you mean?

301
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,848
-Can't say the A word. Yeah. Yeah.
-Did l say that? A-hole? When?

302
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,513
in the thing. In the huddle.

303
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:50,615
-Hey.
-Hey.

304
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:53,220
-l'm Trish.
-Tamra.

305
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,421
Give me some of that popcorn.

306
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,428
lt's all right.

307
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,103
-Come on!
-l'm open!

308
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,670
-Switch.
-Lisa!

309
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,776
-Tamra, l'm open!
-Go, Tam-Tam!

310
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,344
Tough luck. That's all right.

311
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:30,556
Come on, guys, defense!

312
00:22:36,094 --> 00:22:37,629
Come on, D. Head's up on D.

313
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,762
-Shouldn't you be trying to comfort them?
-What?

314
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,698
Shouldn't you be trying
to make them feel better?

315
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:13,533
l don't think there's anything
that can make you feel better

316
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:16,670
-after a game like that.
-Sure there is.

317
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,647
What is this?

318
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,799
l liked that music.

319
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,502
Yeah, so did they.

320
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:54,107
-You like basketball?
-No.

321
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,810
All right, well,
how'd you like to be my assistant?

322
00:23:58,443 --> 00:23:59,511
No.

323
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:05,587
Okay, listen, l need some help.

324
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,459
l don't know how to deal
with all this girl shit.

325
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:15,627
Fifty bucks a game.

326
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:17,229
Fifty bucks? What?

327
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,932
-There's no budget for that.
-You're getting paid.

328
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:22,735
Okay, l'll give you 10.

329
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,105
Twenty.

330
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,644
-Eleven.
-Eleven?

331
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:34,513
-Eleven.
-Fifteen.

332
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,485
And l get to use the gym to work out
during practices.

333
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,019
You work out?

334
00:24:57,935 --> 00:25:00,940
All right, we lost, and we lost bad.
Now, part of that's my fault.

335
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,008
l never coached girls' basketball before.

336
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:08,350
Aside from my daughter's freshmen games,
l never even watch girls' basketball.

337
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:11,085
l didn't expect the other teams
could be so much better.

338
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:14,255
l just thought everyone would kind of suck.

339
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:17,590
That's obviously not the case.
We're behind.

340
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:21,161
We need to catch up.
We need to catch up fast,

341
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:24,230
or we're not even gonna be able
to lose our games with any dignity.

342
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,132
You have a daughter?

343
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:31,938
From now on, we're gonna run practices
mornings and afternoons.

344
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:33,573
From now on until the end of the season,

345
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:35,875
l don't want you to think about anything
but basketball.

346
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,945
l don't even want you to dream
about anything else.

347
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,380
What about schoolwork?

348
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:43,217
Yeah, all right, schoolwork.
Basketball and schoolwork.

349
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,184
We can't forget about our families.

350
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:48,388
No, no, family's important.
l'm not asking you to take me that literally.

351
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,256
-What about global warming?
-Excuse me?

352
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:54,929
-The planet's dying. It's kind of a big deal.
-Yeah, don't you care?

353
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:57,695
All right, all right.

354
00:25:57,762 --> 00:26:01,102
l don't want you to think about anything
but basketball, schoolwork...

355
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,168
-What did you say?
-Family.

356
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:07,308
Families and global warming.
Okay? Got it?

357
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,276
l guess.

358
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:14,415
l want you to treat these
like they're your babies.

359
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,317
''Treat these like your babies''

360
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:19,651
is a sexist analogy.

361
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:24,123
You should tell us
to treat them like our pets.

362
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:28,663
-You all right there, kid? Yes, darling?
-Can we treat them like puppies?

363
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,529
Like little Chihuahuas?
l want to put them in my purse.

364
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:33,667
-Well, yeah. That sounds great.
-l know.

365
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,169
Do you want a little puppy food, too,
for the balls?

366
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:38,103
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:41,175
Just take them with you
wherever you go, okay?

368
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:44,912
,
Home, out to eat, at the mall

369
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:48,615
-when you're taking a dump.
-But we'll look like idiots.

370
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,382
No, you looked like idiots last night.

371
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:54,989
You start taking this game
a little more seriously and that will change.

372
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,644
-Hey.
-Hey.

373
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:24,084
-What's going on? Where's Molly?
-Molly's at Gracie's birthday party.

374
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,184
-What?
-Yeah.

375
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:27,753
What are you talking about? It's my day.

376
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:31,892
l tried to call you.
You really need to get a cell phone.

377
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,526
No, no, no, no.

378
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:36,964
That's not how this is supposed
to work, okay?

379
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:40,535
-Okay, Bill, just sit down.
-Yeah, let's sit down for a second.

380
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,167
This is my day, Stacey, okay?

381
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,672
l'm not gonna take less time
than l already have, okay?

382
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,906
You want to know why
she feels uncomfortable around me?

383
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,775
lt's because you never pick up the phone
when l call.

384
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,276
-You pit her against me.
-No. Calm down.

385
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:52,377
You're legally obligated

386
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:54,713
-to tell me where she is.
-l would think about that if l were you.

387
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,349
Tell me where she is.

388
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,053
Let's go. We're leaving.
Let's get out of here.

389
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,424
-Dad, what are you doing here?
-Come on. We're leaving. Let's go.

390
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:06,425
-No, l just... No, l just got here.
-Let's go.

391
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,994
What're you hanging out with him for?
He's got bad form. Let's go.

392
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,128
Let go of me!

393
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:12,498
-Get in the car.
-No!

394
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:16,704
Get in the car. Get in the car right now.
Get in the car right now.

395
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:23,878
-Hey. Hey, is everything all right here?
-Everything's fine. l'm her father.

396
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,043
Molly...

397
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,552
Hey, Molly.

398
00:29:01,812 --> 00:29:04,817
Come on, Molly. l'm sorry, okay?

399
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:10,822
Molly?

400
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,061
Okay, l'm gonna open the door.

401
00:29:17,395 --> 00:29:20,099
Molly, l'm opening the door, all right?

402
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,442
-Hey.
-Hey.

403
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:35,417
l need some help. Molly ran... She took off.
She ran down the fire escape

404
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,516
-and l don't know where she is.
-No, she's okay.

405
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,959
God damn it.
l was worried sick about you, young lady.

406
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:48,328
-l was worried sick about you.
-Look, you go home.

407
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:49,393
You don't want to push it.

408
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,595
-She's really emotional...
-Let me talk to her.

409
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:51,662
Don't come in my house.

410
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:52,897
-Hey, hey, hey.
-She doesn't want to talk to you.

411
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:55,067
-Here we go. Mr. Right's here.
-ls everything okay?

412
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:56,401
ls everything okay with you?

413
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,971
-We're fine here.
-Hey, get out of here, will you? Please.

414
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,305
-You're getting out of line.
-Yeah?

415
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:01,573
-You okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

416
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,476
All right. l'm right over here.

417
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:04,576
Look at me.

418
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:06,746
-Come out here. l want to talk to you.
-Billy, look at me.

419
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:09,015
-Let me just talk to her, okay?
-She wants me to call the cops.

420
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,819
She wants me to get a restraining order.

421
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:20,360
-What? What is she talking about?
-Listen. You embarrassed her.

422
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:22,293
Molly, come on. Let me talk to you for a sec.

423
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,263
You should go home.

424
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:28,900
Molly, come...

425
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:44,316
What are you willing to do
to win this game?

426
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,789
-Anything?
-Anything, huh? Gee.

427
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:51,757
Would you follow her? Come here.

428
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,794
Go ahead, now, push me.

429
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,498
-No balance, right?
-No.

430
00:30:58,562 --> 00:30:59,897
l want you to set a wide base.

431
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,602
l want you to keep low on that defense,
you understand?

432
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,301
Get your arm out. Be the boss!

433
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:08,574
This is our house.

434
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:11,843
And you're the home team.

435
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,913
'Cause we got a whole crowd
of people out there

436
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:16,649
waiting to see what's gonna happen.

437
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:20,521
They didn't come in here to see us...
See you guys have fun,

438
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:23,623
or get along as a team,
or any of that other bullshit.

439
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:27,126
They came to see their school kick ass!

440
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,196
That's the only thing
that's gonna make them want to come back,

441
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:33,132
so let's get out there

442
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:37,103
and let's give them what they want,
all right?

443
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:40,805
Whose house is it?

444
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,978
-Our house?
-Whose house?

445
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,044
-Our house.
-Our house.

446
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:48,146
Whose house?

447
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:49,982
-Our house!
-Our house!

448
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:52,918
l can't hear you! Whose house?

449
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,018
-Our house!
-Our house!

450
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:55,520
-Whose house?
-Our house!

451
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,121
-Whose house?
-Our house!

452
00:31:57,188 --> 00:32:00,394
That's right!
Is there anything you'd like to add?

453
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:04,465
Donna? Would you like to say something?

454
00:32:07,765 --> 00:32:10,470
You know, l remember when l was a girl,

455
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:15,408
my father,
he would take me out to shoot hoops,

456
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:18,947
and l wasn't very good at it,
but he always said to me,

457
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:20,812
''Donna, l think you should
stop playing basketball...''

458
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:24,585
Okay, that's enough.
That's good. That's good. That's good.

459
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:27,754
Let's go. Let's get out there.

460
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,520
Let's go!

461
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:33,458
Nice.

462
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:37,897
-Tamra! Tamra! Tamra!
-Chargers!

463
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,200
-l brought this for you.
-What is it?

464
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:45,239
lt's a burrito.
l thought you could document our downfall.

465
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:48,239
Abbie, l'm open.

466
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,377
Get back!

467
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:02,419
l'm open!

468
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,391
She's open! Give it to her!

469
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,862
-Lisa!
-Give it to her! She's open! Give it to her!

470
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:12,232
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

471
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,699
What are you thinking?

472
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,738
-Tamra.
-Tamra, post up!

473
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:23,976
Timeout. Timeout. Timeout. Timeout.

474
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:27,344
Come on, come on.

475
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:31,684
What are you guys doing out there?
What are you doing?

476
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:36,057
Tamra, you got to stay tight
on that big girl under the bucket. Come on!

477
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,226
-She's scoring all the points for her team.
-What do you mean, ''big girl''?

478
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:42,961
-What?
-Do you mean fat?

479
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:45,430
Are you calling her fat?

480
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:47,734
Look, just because someone's big,
it doesn't mean they're fat.

481
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:51,069
Okay, l didn't say she was fat.

482
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,605
No, but you called her big.
It's the same thing.

483
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,039
Jesus Christ, who gives a shit?

484
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:56,909
See, that's the attitude
that causes girls to have eating disorders.

485
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,142
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

486
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,949
-What do you want me to call her?
-Her name is Cindy.

487
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:03,714
Why don't you try that?

488
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:05,450
-Okay, fine.
-Good.

489
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:08,288
Can you stay tight on Cindy?

490
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:10,189
-ls that okay with you?
-Yeah.

491
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:12,356
-ls that okay with you guys?
-Yeah. Thanks.

492
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:13,626
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

493
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:17,464
She can't shoot from outside,
so let's make them shoot it outside, okay?

494
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:19,833
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's go.

495
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:21,699
Chargers!

496
00:34:24,335 --> 00:34:26,707
Come on, team.
Good hustle. Let's go, let's go!

497
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,905
Pass it to Kathy!

498
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,809
-l'm open! l'm open!
-Kathy's open, pass it to her!

499
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,308
Pass it!

500
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:41,420
What's the matter with you?
Kathy was open.

501
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:45,291
At least it was close.

502
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,497
-What is she doing here?
-Just be nice, okay?

503
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:55,603
-Hey.
-Hey. Sit down.

504
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:56,901
Thanks.

505
00:34:58,168 --> 00:35:01,007
So, where are you from anyway, Kathy?

506
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:04,277
-Arizona.
-Yeah? Why'd you move to Indiana?

507
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,346
My mom and l were looking for a place
with a little more racial hostility.

508
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:10,214
And where's your dad?

509
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:13,953
-California.
-What's he doing there?

510
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:15,487
He plays for the Lakers.

511
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:19,626
-No, he doesn't.
-Which one is he?

512
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,726
The Mexican one.

513
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:24,429
-Wait, which one's the Mexican one?
-Shut up, Mindy.

514
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:25,931
-You shut up.
-l wasn't talking.

515
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:27,966
-So?
-You're so hopeless.

516
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:32,671
l gotta go.

517
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:36,976
ls that her little brother?

518
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:42,850
Where were you tonight?
We had our first home game, remember?

519
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:47,655
-Shoot.
-Did you forget or something?

520
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,359
l'm really sorry, Abbie. Did you win?

521
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,194
No.

522
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,198
Well, l made you this mix.

523
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:04,871
-You did?
-Do you want to listen to it?

524
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:07,572
-Sure.
-All right.

525
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,943
Thanks.

526
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:21,187
-You're a good dancer.
-Thank you.

527
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,457
-Wow.
-lt's so good!

528
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,628
-lt is.
-l think we should kiss.

529
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,501
-Go, Warriors!
-Go, Warriors!

530
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:41,940
Get in position! Let's go!

531
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:44,509
-l'm open. Tamra!
-Let's go!

532
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:49,719
Nice pass. Let's go. Good try.
Foul! Come on! Come on, man!

533
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,588
-lt's all right, Chargers. Let's go.
-Get on them. Get on them!

534
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,357
This isn't hockey.
Where'd you find these girls?

535
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:02,061
-Come on, Warriors. Take that shot.
-Come on, Warriors. Take that shot.

536
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,561
-Grabbing on her shirt!
-Come on!

537
00:37:03,627 --> 00:37:05,965
What the hell are you doing? Call it!

538
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,269
lt's about time.

539
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:13,806
-Lay off.
-Got a problem?

540
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:15,073
Do you?

541
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,678
Come on, Chargers!

542
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:24,481
-Spic!
-Don't miss, wetback.

543
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:32,357
That's okay. That's okay.

544
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:35,194
Hey, did you hear about the Mexican
who went to college?

545
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:37,129
-No.
-Yeah, me neither.

546
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,936
-Kathy, what're you doing?
-What did you say to her?

547
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,003
-Nothing.
-Kathy.

548
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,972
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-Got something to say?

549
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:49,507
-l didn't say anything.
-Why don't you say it out loud

550
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:50,675
-so l can hear you?
-You must be hearing things.

551
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,211
-Can you repeat that?
-You have a hearing problem.

552
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:53,678
_Cause l can't hear you.
-l didn't say anything.

553
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:57,518
You're talking a lot of trash right now.
You know that? Say it again. Go ahead!

554
00:37:57,581 --> 00:37:59,986
-Hey, hey. Hey, can you help me out?
-You've got balls, right?

555
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,085
-Can you help me out?
-Say it again.

556
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:03,622
Can you help me out with your player?
What's going on? What happened?

557
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,892
-They called her a spic!
-They what?

558
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:08,895
-They called her a spic!
-Okay, that's just tactics.

559
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,430
You can't listen to that shit.
That's the oldest trick in the book.

560
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:14,267
l heard your coach was a dishwasher.

561
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,002
Beat her ass.

562
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,910
-Right, you guys... Come on!
-Shame on you.

563
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:28,447
Guys, get off! Wendy, stop pulling her hair!

564
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:34,020
Hey. What's up?

565
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,155
Please don't make me
go back out there, Coach.

566
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:39,725
l'm not gonna make you
go back out there, don't worry.

567
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,326
l hate it here.

568
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:45,130
Everyone's so frisking white.

569
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,599
-Yeah. l know.
-No offense.

570
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:49,300
None taken.

571
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:54,343
-You want to know something funny?
-Yeah, l love funny shit. Tell me.

572
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:58,678
l've never even been to Mexico.
Probably wouldn't fit in there either.

573
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,415
Listen, you know, kids are stupid.

574
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:08,189
-Yeah, but it's not just the kids.
-Well, you know, people are stupid.

575
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:12,961
lt starts in childhood
and then continues all the way to death.

576
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:18,364
-l let everybody down.
-No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

577
00:39:18,428 --> 00:39:20,565
l just walked out on a game.

578
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,604
-Hey.
-Sorry, you guys.

579
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:30,143
-Yeah. Lisa punched someone in the face.
-What?

580
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:31,842
-Yeah.
-Here Here.

581
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,247
-Are you serious?
-You all right?

582
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:36,481
-Yeah, are you?
-Yeah.

583
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:38,216
-Did we forfeit?
-lt got really rough out there.

584
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:40,019
Yeah, we forfeited.

585
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,489
And their spirits are down,
so l think we need to...

586
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:45,290
You need to do something for them.

587
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:46,557
-You know...
-Like what?

588
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:50,597
We're gonna be passing places to eat.
Maybe you could take them out for dinner.

589
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:54,035
-l don't have any money.
-You don't have any money?

590
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:57,136
No, l can't take them. No. What am l gonna...

591
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:02,810
Okay, l'll pay for it, but, you know,
you're gonna have to pay me back.

592
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:04,776
You should try dipping your French fries

593
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,311
-in your milkshake.
-Okay, that's disgusting.

594
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:08,213
-l thought l was the only one who did that.
-lt's really good.

595
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,413
-You should try it.
-Let me try that.

596
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,547
How about an onion ring?

597
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:13,086
-No, that's gross.
-No, that is so disgusting.

598
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,819
What, are you like...
You got a rulebook or something?

599
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:18,156
Tight on her, Abbie.

600
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:21,693
All right, come on! Come on!
Don't let her score.

601
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:23,294
-Come on, keep it up! Keep it up!
-Don't let her score!

602
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:24,428
-Hands up!
-Don't let her make that shot!

603
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:28,633
All right, Chargers, let's go.

604
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,169
-Come on, guys.
-All right, come on!

605
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:35,642
Get it back, girls. Get it back.
That's what l'm talking about! Yeah!

606
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,243
Abbie, foul. Foul. Stop the clock.

607
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:40,178
-No, l'm not gonna foul her. No.
-Stop the clock.

608
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:42,447
-Come on! No!
-Stop the clock!

609
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:44,382
All right, that's good. Good.

610
00:40:44,448 --> 00:40:47,187
All right. Timeout, timeout.
Bring it in, bring it in.

611
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,719
You don't ever contradict me.

612
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:52,526
lf l tell you to do something, you do it,
you understand me?

613
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,994
All right,
when that girl misses her free throws,

614
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:58,130
Abbie's gonna take the ball down court
and look for the clear shot.

615
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:01,969
Wendy, l want you to set a pick
at the three-point line. Set it hard.

616
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:05,872
Kathy's gonna cut off the screen
and go backdoor, understand?

617
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:09,009
-Go for the lay-up. Bring it in.
-What about Wendy?

618
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:11,209
What about Wendy?

619
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:15,549
She's gonna be wide open
on the three-point line.

620
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:16,714
Yeah?

621
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:21,655
Everybody's going to be expecting Kathy
to take the last shot, so...

622
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,256
Wendy can make it. l've seen her do it.

623
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:26,625
-You can make it, right?
-Yeah.

624
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:36,302
Okay. Everybody's gonna be
expecting Kathy to take the last shot.

625
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:38,336
Wendy's gonna be free
after she sets the pick.

626
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:42,243
Abbie, you get the ball to her right away.
Wendy, don't miss!

627
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,743
-What if she does miss?
-What?

628
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:46,511
Well, what if she does?
You just put more pressure on her.

629
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:48,913
You should say, ''Try not to miss.''

630
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:51,684
-Something encouraging.
-Tamra, shut up.

631
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:56,590
You're gonna make it, you understand?
All right, everybody bring it in. Let's go.

632
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:58,790
''Go, fight, win'' on three. One, two, three.

633
00:41:58,855 --> 00:42:00,358
-Go! Fight! Win! Yeah!
-Go! Fight! Win!

634
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:02,394
Let's go. Get out there.

635
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:14,972
-Yeah!
-All right.

636
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:19,212
Box out, Tam-Tam!

637
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:31,723
Go, Wendy. l know what you want.
Come on. Go.

638
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:43,101
lt's as easy as that!

639
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:47,240
That's what l'm talking about.
That's what l'm talking about. Yeah!

640
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:49,408
-How do you girls feel right now?
-Great!

641
00:42:49,473 --> 00:42:50,508
-Good.
-Yeah?

642
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:52,878
How'd you like to feel like that every day
for the rest of the season?

643
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:56,549
You played a good game tonight,
but none of you played your best.

644
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:59,452
-Are you kidding?
-Hey, we just won. What more do you want?

645
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:01,453
l want you to keep winning.

646
00:43:01,518 --> 00:43:04,523
lt's a good start. Let's go.
Let's get in the locker room.

647
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,859
That was good.

648
00:43:10,094 --> 00:43:12,498
Did you see your dad cheering for you?
He was like...

649
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:15,634
l don't think anyone at the game missed it,
thank you very much.

650
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:17,702
-And the red pants.
-Hey.

651
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,103
Hey.

652
00:43:20,604 --> 00:43:22,274
-Thanks.
-Good game last night.

653
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:24,776
How funny was Tamra's dad
at the game last night?

654
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:27,413
-He was so funny!
-Tam-Tam, box out!

655
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:28,612
Tam-Tam!

656
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,317
-Okay, Chargers!
-Go, Chargers!

657
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,259
Hey, Bill, where you been?
Game's about to start.

658
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:43,295
-l can't... l can't do it.
-What do you mean you can't do it?

659
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,466
You see that girl on the Van Hunt team,
number three?

660
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,640
That's my daughter, and she hates me.
She hasn't spoken to me in two weeks.

661
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:54,506
l can't coach against her.

662
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:01,348
What do you mean? You can't just leave.
Come on. You gotta be a man.

663
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:03,749
l can't do that to my daughter.

664
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:09,290
She may be your daughter,
but those are your girls out there.

665
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,660
Go, Chargers! Go, Lisa!

666
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:19,897
Go, Chargers!

667
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:23,568
Go, Tam-Tam!

668
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:30,977
Tamra, post up.
Come on, girls, box out! Come on!

669
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,711
Timeout. Timeout.

670
00:44:40,483 --> 00:44:43,722
-Are you okay, Coach?
-Yeah, l'm...

671
00:44:47,057 --> 00:44:49,295
l mean, tell us what to do. Come on.
We can win this.

672
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,463
Okay, Molly,
l want you to watch number three.

673
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:52,863
-Molly?
-Who's Molly?

674
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,568
Abbie, l want you to watch number three.

675
00:44:56,633 --> 00:45:01,342
She can't go left, and you might be able
to get a couple more turnovers, okay?

676
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:07,280
-l want you two to set a trap, okay?
-Are you sure you're okay?

677
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:08,679
-Yeah.
-You sure?

678
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:09,746
Let's bring it in.

679
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:12,584
-Go! Fight! Win!
-Go! Fight! Win!

680
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:16,323
Yeah! Go, Chargers! Let's go, girls.

681
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:26,831
Here we go, Abbie.
Keep it going, keep it going!

682
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:27,964
Hey!

683
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:33,206
-You apologize to that girl right now.
-No!

684
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:35,541
-You apologize to her right now!
-Get lost!

685
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:37,275
Stay out of this. Stay out of this.

686
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,677
Don't make a scene, okay?
Don't talk to me like that.

687
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,348
You shut up! And you're a loser! l hate you!

688
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:05,204
So, that was your daughter, right?

689
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:08,005
Yeah. Yeah.

690
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:12,044
What... What did you do to her?

691
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,213
What did l do to her?

692
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,617
-l mean, what...
-l didn't do anything to her.

693
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,219
Well, why does she hate you so much?

694
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:28,359
Her mother brainwashed her.

695
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:30,962
-What did you do to her mother?
-Nothing.

696
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:35,503
Well, we think you should take her
to see a counselor or something.

697
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:43,810
-ls that what you think?
-Well, l think it would help.

698
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:48,314
We don't need any help, okay?

699
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:52,352
lt really helped me and my dad
after our parents got divorced.

700
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,888
-Yeah, it helped me and my dad, too.
-Whatever.

701
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:58,324
A therapist helped me
stop confusing issues with my mom

702
00:46:58,388 --> 00:47:01,159
-with issues from my father's abandonment.
-Jesus Christ!

703
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:05,900
-ls everybody here from a broken home?
-My parents are still together, Coach.

704
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:08,065
But they hate each other.

705
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,969
That's ridiculous.

706
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:53,672
...but l'll come back when you draw it.

707
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,775
-Hey.
-Hey.

708
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,980
-You want some popcorn?
-No. Thank you.

709
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:04,949
-Can l ask you something?
-Sure.

710
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:22,467
Do you like women?

711
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:27,739
-Who told you that?
-No one.

712
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:32,811
That's none of your business.

713
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:35,278
l'm sorry.

714
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,153
Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of
if l did, either.

715
00:49:43,353 --> 00:49:46,258
When did you first know?
l mean, if you did.

716
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:52,797
Attraction is chemical.

717
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:57,571
You feel something for someone,
your body just lets you know.

718
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:02,273
Sometimes before your mind accepts it.

719
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:05,742
Why?

720
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:09,215
-You think you might be...
-l don't think so.

721
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,151
-ls that Wendy's boyfriend?
-Yeah.

722
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,862
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-What about the text you sent me?

723
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,730
What about that text?

724
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:29,503
-Hi, Coach.
-Hey, Wendy. Who's your friend?

725
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,971
Hey. Joel. Nice to meet you.

726
00:50:33,102 --> 00:50:35,607
-You know she's 16, right?
-Seventeen, actually.

727
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:38,511
-Yeah. Whatever. You're still too young.
-Hey, it's not like that.

728
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:40,378
Yeah? What's it like?

729
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:43,147
You want to know, huh?

730
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:47,152
Yeah. She's wearing a retainer.
You know that.

731
00:50:48,685 --> 00:50:51,122
Stay off the sports drinks, Coach.

732
00:50:51,788 --> 00:50:55,662
-Stay away from my team.
-Yeah, all right. You coming, Wendy?

733
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:06,810
Move with the ball. That's good.
Okay, drive it. Drive it at me. A bit.

734
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:07,870
Nice.

735
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:10,809
-You're late.
-Yeah, well, l'm here now.

736
00:51:13,142 --> 00:51:15,145
We have a new addition.

737
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:19,585
-Who the hell are you?
-Her name is Floor.

738
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:22,185
Can you speak English?

739
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:24,520
Not really.

740
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:26,558
Can she play?

741
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:29,060
-Do cows say moo?
-Great.

742
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:33,299
Well, welcome to America.
We'll get you a ball with your name on it.

743
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,102
The girls want to talk to you
about something.

744
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:41,908
Yeah? What now?
Keep the toilet seat down or something?

745
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:44,241
The boys played their first home game
Last night,

746
00:51:44,307 --> 00:51:47,279
and the girls thought
that they were treated better.

747
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:49,080
-Yeah.
-lt's not fair.

748
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:54,088
Well, life isn't fair. What can l say?
Adapt or menstruate, right, Floor?

749
00:51:58,087 --> 00:52:01,226
The girls want to bust
through a paper banner like the boys.

750
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,358
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

751
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:03,795
And we want an announcer, too.

752
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,130
And cheerleaders.

753
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:07,631
Yeah, that stuff comes with winning games.

754
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:09,566
We have been winning games.

755
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:11,903
-You know, at least a couple, right?
-Yeah.

756
00:52:11,968 --> 00:52:13,370
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

757
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:19,512
l'll see what l can do.
l'll jot it down on my to-do list.

758
00:52:37,393 --> 00:52:41,300
lt happens. Okay? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

759
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:52,612
-What's he doing out there?
-l don't know. Hey, Coach, are you okay?

760
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,445
-Hey.
-Are you okay? What happened?

761
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,748
-Hey.
-Can you help him up?

762
00:52:56,813 --> 00:52:59,317
-Come on. Do you need any help?
-Did you fall?

763
00:52:59,382 --> 00:53:02,354
-l'm just trying to find my... Hey!
-Jesus.

764
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:05,923
Where's my hat?

765
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:11,395
Yeah. l'm just trying to find my keys.

766
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:16,737
-l'll help you. Are they in here?
-What's wrong with him?

767
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:21,472
-Here, can you stand up?
-Thank you.

768
00:53:21,537 --> 00:53:24,542
-We got a lot of balls.
-Those are our babies.

769
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:27,278
-l will find my keys.
-You know what? They are not in here,

770
00:53:27,343 --> 00:53:29,313
so l think
that we'll just give you a ride home.

771
00:53:31,514 --> 00:53:34,152
Where's the light? Okay, come on in.

772
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:37,054
Thanks, girls. You okay?

773
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:39,824
What, did you have a party in here
or something?

774
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:42,995
Yeah, a big party.
Let's have a party right now.

775
00:53:43,326 --> 00:53:45,229
Hey, put on some music.

776
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:49,268
What was the occasion
for this little party, Coach?

777
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:51,368
What, you didn't hear?

778
00:53:52,602 --> 00:53:54,773
l won Asshole of the Year award.

779
00:53:54,837 --> 00:53:56,707
l didn't know
they gave out an award for that.

780
00:53:56,774 --> 00:54:01,449
-Yeah, they got awards for everything now.
-Let me guess. Is this the trophy?

781
00:54:01,511 --> 00:54:05,285
-Yeah. Isn't it gorgeous?
-Were you any good in high school?

782
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:08,153
-Are you kidding me? l was great.
-Really?

783
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:11,523
l led the only team in Plainview history
to make it to State.

784
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:12,655
Did you win?

785
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:14,357
No.

786
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:17,061
Then you couldn't have been
that good, then.

787
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:19,296
Sassy pants!

788
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:24,470
-Somebody's a sassy pants.
-Was my dad any good at basketball?

789
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,404
He was good at putting on his jockstrap.

790
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,305

791
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:31,241
Ex.

792
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:35,814
-She's pretty.
-How'd you get her to marry you?

793
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:38,215
What am l, a tuna fish sandwich?

794
00:54:38,314 --> 00:54:39,817
-What is that?
-Coffee.

795
00:54:39,882 --> 00:54:42,720
-Have some. It'll make you feel better.
-l don't want a coffee, l want a beer.

796
00:54:42,786 --> 00:54:44,655
-No. No more beer, Coach.
-No, you don't need any more beer.

797
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,958
Take it from him. Take it from him.

798
00:54:49,192 --> 00:54:51,529
So, what,
were you guys high-school sweethearts?

799
00:54:51,594 --> 00:54:54,599
-Yeah, something like that.
-What happened?

800
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:58,638
Just... You know, high school ended,
that's all.

801
00:54:58,701 --> 00:55:02,008
-Did you play ball in college?
-No.

802
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:03,841
Why not?

803
00:55:05,107 --> 00:55:08,379
-lt just didn't work out.
-Well, where'd you go?

804
00:55:09,512 --> 00:55:11,716
lU. That's the man right there.

805
00:55:11,782 --> 00:55:14,921
-So, you couldn't make the team?
-l could have made the team.

806
00:55:14,984 --> 00:55:17,021
l could have made the team plenty
and then some.

807
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:18,288
l just don't understand.

808
00:55:18,354 --> 00:55:22,395
l mean, if you could have made the team,
well, why didn't you play?

809
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:24,660
He had a kid.

810
00:55:30,766 --> 00:55:31,902
ls that true?

811
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,481
Thanks for the ride, but l think it's time
you should go. Maybe now.

812
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:44,015
Well, we don't want
to leave you by yourself.

813
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,021
l think we'll just stay until maybe
you want to, like, drink some water

814
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:50,087
-and lie down?
-Just go.

815
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:52,924
-Are you sure?
-Are you sure?

816
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:56,628
Don't you want us to clean up
or something, or help you out?

817
00:55:56,692 --> 00:56:00,366
-Just... Just go, please, okay?
-No, we're not gonna leave.

818
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:01,899
l don't think you're all right here
by yourself.

819
00:56:01,964 --> 00:56:03,766
l'm fine, sweetheart.

820
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:06,971
Come on, let's go.

821
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,242
-We'll see you at practice, okay?
-See you, Coach.

822
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:13,779
-Are you sure you don't want us to stay?
-Go.

823
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:19,149
Hey, you can recycle these cans, you know.

824
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:20,985
-Get out!
-Okay, okay, Coach.

825
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,099
-Fuck! Fuck. Jesus!
-Good morning.

826
00:57:10,466 --> 00:57:12,570
What are you doing in here?

827
00:57:14,503 --> 00:57:16,306
l just thought l'd come by
and say hello, you know?

828
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:19,044
Haven't spoken much
since you started, so...

829
00:57:22,578 --> 00:57:26,786
-Yeah, l've been busy.
-The girls are really coming along, huh?

830
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,352
Tamra can't stop talking about you.

831
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:32,424
Yeah, she's good. They all are.
They're doing a good job.

832
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:35,660
-l know, l told you.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, you're...

833
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:43,271
-What's this? You rode your bike today?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. l lost my keys.

834
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:48,639
-Yuck.
-Yeah.

835
00:57:48,704 --> 00:57:50,942
So, you find them?

836
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,245
Yeah, yeah, they were under the seat.

837
00:57:58,714 --> 00:58:03,356
Something... Something you want
to say to me, or...

838
00:58:07,123 --> 00:58:09,594
-No. No. Guess not.
-Okay. Okay.

839
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,207
Just try and keep a hold
of those keys, okay?

840
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:24,709
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You got it, you got it.

841
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:31,483
-Fuck it.
-Hey. Listen, man.

842
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:38,558
l'm just gonna say it.
l think your assistant coach is a lesbian.

843
00:58:38,654 --> 00:58:41,860
-What?
-Yeah. Boy, that feels better.

844
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:43,860
-How do you...
-l mean, l don't know.

845
00:58:43,926 --> 00:58:47,767
Don't, like, you know, quote me or anything.
l'm just... l just got a sense.

846
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:50,868
-The way she moves.
-Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:52,536
Her general demeanor. She drives a bus.

848
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:56,141
-Yeah.
-She wears very comfy sneakers.

849
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:58,676
l'll check her out. l'll see...
It's gonna be fine.

850
00:58:58,741 --> 00:58:59,809
-Okay.
-Okay.

851
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,011
-All right.
-Weird.

852
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:02,547
Great. Hey.

853
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:05,316
-Hey, thanks... Thanks, man.
-All right.

854
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:07,151
Go, fight, win!

855
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:17,429
All right, who wants to talk
about what happened last night?

856
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:29,908
Who wants to talk about
why we lost to a team that was shorter,

857
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:32,510
slower and less talented than us?

858
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,282
Anyone?

859
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:46,160
l see. Well, if we're not gonna talk,
we might as well get a little running in.

860
00:59:46,222 --> 00:59:47,257
Hit the baseline.

861
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,295
Where's your sister?

862
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:54,865
-She's at Shoes Etc.
-Shoes Etc.?

863
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,900
Yeah. With that new guy.

864
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:01,905
You know how beautiful l think you are?

865
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:07,479
-Hey, party's over, shithead. Let's go.
-Hey!

866
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:09,113
-Let's go.
-What are you doing here?

867
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:10,346
Didn't l tell you she was 16?

868
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:11,580
-l'm 17!
-Whatever!

869
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,586
-Coach, it's not what you think.
-You have no idea what l think, okay?

870
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,253
-Wendy, you're not going anywhere.
-l'm sorry.

871
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:17,319
Let's go.

872
01:00:17,386 --> 01:00:19,189
-You're having private practice, huh?
-Shithead!

873
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:23,763
-Oh, my... What are you doing?
-Get out of my face, asshole. He's fine.

874
01:00:23,826 --> 01:00:25,663
l'm sure it happens to him all the time.
Let's go. Let's go.

875
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:29,635
-What is wrong with you?
-l'm sure it happens to him every day.

876
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:35,308
-Did you just throw a shoe at me?
-No. No. No. l didn't throw anything at you.

877
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:36,906
That wasn't me.

878
01:00:38,574 --> 01:00:41,212
Let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go.

879
01:00:43,812 --> 01:00:46,817
-You picked a real winner there.
-What are you, jealous?

880
01:00:46,882 --> 01:00:47,917
No.

881
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:50,887
-No, l'm not.
-You are.

882
01:00:50,953 --> 01:00:52,021
-No.
-You're jealous.

883
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:54,492
You're totally jealous, you perv.

884
01:00:58,827 --> 01:01:01,199
l hate to bust your bubble, honey,
but you're not my type.

885
01:01:01,263 --> 01:01:03,967
l'm moving! l'm moving! Go ahead!

886
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:07,036
Go ahead!

887
01:01:07,103 --> 01:01:10,976
-What's your type?
-l like big tits and an onion butt.

888
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:13,210
What's an onion butt?

889
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:17,881
lt's an ass that brings tears to your eyes.

890
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:20,718
All right, everybody, gather around.

891
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:26,593
This is last year Triple-A finals, okay?

892
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,996
These girls are from schools
just like this one.

893
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:35,368
What's wrong?
What are you laughing about? What is it?

894
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:39,003
-Gross.
-Shit. You guys are looking at my...

895
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,039
All right. It's not funny.

896
01:01:42,104 --> 01:01:45,109
Here you go.
Save me some of those pizza things.

897
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:46,810
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

898
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:49,379
-Hello? Hey. Yeah.
-l want you to watch this point guard.

899
01:01:50,613 --> 01:01:52,850
They're really good.
You guys could be this good.

900
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:56,888
Watch this defense.
Keeping them outside, see?

901
01:01:57,353 --> 01:02:00,959
-They can't penetrate. See that?
-They're really good.

902
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:05,095
-What is she doing?
-Wow!

903
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:08,266
-Did she just take that?
-What was that, a foul?

904
01:02:09,465 --> 01:02:12,537
Wнde open underneath the bucket and...
Rattled out of there!

905
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:24,382
So are you gay,
or do you got a fellow or what?

906
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:29,719
That's not a very polite way of asking.

907
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:34,627
l'm sorry. Are you a lesbian, or...

908
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,362
-Does it matter?
-Hey, l don't care.

909
01:02:38,427 --> 01:02:43,035
l'm just... You know, it's a small town.
A lot of people would be uncomfortable

910
01:02:43,098 --> 01:02:46,405
knowing that somebody like you
is hanging out with their teenage girls.

911
01:02:46,468 --> 01:02:50,843
-Do you think they're comfortable with you?
-l'm not a... l've never known a gay before.

912
01:02:50,906 --> 01:02:54,546
-l don't know how this works. l mean...
-Sure you have. They just didn't tell you.

913
01:02:58,447 --> 01:02:59,549
Okay.

914
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:03,621
Since we're being so honest here,
you mind if l ask you a question?

915
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:06,858
l hope you're not gonna ask me
to impregnate you, are you?

916
01:03:06,922 --> 01:03:08,558
That's cute.

917
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:12,231
No. What happened with those boys
at Culver?

918
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:18,303
Someone said something
they shouldn't have,

919
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:22,207
something about my daughter,
and l did something l shouldn't have.

920
01:03:22,272 --> 01:03:24,676
Just for saying something
about your daughter?

921
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,179
l lost control,
and my players didn't back me up.

922
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:30,880
Let's just leave it at that.

923
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:55,406
Lisa, Kathy against Tamra, Wendy and Floor.
Let's go.

924
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:56,806
All right.

925
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,344
What'd l tell you girls
about putting this shit on my court?

926
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:02,613
-No!
-No! No! No! No!

927
01:04:02,678 --> 01:04:05,316
-That's not trash!
-What is it? Barbie shit? What is it?

928
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,419
That's not trash. Open it.

929
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:11,855
-What is it?
-Open it.

930
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,415
That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

931
01:04:37,746 --> 01:04:40,050
We wanted to get you something.

932
01:04:41,784 --> 01:04:45,391
Okay, back to practice. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go, come on.

933
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:48,058
Thank you very much. l appreciate it.

934
01:05:21,056 --> 01:05:22,793
Hey, can l get a...

935
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:28,935
Can l get a pack of Cool's? Menthol?

936
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:33,437
They're minty.

937
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:32,531
-What makes a guy turn into a jerk?
-Why are you asking me that?

938
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:36,067
-Look, do you know Damon Tisdale?
-Yeah, the ugly guy?

939
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:38,268
-Okay, he's not ugly.
-Short kid?

940
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,906
l know. He's a point guard.
l know. He's good.

941
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:46,411
We're kind of dating and, l don't know,
he's never been to one of my games,

942
01:06:46,476 --> 01:06:50,817
-and l've been to all of his.
-Well, you know, a kid like Damon Tisdale

943
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:53,551
is not really thinking about the big picture
right now, you know what l mean?

944
01:06:53,615 --> 01:06:55,050
No, l don't. l mean...

945
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:59,993
l mean, you know, he's a star athlete.
He's popular. He's got a pretty girlfriend.

946
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:02,727
As far as he's concerned,
the sun shines out of his ass.

947
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,895
Well, okay, then, what is this big picture?

948
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,397
Big picture is the rest of his life.
That's the big picture.

949
01:07:07,463 --> 01:07:09,934
He's gonna be pumping gas in a few years.

950
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:12,402
l don't know if that's supposed
to make me feel better or worse.

951
01:07:14,002 --> 01:07:17,274
l don't even think he's that great a player,
to be honest with you.

952
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:20,812
Mop the tears up.
Put your bras back on. Let's go.

953
01:07:20,876 --> 01:07:24,148
Stop talking about boys. Come on.
We have a job to do.

954
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:28,688
Bring it in, let's bring it in. Let's go.
This is the last game of the season.

955
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,691
Up until tonight, we've won some
of our games, lost some of our games.

956
01:07:32,754 --> 01:07:36,160
This game determines whether or not
we have a winning season

957
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:38,227
or a losing season,

958
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:42,534
and that determines
if we get to go to the sectionals or not.

959
01:07:43,432 --> 01:07:44,935
You know what?

960
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,238
-l don't really give a shit, because...
-What?

961
01:07:48,303 --> 01:07:51,008
This has been a good one for me, and...

962
01:07:51,773 --> 01:07:56,047
So just go out there,
and, you know, do the best you can.

963
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,050
l mean, you know, try to win.

964
01:08:02,518 --> 01:08:04,788
-Are you drunk?
-l'm not drunk at all. l'm serious.

965
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:07,123
l want you to win.
But don't think that that's not...

966
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:10,696
Hey, wait a minute. Don't think that
that's not important, not to win, okay?

967
01:08:11,493 --> 01:08:16,502
You know what l mean? Okay, l'm not...
Yeah, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on.

968
01:08:33,448 --> 01:08:34,717
One, two, three!

969
01:08:34,783 --> 01:08:37,254
-Go! Fight! Win!
-Go! Fight! Win!

970
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:45,931
-Get back. Let's get back.
-Go, Chargers!

971
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:50,534
Come on, defense, girls.

972
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,135
Tamra, box out!

973
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:55,373
That's okay. That's okay.

974
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:57,707
All right!

975
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:01,845
Tam-Tam!

976
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:18,561
Hey! What's up? What are you doing here?

977
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:20,798
-Nice room.

01:09:20,862 --> 01:09:23,566

-l know, isn't it cool?

979
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:27,403
Yeah, we had our last game tonight.

980
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:32,377
-We won, FYl. We're going to the sectionals.
-That's great.

981
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:34,813
What were you doing?
l mean, l always make it to your games...

982
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:36,813
-l know.
-...and you've never even come to one yet.

983
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,085
l... l forgot.

984
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:49,698
Yeah. Look, Damon, l like you, you know.
You're really cute. You're a good kisser.

985
01:09:49,758 --> 01:09:51,828
Thank you. Yeah, l like you, too.

986
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:56,066
But l just don't think you're seeing
the big picture here.

987
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:58,033
What do you mean?

988
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,404
What do you want to do
with the rest of your life, Damon?

989
01:10:00,469 --> 01:10:03,541
What do l want to do?
Be on reality television.

990
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:07,609
Right. All right.

991
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:14,619
-Goodbye, Damon.
-Where are you going?

992
01:10:18,086 --> 01:10:20,323
What's wrong with reality TV?

993
01:10:25,227 --> 01:10:28,166
-Everything okay?
-Everything's fine, yeah.

994
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:30,267
Can l get you anything else? Another Coke?

995
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:34,239
What is that,
the orange drink they're having?

996
01:10:34,302 --> 01:10:36,640
-That's the Wallaby Darned.
-Yeah?

997
01:10:36,706 --> 01:10:38,008
lt's our most popular drink.

998
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:40,310
-Cricket! All right, l'll have...
-You want one?

999
01:10:40,375 --> 01:10:42,947
Yeah, why not?
l'm celebrating tonight, so...

1000
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:44,380
Yeah? What's the occasion?

1001
01:10:44,446 --> 01:10:47,886
End of my first season
as coach of the Lady Chargers.

1002
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:50,153
-You coach girls' basketball?
-Yeah.

1003
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:52,723
That is so cute. l used to play.

1004
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:55,694
-Were you good?
-l was okay, yeah. Not bad.

1005
01:10:55,758 --> 01:10:57,995
-l bet you were.
-Man, l bet they love

1006
01:10:58,059 --> 01:10:59,327
having you as a coach, huh?

1007
01:10:59,394 --> 01:11:02,734
They're okay. l don't know if they like me
so much all the time, but...

1008
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:04,936
No, l bet they love you.

1009
01:11:06,803 --> 01:11:10,042
-Well, l will bring you that Wallaby Darned.
-All right, thanks.

1010
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:15,946
You almost done?

1011
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:17,814
-l feel great.
-Great.

1012
01:11:17,879 --> 01:11:21,352
-These are delicious!
-They are, yeah. You...

1013
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:24,522
-Good day!
-Yeah, okay. All right.

1014
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:29,528
-Maybe l'll get another one of these babies.
-How about some coffee, Coach?

1015
01:11:29,591 --> 01:11:31,428
-ls that a hint?
-Maybe. l'm gonna go get that.

1016
01:11:31,493 --> 01:11:36,536
-You know what'd be fun...
-No, no, no, don't... Leave it, leave it.

1017
01:11:36,598 --> 01:11:37,801
Please leave it.

1018
01:11:37,866 --> 01:11:39,803
-Let me help you. l'm sorry.
-Somebody will get it.

1019
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:43,007
l was just gonna ask you if you wanted
to maybe go somewhere else

1020
01:11:43,071 --> 01:11:46,377
-and have one of these with me.
-No, but thank you.

1021
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:48,077
l didn't mean to grab you there.

1022
01:11:48,143 --> 01:11:49,846
-l was just trying to...
-lt's fine.

1023
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:53,417
-...get your attention.
-Here's your check. l'll be back.

1024
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:57,422
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have asked you out.
That was probably...

1025
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:08,831
Fuck!

1026
01:12:22,244 --> 01:12:23,346
Shit.

1027
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:35,992
Okay, move it.

1028
01:12:56,846 --> 01:12:57,914
Hey.

1029
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:04,524
-Sweetie, what are you doing here?
-What are you doing here? What happened?

1030
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:10,129
l made a mistake, honey.
l made a bad decision.

1031
01:13:11,794 --> 01:13:13,196
Oh, my God!

1032
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:17,668
Girls, what are you doing here?

1033
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:22,072
-Why weren't you at practice?
-l got fired.

1034
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:24,840
We heard.

1035
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:27,344
How the hell are we gonna play
in the sectionals without you?

1036
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:29,814
You're gonna be fine. You got Donna.

1037
01:13:29,879 --> 01:13:32,450
No, Donna doesn't know anything
about basketball.

1038
01:13:32,514 --> 01:13:36,788
To us, you're still the coach,
so you better start thinking of a plan.

1039
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:39,356
-Okay?
-And fast.

1040
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,392
-Let's go.
-Here.

1041
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:45,627
What's this?

1042
01:13:45,694 --> 01:13:48,066
lt's the tapes from all the games
l've been taping over the season.

1043
01:13:49,197 --> 01:13:50,766
See you around.

1044
01:13:53,501 --> 01:13:55,939
l mean, it's a federal offense.
Did you know that?

1045
01:13:56,338 --> 01:14:00,345
You can't sell your prescriptions.
You just can't. They're yours.

1046
01:14:01,076 --> 01:14:03,480
Okay? You take them for a reason.

1047
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,149
l want to finish the season.

1048
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:08,318
-Forget it.
-You want me to say please?

1049
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:11,789
l don't care what you say, all right, Bill?
You blew it.

1050
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:14,960
-Let me go to the sectionals, Terry.
-l said you blew it!

1051
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:17,862
-Come on, man. Let me just...
-You broke my daughter's heart!

1052
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:19,429
You broke all their hearts.

1053
01:14:19,494 --> 01:14:20,729
l'm sorry.

1054
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,665
Get out.

1055
01:14:49,892 --> 01:14:50,960
Hey, girls.

1056
01:14:52,895 --> 01:14:54,264
l just wanted to take a moment

1057
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:56,399
before we head to the sectionals
tomorrow morning.

1058
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,372
l know you're nervous. l am, too.

1059
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,111
But just remember, we're a team.

1060
01:15:08,176 --> 01:15:11,282
That's not something
anyone can ever take away from us.

1061
01:15:11,346 --> 01:15:13,483
Now, l've never been part of a team before,

1062
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:16,887
and at my age, it wasn't something
l was expecting to ever happen.

1063
01:15:17,352 --> 01:15:21,126
So, l want to thank you
for giving that to me.

1064
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:27,098
My whole life,
l've felt apart from other people.

1065
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,404
l don't feel apart from you girls.

1066
01:15:35,203 --> 01:15:38,842
And no matter what happens tomorrow,

1067
01:15:41,176 --> 01:15:43,313
l'll always be proud of you.

1068
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,487
-Go, Chargers!
-Go, Chargers!

1069
01:16:18,413 --> 01:16:21,085
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1070
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:28,926
We can win. We can win. We can win!

1071
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:32,695
Set a trap.

1072
01:17:01,056 --> 01:17:04,061
-Get off the road, you moron!
-Shut up!

1073
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:18,141
Everyone ready?

1074
01:17:22,077 --> 01:17:23,078
No.

1075
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:28,985
Are you serious, you guys?

1076
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:34,760
The game hasn't even started and you're
already sitting here like we just lost!

1077
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:36,526
l mean, come on!

1078
01:17:37,292 --> 01:17:39,863
Have you realized how much
we've accomplished this year?

1079
01:17:39,928 --> 01:17:44,137
l mean, we're a winning team, guys!
That's cool! And l know Bill isn't here,

1080
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,671
but we were the ones on the court
winning those games,

1081
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:49,439
each and every one of them,
all by ourselves!

1082
01:17:49,504 --> 01:17:52,610
With our talent and our skills
and our minds, right?

1083
01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:56,882
And if Bill was here, he wouldn't let us
sit around and mope, right?

1084
01:17:57,278 --> 01:17:58,380
Am l right?

1085
01:17:58,746 --> 01:17:59,781
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1086
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,618
l said am l right?

1087
01:18:02,684 --> 01:18:03,919
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1088
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:06,090
Oh, my God. Whose house is this?

1089
01:18:06,155 --> 01:18:07,924
-Our house!
-Our house!

1090
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:11,629
Get up. Get up! l said, whose house is this?

1091
01:18:11,693 --> 01:18:14,532
-Our house!
-Our house!

1092
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:16,366
Our house! That's right!

1093
01:18:18,499 --> 01:18:21,104
Go! Come on. Let's go, let's go!

1094
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:30,980
Abbie, get your head in the game. Focus.

1095
01:18:38,419 --> 01:18:39,788
Come on, girl!

1096
01:18:41,223 --> 01:18:43,393
Hate the Chargers!

1097
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:48,096
-No!
-Come on!

1098
01:18:52,134 --> 01:18:53,536
Hey, chica.

1099
01:18:55,503 --> 01:18:58,442
-Can l see your green card?
-Kathy, l'm open!

1100
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:23,465
Hey!

1101
01:19:26,367 --> 01:19:27,535
Coach!

1102
01:19:28,503 --> 01:19:31,007
-Coach, is that you?
-Yeah. We can win!

1103
01:19:31,072 --> 01:19:33,677
-What are you doing here?
-Why are you so sweaty?

1104
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:36,947
-l rode my bike.
-We missed you! We missed you!

1105
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:39,014
We don't have a lot of time.
We don't have a lot of time.

1106
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,083
l think you can beat these girls

1107
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,187
if you switch your defense
to a full-court press.

1108
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:48,059
These girls, they're healthy, you know?
They're tall and healthy,

1109
01:19:48,122 --> 01:19:52,598
but they're not good ball handlers.
l want two defenders on the ball at all times.

1110
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,932
Keep them flustered,
and they'll lose their cool.

1111
01:19:55,997 --> 01:19:58,101
-You got it? Stay on them!
-All right, we got it.

1112
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:01,740
Double-team them. Let's go.
What are you waiting for?

1113
01:20:01,803 --> 01:20:05,176
What are you waiting for? Let's go!
Come on! Come on! Go!

1114
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,410
Come on. Come on.

1115
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:09,579
-Double-team them. Yeah!
-Double-team them?

1116
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:11,414
Tell them to set the trap.
Keep them in the trap.

1117
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:13,148
-Trap?
-Set a trap.

1118
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:15,117
-Trap.
-l need a cigarette.

1119
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:22,425
-You gotta go.
-What do you mean?

1120
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:26,231
-What do you mean, ''What do l mean''?
-lt's my team! Come on, guys. Come on.

1121
01:20:26,295 --> 01:20:27,430
Bill.

1122
01:20:28,663 --> 01:20:30,299
l like the shirt.

1123
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:33,437
Yeah. l know you're being sarcastic.

1124
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:51,287
We won!

1125
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:53,590
-You're kidding me. That's great!
-No, no, no. We won!

1126
01:20:53,654 --> 01:20:55,724
We won 52 to 50!

1127
01:20:58,426 --> 01:20:59,694
-All right!
-lt's good, huh?

1128
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:00,963
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1129
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:12,543
What? Are you kidding me?
She was nailed! Can you hear me?

1130
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,978
Billy. Hey, Billy. Hi.

1131
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,780
Hey, hey. How you doing?

1132
01:21:18,579 --> 01:21:20,316
-How are you?
-l'm okay.

1133
01:21:20,382 --> 01:21:25,190
-Why don't you come sit with us?
-ls that okay with Mr. Perfect over there?

1134
01:21:25,653 --> 01:21:27,222
He's not perfect. Come on.

1135
01:21:37,165 --> 01:21:39,403
Come on, ref, that was a foul!

1136
01:21:41,437 --> 01:21:43,974
-That guy's an idiot.
-She's gonna be heartbroken.

1137
01:21:44,038 --> 01:21:47,612
Listen, tell her she played a hell of a game,
will you?

1138
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:49,745
-Will you tell her that?
-Yeah.

1139
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,113
She really did.

1140
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:54,518
All right, everybody. Huddle up. Huddle up.
Come on, come on.

1141
01:21:55,016 --> 01:21:59,825
All right, now, listen.
l've seen this team play, and they're all D,

1142
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:01,957
which is easy to get around
if you look for the open shot.

1143
01:22:02,023 --> 01:22:03,125
You guys seen Hoosiers?

1144
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:06,464
l want you to pass the ball four times
before you shoot.

1145
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:09,231
What's the most beautiful, beautiful play
in basketball?

1146
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:10,533
-Does anybody know?
-Dribbling?

1147
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:11,700
-Scoring?
-Passing.

1148
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:14,303
That's right, passing. Do you know why?

1149
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:17,341
Because it binds you together
as a team, okay?

1150
01:22:17,406 --> 01:22:21,413
Remember, it's not whether you win or lose,
it's who's afraid to play you next time.

1151
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:24,549
Let's go. One, two, three. One, two, three.

1152
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:26,147
-Go! Fight! Win!
-Go! Fight! Win!

1153
01:22:26,214 --> 01:22:28,151
Yeah! Look them in the eye!

1154
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:31,920
What's going on?

1155
01:22:31,986 --> 01:22:34,090
They're double-teaming Kathy.
What should we do?

1156
01:22:34,155 --> 01:22:36,158
Okay, that's okay, that's okay.
Wendy and Lisa are open,

1157
01:22:36,224 --> 01:22:38,629
-so tell them to set the pick and roll.
-Okay.

1158
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:41,498
And tell Tamra to get those
offensive rebounds and chin it.

1159
01:22:41,562 --> 01:22:45,469
Chin it when she gets
those offensive rebounds. Are we winning?

1160
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:49,004
Good game. Good game.

1161
01:22:49,604 --> 01:22:51,607
-Hey, what happened?
-We're going to the finals tomorrow!

1162
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:54,209
Hey! You're going to the finals? All right!

1163
01:22:54,275 --> 01:22:56,480
-Who are we playing? Who are we playing?
-lt doesn't matter.

1164
01:22:56,544 --> 01:22:57,812
-Who?
-Prairie Hill.

1165
01:22:57,879 --> 01:22:59,515
Prairie. Shit. No kidding.

1166
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:03,053
l'm going. l'm going. l'm going.
l'm going. Okay.

1167
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:04,386
Hey, hey.

1168
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:07,458
-Call me. l'll meet you in the parking lot.
-All right. Good, Coach.

1169
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,059
Are you sure he's coming?

1170
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:15,363
-Are you ready?
-Coach!

1171
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,032
-Coach!
-Let's go!

1172
01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:18,968
-Okay.
-We were waiting for you.

1173
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:20,536
Let's go!

1174
01:23:20,601 --> 01:23:24,274
-So, what's the plan?
-l don't know. l'm not sure yet. l don't know.

1175
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:27,010
You better come up with one quick.
We're gonna be there in half an hour.

1176
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:28,577
Okay. l'm working on it.

1177
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:32,917
How do you expect to sneak by Tamra's dad
without him recognizing you?

1178
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:34,783
l have an idea.

1179
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:41,324
-What? What is it?
-Yeah? Yeah?

1180
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:42,425
-What is it?
-lt's good.

1181
01:23:42,491 --> 01:23:44,661
You're gonna hate it,
but you're gonna do it.

1182
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:58,008

Do you think that anybody noticed me?

Notice you? l think everyone noticed you.

1196
01:25:02,737 --> 01:25:03,939
-Hey.

01:25:05,106 --> 01:25:07,711
-Really?
-You looked good out there.

1199
01:25:10,911 --> 01:25:13,015
What? Tam-Tam, what's that?

1200
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:15,449
Shit!

1201
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:21,629
-lt's all right. It's all right, Tam-Tam.
-Pass the ball, girls. Pass it! Pass that ball.

1202
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:23,526
Lisa!

1203
01:25:30,765 --> 01:25:33,570
-Get back, get back.
-Back it up!

1204
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:37,140
Tamra, pull the screen!

1205
01:25:37,204 --> 01:25:38,907
-God... God damn it!
-Watch it.

1206
01:25:38,973 --> 01:25:40,175
God damn it!

1207
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:43,013
-l'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

1208
01:25:43,077 --> 01:25:44,847
-Focus, Tamra!
-Tamra!

1209
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:49,453
-Tell them to drive it. Drive it. Drive it!
-Okay, drive it! Drive it!

1210
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:52,557
Okay! Let's go, Chargers. Move that ball.

1211
01:25:53,854 --> 01:25:55,423
Take the three!

1212
01:25:57,091 --> 01:26:01,900
Yeah! Chargers! Chargers!
Chargers! Chargers!

1213
01:26:03,464 --> 01:26:04,934
-Tamra...
-Rebound!

1214
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:07,303
-Pass the ball.

1216
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,283
-Wendy, hands up! Hands up!
-You gotta be kidding me!

1217
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:22,284
-Timeout! Timeout!
-Bill...

1218
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:23,952
Call a timeout. Call a timeout.

1219
01:26:24,018 --> 01:26:26,590
-Call a timeout.
-lt's over. Look over your shoulder.

1220
01:26:28,122 --> 01:26:29,224
Bill...

1221
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:33,565
Terry, you're killing me, man.
Just let me stay.

1222
01:26:33,628 --> 01:26:36,065
-lt's that simple. All you got...
-l can't let you stay, you know that.

1223
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,200
-Come on, man!
-We're not gonna do this here.

1224
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:39,533
-Come on.
-Go.

1225
01:26:39,767 --> 01:26:40,935
lt's almost over. Let me just stay.

1226
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:42,436
Come on.

1227
01:26:42,503 --> 01:26:44,875
Girls, l need a better second half
from you girls. You understand?

1228
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:47,009
-Please.
-Kathy, l want you to stay in control,

1229
01:26:47,074 --> 01:26:48,744
-you understand me? Tamra...
-Please, sir.

1230
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:51,046
Tamra, what's going on? You gotta focus!

1231
01:26:51,112 --> 01:26:53,917
-Focus!
-Thank you. Thank you. Good move.

1232
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:19,407
Fuck!

1233
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:22,712
You guys know where there's a phone?
A phone booth?

1234
01:27:22,778 --> 01:27:24,147
Down the hall, to the right.

1235
01:27:43,264 --> 01:27:44,265
Hello?

1236
01:27:44,331 --> 01:27:49,474
Hey! Tell Tamra to guard that girl closer.
What the hell's going on?

1237
01:27:50,504 --> 01:27:51,974
Bill? Where are you?

1238
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:55,478
Never mind where l am!
Tell Tamra to play tighter defense,

1239
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:58,282
and tell everyone to pass the ball more!

1240
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,881
Timeout!

1241
01:28:01,282 --> 01:28:03,954
Hello? Hello?

1242
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:09,327
Bill just called. He's watching,
and he's not happy with what he's seeing.

1243
01:28:10,524 --> 01:28:12,862
Tamra, you need to play tighter defense.

1244
01:28:14,028 --> 01:28:17,567
You're making it too easy
for that girl to score on you,

1245
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,203
and everyone needs to pass the ball more.

1246
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:22,939
-Where is he?
-l have no idea.

1247
01:28:26,106 --> 01:28:28,477
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1248
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:43,091
Call a timeout!

1249
01:28:43,157 --> 01:28:46,129
-Call a timeout! Call a timeout.
-Timeout.

1250
01:28:46,193 --> 01:28:48,397
Ask Tamra what the hell is going on!

1251
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,701
He wants to know what's going on.

1252
01:28:50,765 --> 01:28:52,200
Why is she letting that girl score
all over her?

1253
01:28:52,266 --> 01:28:54,203
Why aren't you guarding that girl more?

1254
01:29:02,943 --> 01:29:04,713
ls something wrong?

1255
01:29:05,814 --> 01:29:07,817
What's going on? What's going on?

1256
01:29:08,717 --> 01:29:10,619
l'm getting this vibe.

1257
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:17,729
See, l feel funny around her,
and l feel something.

1258
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:19,327
Talk to me. What's happening?

1259
01:29:22,731 --> 01:29:24,333
She's feeling this vibe.

1260
01:29:24,398 --> 01:29:26,602
What? What do you mean a vibe?
What's a vibe? What do you mean?

1261
01:29:27,101 --> 01:29:28,904
She thinks she might have a crush on her.

1262
01:29:32,306 --> 01:29:35,545
Okay. All right, well, then,
if that's the only problem,

1263
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:39,717
tell her to switch opponents with Kathy,
that's all. Just tell her to...

1264
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:41,683
Good luck with that.

1265
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:46,191
-Please deposit 25 cents.
-Man! Come on!

1266
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:55,029
Hey.

1267
01:29:57,998 --> 01:30:00,903
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

1268
01:30:02,736 --> 01:30:04,206
What am l doing here?

1269
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,144
Yeah, l guess this looks pretty weird, huh?

1270
01:30:12,847 --> 01:30:15,585
You played a hell of game the other day.

1271
01:30:17,017 --> 01:30:18,219
Thanks.

1272
01:30:19,153 --> 01:30:21,524
How's your algebra coming along?

1273
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,592
lt's okay.

1274
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,166
You have any change or anything?
You wouldn't happen to have a quarter?

1275
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,365
Here.

1276
01:30:37,571 --> 01:30:38,773
Thanks.

1277
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:43,912
Hey, Molly,

1278
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,952
-l'm really sorry about...
-The game's almost over.

1279
01:30:50,919 --> 01:30:52,021
Okay.

1280
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:05,135
Call a timeout as soon as you can, okay?

1281
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,636
-Where are you?
-l'm around.

1282
01:31:07,701 --> 01:31:09,438
Wait a minute! You!

1283
01:31:10,972 --> 01:31:12,774
Timeout!

1284
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:14,508
Put me on speakerphone.

1285
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:15,677
Okay.

1286
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:18,380
He's at the door!

1287
01:31:18,913 --> 01:31:22,252
Now, listen to me carefully.
Look нn each other's eyes.

1288
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:24,286
And you know that feeling
you're feeling right now?

1289
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:26,354
lt isn't gonna get better than that.

1290
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,361
So, Kathy, you've got one
of the best jump shots l've ever seen.

1291
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:33,263
lt's beautiful, just keep firing them up there,
okay, kid?

1292
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:37,334
And if they start to double-team her,
Look for Wendy and Lisa, okay?

1293
01:31:37,398 --> 01:31:40,237
Because they can hit everything they take
from here on out.

1294
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:43,606
And, Tamra, l'm counting on you
to get those rebounds.

1295
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,507
-Hey!
-No!

1296
01:31:46,573 --> 01:31:48,009
l don't want them getting
any second chances.

1297
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:49,076
Yeah, got it.

1298
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:53,149
Abbie, you're the leader on the court.
You got great instincts.

1299
01:31:53,213 --> 01:31:56,385
-Trust them, use them. Don't lose your cool.
-Got it.
