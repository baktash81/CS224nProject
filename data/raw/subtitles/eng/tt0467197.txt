1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,299


3
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,903
<i>I believe in pain.</i>

4
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,587
<i>I believe in fear.</i>

5
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,723
<i>I believe in death.</i>

6
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,124
<i>There's an army of bodies under this river.</i>

7
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:00,606
<i>Criminals. People who ran out of time.</i>

8
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,091
<i>Out of friends.</i>

9
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,866
<i>Next time they drag this river</i>

10
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:14,788
<i>they will find me on the bottom with the rest of them.</i>

11
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,086
<i>And there won't be anyone left to say I was different.</i>

12
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,809
<i>I could feel the dead down there.
Just below my feet.</i>

13
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,811
<i>Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own.</i>

14
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,827
<i>It was an easy mistake to make.</i>

15
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:53,069


16
00:01:54,559 --> 00:02:00,776


17
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,105
All the cold investigations in the city are collected up
and delivered over here to us.

18
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,336
And we call each of the witnesses 

19
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,266
to see if they have anything to add to their original statements.

20
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,542
And if they can't?

21
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,966
Then we send the file back to the original precinct for follow-up.

22
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,458
Don't get your hopes up though.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,671


24
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:29,312
This is the cold case office.

25
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,586
Once you've been through the file and come up empty, you bring it here.

26
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,842
Max here handles all our files.

27
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,205
If it hits his desk, the case is officially dead.

28
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,104
So what if there's no phone number for a witness?

29
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:45,215
- Should I do a follow-up in person?
- No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.

30
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:46,544
I don't understand. Then how...

31
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:50,396
How am I supposed to solve the unsolvable murder mystery and redeem myself?

32
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,770
- Man, internal affairs...
- Stop!

33
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:56,348
Alright, trust me! There's a tragic story behind

34
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,133
why I'm standing here giving you this tour.

35
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:01,174
We all did something, so just save it.

36
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:10,756
What do you say, we grab a beer after work or something?

37
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,498
- So what's his story?
- There is none.

38
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,439
- But back there you said...
- Listen!

39
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,527
His wife and kid were murdered.

40
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,590
They never found the guy. That's the story.

41
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,617
Remember when you were a kid

42
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:35,604
 and you'd hold your breath when you went past the graveyard?

43
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,358
Just leave that man alone.

44
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,309


45
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,109


46
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:52,589


47
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:13,709


48
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,660
Yo, homey. That's a really nice watch.

49
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,941
Kinda reminds me of the one I lost.

50
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,380
You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago.

51
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,234
Ask Doug. He was there with you.

52
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,082
You follow us, asshole?

53
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:45,680
No.

54
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:49,079
I'm only following you.

55
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,843
Oh hell no. You a cop or something?

56
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,640
Not tonight.

57
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:58,877
That's too bad.

58
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,995
Now go get my watch!

59
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,865
Come on, Doug. Come get his watch!

60
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,732
I guess this ain't your lucky day, now is it?

61
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,772


62
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,373
Watch over me!
Watch over me!

63
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,634
Open your eyes! Now!

64
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,381
Have you ever seen this woman?

65
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:57,381
No.

66
00:06:57,382 --> 00:07:00,745
You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey 
with William Preston six months ago.

67
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,109
Bill's dead.

68
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,269
Why the hell do you think I'm talking to you?

69
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:07,132
Did you ever hear anyone say anything about this woman?

70
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,070
Bill died because their wings couldn't lift him up.

71
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:10,768
No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.

72
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:11,861
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,074
Their wings are golden, the feathers only look black...

74
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,164


75
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,129
- Hey buddy!
- Man, I told you not to come here.

76
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,127
William Preston was a dead end.

77
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,091
I am done helping you, Max.

78
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,681
I paid my debt to society, you know.

79
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,823
I've cooperated enough, man.

80
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,054
Okay?

81
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,936
- What's going on in there?
- Well, it's a dinner party.

82
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,557
I'm a little offended I didn't get my invitation.

83
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:32,783
Well, I didn't send out invitations...

84
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,828
Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.

85
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:36,838
I did.

86
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,390
Doug only wanted to talk about birds or something. He was a whack job.

87
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,226
- Now I need a new name.
- I'm out of ideas then.

88
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,332
- Hey baby.
- Not now, bitch.

89
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:46,865
Look! OK?

90
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,966
I told you I don't know those kinds of people now.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,025
- I moved up in the world, Max.
- I can see that.

92
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,809
This is a dinner party. Alright, these are my friends.

93
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,005
You remember friends?

94
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,951
Listen! If you don't give me a new name, I'm gonna start frisking everyone of your friends.

95
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,480
Three years on the street is a lifetime, man.

96
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,676
Whoever you're looking for, there's no way they are still out there.

97
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,244
You're chasing ghosts, Max.

98
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:12,852
If you tried sleeping once in a while, you could see that for yourself.

99
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,143
I thought I knew all of Trevor's friends.

100
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,619
Max, Natasha.
Natasha, Max.

101
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,238
Jesus Christ!

102
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,356
Got a light?

103
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,275
I don't smoke.

104
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,457
Interesting.

105
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,991
- What?
- Your tattoo. That's interesting.

106
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,942
Oh, thank you.

107
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:40,587


108
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,488
- Shit!
- What?

109
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:53,962


110
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,498
What are you doing here?

111
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,289
Come with me!

112
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,027
- Hey!
- Mind your own business!

113
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,516
You have no rights to be here.

114
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,797
I'm clean.

115
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,050
I'm not doing anything wrong.

116
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:11,025
Why don't you relax?

117
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:13,580
It's a party. Have a drink!

118
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:18,493
These are new friends.

119
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,626
I don't see the others anymore!

120
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,265
He's a cop.

121
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,699
How much trouble can I get in ?

122
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:38,811
My sister!

123
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:40,927
Sort of a bitch.

124
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,023
Max!

125
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:45,628
You have to go! Now!

126
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:48,095
I need to ask her something first.

127
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,108
Oh Jesus Christ!

128
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:08,420
There you are.

129
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:10,373
Where did you go?

130
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,421
Take me somewhere. I'll tell you.

131
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:19,218
See you around, Lupino.

132
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:12,874
Easy!

133
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,116
You just move in?

134
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:21,250
So we're somewhere.

135
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:25,232
What was going on in that room back there?

136
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,069
Hey!

137
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:35,671
Who was the guy with the tattoos on his face?

138
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,334
Fine. What was her name?

139
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:53,845
What are you talking about? Who?

140
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:57,417
The girl from the boring story you wanna tell me.

141
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,615
The one that ends with you living here.

142
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:01,254
Very sad.

143
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,800
I tell you what. Call me by her name!

144
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:11,767
That way you can make love to her just like she never left you.

145
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:17,169
Oh Max! I miss you.

146
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,496
Get out!

147
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:24,395
Excuse me?

148
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,858
I said get out now!

149
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:34,815
- You're kicking me out of your bed?
- Yeah. Get your shit and get out!

150
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,285
This is Owen. Leave a message!

151
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:08,539
Owen, it's Natasha.

152
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:12,838
Where is Lupino?
I need some more stuff.

153
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,757
Yeah, call me, OK?

154
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:09,913
No! No! Not yet! Not yet!

155
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,190
- What?
- Jump in, will ya?

156
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:21,420
- Where are we going?
- I need you to look at something.

157
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:47,477
- What happened to them?
- Her. Just one.

158
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:53,863
I don't believe it.

159
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:58,979
What, are you two back together again? You kissed and made up?

160
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,626
Where are we on the weapon?

161
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:02,661
We are nowhere yet.

162
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:05,280
Looks like a blade, but...

163
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,451
Too much blood for that to be right.

164
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,643
Hey, o'Brian.

165
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:15,022
- Why did you show me this?
- We found this here.

166
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:19,640
Do you know her, Max?

167
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,777
Natasha.

168
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:43,285
Let's take a ride.

169
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,445


170
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,489
- What are we doing here?
- We're getting a beer, right?

171
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,514
You'd rather do this in the streets?

172
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,169
Fine!

173
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:21,490
You were with the victim last night. Your wallet was found in the alley.

174
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,523
If you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna send somebody who doesn't know you 

175
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:26,737
and won't care about your side of the story.

176
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,264
I didn't kill her, so I don't need a side.

177
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:32,508
What's going on, Max? What are you mixed up in, man? You can talk to me.

178
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,753
You know what they think about you at the force already, right?

179
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,625
Cause you hear all the questions I get about my old partner.

180
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:44,343
Good thing you got my back then, huh?

181
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:46,843
What's that supposed to mean?

182
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,689
It means that when you follow up on an unsolved murder,

183
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,400
I don't have much hope for that girl in the alley.

184
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:51,776
Is that what you think?

185
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,282
That I am working Michelle's case?

186
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:00,179
I did everything! Everything!

187
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:03,211
He's still out there somewhere. One of them is still out there.

188
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,165
That's everything, alright?

189
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,795
We're done here.

190
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,642
Come on! Max!

191
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:15,448


192
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:19,870


193
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:27,549


194
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,549


195
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:10,488
- Detective Max Payne.
- Shit.

196
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,867
Leave a message.

197
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:16,235
Max, it's me, Alex.

198
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,090
Miss Sax?

199
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,367
Sorry for your loss.

200
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,712
And...

201
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,254
I pulled her cellphone log.

202
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:34,082
Last call was to an Owen Green.

203
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:37,854
Called him twice.

204
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:56,161


205
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:01,903
Max, it's me, Alex.

206
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:03,888
You're not gonna believe this but I think there's a connection

207
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,894
between that girl in the alley and Michelle's murder.

208
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,868
I'm heading over to your apartment right now.

209
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,792
Alex? You in here?

210
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,110
Alex?

211
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,498
Alex?

212
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:16,663
Alex?

213
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,623
The E.R. doctors old man was a patrolman in the 45th.

214
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,423
Got you on a quiet floor.

215
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,774
BB.

216
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,616
- Where am I?
- Saint Mary's.

217
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,285
Came in looking pretty bad, Max.

218
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:01,427
What happened?

219
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,525
I don't... Alex...

220
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:10,248
When dispatch couldn't raise him,

221
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,251
they found out from Christa where he'd gone.

222
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,099
First unit got to you in time.

223
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,855
But Alex was...

224
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:20,963
Alex was dead.

225
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,141
I got six shots off.

226
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,456
I hit something - someone. You gotta check the hospitals.

227
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:32,356
I'm not a cop anymore, Max. I came to see about you.

228
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:36,587
He wanted to tell me something.

229
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:38,359
Listen!

230
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:42,052
Anything you can remember will help. They got nothing for leads.

231
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:45,287
The whole force has you pegged as the prime suspect.

232
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,118
And you told them where to find me?

233
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,374
Wake starts in an hour.

234
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,641
I'll pass that along.

235
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,721
- What do you think you're doing?
- Paying my respects.

236
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,601
Not like that, alright?

237
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,620
I should have a clean shirt for you at the office.

238
00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:06,965
It's on the way.

239
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:14,666


240
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,270


241
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:31,872


242
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,163


243
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,353
Mister Hensley?
There you go.

244
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,186
When did they move in here?

245
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:52,304
- I guess we got the building last year.
- We?

246
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:53,724
Sorry.

247
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,383
Used to be a habit.

248
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:05,128


249
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:11,848
- Good morning, Spike.
- Good morning, Mister Hensley.

250
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:14,523
You know the drill, sir. Sign in the guest, please.

251
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,442
Oh my god.

252
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,617
Max!

253
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,416
Miss Horne.

254
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:29,201
How have you been?

255
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:31,301
Fine, thanks.

256
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:34,202
I hope you know you can always call me.

257
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,460
Please, Max. If there is ever anything we can...

258
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:39,665
I know. I've been meaning to. I got the cards, too.

259
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:43,057
She was such a bright light in this company.

260
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:49,184
I'm not making any guarantees that any of these will fit.

261
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:54,811
I saved one of those for you.

262
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,266
Third page from the back.

263
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,464
They set up a scholarship in her name.

264
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:03,437
Kept coming to me for suggestions about what she might want.

265
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,238
I said art.

266
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,772
She liked art, right?

267
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:12,606
They knew we were close. Thought I was family.

268
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,296
It's a nice thing, a scholarship. Good way to remember somebody.

269
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:19,920
Hey Joe!

270
00:27:20,418 --> 00:27:22,831
Max, you remember Joe, right?

271
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:24,192
Hey!

272
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,816
You care picking up some overtime?

273
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,193
I'd think twice about that. I hear the boss is a real asshole.

274
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:33,971
Now that he's out of security, we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.

275
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:35,678
They still pay me like the janitor.

276
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:39,762
She's looking for you. Just tried me in my office, dude.

277
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:43,248


278
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah?

279
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:12,390
Christa.

280
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:19,147
Jesus.

281
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,776
All it would have taken was one word from you.

282
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:28,220
To give Alex some peace.

283
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,888
Are you happy now, Max?

284
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:38,470
You made him think he hadn't done enough.

285
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:42,616
What have you done, Max?

286
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:46,015
What has Max Payne done?

287
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:49,959
Except for bring misery

288
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,740
to everyone who ever cared for him?

289
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,610
Now please get out of my house!

290
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:01,825
Please just go!

291
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:19,794
Ah jeez. Watch out for this prick!

292
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:22,413
Detective Max Payne?

293
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,545
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs. I need you to come with me.

294
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,115
Now?

295
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:29,618
Yeah now.

296
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,849


297
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:33,243
How'd the girl have your wallet?

298
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,198
She stole it.

299
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,417
What do you mean? Stole like...

300
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,549
Picked your pocket?

301
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,058
How was it you know each other?

302
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:46,382
We met through a friend.

303
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:51,767
Trevor Duncan. He's your friend?

304
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,078
- Yes.
- That's classy.

305
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:57,889
You know what Trevor does for a living, I assume?

306
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,640
He used to snitch for me.

307
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:04,479
Christ!

308
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,156
Tell me something, Max!

309
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:10,600
What does a glorified file clerk still need a snitch for?

310
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,769
So you'd piss in a cup for us, right?

311
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,349
You just said the magic words.

312
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,272
Call once you hear from the union lawyer.

313
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:23,678
You and Detective Balder haven't worked together since your reassignment.

314
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,529
What made you get back in touch?

315
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,890
- He wanted to talk.
- And?

316
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:32,887
Hey asshole!

317
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:34,610
I got two bodies in ten body bags 

318
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:36,444
and you were the last person to see either one.

319
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,051
Yeah, and some of that blood is mine.

320
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,220
Good luck with your case.

321
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,738
Nice work, detective.

322
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:48,487
Look, if you're really his friend, then talk to him.

323
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,127


324
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,027
Well, let's hope that felt good.

325
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:01,864
Makes you look guilty. You understand that, right?

326
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,776
Not just Alex's unit thinks you're the guy.

327
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:07,968
You need friends on the force right now.

328
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:10,523
There's only so much I can do from the outside.

329
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,856


330
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,043
Where are you going?

331
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,496


332
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:19,741


333
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:23,521


334
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,898


335
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:30,861
Where do you think you're going, asshole?

336
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,390


337
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,232
The detective in that office was killed.

338
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,045
Get back here, asshole!
Where do you think you are going?

339
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,071
Stop right there! What are you gonna do in there?

340
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,788
Back up! Make a hole!
Back up, goddammit! Make a hole!

341
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,058
Open up, Max!

342
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:59,719
Open up the goddamn door, Max!

343
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,845
Open up!

344
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,380


345
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,941
Open the door!

346
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:14,213


347
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:16,898


348
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:19,777


349
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:22,357


350
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:30,996


351
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,308
Son of a bitch!

352
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,876
Hey buddy.

353
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,514
Where is he?

354
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:58,077
For god's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze to death.

355
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:00,769
- Why don't you come inside?
- Alex knew something about Michelle.

356
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,111
Something new.

357
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:04,079
Don't you think he would have told you if he had something like that?

358
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:05,774
He was trying to the night he was killed.

359
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,424
Whatever was in that room that night with us.

360
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,280
What exactly do you think you're looking for?

361
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:11,102
- Just forget it, alright?
- Max, talk to me!

362
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:12,420
Max!

363
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:14,810
Now where are you going?

364
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:51,235
Drop it, shithead!

365
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,416
Take it easy!

366
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:00,082
Remove your back-up piece with your left hand!

367
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:09,179
That's it.

368
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:10,829
- Kneel down!
- What?

369
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,156
Kneel the fuck down!

370
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:15,562
Shit!

371
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,113
We need to talk about my sister.

372
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:32,326
Look, my partner was killed, too. We're both looking for the same person.

373
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,009
Yeah, you!

374
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:41,602
Who's Owen Green?

375
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,214
- How did you get that name?
- Natasha called...

376
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:47,440
Don't say her name!

377
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,307
I heard her call him, OK?

378
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,484
Owen was probably the last person who saw her alive.

379
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:53,157
Yeah?

380
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,151
Except for the guy that left his wallet lying by the body.

381
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:59,003
Does that sound like something a homicide cop gets wrong?

382
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:00,159
Whoever killed your sister

383
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:01,718
probably did the same thing to my partner an maybe my...

384
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,685
Look, you wanna help, help me find Owen Green!

385
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,183
Right here.

386
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:28,344
Green is on the top floor.

387
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:34,539
You know what I do for a living. You try anything and I'll kill you.

388
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,099
- Who's this guy.
Some jerk my sister used to know.

389
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,784
Owen. Owen, open up!

390
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,108
Owen.

391
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:34,858
Owen.

392
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:40,872
Hey!

393
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,795
Owen.

394
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:49,821
Hey, Owen.

395
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,617
They're coming.

396
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,162
Owen, look at me!

397
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:03,296
I know Natasha called you. You know what happened to her?

398
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:06,322
She's gone.

399
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:11,352
They took her.

400
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,221
Owen?

401
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:18,851
Owen, just relax.

402
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,538
They took her upon their wings.

403
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:24,941
They took her.

404
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,650
Owen?

405
00:37:55,943 --> 00:38:01,704


406
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:03,833
Jesus!

407
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,430
You know it isn't anything new.

408
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:28,235
People jump out of windows. They go crazy for no reason.

409
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,471
It just happens.

410
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:35,939
Natasha got all her work done here.

411
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:48,355
I'll have to call back, OK?

412
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:54,031
- Can I help you with something?
- Yeah.

413
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,879
What if I wanted this tattoo?

414
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,207
You in the Marine Corps?

415
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,751
- This one.
- What's it mean?

416
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:04,751
That's a Norse valkyrie.

417
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,633
Vikings used to wear them for protection.

418
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:10,451
Valkyries fly over the battlefield,

419
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,551
picking out the righteous dead.

420
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,346
They reward the people who draw first blood.

421
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:18,481
A soldier's angel.

422
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,666
In Norse mythology, the only way you get to go to heaven

423
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,909
is to die in violence.

424
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,226
You die in your sleep, you go to hell.

425
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,211
Protection from what?

426
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:38,907
- Huh?
- What do you mean "Huh"?

427
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,327
You said people get the tattos for protection.

428
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:42,466
What are they afraid of?

429
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:58,480
Please!

430
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,012
This is far enough.

431
00:41:35,988 --> 00:41:37,321
I need to speak with Lincoln.

432
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:50,629


433
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:01,432
Are you expecting company there, Lincoln?

434
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:03,129
Safe measures I know.

435
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:07,991
- I heard about your sister.
- Yeah?

436
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,145
You know anything about it?

437
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:12,847
She will not be the last.

438
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,743
What about the tattoos?

439
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:23,034
What would they mean? The wings?

440
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:26,067
He mocks them.

441
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:30,038
And what does that mean?

442
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:32,287
The devil is building his army.

443
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:35,715
Yeah?

444
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,893
Does this devil have a name?

445
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:41,933
Vinnie.

446
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:44,636
The one you are looking for is Lupino.

447
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:50,665
A place called Ragnarock.

448
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:53,326
It's an old club, east side.

449
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,051
Listen.

450
00:42:59,095 --> 00:43:00,869
You still got a thing with the cops, right?

451
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:05,503
See if they learn anything about a Detective Max Payne.

452
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,535
Max Payne?

453
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,907
- What?
- Max Payne, he's been hunting.

454
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:18,261
Three years of kicking down doors.

455
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:25,462
He's looking for something that god wants to stay hidden.

456
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:29,660
And that's what makes him even more dangerous.

457
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,772
Mona.

458
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,687
Stay away from Max Payne.

459
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,230
You don't wanna be near him when judgment day comes.

460
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:57,535
<i>They took her upon their wings.</i>

461
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:00,807
<i>Their wings are golden, the feathers only look black.</i>

462
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:06,569
<i>That's a Norse valkyrie. A soldier's angel.</i>

463
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,899
<i>She was such a bright light in this company.</i>

464
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:16,102


465
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,781
- What is it? What's going on?
- Coffee?

466
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:48,459
It isn't that I've been missing something.

467
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:52,982
- There's something they been missing.
- So?

468
00:45:53,202 --> 00:45:54,476
BB, what do you mean "so"?

469
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:57,616
And what would this company want with her art papers?

470
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,332
- I don't know.
- Well, who then?

471
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,832
Our old supervisor, what is his name?

472
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:02,741
Max.

473
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:04,725
- Max, this is enough.
- What is his name?

474
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:07,232
Colvin. John Colvin. Is he still around?

475
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,243
- Hold on, Max!
- BB.

476
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:11,385
Is he still working for the company?

477
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,441
Jason Colvin.

478
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:20,569
- The guy's name is Jason.
- Thank you.

479
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,432
<i>This is Detective Bravura.</i>

480
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:39,039
<i>Detective, I need to speak with you about Max.</i>

481
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:41,711
<i>Right away, please. It's urgent.</i>

482
00:46:44,073 --> 00:46:46,492
Detective, thanks for seeing me in my office.

483
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:48,912
I need to explain what happened to Max.

484
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:51,485
The file can't tell you everything.

485
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,483
Unless you think that's all you need to know about Max.

486
00:46:58,563 --> 00:47:01,096
<i>Can't tell you how beautiful Michelle was.</i>

487
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,374
<i>How happy they were together.</i>

488
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:08,937
<i>Can't tell you how the baby lokked just like her.</i>

489
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:15,888
<i>It started out as a robbery.</i>

490
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:21,852
<i>That day, the perps were out for something more.</i>

491
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:05,402
Michelle?

492
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:08,328
Michelle?

493
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:09,588
Michelle?

494
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:12,446
Michelle?

495
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:21,444
It's OK. They're angels now.

496
00:49:17,097 --> 00:49:20,532
<i>He was maybe ten minutes too late.</i>

497
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,349
<i>That's all.</i>

498
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:29,701
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

499
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:44,052
We looked everywhere for the third guy.

500
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:45,727
But there was nothing to go on.

501
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,817
Max transferred to Cold Case.

502
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:51,762
Working leads that went nowhere.

503
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:56,137


504
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,882
Of course not.

505
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:02,662
Understand!

506
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:05,800
This is my old partner's kid.

507
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:08,557
He's family.

508
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,311
You gotta help him here.

509
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:15,837
You should hear the kind of things Max is saying. None of it makes any sense.

510
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,702
He has gotten in his head that someone here at the company is responsible.

511
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:23,375
I'm worried he's gonna

512
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:25,869
get into another situation before I can convince him to come in.

513
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,058
- So you really think he's...
- I think you need to find him.

514
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:03,845
What is it, Jason?

515
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:14,661


516
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:23,676
Is this a threat?

517
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:26,372
No.

518
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:27,906
No.

519
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,728
I just thought you should be aware.

520
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:34,492
Just take care of it, Jason.

521
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,618
There is someone in your office.

522
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:13,935
It's a detective.

523
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:29,750
This your daughter?

524
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:33,472
Yes, it is.

525
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:35,763
Three years old.

526
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:37,252
She's beautiful.

527
00:52:38,026 --> 00:52:41,536
- Is there something I can help you with, detective?
- I don't know yet.

528
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:46,914
Maybe if you told me what this was about...

529
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:51,619
It's a homicide. Multiple homicides.

530
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:55,756
I didn't get your name.

531
00:52:58,145 --> 00:52:59,224
Max Payne.

532
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:04,148
Sorry, didn't recognize you.

533
00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:05,815
It's OK.

534
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,174
What can you tell me about what Michelle was working on?

535
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,537
Right before she died.

536
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,033
Routine projects.

537
00:53:24,987 --> 00:53:26,547
Nothing really out of the ordinary.

538
00:53:32,716 --> 00:53:36,090
Look, it's really hard to be specific that long ago.

539
00:53:37,273 --> 00:53:38,798
Well, can you look it up?

540
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,991
I don't know how I would, really.

541
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:47,439
You know, that far back...

542
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:51,496
Any documents that we had would be gone and...

543
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:57,214
I'm not sure of any other way.

544
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,076
So there's just no trace of her?

545
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:01,837
It's nothing personal. We just...

546
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:06,144
We can't keep safe everything.

547
00:54:06,748 --> 00:54:09,825
- You need to make a call?
- Maybe I should.

548
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:13,232
A beautiful office you have.

549
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:17,685
Jackie, hi...

550
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:21,873
- What do you know?
- Wait!

551
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,154
I need to talk to somebody about a woman that used to work here.

552
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:27,787
You can have a seat over there.

553
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:34,150
Mister Colvin?

554
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:36,196
- You're lying to me. Why?
- I'm not.

555
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,354
Mister Colvin?

556
00:54:39,386 --> 00:54:40,723
Tell me what happened to Michelle!

557
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:41,921
I don't know.

558
00:54:41,922 --> 00:54:43,263
Mister Colvin, are you OK?

559
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:44,839
Jackie?

560
00:54:44,921 --> 00:54:46,829
Mister Colvin, it's Jackie. I can hear you.

561
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:49,037
Are you alright?

562
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:53,776
What was she working on?

563
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:54,866
I don't know.

564
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:58,399
I was in charge of a different project. There was a government contract.

565
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:01,388
- What did it have to do with Michelle?
- Nothing, she was just...

566
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:07,469
- Security.
- Can I speak to BB please?

567
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:10,321
Yeah!

568
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:11,853
BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.

569
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:12,666
What?

570
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,798
Shall I call the other guys?

571
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,245
No, no, no. I'll call.

572
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,336
Hurry, please!

573
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,377
It was a military operation.

574
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:29,015
It was something to make soldiers more aggressive in combat.

575
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:31,078
It was a disaster.

576
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:36,130
In only one percent, it made them invincible, alright?

577
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:38,555
The rest suffered horrible hallucinations.

578
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:39,757
Devils and demons.

579
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,479
It drove them insane.

580
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:46,836
The effects weren't controlable.

581
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:51,781
And this stuff was so addictive, we couldn't even guarantee the safety of our own scientists.

582
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:54,279
We had to shut it down.

583
00:55:54,677 --> 00:55:56,900
The test subjects had taken to follow them home.

584
00:55:57,861 --> 00:55:59,871
They'd kill them just for an extra dose.

585
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:03,962
- Is that what happened to Michelle?
- No.

586
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,511
What do you mean "no"? What hapenend to her then?

587
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:22,538
She didn't even know what was coming for her.

588
00:56:23,407 --> 00:56:25,759
Mister Colvin, I called security and they're on their way.

589
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:29,525
I will tell you what happened. You gotta get me out of her though.

590
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:31,265
- Right now.
- What are you talking about?

591
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:33,489
I will confess to everything, but you gotta...

592
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,913
That's not good enough. You tell me what happened to her right now.

593
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:38,304
She was killed because of the drug.

594
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,640
The envelope. Bring it with us! Everything, it's all in there.

595
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:46,271
Please, you gotta protect me from them.

596
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,333
Who are you talking about?

597
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,856
The man who killed your wife.

598
00:56:51,937 --> 00:56:52,993
Get the envelope!

599
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:54,610
Get it!

600
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:56,579
Let's go!

601
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,553
All down! NYPD!

602
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,460


603
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:46,220
<i>Central dispatch.</i>

604
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,395
This is Jim Bravura, IA.

605
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:49,380
What unit is responding to the Aesir call?

606
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:56,880
The Aesir building. You mean nobody has called anything in yet?

607
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:57,970
<i>Would you like to report something?</i>

608
00:57:57,987 --> 00:57:58,993
Hell yes, I'd like to report something.

609
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,810
We have machine gun fire in Midtown.

610
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,476
Put your hands up!

611
00:59:00,981 --> 00:59:03,080
- You need to come in now.
- Not a chance.

612
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,539
- Colvin knew.

613
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:10,038
Take it easy, Max! We'll talk about this right now.

614
00:59:23,157 --> 00:59:24,336
Great job, boys.

615
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,953
You see what you did? You let him get away.

616
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:27,535
Everybody's gonna get a medal for this.

617
00:59:27,569 --> 00:59:29,036
Great, damn.

618
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:38,567
I'm at the office. I'll call you back.

619
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:10,146
<i>And will forever give them the combat edge in conflicts of the future.</i>

620
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,107
<i>Valkyr. 100% effective.</i>

621
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,422
<i>100% combat tested.</i>

622
01:00:15,456 --> 01:00:18,618
<i>The new weapon in the war on terror.</i>

623
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:21,363
<i>Valkyr, the strength of freedom.</i>

624
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:24,918
<i>Valkyr, winning the war on terror.</i>

625
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:26,299
You need to see this.

626
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,313
<i>From the dawn of time</i>

627
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:34,846
<i>great generals have always known the one fundamental truth of warfare.</i>

628
01:00:34,879 --> 01:00:37,410
<i>Morale wins battles.</i>

629
01:00:37,636 --> 01:00:41,777
<i>Thanks to the breakthroughs made by Aesir Pharmaceuticals</i>

630
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:45,918
<i>the military of tomorrow will be able to unlock the limitless potential</i>

631
01:00:45,952 --> 01:00:47,807
<i>insde every soldier.</i>

632
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:52,939
<i>Introducing Valkyr, the strength of freedom.</i>

633
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,585
That's what this is about? A drug?

634
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,760
<i>How is your experience of combat improved</i>

635
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:09,824
<i>since taking the drug Valkyr?</i>

636
01:01:10,326 --> 01:01:12,440
<i>Well, I'm never scared for starters.</i>

637
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:14,388
<i>Describe to me, if you will,</i>

638
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,468
<i>how is Valkyr winning the war on terror?</i>

639
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:20,841
<i>You face down a group of insurgents and instead of fear</i>

640
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:25,483
<i>you're filled with peace, I guess.</i>

641
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:28,061
<i>It's like something's watching over you from above.</i>

642
01:01:28,094 --> 01:01:30,205
<i>You feel like you have wings.</i>

643
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,925
<i>So when you say you feel stronger, more secure, more capable.</i>

644
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:37,914
<i>Definitely. It's just whatever it takes to win the war out there.</i>

645
01:01:38,535 --> 01:01:41,278
<i>You feel indestructible. Nothing can stop me.</i>

646
01:01:41,995 --> 01:01:43,423
<i>I can face anything.</i>

647
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,489
<i>Have you noticed any side effects?</i>

648
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:51,567
<i>I can only speak for myself and no.</i>

649
01:01:52,228 --> 01:01:53,284
<i>I apologize.</i>

650
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:56,967
<i>- You wanna do it again?
- No, we're good.</i>

651
01:02:01,987 --> 01:02:03,319
Killed my wife.

652
01:02:05,724 --> 01:02:06,878


653
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:11,481
He's in an old club called Ragnarock.

654
01:02:15,213 --> 01:02:18,228
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

655
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:29,753
Forget it, Max! You go there, you die.

656
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:35,870
You have my help with anything else, but not to go in there.

657
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:37,073
Yeah, you keep it.

658
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:43,192
You don't wanna make it out alive.

659
01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:49,300
Do you think that if he puts you out of your misery, you'll be with them again?

660
01:02:50,593 --> 01:02:52,586
Yeah, I hope that's really the way it works.

661
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:21,935


662
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,723
<i>Unit six, Lupino is secure.</i>

663
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:49,229
Do you hear them coming?

664
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:56,056
We'll see which one of us they're flying for.

665
01:08:57,878 --> 01:08:59,902
We'll see which one of us they love best.

666
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:04,209


667
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:07,899
Angels.

668
01:09:09,804 --> 01:09:11,454
The angels are not done with you yet.

669
01:09:28,737 --> 01:09:30,198
BB?

670
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,837
What's going on here, BB?

671
01:09:38,803 --> 01:09:39,859
Let's go!

672
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:42,930
Let's get out of here!

673
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,672
BB, BB, what's going on here?

674
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,400
BB, I looked at Lupino. He didn't know who I was.

675
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:57,623
What are you doing here?

676
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:03,866
- Now?
- No, not yet.

677
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:05,833
Cuff him!

678
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:15,640
What was I supposed to do? Michelle kept nosing around.

679
01:10:16,089 --> 01:10:19,076
Some boxes from the dead project went missing.

680
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:22,451
She mentionned it to me without knowing what it really meant. I had to...

681
01:10:22,693 --> 01:10:24,747
I had to talk to her.

682
01:10:26,023 --> 01:10:28,649
Show her my side before she took it to someone else.

683
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:30,663
Before that night...

684
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,828
The things that went wrong for me seemed impossible to do anything about.

685
01:10:36,223 --> 01:10:38,606
Michelle was the first problem in my life 

686
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:40,589
small enough to reach out and stop.

687
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,499
Once that happened

688
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,979
I realized I could use the strength of my hands

689
01:10:47,012 --> 01:10:49,409
to keep one thing from being taken away from me.

690
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:55,154
At the time Michelle stopped screaming that night,

691
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,841
I'd learned the most amazing lesson.

692
01:10:59,862 --> 01:11:03,313
I could keep doing this my entire life.

693
01:11:05,655 --> 01:11:09,052
I was a new person that night.

694
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:11,734
And from there,

695
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:14,418
figuring out how to put the drug on the street,

696
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:16,906
how to make use of Lupino and the rest of them,

697
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,017
it was easy.

698
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,848
But only because of Michelle,

699
01:11:20,871 --> 01:11:23,492
the first problem I really solved for myself.

700
01:11:42,067 --> 01:11:43,123
OK, enough!

701
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,155
Enough of this shit.

702
01:11:45,988 --> 01:11:47,044
BB.

703
01:11:54,093 --> 01:11:55,870
It's not like we didn't see it coming.

704
01:11:57,175 --> 01:12:01,939
Sullen, withdrawn, Max just never seemed the same after the tragedy.

705
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,255
Grab me some of that rope!

706
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:09,308
It's a good thing your father didn't live to see it.

707
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:14,034
The great Bill Payne's only son.

708
01:12:16,661 --> 01:12:20,122
A strung-out junkie suicide.

709
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:23,784
It would have eaten him alive.

710
01:12:29,938 --> 01:12:30,338
Get him down!

711
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:55,651
Screw him!

712
01:12:56,477 --> 01:12:57,632
He'll freeze to death.

713
01:13:01,263 --> 01:13:02,319
Come on!

714
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:31,890
<i>Not yet, Max.</i>

715
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:00,297
Neville.

716
01:17:00,411 --> 01:17:01,643
What the hell is going on?

717
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,580
Why is half my force sitting here instead of being out on the street?

718
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,882
Under what authority...

719
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:09,744
I'm investigating the shooting of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin,

720
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:12,455
and the attempted murder of Detective Max Payne.

721
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,417
Really? I heard he took the first shot

722
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,299
and if I know the kind of men that I serve with 

723
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,004
I don't think that they're gonna contradict that.

724
01:17:18,037 --> 01:17:19,492
And what kind of men would that be?

725
01:17:19,525 --> 01:17:21,492
These are the real cops.

726
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:23,127
- No offense.
- None taken.

727
01:17:23,363 --> 01:17:27,100
Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a real cop.

728
01:17:27,595 --> 01:17:31,045
Detective, Jack Taliente, special agent, FBI.

729
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,275
Who are you?

730
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:39,413
Bravura called in the FBI.

731
01:17:40,628 --> 01:17:41,694
They are on their way.

732
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:46,988
For god's sake, come on!

733
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,298
Max is dead. They got nothing else.

734
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,866
Come on!

735
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:01,686
Calm down, Joe!

736
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:17,691
The car is waiting, sir.

737
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:35,292
Oh shit!

738
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,955
He's not dead. He's here.

739
01:18:39,376 --> 01:18:40,432
Bullshit.

740
01:18:49,952 --> 01:18:51,008
Where the hell is he?

741
01:18:54,976 --> 01:18:56,320


742
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:03,616


743
01:19:03,617 --> 01:19:06,496


744
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:08,908
Who are you calling?

745
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:14,741
It's late.

746
01:19:15,058 --> 01:19:17,077
I need you to send a helicopter to the roof.

747
01:19:17,332 --> 01:19:18,596
What are you talking about, BB?

748
01:19:18,911 --> 01:19:21,980
The Michelle Payne thing is coming back on us.

749
01:19:29,537 --> 01:19:31,745


750
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:34,433


751
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:49,168
Take some C4.

752
01:19:50,097 --> 01:19:52,215
Wire it, so he can't make it to the roof.

753
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,676
Are you nuts?

754
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:57,613
You saw him. You saw him, Joe.

755
01:19:57,897 --> 01:19:59,179
He's not gonna stop.

756
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,269
<i>We got multiple shots fired.</i>

757
01:20:27,303 --> 01:20:29,536
<i>We need back-up ASAP.</i>

758
01:20:48,482 --> 01:20:50,855
- Michelle?
<i>- Max.</i>

759
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,293
<i>Max.</i>

760
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:04,521
Max.

761
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:06,509
Max, come on!

762
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:11,641
Listen. I will hold them off for as long as I can, but you have to finish this.

763
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:15,248
Max, come on!

764
01:22:16,202 --> 01:22:17,257
Come on!

765
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:20,156
Help me! Take it!

766
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:24,505
Max, come on! Look at me!

767
01:22:27,504 --> 01:22:29,086
You're not done yet.

768
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:43,469


769
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,896


770
01:23:16,773 --> 01:23:18,004
Be careful with that thing!

771
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:20,314
Come on now, Mona!

772
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,365
I'm sure we can work something out.

773
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:34,132
BB.

774
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:02,742
<i>Detective Max Payne is in the line of fire.</i>

775
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:04,947
<i>Snipers will not take the shot.</i>

776
01:24:08,816 --> 01:24:09,566
Bravura.

777
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:11,625
Take Payne alive if there's anything left.

778
01:24:27,993 --> 01:24:29,401
Now I'm down, BB.

779
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:18,607
- Bravura, you alright?
- Get everybody upstairs now!

780
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:22,224
Guys, that's our cue. Division one, let's go right now!

781
01:25:22,258 --> 01:25:23,857
On the floor. Let's go!

782
01:25:30,784 --> 01:25:31,455
Where are you?

783
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:04,782
It's unbelievable. All that snow.

784
01:26:05,595 --> 01:26:07,830
I watch it end up being a beautiful day.

785
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:12,886
You want my confession first?

786
01:27:21,565 --> 01:27:23,153
<i>I don't know about heaven.</i>

787
01:27:30,271 --> 01:27:32,035
<i>But I do believe in angels.</i>

788
01:27:35,259 --> 01:27:37,136
<i>It's dad.</i>

789
01:27:40,952 --> 01:27:42,417
<i>It's your dad.</i>

790
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:51,436
<i>Not yet, Max.</i>

791
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,004
Max Payne is alive.

792
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:06,500


793
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:11,000


794
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:25,200
