1
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,633
Whoa there!

2
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,236
Halt!

3
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,321
Who goes there?

4
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,868
It is l, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,371
King of the Britons!
Defeater of the Saxons!

6
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,874
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,086
- Pull the other one.
- I am.

8
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,505
This is my trusty servant Patsy.

9
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,008
We have ridden the length
and breadth of the land...

10
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,553
in search of knights who will join me
in my court at Camelot.

11
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,264
I must speak with your lord and master.

12
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,142
- What, ridden on a horse?
- Yes.

13
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,643
You're using coconuts.

14
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,357
- What?
- You're banging together two coconuts.

15
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,611
So? We have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land.

16
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,613
Through the kingdom of Mercia--

17
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,784
- Where'd you get the coconuts?
- We found them.

18
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,495
In Mercia?
The coconut's tropical.

19
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,997
- What do you mean?
- This is a temperate zone.

20
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,708
The swallow may
fly south with the sun...

21
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,379
or the house martin or the plover
may seek warmer climes in winter...

22
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,714
yet these are not strangers
to our land.

23
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,967
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

24
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,428
Not at all.
They could be carried.

25
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,515
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

26
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,350
It could grip it by the husk.

27
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,144
It's not a question
of where he grips it.

28
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,855
It's a simple question of weight ratios.

29
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,151
A five-ounce bird could not carry
a one-pound coconut.

30
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,653
It doesn't matter.

31
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,365
Tell your master that Arthur
from the court of Camelot is here.

32
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,536
In order to maintain
air speed velocity...

33
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:14,582
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second.

34
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,917
Please!

35
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,837
- Am I right?
- I'm not interested.

36
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,548
It could be carried
by an African swallow.

37
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:26,344
An African swallow, maybe,
but not a European swallow.

38
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,763
- That's my point.
- I agree with that.

39
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,892
Will you ask your master if he wants
to join my court at Camelot?

40
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,731
But then, of course,
African swallows are nonmigratory.

41
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,692
So they couldn't bring
a coconut back anyway.

42
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,779
Wait a minute. Supposing two swallows
carried it together!

43
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,865
No, they'd have to have it on a line.

44
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,035
Simple. They just use
a strand of creeper.

45
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,621
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?

46
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,834
Bring out your dead!

47
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,186
Bring out your dead!

48
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,408
Ninepence.

49
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,139
- Here's one.
- Ninepence.

50
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,141
- I'm not dead!
- What?

51
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,769
- Nothing. Here's our ninepence.
- I'm not dead!

52
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,146
- Here. He says he's not dead.
- Yes, he is.

53
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,148
- I'm not.
- He isn't?

54
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,359
- He will be soon. He's ill.
- I'm getting better.

55
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,361
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

56
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,072
I can't take him like that.
It's against regulations.

57
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,409
- I don't want to go on the cart!
- Don't be such a baby.

58
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,744
- I can't take him.
- I feel fine.

59
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,871
- Do us a favor.
- I can't.

60
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,040
Can you hang around?
He won't be long.

61
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,043
I've got to get to Robinson's.
They've lost nine today.

62
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,212
- When is your next round?
- Thursday.

63
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,882
- I think I'll go for a walk.
- You're not fooling anyone.

64
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,386
- Isn't there something you can do?
- I feel happy!

65
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,392
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all. See you on Thursday.

66
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,608
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Must be a king.

67
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,362
- Why?
- He hasn't got shit all over him.

68
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,137
- Old woman !
- Man !

69
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,807
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle there?

70
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,268
- I'm 37.
- What?

71
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,854
I'm 37. I'm not old.

72
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,940
- I can't just call you "man."
- You could say "Dennis."

73
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,027
- I didn't know you were called Dennis.
- You didn't bother to find out.

74
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,946
I said "Sorry" about the old woman,
but from behind, you looked--

75
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,241
What I object to is that you
automatically treat me like an inferior.

76
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,161
- I am king.
- Oh, king. Very nice.

77
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,040
And how'd you get that?
By exploiting the workers.

78
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,584
By hanging on to
outdated imperialist dogma...

79
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,588
which perpetuates the economic
and social differences in our society.

80
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,760
- If there's ever going to be progress--
- There's lovely filth down here.

81
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,179
- How do you do?
- How do you do, good lady?

82
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,641
I'm Arthur, king of the Britons.
Whose castle is that?

83
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,768
- King of who?
- The Britons.

84
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,314
-Who are the Britons?
-We are all Britons, and I am your king.

85
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,151
I didn't know we had a king. I thought
we were an autonomous collective.

86
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,363
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

87
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,783
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes--

88
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,160
There you go bringing class
into it again.

89
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,162
That's what it's all about.

90
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,667
Please, good people. I am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?

91
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,627
No one lives there.

92
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,005
- Then who is your lord?
- We don't have a lord.

93
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,297
What?

94
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,050
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

95
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,346
We take turns to act as sort of
an executive officer for the week.

96
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,974
But all the decisions
of that officer have to be ratified...

97
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,393
at a special biweekly meeting...

98
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,896
by a simple majority
in the case of internal affairs.

99
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,691
- But by 2/3rd's majority--
- Be quiet!

100
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,278
- I order you to be quiet!
- Order? Who does he think he is?

101
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,656
- I am your king.
- I didn't vote for you.

102
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,410
- You don't vote for kings.
- How'd you become king, then?

103
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,412
The Lady of the Lake...

104
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,540
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite...

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,210
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

106
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,296
signifying by Divine Providence...

107
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,591
that l, Arthur,
was to carry Excalibur.

108
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,593
That is why I am your king.

109
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,055
Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords...

110
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,057
is no basis for government.

111
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,186
Supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses...

112
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,772
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

113
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,939
Quiet!

114
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,610
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

115
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,820
because some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

116
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:36,946
Shut up!

117
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,115
If I went around saying
I was an emperor...

118
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,495
just because some moistened bint lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away.

119
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,789
Shut up!
Will you shut up?

120
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,957
Now we see the violence
inherent in the system.

121
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,542
Shut up!

122
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,797
Come see the violence inherent in
the system. Help! I'm being repressed!

123
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,300
- Bloody peasant!
- What a giveaway! Did you hear that?

124
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,428
That's what I'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

125
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,236
You fight with the strength
of many men, Sir Knight.

126
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,950
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

127
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,582
I seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land...

128
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,918
to join me at Camelot.

129
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,593
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

130
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,352
You make me sad. So be it.
Come, Patsy.

131
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,688
- None shall pass.
- What?

132
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,648
None shall pass.

133
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,860
I have no quarrel with you,
but I must cross this bridge.

134
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,446
Then you shall die.

135
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,326
I command you, as king of the Britons,
to stand aside!

136
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,455
I move for no man.

137
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,041
So be it!

138
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,155
- Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
- 'Tis but a scratch.

139
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,866
- A scratch? Your arm's off.
- No, it isn't.

140
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,327
- What's that, then?
- I've had worse.

141
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,413
- You liar!
- Come on, you pansy!

142
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,466
Victory is mine.

143
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,177
We thank Thee, Lord,
that in Thy mercy--

144
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,388
- Come on.
- What?

145
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,390
Have at you!

146
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,894
You are indeed brave,
but the fight is mine.

147
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,355
Had enough, eh?

148
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,066
You stupid bastard,
you've got no arms left.

149
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,068
- Yes, I have.
- Look!

150
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,612
It's just a flesh wound.

151
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,156
- Stop that!
- Chicken!

152
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,284
I'll have your leg! Right!

153
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,038
- Right!
- I'll do you for that.

154
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,165
- You'll what?
- Come here.

155
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,585
- Are you going to bleed on me?
- I'm invincible!

156
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,961
You're loony.

157
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,090
The Black Knight always triumphs!

158
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,759
Have at you!
Come on, then.

159
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,643
All right, we'll call it a draw.

160
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,520
Come, Patsy.

161
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,106
I see. Running away, eh?

162
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:26,111
You yellow bastards! Come back here
and take what's coming to you !

163
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,113
I'll bite your legs off!

164
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,567
A witch! A witch!

165
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,488
A witch! We found a witch !

166
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,494
We've got a witch!
A witch! A witch!

167
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,174
We have found a witch.
May we burn her?

168
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,263
- How do you know she is a witch?
- She looks like one.

169
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,309
Bring her forward.

170
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,895
I'm not a witch!
I'm not a witch !

171
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,064
But you are dressed as one.

172
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,941
- They dressed me like this.
- No, we didn't.

173
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,986
And this isn't my nose.
It's a false one.

174
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,159
- Well?
- We did do the nose.

175
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,829
- The nose?
- And the hat. But she is a witch !

176
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,128
- Did you dress her up like this?
- No, no!

177
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,173
Yes. A bit.

178
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,592
She has got a wart.

179
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,719
What makes you think
she's a witch?

180
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,763
She turned me into a newt!

181
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,224
A newt?

182
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,938
I got better.

183
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,940
Burn her anyway!

184
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,238
QQuiet! QQuiet!

185
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,658
There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

186
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:40,995
- Are there? What are they? Tell us.
- Do they hurt?

187
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,957
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

188
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,458
Burn them!

189
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,754
And what do you burn,
apart from witches?

190
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,133
- More witches!
- Wood!

191
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,177
So why do witches burn?

192
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,858
- 'Cause they're made of wood?
- Good!

193
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,991
- How do we tell if she is made of wood?
- Build a bridge out of her.

194
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:21,703
But can you not also make bridges
out of stone?

195
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,122
Oh, yeah.

196
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,209
Does wood sink in water?

197
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,338
- No, it floats.
- Throw her into the pond!

198
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,719
What also floats in water?

199
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,055
- Bread.
- Apples.

200
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,224
- Very small rocks.
- Cider! Great gravy.

201
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,518
- Cherries. Mud.
- Churches.

202
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,520
- Lead.
- A duck!

203
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,274
Exactly.

204
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,736
So, logically--

205
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,657
If she weighs the same as a duck...

206
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,661
she's made of wood.

207
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,205
And therefore?

208
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,583
A witch!

209
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,755
- A duck! A duck!
- Here's a duck.

210
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,007
We shall use my largest scales.

211
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,183
Burn the witch !

212
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,907
Remove the supports!

213
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,204
A witch!

214
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,039
It's a fair cop.

215
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,176
Who are you, who are so wise
in the ways of science?

216
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,721
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

217
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,848
My Liege!

218
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,559
Good Sir Knight, will you come with me
to Camelot...

219
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,395
and join us at the Round Table?

220
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,064
My Liege, I would be honored!

221
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,151
- What is your name?
- Bedevere, my Liege.

222
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,696
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere...

223
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,240
Knight of the Round Table.

224
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:27,037
The wise Sir Bedevere was fhe firsf
to join King Arthur's knighfs.

225
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,415
But ofher illusfrious names
were soon fo follow.

226
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,168
"Sir lancelot fhe Brave.

227
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,962
Sir Galahad fhe Pure.

228
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,007
And Sir Robin the
Not-Quife-So-Brave-As Sir lancelot...

229
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,301
who had nearly fought
fhe Dragon of Angnor...

230
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,387
who nearly sfood up to
fhe Chicken of Brisfol...

231
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,350
and wet himself af
the Baffle of Badon Hill.

232
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:53,229
And fhe apfly named,
Sir Not-Appearing-ln-This-Film.

233
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,524
Together fhey formed a band

234
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,110
were refold fhroughouf fhe cenfuries. "

235
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,696
The Knighfs of the Round Table.

236
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,575
And that, my Liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

237
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,078
This new learning amazes me.

238
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,998
Explain again how sheeps' bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

239
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,209
- Certainly, sir.
- Look, my Liege!

240
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,215
- Camelot!
- Camelot!

241
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,134
It's only a model.

242
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,680
Knights, I bid you welcome
to your new home.

243
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,641
Let us ride to Camelot!

244
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,396
We're Knighfs of the Round Table
We dance when e're we're able

245
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,816
We do roufines and chorus scenes
wifh foofwork impeccable

246
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,111
We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

247
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,454
We're Knighfs of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

248
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,001
Buf many times we're given rhymes
fhaf are quite unsingable

249
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:01,297
We're opera mad in Camelof
We sing from the diaphragm a lof

250
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,939
In war we're tough and able

251
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,400
Quife indefafigable

252
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,487
Between our quesfs we sequin vests
and impersonafe Clark Gable

253
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,156
It's a busy life in Camelof

254
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:31,161
I have fo push the pram a lot

255
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,834
On second thought,
let's not go to Camelot.

256
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,128
- It is a silly place.
- Right.

257
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,849
Arthur! Arthur!

258
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,976
King of the Britons!

259
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,482
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people groveling.

260
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,484
- Sorry.
- And don't apologize!

261
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,862
Every time I talk to someone, it's
"Sorry this" and "Forgive me that"...

262
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,864
and "l'm not worthy."

263
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,909
- What are you doing now?
- Averting my eyes.

264
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:15,622
Don't! It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

265
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,166
- Now knock it off!
- Yes, Lord!

266
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,628
Arthur, king of the Britons...

267
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,172
your Knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

268
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:27,008
to make them an example
in these dark times.

269
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,510
Good idea.

270
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,553
Of course it's a good idea!

271
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,265
Behold, Arthur,
this is the Holy Grail.

272
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,768
Look well, Arthur...

273
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,521
for it is your sacred task
to seek this Grail.

274
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,732
That is your purpose, Arthur.

275
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,860
The quest for the Holy Grail.

276
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:52,075
A blessing from the Lord!

277
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,702
God be praised!

278
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,802
Halt!

279
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,148
Hello!

280
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,240
Hello!

281
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,535
Hello? Who is it?

282
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,872
It is King Arthur, and these are
my Knights of the Round Table.

283
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,874
Whose castle is this?

284
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:26,419
This is the castle of my master,
Guy di Loimbard.

285
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,588
Go and tell your master...

286
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:32,467
that we have been charged by God
with a sacred quest.

287
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,720
If he will give us food and shelter
for the night...

288
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,932
he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

289
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,185
I'll ask him, but I don't think
he'll be very keen.

290
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,521
He's already got one, you see.

291
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,275
- What?
- He says they've already got one.

292
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,361
Are you sure he's got one?

293
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,530
Yes. It's very nice.

294
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:57,450
I told him we already got one.

295
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,954
Well, can we come up
and have a look?

296
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,915
Of course not!
You are English types.

297
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,543
What are you?

298
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:11,798
I'm French ! Why do you think I have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

299
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,051
- What are you doing in England?
- Mind your own business!

300
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,890
If you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

301
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,561
You don't frighten us,
English pig-dogs!

302
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:28,898
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person!

303
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,902
I blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King!

304
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,488
You and all your silly English...

305
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,490
"kniggits."

306
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:47,584
- What a strange person.
- Look here, my good man--

307
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,753
I don't want to talk to you no more...

308
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,256
you empty-headed animal
food-trough wiper!

309
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,885
I fart in your general direction.

310
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:58,970
Your mother was a hamster...

311
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:03,308
and your father smelt of elderberries!

312
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,811
Is there someone else we could talk to?

313
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:11,691
No. Now go away,
or I shall taunt you a second time.

314
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,488
This is your last chance.
I've been more than reasonable.

315
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,872
If you do not agree to my commands,
then I shall--

316
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,625
Jesus Christ!

317
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,048
Right!

318
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,050
Charge!

319
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,392
This one is for your mother!

320
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,315
Run away!

321
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,912
Filthy fiends.
I'll tear them apart.

322
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:09,582
Sir, I have a plan.

323
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:47,555
- What?
- A present.

324
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,683
Hurry. Let's go.

325
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,125
What happens now?

326
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,420
Now Lancelot, Galahad and l...

327
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:22,048
wait until nightfall,
and then leap out of the rabbit...

328
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,551
taking the French by surprise.

329
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:28,179
Not only by surprise,
but totally unarmed.

330
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,432
Who leaps out?

331
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:33,560
Lancelot, Galahad and l...

332
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:37,022
Ieap out of the rabbit and--

333
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:45,155
Look, if we built
this large, wooden badger--

334
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,076
Run away!

335
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,049
- Feature for schools. Take eight.
- Action.

336
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,136
Defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened King Arthur.

337
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:13,099
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

338
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:17,520
And Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

339
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:21,941
if the quest for the Holy Grail were to
be brought to a successful conclusion.

340
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,236
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights...

341
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,908
decided that they should separate
and search for the Grail individually.

342
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,702
Now this is what they did.

343
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,539
Frank!

344
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,217
"The Tale of Sir Robin. "

345
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,887
So each of the knighfs
went fheir separate ways.

346
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,516
Sir Robin rode north
fhrough the dark foresf of Ewing...

347
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,018
accompanied by his favorife minsfrels.

348
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:02,607
Bravely, bold Sir Robin
rode forfh from Camelot

349
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:07,112
He was not afraid fo die
O brave Sir Robin

350
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:11,408
He was nof at all afraid
fo be killed in nasfy ways

351
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:14,035
Brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

352
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,333
He was not in fhe leasf bit scared
fo be mashed into a pulp

353
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:24,838
Or fo have his eyes gouged out
and his elbows broken

354
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:29,092
To have his kneecaps splif
and his body burned away

355
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,762
And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

356
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,892
His head smashed in, his hearf cut ouf
His liver removed, his bowels unplugged

357
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,229
His nostrils raped, his botfom burnf off
And his penis--

358
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:44,399
That's enough music for now, lads.

359
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,901
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

360
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,490
Anarcho-syndicalist
is a way of preserving freedom.

361
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,785
Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom!
And don't drop that mud.

362
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,916
Halt! Who art thou?

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,086
He is brave Sir Robin
Brave Sir Robin who--

364
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,256
Shut up!
Nobody really.

365
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,634
- I'm just passing through.
- What do you want?

366
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,803
To fighf and--

367
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,597
Shut up!

368
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,182
Nothing really.

369
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,268
Just to pass through,
good Sir Knight.

370
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:21,811
I'm afraid not.

371
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:26,107
Actually I am
a Knight of the Round Table.

372
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,736
- You're a Knight of the Round Table?
- I am.

373
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,364
- In that case I shall have to kill you.
- Shall l?

374
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,616
- I don't think so.
- What do I think?

375
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,618
- Kill him.
- Let's be nice to him.

376
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,661
Shut up! And you !

377
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,955
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

378
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,292
- Cut your own head off.
- Do us all a favor.

379
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,671
- Yapping on all the time.
- You're lucky you're not next to him.

380
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,131
- What do you mean?
- You snore.

381
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,592
I don't. Anyway,
you've got bad breath.

382
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:56,971
- Because you don't brush my teeth.
- Stop bitching. Let's have tea.

383
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:01,518
All right. We'll kill him first,
then have tea and biscuits.

384
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:04,270
- Not biscuits.
- All right, not biscuits.

385
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,564
- Let's kill him anyway.
- Right.

386
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,903
- He's buggered off.
- So he has. He's scarpered!

387
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,406
Brave Sir Robin ran away

388
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,658
Bravely ran away, away

389
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,410
I didn't!

390
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:22,664
When danger reared its ugly head
he bravely furned his tail and fled

391
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,958
- Brave Sir Robin turned about
- I didn't!

392
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,003
And gallanfly he chickened ouf
Bravely faking fo his feet

393
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,505
- I never did!
- He beaf a very brave retreaf

394
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,966
- All lies!
- Bravesf of fhe brave, Sir Robin

395
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,467
I never!

396
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:08,043
"The Tale of Sir Galahad. "

397
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,348
Open the door!

398
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:08,937
In the name of King Arthur,
open the door!

399
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:18,905
Hello.

400
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,658
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.

401
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,660
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

402
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,079
Castle Anthrax?

403
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:30,041
Yes. It's not a very good name,
is it?

404
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:34,921
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every need.

405
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,632
You are the keepers
of the Holy Grail?

406
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,593
- The what?
- The Grail. It is here?

407
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,889
But you are tired,
and you must rest a while.

408
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,809
- Midget. Crapper.
- Yes, O zoot?

409
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,686
Prepare a bed for our guest.

410
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,981
Thank you. Thank you.

411
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,525
Away, away, varletesses.

412
00:37:55,567 --> 00:38:00,739
The beds here are warm and soft
and very, very big.

413
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,075
What is your name, handsome knight?

414
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,287
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

415
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,082
Mine is zoot. Just Zoot.

416
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,460
- But come.
- No, please!

417
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,837
In God's name, show me the Grail.

418
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,424
You have suffered much.
You are delirious.

419
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:22,177
I have seen it. It is here.

420
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,057
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

421
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:31,519
I'm afraid our life must seem...

422
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:35,273
very dull and quiet
compared to yours.

423
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,193
We are but eightscore
young blondes and brunettes...

424
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,820
all between 16 and 19-and-a-half...

425
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,990
cut off in this castle
with no one to protect us.

426
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,077
Oh, it is a lonely life.

427
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,747
Bathing, dressing, undressing...

428
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,791
making exciting underwear.

429
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,711
We are not used to handsome knights.

430
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,631
Nay, come, come.
You may lie here.

431
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:04,260
- Oh, but you are wounded!
- No, it's nothing.

432
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,763
You must see the doctors immediately.

433
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,265
No, please, lie down.

434
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,396
What seems to be the trouble?

435
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,023
They're doctors?

436
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,693
They have basic medical training, yes.

437
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,987
Come, come.
You must try to rest.

438
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:27,242
Dr. Piglet, Dr. Winston,
practice your art.

439
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:36,626
- Try to relax.
- Are you sure that's necessary?

440
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,670
We must examine you.

441
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:45,468
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Please. We are doctors.

442
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,347
No! This cannot be.

443
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,766
- I am sworn to chastity.
- Back to your bed at once.

444
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,061
Torment me no longer.
I have seen the Grail.

445
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,939
- There's no grail here.
- I have seen it!

446
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,651
- I have seen--
- Hello.

447
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:31,306
No. I am zoot's
identical twin sister Dingo.

448
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,433
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

449
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,978
I seek the Grail.
I have seen it here in this castle!

450
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,274
No! Oh, no!

451
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,235
- Bad, bad zoot!
- What is it?

452
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,821
Wicked, bad, naughty zoot!

453
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:51,493
She has been lighting our beacon, which
I've just remembered is grail-shaped.

454
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:55,789
- This is not the first time.
- It's not the real Grail?

455
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:59,584
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil zoot!

456
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:03,129
She is a naughty person,
and she must pay the penalty.

457
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:08,551
Here in Anthrax we have one punishment
for lighting the grail-shaped beacon.

458
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,846
You must tie her down on a bed
and spank her.

459
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,932
A spanking!

460
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:18,019
Spank her well, and after you have
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

461
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:21,606
- Then spank me.
- And me.

462
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,776
Yes. Give us all a good spanking.

463
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:31,032
And after the spanking,
the oral sex.

464
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:35,995
I could stay a bit longer.

465
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,248
- Sir Galahad!
- Hello.

466
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,625
Quick! QQuick!
You're in great peril!

467
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,169
- No, he isn't!
- Silence, foul temptress!

468
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,630
- She's got the point.
- We will cover your escape.

469
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,132
I'm fine!

470
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:52,178
- I can tackle this lot single-handed.
- Let him tackle us singled-handed.

471
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:57,392
- No, Sir Galahad. Come.
- I can handle this lot easily.

472
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,769
Let him handle us easily.

473
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,231
Wait. I can defeat them.
There's only 150 of them.

474
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:07,277
Yes! He'll beat us easily!
We haven't a chance.

475
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,574
Oh, shit!

476
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:15,618
- You were in great peril.
- I don't think I was.

477
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,039
- You were in terrible peril.
- Let me go back in and face the peril.

478
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:22,792
- It's too perilous.
- My duty is to sample peril.

479
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,962
- We've got to find the Holy Grail.
- Let me have a bit of peril.

480
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,840
- No. It's unhealthy.
- I bet you're gay.

481
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,508
I am not.

482
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:35,055
"Sir Lancelof had saved Sir Galahad
from almosf cerfain fempfafion. "

483
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,682
But they were no nearer fhe Grail.

484
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,684
Meanwhile,
King Arfhur and Sir Bedevere...

485
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,937
nof more than a swallow's flight away
had discovered somefhing.

486
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,317
Thaf's an unladen swallow's flighf,
obviously.

487
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,861
They were more fhan two laden
swallows' flighfs away.

488
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:53,990
Four if they had a coconuf on a line
between them. If fhe birds walked--

489
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:56,326
Get on with it!

490
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,080
Anyway, on fo scene 24,
a smashing scene wifh lovely acfing...

491
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,499
in which Arfhur discovers
a vital clue...

492
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,835
in which fhere are no swallows,
alfhough I fhink--

493
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:11,758
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

494
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,350
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?

495
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,561
He knows of a cave.

496
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,356
A cave which no man has entered.

497
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,900
And the Grail is there?

498
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:32,278
There is much danger,
for beyond the cave...

499
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:35,240
Iies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

500
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:38,368
which no man has ever crossed.

501
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,954
But the Grail !
Where is the Grail?

502
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:44,749
Seek you the Bridge of Death!

503
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,378
The Bridge of Death
which leads to the Grail?

504
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,550
Who are you?

505
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:40,513
- We are the Knights Who Say "Ni."
- No, not the Knights Who Say "Ni."

506
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:42,640
- The same.
- Who are thee?

507
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:46,186
We are the keepers of the sacred words:

508
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,939
"Ni," "Peng," and "Nee-wom"!

509
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:52,942
Those who hear them seldom live.

510
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:57,572
The Knights Who Say "Ni"
demand a sacrifice.

511
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:02,118
We are simple travelers who seek the
enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

512
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,879
We shall say "Ni" again to you...

513
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:14,881
if you do not appease us.

514
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,884
- What do you want?
- We want...

515
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:20,553
a shrubbery!

516
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,682
A what?

517
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,687
Please, no more!
We will find you a shrubbery.

518
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,272
You must return here with a shrubbery...

519
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:37,195
or else you will never pass
through this wood alive.

520
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:40,782
You are just and fair,
and we will return with the shrubbery.

521
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:42,909
- One that looks nice.
- Of course.

522
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,911
- And not too expensive.
- Yes.

523
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:48,206
Now go!

524
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,126
Stop that. Stop that.

525
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,255
Go on, clear off. Go away.

526
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,883
Do it. Go away.

527
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,010
And you, clear off!

528
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,891
Bloody weather.

529
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:51,686
"The Tale of Sir lancelof. "

530
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,236
One day, lad,
all this will be yours.

531
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,906
- The curtains?
- Not the curtains, lad.

532
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:07,410
All you can see stretched
over the hills and valleys of this land.

533
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,704
- This will be your kingdom.
- But, Mother--

534
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,206
I'm Father.

535
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,833
But, Father, I don't want any of that.

536
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,420
Listen, I built this kingdom
up from nothing.

537
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,465
When I started,
all there was was swamp.

538
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:23,426
All the kings said I was daft
to build a castle in a swamp...

539
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,971
but I built it all the same,
just to show 'em.

540
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:30,558
It sank into the swamp.
So I built a second one.

541
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:33,311
That sank into the swamp.
So I built a third one.

542
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,480
That burned down, fell over,
then sank into the swamp!

543
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:38,733
But the fourth one stayed up!

544
00:47:38,817 --> 00:47:40,819
And that's what you're gonna get.

545
00:47:40,902 --> 00:47:44,155
The strongest castle in these isles.

546
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,826
- I don't want any of that. I'd rather--
- Rather what?

547
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:52,288
I'd rather just sing!

548
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:56,209
Stop that! You're not going
into a song while I'm here.

549
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:59,504
Listen. In 20 minutes
you're getting married to a girl...

550
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:03,591
whose father owns the biggest tracts
of open land in Britain.

551
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,677
But I don't want land.

552
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,179
- Listen, Alice--
- Herbert.

553
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:11,850
We live in a bloody swamp.
We need all the land we can get!

554
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:14,060
But I don't like her.

555
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,313
Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?

556
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:20,066
She's beautiful. She's rich.

557
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,152
She's got huge...

558
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:24,571
tracts of land.

559
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:26,072
I know...

560
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:30,535
but I want the girl
that I marry to have...

561
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:34,998
a certain special something.

562
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,000
Cut that out!

563
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,795
Look, you're marrying
Princess Lucky...

564
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:44,007
so you better get used to the idea.

565
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,300
Guards!

566
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:49,262
Make sure the prince doesn't leave
this room until I come and get him.

567
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:52,265
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

568
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,684
No, no. Until I come and get him.

569
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:57,979
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

570
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:03,151
No, no. You stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

571
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:05,570
- And you'll come and get him.
- Right.

572
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:09,657
We don't need to do anything apart
from just stop him entering the room.

573
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:13,078
- No, no. Leaving the room.
- Leaving the room. Yes.

574
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:15,038
All right?

575
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,626
- Yes? What is it?
- If-- Oh.

576
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,628
It's quite simple.

577
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:26,758
You just stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

578
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:28,259
All right?

579
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:32,138
Oh, I remember.
Can he leave the room with us?

580
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:35,850
No, no. You just keep him in here,
and make sure--

581
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,852
Oh, yes! We'll keep him
in here, obviously.

582
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:40,188
But if he had to leave
and we were with him--

583
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:43,066
- Just keep him in here--
- Until you or anyone else--

584
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:45,610
- No, not anyone else, just me.
- Just you.

585
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,237
- Get back.
- Get back.

586
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:50,156
- Right?
- We'll stay here until you get back.

587
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,158
And make sure he doesn't leave.

588
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,952
What?

589
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,079
Make sure he doesn't leave.

590
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:59,416
- The prince?
- Yes, make sure he doesn't leave--

591
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:02,794
Oh, yes, of course.
I thought you meant him.

592
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:06,840
It seemed a bit daft, me having
to guard him when he's a guard.

593
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,801
- Is that clear?
- Oh, quite clear. No problems.

594
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:11,344
Right.

595
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:15,807
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.

596
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:20,395
No, no. I want you to stay here
and make sure he doesn't leave.

597
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:22,230
Oh, I see. Right.

598
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:27,235
Shut your noise, you!
And get that suit on !

599
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,119
And no singing!

600
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:38,455
Go get a glass of water.

601
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,631
- Well taken, Concord.
- Thank you, sir. Most kind.

602
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:31,466
And again.

603
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:35,220
Over we go! Good. Steady.

604
00:51:35,303 --> 00:51:37,597
And now, the big one!

605
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:40,433
Come on, Concord.

606
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,686
Message for you, sir.

607
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:47,273
Concord, speak to me!

608
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,827
"To whoever finds this note:

609
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:03,289
I have been imprisoned by my father...

610
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,875
who wishes me to marry
against my will.

611
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:09,045
Please, please,
please come and rescue me.

612
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,716
I am in the tall tower
of Swamp Castle."

613
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,719
At last! A call!
A cry of distress!

614
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:19,264
This could be the sign that leads us
to the Holy Grail.

615
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:23,601
Brave, brave Concord,
you shall not have died in vain.

616
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:25,645
I'm not quite dead, sir.

617
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,650
Well, you shall not have been
mortally wounded in vain.

618
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,653
I think I could pull through, sir.

619
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,155
Oh, I see.

620
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:38,658
-I think I'm all right to come with you.
-No, no, stay here.

621
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,579
I will send help when I have made
the daring and heroic rescue...

622
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:44,873
in my own particular--

623
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:49,753
- Idiom, sir?
- Idiom!

624
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:54,132
- No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
- Farewell, sweet Concord.

625
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:58,303
I'll just stay here, then,
shall l, sir?

626
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:00,805
Yeah.

627
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,471
- Morning.
- Morning.

628
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,029
You're not allowed
to enter this room--

629
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:25,825
O fair one, behold your humble servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

630
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,994
I have come to take--
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

631
00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:31,706
- You got my note!
- Well, I got a note.

632
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:35,335
- You've come to rescue me.
- You see--

633
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:37,337
I knew someone would.

634
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,717
I knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone who--

635
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:45,345
Stop that! Stop it!

636
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:48,223
- Who are you?
- I'm your son!

637
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:50,600
- Not you.
- I am Sir Lancelot, sir.

638
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:53,895
- He's come to rescue me, Father.
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

639
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:56,898
Did you kill all those guards?

640
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,900
Oh, yes. Sorry.

641
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:02,112
- They cost 50 pounds each!
- I'm sorry. I can explain.

642
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:06,157
Don't be afraid of him.
I've got a rope all ready.

643
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:08,743
You killed eight wedding guests in all !

644
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:12,122
-You see, I thought your son was a lady.
-I can understand that.

645
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,290
Hurry, Sir Lancelot.

646
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:18,586
- You only killed the bride's father.
- I didn't mean to.

647
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,799
- You put your sword through his head!
- Oh, dear. Is he all right?

648
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:25,677
You even kicked the bride.
This is gonna cost me a fortune.

649
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,764
I can explain. I was riding north
from Camelot when I got this note--

650
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:32,517
Camelot?
Are you from Camelot?

651
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,185
Hurry.

652
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:37,272
- I am a knight of King Arthur.
- Very nice castle, Camelot.

653
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:40,442
- Very good pig country.
- Is it?

654
00:56:40,525 --> 00:56:42,527
Hurry. I am ready.

655
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,072
- Would you like to come have a drink?
- That's awfully nice of you.

656
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:48,074
I am ready!

657
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,702
I mean, to be so understanding.

658
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,747
I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom,
I get carried away.

659
00:56:53,788 --> 00:56:55,749
Don't worry about that.

660
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:04,382
This is the main hall. We're having this
made into one big living room.

661
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:07,719
- There he is!
- Oh, bloody hell.

662
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:11,431
Hold it!

663
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:19,647
- Please.
- Sorry, sorry.

664
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:24,194
See what I mean? I get carried away.
I really must apologize. Sorry.

665
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:27,280
He's killed the best man !

666
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,866
Hold it. Hold it, please.

667
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:34,245
This is Sir Lancelot
from the court of Camelot.

668
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:37,499
A very brave and influential knight...

669
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:39,834
and my special guest here today.

670
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,920
- Hello.
- He killed my auntie!

671
00:57:42,837 --> 00:57:44,506
Please, please!

672
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:47,634
This is supposed to be
a happy occasion.

673
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:52,222
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

674
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:56,893
We are here today to witness
the union of two young people...

675
00:57:56,976 --> 00:57:59,479
in the joyful bond
of holy wedlock.

676
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:05,402
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

677
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,404
has just fallen to his death.

678
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,782
But I don't want to think
I've lost a son...

679
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:13,702
so much as gained a daughter.

680
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:19,541
- Since the tragic death of her father--
- He's not quite dead.

681
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:24,713
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

682
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,632
He's getting better.

683
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,845
For, since her own father...

684
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:35,515
who, when he seemed about to recover...

685
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:39,352
suddenly felt the icy hand
of death upon him--

686
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:42,188
Oh, he's died.

687
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:47,152
I want his only daughter
to look upon me as her own dad...

688
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:50,238
in a very real
and legally binding sense.

689
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:55,118
And I feel sure that the merger--
the union...

690
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,120
between the princess...

691
00:58:57,203 --> 00:59:01,583
and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--

692
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,710
Look! The dead prince!

693
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,759
- He's not quite dead
- No, I feel much better.

694
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:13,386
You fell out of the tall tower,
you creep!

695
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:17,349
- No, I was saved at the last minute.
- How?

696
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,852
Well, I'll tell you.

697
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:23,146
Not like that! No!

698
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:25,273
Stop it!

699
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:28,693
He's going fo fell
He's going to fell

700
00:59:31,946 --> 00:59:33,573
QQuickly, this way.

701
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:37,744
No, it's not right for my idiom.
I must escape more--

702
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,455
Dramatically?

703
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:41,956
Dramatically.

704
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,250
Heave!

705
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:51,966
Whaf a wonderful escape

706
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,806
Excuse me. Could somebody
give me a push, please?

707
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,781
Old crone.

708
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,953
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

709
01:00:20,995 --> 01:00:23,790
- Who sent you?
- The Knights Who Say "Ni."

710
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:27,377
Ah, no. Never.
We've no shrubberies here.

711
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,213
If you do not tell us where
we can buy a shrubbery...

712
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:34,384
my friend and I will say--

713
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,720
We will say "Ni."

714
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,597
Do your worst.

715
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:43,351
Very well. If you will
not assist us voluntarily--

716
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:51,693
Never! No shrubbery!

717
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,905
- Nu!
- No, no. It's not that. It's "Ni."

718
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,908
- Nu.
- No. Ni. You're not doing it properly.

719
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,619
- Ni.
- That's it. You got it.

720
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,334
Are you saying "Ni"
to that old woman?

721
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,044
Um, yes.

722
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:12,047
Oh, what sad times are these
when passing ruffians...

723
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,050
can say "Ni" at will
to old ladies.

724
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,636
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

725
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,805
Even those who arrange
and design shrubberies...

726
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:24,392
are under considerable economic stress
at this period in history.

727
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:27,354
- Did you say shrubberies?
- Yes.

728
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:30,315
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.

729
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:32,609
My name is Roger the Shrubber.

730
01:01:32,692 --> 01:01:35,195
I arrange, design
and sell shrubberies.

731
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:43,036
O Knights of Ni, we have brought you
your shrubbery. May we go now?

732
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,790
It is a good shrubbery.
I like the laurel particularly.

733
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:49,084
But there is one small problem.

734
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,585
What?

735
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,547
We are now no longer
the Knights Who Say "Ni."

736
01:01:55,882 --> 01:02:01,554
We are now the Knights Who Say
"Ecky, Ecky, Ecky, Pakang, zoom-ping."

737
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,557
We must give you a test.

738
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:08,895
What is this test, O Knights of--
Knights Who Till Recently Said "Ni"?

739
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:13,233
Firstly, you must find
another shrubbery.

740
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:17,487
Not another shrubbery!

741
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:21,324
When you have found the shrubbery,
place it beside this shrubbery...

742
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:24,828
only higher to get the two-level effect
with a path down the middle.

743
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,121
A path!

744
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,625
Then when you have found
the shrubbery...

745
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:34,796
you must cut down the mightiest tree
in the forest...

746
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:38,174
with a herring!

747
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:42,178
- We shall do no such thing.
- Please.

748
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:46,099
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

749
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,935
- Oh! Don't say that word.
- What word?

750
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:54,149
I cannot tell. It is one of the words
the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

751
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:56,985
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

752
01:02:57,068 --> 01:02:59,320
- You said it again!
- What? "ls"?

753
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:00,822
Not "is."

754
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:03,158
Wouldn't get far in life
not saying "is."

755
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,202
My Liege, it's Sir Robin!

756
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:09,414
And packing it up
and sneaking away and buggering off

757
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:11,499
And chickening ouf
and pissing off home

758
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,044
Yes, bravely he is
fhrowing in fhe sponge

759
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:17,672
- It's good to see you.
- Now he said the word.

760
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,258
Surely you've not given up your quest
for the Holy Grail.

761
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:23,219
He is sneaking away
and buggering off

762
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:25,764
- No, no. Far from it.
- He said the word again.

763
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:28,141
I was looking for it...

764
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:31,353
here in this forest.

765
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,438
It is far from this place.

766
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,650
- Stop saying the word!
- Oh, stop it!

767
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,861
- You said it again.
- That's it.

768
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:42,947
I said it! I said it!
Oh, I said it again!

769
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:45,617
That's three "its."

770
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,917
And so Arthur and Bedevere
and Sir Robin...

771
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,378
sef out on their search
fo find the Enchanter...

772
01:03:56,461 --> 01:04:00,215
of whom fhe old man had spoken
in scene 24.

773
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:04,010
Beyond the foresf,
they met lancelot and Galahad...

774
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,179
and fhere was much rejoicing.

775
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:20,193
In fhe frozen land of Nador...

776
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:22,779
fhey were forced fo eaf
Robin's minsfrels...

777
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:26,157
and fhere was much rejoicing.

778
01:04:27,742 --> 01:04:29,661
A year passed.

779
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:36,001
- Winfer changed info spring.
- Nice.

780
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:38,628
Spring changed into summer.

781
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:41,256
Summer changed back into winfer.

782
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:44,968
And winter gave spring and summer
a miss and wenf straight into aufumn.

783
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:48,972
Unfil one day--

784
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,370
Knights...

785
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:14,873
forward.

786
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:55,288
What manner of man are you that can
summon up fire without flint or tinder?

787
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:59,042
I am an enchanter.

788
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,463
By what name are you known?

789
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:07,050
There some who call me...

790
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:08,551
Tim.

791
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,679
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

792
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,722
Greetings, King Arthur.

793
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,725
- You know my name?
- I do!

794
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:26,194
You seek the Holy Grail.

795
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:29,656
That is our quest. You know much
that is hidden, O Tim.

796
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:31,116
Quite.

797
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,168
Yes, we're looking
for the Holy Grail.

798
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,337
Our quest is to find
the Holy Grail.

799
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,381
Yes, it is. Yeah.

800
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,553
And so we're looking for it.

801
01:06:51,636 --> 01:06:55,098
- Yes. We have been for some time.
- Ages.

802
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:01,771
So anything that
you could do to help...

803
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:05,025
would be...

804
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:08,278
very helpful.

805
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:10,030
Can you tell us--

806
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:17,245
Fine. I don't want to waste
any more of your time.

807
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:21,583
But I don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a--

808
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:25,879
A what?

809
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:31,217
- A grail?
- Yes, I think so.

810
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:34,888
- Yes.
- Yes.

811
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:37,223
Yes!

812
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:39,809
- Oh, thank you.
- Splendid.

813
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:47,567
Look, you're a busy man and--

814
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:51,821
Yes, I can help you find
the Holy Grail.

815
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,741
To the north there lies a cave...

816
01:07:54,824 --> 01:07:57,243
the cave of Caerbannog...

817
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:02,040
wherein carved in mystic runes
upon the very living rock...

818
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:05,710
the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

819
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:12,717
make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

820
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,095
Where could we find this cave,
O Tim?

821
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:17,430
Follow!

822
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:22,060
But follow only
if ye be men of valor!

823
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:26,439
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

824
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:29,734
so foul, so cruel...

825
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:33,196
that no man yet
has fought with it and lived!

826
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:37,283
Bones of full 50 men...

827
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:39,953
Iie strewn about its lair!

828
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:41,663
So, brave knights...

829
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:46,292
if you do doubt your courage
or your strength...

830
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:50,755
come no further,
for death awaits you all...

831
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,217
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

832
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,430
What an eccentric performance.

833
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:14,988
- They're nervous, sire.
- We best leave them and go on foot.

834
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:16,906
Dismount!

835
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:34,799
Behold the cave of Caerbannog.

836
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,345
Right. Keep me covered.

837
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:41,222
- What with?
- Just keep me covered.

838
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:42,557
Too late!

839
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,975
What?

840
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,977
There he is!

841
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:49,689
- Where?
- There!

842
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:52,567
Behind the rabbit?

843
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,569
It is the rabbit.

844
01:09:56,529 --> 01:09:58,406
You silly sod!

845
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,450
- What?
- You got us all worked up!

846
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:02,535
That's no ordinary rabbit.

847
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:07,582
That's the most foul, cruel
and bad-tempered rodent you ever saw.

848
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:11,378
You tit! I soiled my armor
I was so scared.

849
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:15,965
That rabbit's got a vicious streak.
It's a killer.

850
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:18,802
- Get stuffed!
- He'll do you up a treat, mate.

851
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:20,887
You mangy Scots git!

852
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,556
- I'm warning you.
- What's he do, nibble your bum?

853
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,725
He's got huge, sharp--

854
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:28,770
He can leap about--

855
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:32,357
- Look at the bones!
- Go on, Bors. Chop his head off.

856
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:37,028
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

857
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,532
Look!

858
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,411
Jesus Christ!

859
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:47,122
- I warned you.
- I've done it again.

860
01:10:47,205 --> 01:10:51,668
I warned you, but did you listen to me?
Oh, no. You knew it all, didn't you?

861
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:54,504
Oh, it's just a harmless
little bunny, isn't it?

862
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:57,424
Well, it's always the same.
I always tell them--

863
01:10:57,465 --> 01:10:59,300
Shut up!

864
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:01,594
Right. Charge!

865
01:11:18,945 --> 01:11:21,031
Run away! Run away!

866
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,542
How many did we lose?

867
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,002
- Gawain.
- Ector.

868
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:36,212
- And Bors. That's five.
- Three, sir.

869
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:41,217
Three. We better not risk another
frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.

870
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,887
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

871
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,264
Oh, shut up.
Go and change your armor.

872
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:50,310
Let us taunt it. It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

873
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:52,103
Like what?

874
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:54,272
Well--

875
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:59,027
Have we got bows?

876
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:03,281
- We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
- Yes. The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

877
01:12:03,365 --> 01:12:07,035
'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother
Maynard carries. Brother Maynard.

878
01:12:07,118 --> 01:12:10,163
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

879
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:45,031
- How does it-- How does it work?
- I don't know, my Liege.

880
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:47,033
Consult the "Book of Armaments."

881
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:51,579
Armaments, chapter two,
verses 9 to 21.

882
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:58,712
"And St. Attila raised
the hand grenade up on high saying...

883
01:12:58,795 --> 01:13:01,881
'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade...

884
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:05,260
that with it thou mayest blow
thine enemies to tiny bits...

885
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:07,262
in Thy mercy.'

886
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:09,305
And the Lord did grin...

887
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:13,518
and the people did feast upon
the lambs and sloths and carp...

888
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:18,314
and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats--"

889
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:21,026
Skip a bit, Brother.

890
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:23,695
"And the Lord spake saying...

891
01:13:23,778 --> 01:13:27,323
'First shalt thou take out
the holy pin...

892
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:29,951
then shalt thou count to three...

893
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:32,787
no more, no less.

894
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,373
Three shall be the number
thou shalt count...

895
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:38,126
and the number of the counting
shall be three.

896
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:43,173
Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two...

897
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:46,217
excepting that thou
then proceed to three.

898
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:49,346
Five is right out.

899
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:54,559
Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached...

900
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:57,979
then lobbest thou
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...

901
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:00,065
towards thy foe...

902
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:03,777
who, being naughty in My sight,
shall snuff it."'

903
01:14:04,736 --> 01:14:07,197
- Amen.
- Amen.

904
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:08,948
Right.

905
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:11,284
One, two, five.

906
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:14,162
- Three, sir!
- Three!

907
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:01,543
There! Look!

908
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:03,878
- What does it say?
- What language is that?

909
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:07,549
- Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.
- It's Aramaic.

910
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:11,428
Of course.
Joseph of Arimathea.

911
01:15:11,511 --> 01:15:13,513
- Of course.
- What does it say?

912
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:17,809
It reads, "Here may be found...

913
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:21,354
the last words
of Joseph of Arimathea.

914
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:24,733
He who is valiant
and pure of spirit...

915
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:27,944
may find the Holy Grail...

916
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:32,615
in the castle of A-a-a-argh."

917
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,161
What?

918
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:39,622
"The castle of A-a-a-argh."

919
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,459
What is that?

920
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:44,753
He must have died while carving it.

921
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:47,589
- Oh, come on !
- Well, that's what it says.

922
01:15:47,672 --> 01:15:52,552
If he was dying he wouldn't bother
to carve "A-a-a-argh." He'd just say it.

923
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:55,055
That's what's carved in the rock.

924
01:15:55,138 --> 01:15:58,683
- Perhaps he was dictating.
- Shut up. Does it say anything else?

925
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,560
No. Just...

926
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,604
"A-a-a-argh."

927
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:11,279
Do you suppose he meant
the Camargue?

928
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:13,406
- Where's that?
- In France, I think.

929
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,618
Isn't there a St. A-a-a-argh's
in Cornwall?

930
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:18,703
- That's St. Ives.
- Oh, yes.

931
01:16:22,874 --> 01:16:25,085
No, no. A-a-a-argh.
Back of the throat.

932
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:28,880
No, no. "O-o-oh" in surprise and alarm.

933
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:32,092
- You mean sort of a "aaah"!
- Yes, that's right.

934
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:34,427
Oh, my God!

935
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:40,642
It's the legendary
Black Beast of--

936
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:44,896
That's it! Run away!

937
01:16:55,156 --> 01:16:56,658
Keep running!

938
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:02,956
We've lost him.

939
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,919
As the horrendous Black Beasf
lunged forward...

940
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,755
escape for Arthur and his knights
seemed hopeless...

941
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,967
when suddenly the animafor
suffered a fafal heart aftack.

942
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:18,138
The carfoon peril was no more.

943
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:21,641
The quesf for fhe Holy Grail
could confinue.

944
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:36,948
There it is!
The Bridge of Death.

945
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,450
Oh, great.

946
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:43,621
Look! There's the old man
from scene 24.

947
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:46,916
-What's he doing here?
-He's the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

948
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,586
He asks each traveler
five questions--

949
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:51,629
- Three questions.
- Three questions.

950
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:55,050
- He who answers the five questions--
- Three questions.

951
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:57,635
Three questions.
May cross in safety.

952
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,637
What if you get a question wrong?

953
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,183
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

954
01:18:03,266 --> 01:18:04,976
I won't go.

955
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,562
- Who's gonna answer the questions?
- Sir Robin.

956
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:10,273
- Yes?
- Brave Sir Robin, you go.

957
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:14,569
I've got a great idea.
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

958
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:17,280
Yes, let me go.
I will take it single-handed.

959
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:21,117
-I shall make a feint to the northeast--
-No. Hang on.

960
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,828
- Just answer the five questions--
- Three questions.

961
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:25,872
Three questions as best you can.

962
01:18:25,955 --> 01:18:28,166
And we shall watch and pray.

963
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:29,959
I understand.

964
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:33,838
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

965
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:39,719
Stop!

966
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:45,350
Who would cross the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

967
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:48,103
ere the other side he see.

968
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:50,897
Ask me the questions, bridge keeper.
I am not afraid.

969
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,358
What is your name?

970
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,610
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

971
01:18:55,694 --> 01:19:00,073
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

972
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:03,910
- What is your favorite color?
- Blue.

973
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:05,620
Right. Off you go.

974
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:09,457
Oh, thank you very much.

975
01:19:12,919 --> 01:19:14,754
That's easy!

976
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,133
Stop!

977
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:24,139
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

978
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,641
ere the other side he see.

979
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:30,311
Ask me the questions.
I am not afraid.

980
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:33,732
- What is your name?
- Sir Robin of Camelot.

981
01:19:33,773 --> 01:19:37,444
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

982
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:40,113
What is the capital of Assyria?

983
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,909
I don't know that!

984
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,502
Stop!

985
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:58,131
- What is your name?
- Sir Galahad of Camelot.

986
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:02,260
- What is your quest?
- I seek the Grail.

987
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:05,430
What is your favorite color?

988
01:20:05,513 --> 01:20:07,849
Blue. No, yel--

989
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:18,610
Stop! What is your name?

990
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:20,695
It is Arthur, king of the Britons.

991
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:25,033
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

992
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:29,245
What is the airspeed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

993
01:20:29,287 --> 01:20:32,540
What do you mean,
an African or a European swallow?

994
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,585
I don't know that.

995
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:44,052
How do you know
so much about swallows?

996
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:46,930
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

997
01:21:26,636 --> 01:21:28,221
Lancelot?

998
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:54,456
Arthur

999
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,891
The Castle A-a-a-argh.

1000
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,436
Our quest is at an end.

1001
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:00,081
God be praised!

1002
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:05,503
Almighty God, we thank Thee...

1003
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:09,632
that Thou has brought safe to us
the most Holy--

1004
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,635
Jesus Christ!

1005
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:15,930
Hello, daffy English "kniggits"...

1006
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:19,184
and Monsieur Arthur King
who has the brain of a duck.

1007
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:22,312
So we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

1008
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:25,899
How dare you profane this place
with your presence!

1009
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:30,028
I command you, in the name
of the Knights of Camelot...

1010
01:24:30,111 --> 01:24:33,656
to open the doors
of this sacred castle...

1011
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,659
to which God Himself has guided us!

1012
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:39,746
How you English say,
I one more time...

1013
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:43,750
unclog my nose in your direction,
sons of a window dresser.

1014
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:46,503
So you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

1015
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:49,964
with your silly knees-bent,
running-about advancing behavior!

1016
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:53,051
I wave my private parts
at your aunties...

1017
01:24:53,134 --> 01:24:57,847
you cheesy lot of secondhand
electric-donkey bottom biters!

1018
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,100
In the name of the Lord...

1019
01:25:00,183 --> 01:25:03,478
we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

1020
01:25:03,561 --> 01:25:06,147
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

1021
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:11,111
I burst my pimples at you and call
your door-opening request a silly thing.

1022
01:25:11,194 --> 01:25:14,698
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms!

1023
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:19,202
If you do not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force.

1024
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:23,331
In the name of God
and the glory of our--

1025
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,711
Right! That settles it!

1026
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:30,922
Yes! Depart at this time
and cut the approaching...

1027
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:35,760
or we fire arrows into your heads and
make castanets out of your testicles.

1028
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:37,762
Walk away. Just ignore them.

1029
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:41,599
Now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger folk!

1030
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:45,145
If you think you got
a nasty taunting this time...

1031
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:47,564
you ain't heard nothing yet...

1032
01:25:47,647 --> 01:25:50,108
daffy English "kniggits"!

1033
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:14,716
- We shall attack at once!
- Yes, my Liege.

1034
01:26:14,799 --> 01:26:17,010
Stand by for attack!

1035
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,987
French persons!

1036
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:23,159
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged!

1037
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:26,663
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

1038
01:27:26,746 --> 01:27:29,374
till each one of you lies dead...

1039
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:31,376
and the Holy Grail...

1040
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:35,880
returns to those
whom God has chosen!

1041
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:37,924
Charge!

1042
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,287
Yes, they're the ones.
I'm sure.

1043
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:10,123
Don't let any of them go through.

1044
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,125
That's them. Yes.

1045
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:15,253
Move along. Come on.

1046
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,759
This one. Come on.
Put him in the van.

1047
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,927
Get a blanket on that one.

1048
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:25,597
Come on, back.
Right back. Come on.

1049
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:29,976
Put that over there.
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

1050
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:31,644
Back. Come on.

1051
01:28:33,146 --> 01:28:35,523
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Just pack that in.

1052
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:36,900
Chrisf!
