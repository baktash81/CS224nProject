1
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,848
- Dock five, the immaculata?
- It's over there!

2
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,110
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

3
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,989
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

4
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,410
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodeling.

5
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,581
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

6
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,668
Hello!

7
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,633
Mr. Stayton? Anybody home?

8
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,969
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

9
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,473
- Nice-looking Weatherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

10
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,809
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

11
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,394
That's my wife's department.

12
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,980
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

13
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,614
You're the carpenter?

14
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,077
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

15
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,370
You're late.

16
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,832
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,335
You see, I just moved up to this area...

18
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,964
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit work for years.

19
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,967
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

20
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,845
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

21
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,182
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

22
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,061
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

23
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,772
I was just... kidding.

24
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,861
Don't walk so close to me!

25
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,365
- OK! Where's your problem?
- My closet.

26
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,993
In here.

27
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,455
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

28
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,542
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

29
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,170
Excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

30
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,548
It is.

31
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,758
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

32
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,595
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

33
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,642
Hello?

34
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,441
Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

35
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,528
Isn't that what I've been
explaining in some detail?

36
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,740
Is English your second language?

37
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,578
What is that odor?

38
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,956
I don't smell anything.

39
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,334
Madam.

40
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,755
Well! I almost had to wait.

41
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,218
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

42
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,266
What is this gelatinous muck?!

43
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,103
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

44
00:05:55,271 --> 00:06:00,942
must I specify that you are to pack good
caviar and not this $1 .99 fish bait!

45
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,613
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

46
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,616
and of adequate size.

47
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,328
And it should burst in your mouth
at precisely the right moment.

48
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,249
- Yes, madam.
- Carpenter!

49
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,127
- Yeah?
- You have exactly 48 hours.

50
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,005
I suggest you get started.

51
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,175
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

52
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,054
Watch him.

53
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,236
Oh, boy. She is really something!

54
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,406
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

55
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,742
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

56
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,327
But of course!

57
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,831
- Bid 1 ,700,000.
- Shit!

58
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,126
Grant, I'm on the phone!

59
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,337
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

60
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,506
- Pull!
- Pull!

61
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,007
Firing!

62
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,149
Hello.

63
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,049
Forks were invented
so man could at least make a pretense

64
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,345
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

65
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:57,225
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

66
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,771
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

67
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,821
And another
Oregon good morning to you.

68
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,282
Wilbur Budd here with some local items.

69
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,037
The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks
are hiring people to shovel the stuff.

70
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,873
Oh, women are welcome, too.

71
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
There's no chauvinism
in the manure business.

72
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,004
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

73
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,008
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their corpses stuck to my fingers.

74
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,885
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

75
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,556
You don't have to sit here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

76
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,058
I look like a bushman.

77
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,020
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

78
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,775
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

79
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,071
He's sweating all over the place.
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

80
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,032
I think they housebreak each other...

81
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,618
- What?
- He's listening.

82
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,954
- Who?
- That carpenter.

83
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,957
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

84
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,335
It's your project, Joanna.
You deal with it.

85
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,798
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

86
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,051
- Well, let's get going.
- I've finished, madam.

87
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,805
- Shall I put your jewelry back on you?
- No.

88
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,307
I'm still tacky.

89
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,158
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

90
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,537
Well! Are we amusing you?

91
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,749
- What... is this?
- Well, I'm done. I'm finished.

92
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,668
- What do you think?
- What is it?

93
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,005
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
You ready?

94
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,758
Just turn the crank here,
those drop back, these split.

95
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,803
- Gives you twice the space...
- Stop boring me with your absurdities.

96
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,557
- What's it made of?
- It's called wood. It's oak.

97
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,685
Oak. An oak closet?

98
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,023
- Why am I even amazed?
- I don't know. Why are you amazed?

99
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,694
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

100
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,698
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

101
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,951
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

102
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,039
I just have to tell ya that's
gonna more than double my estimate.

103
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,877
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak...

104
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,714
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it

105
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,965
- on this deal.
- Why not?

106
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,178
You've eaten everything else here. And
you will eat it because I wanted cedar!

107
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,930
You may have wanted cedar,
but you didn't ask for it.

108
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,476
The entire civilized world
knows closets are made of cedar!

109
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,395
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

110
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,899
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I am housebroke!

111
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,695
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

112
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,240
- You can avoid it now, you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

113
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:03,078
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

114
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,748
The job was not
done to my satisfaction!

115
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,835
I got news for you, lady! No job will
ever be done to your satisfaction!

116
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,588
- That's quite enough! Just get out!
- No problem!

117
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,091
Pay me the 600 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

118
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,051
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

119
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,264
You know what your problem is?

120
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,226
You're so goddamn bored, you gotta
invent things to bitch about.

121
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,604
You haven't got a single thing
to do except for your hair.

122
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,606
Yeah! The closet was fine!

123
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,526
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

124
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,861
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,

125
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,572
rich-bitch, sun-tanning days!

126
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,912
- Don't touch me!
- What?

127
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,458
Hey, lady. I may be hard up,

128
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,212
but I am not that hard up.
And I'm not goin' anywhere...

129
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,964
Hey!

130
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,719
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

131
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,887
I'll get you for this, you...

132
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,975
Not my tool belt!
You owe me 600 bucks!

133
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,810
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

134
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,816
If I ever get you, lady,
you're dead meat! You got that?

135
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,401
No, don't throw that!

136
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,115
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

137
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,325
Everyone wants to be me!

138
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,078
You come back here!

139
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,915
I lost all my tools.

140
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,002
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

141
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,088
I need a steady job.
What about that nighttime thing?

142
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,

143
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,593
we'll get that miniature
golf course deal.

144
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,012
If I can hang on that long.

145
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,017
He called you a what?

146
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,813
Joanna, why are you so upset?

147
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:58,610
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

148
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,196
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

149
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:06,034
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

150
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,871
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

151
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,875
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

152
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,377
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

153
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,464
What should I do?

154
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,884
Darling, if you have a baby,

155
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,386
you won't be the baby anymore.

156
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,388
True.

157
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,642
Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy.

158
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,393
Bye-bye, sweetie.

159
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,022
I'm not a bitch.

160
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,238
Andrew! Are you going
to bring me my lemon

161
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,740
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

162
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,248
Hey, guys, I'm home!

163
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,920
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

164
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,130
Bad dogs! Go away!

165
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,509
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

166
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,263
- Are you Mr. Proffitt?
- Yeah!

167
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,931
You look like
the morning after Halloween.

168
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,767
Probably had a day like I did.
What happened to you?

169
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,270
Monday is their first day of school

170
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,191
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

171
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,903
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

172
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:28,324
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

173
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,743
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

174
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,954
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,333
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

176
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,295
I got two fire extinguishers
ready to go.

177
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,589
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Bur bridge.

178
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,966
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

179
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,594
Your children are monsters!

180
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,928
You won't think that once you know 'em!

181
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,098
Where is Mrs. Proffitt
during all of this?

182
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,100
She died three years ago.

183
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,314
Mr. Proffitt, your children are totally

184
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,441
lacking in parental supervision.

185
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,777
Hey, you don't have to tell me
these kids are lucky.

186
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,406
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

187
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,661
If you don't do something, I am going
to notify the proper authorities.

188
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,915
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

189
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,083
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

190
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,421
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance,
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

191
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,507
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr. Proffitt!

192
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,261
I'm a good father!

193
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,973
What do you know?

194
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,156
Joanna, I want you tonight.

195
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,034
How can you have your period
every week?

196
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,206
You can stow away with the rich
and famous to exotic ports of call...

197
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,875
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

198
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,546
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

199
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,509
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

200
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,388
Grant! I left my
wedding ring on the deck.

201
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,016
- Well, what can I do?
- Go and get it.

202
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,477
- It's after midnight!
- I don't care what time it is.

203
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,729
- I want it now!
- I want to see

204
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,065
who's in the top ten yachts.

205
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,734
- I'll get it!
- OK.

206
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,572
A countdown to the world's
ten best luxury yachts.

207
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,575
This is the big league
of the seven seas.

208
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,412
The one purchase that separates
mere millionaires

209
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,583
from multimillionaires.
Our number ten pick is the Loca Rohan,

210
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,753
a 167-foot Saudi-owned dreamboat,

211
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,255
docked in Tahiti.

212
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,298
Number nine, the 230...

213
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,484
Andrew!

214
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,199
Grant!

215
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,459
Oh, my hair! Help!

216
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,881
Grant! Help!

217
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,719
Stop! You idiots!

218
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,893
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at CRAB,

219
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,938
the family station,
run by me and my family.

220
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,859
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Amontillado County.

221
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,821
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot CRAB newsroom.

222
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,365
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

223
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,619
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

224
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,580
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

225
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,833
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

226
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,211
She has no recollection of who she is.

227
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,881
My wife Rose is with
the captain of the garbage scow

228
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,551
- that picked up the mystery lady. Rose?
- Mr. Tunatti.

229
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,764
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

230
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,767
Yes. We saw something
float in water like this.

231
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,645
Just like that, just like that.
We didn't know it...

232
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,772
We bring... on board.

233
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,858
- On board.
- Yes. We say... foca!

234
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,277
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

235
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,154
No, no, no, no!

236
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,199
Foca! Foca!
Foca means seal in portugues!

237
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,368
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

238
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,704
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

239
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,209
- There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti.
- Thank you.

240
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,920
Garbage I do for money.
For love, I sing.

241
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,297
- In my country, I sing.
- Isn't that interesting?

242
00:18:55,008 --> 00:19:00,388
- We have a Renaissance garbageman.
- We tell stories with our songs.

243
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,181
Thank you, Rose.

244
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,726
Arnie, can we roll
that tape now, please?

245
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:10,398
Now, folks. Here's an interview
we taped earlier at the hospital.

246
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,359
Miss, miss... do you know your name?

247
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,279
Of course I know my name!

248
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,197
It's...

249
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,867
This is absurd!

250
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,661
I know it! It...

251
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,122
Get that thing out of my face!

252
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,834
What a horrible wig!

253
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:44,432
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

254
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,934
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

255
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,769
Well, what do you know?

256
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,565
Extend your brain
a teensy little bit, if possible!

257
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,110
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

258
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,406
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

259
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,242
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

260
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,245
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

261
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,623
Listen to me, medical people.

262
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,877
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

263
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,589
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

264
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,009
Now, I refuse... refuse...

265
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,388
...to be incarcerated
in this semi-private room!

266
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,140
You snore!

267
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,976
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

268
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,146
- Is that her?
- I demand you do something!

269
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,148
Do you hear me?

270
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,485
No! I never saw her before in my life.

271
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,865
Mrs. Stayton has decided to leave me.
Let's celebrate!

272
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,996
Now, Miss... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

273
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,832
where you'll be safer,
we'll all be safer,

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,918
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

275
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,588
Well, I'm glad you've
finally come to your senses!

276
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,548
I was prepared to sue you.

277
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,843
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

278
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,315
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

279
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,527
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

280
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,779
Hi, this is Wilbur Budd.
We got some more

281
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,199
on that amnesia lady story
down there in Elk Grove.

282
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,493
Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?

283
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,122
I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

284
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,541
OK, one bag!

285
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,629
I said Elk Grove before. You know
I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?

286
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,717
The mystery woman is still suffering
from complete but temporary amnesia.

287
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,555
If you know the identity of this
woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital.

288
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,725
I'll put up the reward myself.
She's drivin' us crazy.

289
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,979
- Thank you. Back to Wilbur...
- Yo, Dean!

290
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,066
- She's not the nicest person around...
- Look at this!

291
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,569
She made some remarks about
my wife's hair, which I didn't care for.

292
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,573
But, in any event, there she is
and this is what she looks like.

293
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,742
- That's her.
- Who?

294
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,744
The bitch!

295
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:14,582
Earlier today, one man arrived on the
scene to make an identification, but...

296
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,835
I can't believe it.
He's skippin' out on her.

297
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,671
'Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

298
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,299
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

299
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,594
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

300
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,264
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

301
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,733
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

302
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,109
No.

303
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,945
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

304
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,281
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

305
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,742
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

306
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,998
I wondered if a woman
like that had a husband.

307
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,086
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognize.

308
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,462
Oh, yeah.

309
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,632
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. "JS."

310
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,803
She wouldn't 'cause, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

311
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,138
I bought my wife a garter
at a yard sale.

312
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,391
I bet you did.
Hey, what else you got in here?

313
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,393
I got some pictures.

314
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,895
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

315
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,731
Yeah! That's her.

316
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,652
Oh, yeah.
That's my little cookie cutter.

317
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,654
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

318
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,531
You got that right!

319
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,118
Doc. We got a winner.

320
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,139
Annie!

321
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,016
Stop!

322
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,353
I don't recognize this man.

323
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,356
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

324
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,152
I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

325
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,531
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

326
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,992
Oh, Annie, please!

327
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,287
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

328
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,372
That's not right. That's not my name!

329
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,042
This is completely crazy!
Honey, sit down.

330
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,297
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I am your husband.

331
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,341
My name is Dean Proffitt.

332
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,470
- We've been married for 13 years.
- Wait!

333
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,016
I admit I have
forgotten numerous things.

334
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,145
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

335
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,231
Don't you think there'd
be some spark of recognition?

336
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,151
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

337
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,745
I don't believe this! He could
be some stranger off the street!

338
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,414
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

339
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,832
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,209
Thank you.

341
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,835
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

342
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,630
- What is it?
- Mrs. Annie Proffitt!

343
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:12,092
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

344
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,470
Annie Goolihy?

345
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,889
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

346
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,518
No, no, not there!
Over in Goober, Idaho.

347
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,187
- But it's a nuclear waste dump now...
- Where did I meet you?

348
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,605
Hank's Donut World.

349
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,275
Seattle? You hung out there
every night when you were in the Navy!

350
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,945
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

351
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,656
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

352
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,116
Stop. The Navy?

353
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,701
Oh, come on, honey!

354
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,995
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

355
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,874
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

356
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,962
I need some proof!

357
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,631
Stop staring at me!

358
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,092
Eat your checkers!

359
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,805
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

360
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,182
I'm gonna need some verification.

361
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,811
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

362
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:08,607
I don't like to talk about this in
public, and I've never told anybody...

363
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,652
She does have a small

364
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,863
strawberry-like birthmark...

365
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:19,159
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek
and it's unique.

366
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,765
Come to Daddy!

367
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,909
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

368
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,330
That's something you like to do.

369
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,707
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

370
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,044
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

371
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,089
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

372
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,556
I just... ate a bug!

373
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,064
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

374
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,086
Welcome home, baby!

375
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,172
I feel faint.

376
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,135
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

377
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,847
No. This is wrong.

378
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,393
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

379
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,606
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognize the place myself.

380
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,110
We moved here... deliberately?

381
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,865
Our last place was a real dump.

382
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,744
Come on.

383
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,749
Our new palace!

384
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,802
Well! Let me...

385
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,513
Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

386
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,434
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that.

387
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:52,396
It's comin' back already. Everything
slants down here toward the bedroom.

388
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,316
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

389
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,238
And here we are at the old....
magic room.

390
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,450
Put a lot of miles on that mattress.

391
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,912
Later. All right!

392
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,040
Here's where we have
breakfast every morning. Let's go up...

393
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,585
Here they come!

394
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,632
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't.

395
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,676
- It slipped out of his hands!
- He did!

396
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:27,181
Hey, hey, guys! Hey, look who's home!

397
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,184
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

398
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,437
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

399
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,732
We're so glad you're back.

400
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,527
They're... They're not mine.

401
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,114
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

402
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,701
Well, I think I'd remember
if I had three...

403
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,329
Four, honey! Don't forget little Joe.

404
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,335
Well, that's about it, except for...

405
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,093
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

406
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,554
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

407
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,182
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

408
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,476
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

409
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,353
Hey, a dirty magazine!

410
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,396
Baby doll!

411
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,194
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

412
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,322
Let's forget for a moment
that it's a rag,

413
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,866
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

414
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,578
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

415
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:36,708
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

416
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,961
You used to be like a balloon!

417
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,093
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes! Yes, you had a bad back.

418
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,721
You walked kinda hunched over,
you know?

419
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,561
I was short and fat?

420
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,022
Look, I'm sure you've
got a million questions.

421
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,026
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

422
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,530
First, let's meet the boys.
In the middle we've got the twins:

423
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,116
Greg and Charlie.
He likes to invent things.

424
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,451
- Twins?
- Yeah.

425
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,496
- Obviously, they're not identical.
- Or I'd look like a shithead!

426
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,040
Who asked you, butthole?!

427
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,628
They came out fighting
and they're still at it! Guys, guys!

428
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,799
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

429
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,969
He's the actor in the family.
Then we got the big guy!

430
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,138
Eleven pounds, five ounces.

431
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,474
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

432
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,898
Roy?

433
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,321
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

434
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,656
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

435
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,118
- Hey, what are you...?
- Wait, wait, wait!

436
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,081
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

437
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,500
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

438
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,671
- A falsetto child?
- He thinks he's Pee-Wee Herman.

439
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,882
I love Pee-Wee Herman.

440
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,676
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

441
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,514
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

442
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,351
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

443
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,811
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

444
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,777
- They're great boys, aren't they?
- There's so many of them.

445
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,030
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

446
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,366
...we'll just keep on tryin'.

447
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,619
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

448
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,789
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

449
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,166
They don't look anything like me!

450
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,043
They do take after your mother.

451
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,879
Let's hope they don't grow up
to be lushes, too.

452
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,840
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

453
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,510
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

454
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,057
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

455
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:01,436
- Due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear anymore!

456
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,689
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

457
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,526
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

458
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,905
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

459
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,033
What is it I normally do?

460
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,579
I prepared and handled raw food?

461
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,417
I hunt it. You cook it.

462
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,211
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

463
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,923
- Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.
- Yeah!

464
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,342
It's strange, but...

465
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,263
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

466
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:41,101
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

467
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,103
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

468
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,606
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

469
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,568
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

470
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,495
You're gonna make
that turtle sick again.

471
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,873
You gotta breathe on it.

472
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,086
Look at me, Dad!

473
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,549
Nothing's happening.

474
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,804
Well, pumpkin,
you gotta light the burner.

475
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,643
Thirty seconds.

476
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,439
Twenty-nine, 28, 27...

477
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,653
Fire, fire!

478
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,324
Hey, come here. Sit down.

479
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,202
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

480
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,829
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

481
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,664
Ouch!

482
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,512
OK, let's see, we...

483
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,222
Way to hustle, guys!

484
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,349
You all right?

485
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,685
Well, now we know they work.

486
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,357
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

487
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,901
Where are you going?

488
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,531
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

489
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,201
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

490
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,539
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

491
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,042
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

492
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,962
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

493
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,384
- When are you coming home?
- When I feel like it.

494
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,469
It just depends on how drunk I get.

495
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,488
How's it goin' with your debutante?

496
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,908
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

497
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:06,830
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day?

498
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,417
Figure little wifey-poo can
work off what she owes me in...

499
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,252
...a little over a month.

500
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,087
Your first night with her?

501
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,632
Come on!

502
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,137
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

503
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,432
And a pretty decent face...
She's too rich for my blood!

504
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,102
Chocolate cake's a bit rich, too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

505
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,772
Not my style. 'Course,
eating a whole cake isn't, either.

506
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,941
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

507
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,152
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

508
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,989
- Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.
- Perfect.

509
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,828
- Wait! Wait!
- You jumped my bones

510
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,538
the first night we met!

511
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,210
- We did it on the first date?
- I couldn't call it a date, really.

512
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,838
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

513
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,091
I'm a slut.

514
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,885
Nothing.

515
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,141
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

516
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,644
it might take me a while to get there.

517
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,481
What? No boom-boom?

518
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,151
Well, hey, I understand.

519
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,656
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff?

520
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,241
- Yes.
- OK.

521
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,160
Thank you. No boom-boom.

522
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,331
Baby.

523
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,459
- The couch.
- What?

524
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,922
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

525
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,841
That's why you always sleep
on the living room couch.

526
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:01,695
I'm a short... fat... slut.

527
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,212
Get off of my body! Rover!

528
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,138
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

529
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,307
Time to get up.

530
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,643
Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

531
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,563
I don't care
if they don't go to school.

532
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,359
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

533
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,821
Bye, Mom!

534
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,783
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7:15, let's go!

535
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,410
Hurry up, Mom!

536
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,839
Roy. Roy!

537
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,967
My name is Travis.

538
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,595
Travis.

539
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,682
Travis!

540
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,813
- Come on, Joey.
- Stop honking!

541
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,279
Twin! Oh, twin!

542
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,781
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

543
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,369
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

544
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,664
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

545
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,416
I'm off to work.

546
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,669
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

547
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,716
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

548
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,011
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

549
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,637
See ya tonight.

550
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,974
- Dean?
- Zippety doo dah

551
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,309
Zippety yay

552
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,395
My, oh my, I got a wonderful slave

553
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,439
And you are a genius!

554
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:42,040
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

555
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,838
Down! Down!

556
00:41:53,219 --> 00:42:01,518
Jim Dandy to the rescue

557
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:22,622
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

558
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,377
Dinner! Dinner!

559
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,496
She needs food.

560
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,542
This is fun.

561
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,922
Hey, guys.

562
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,012
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

563
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,474
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

564
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,310
She's been like that for an hour now.

565
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,188
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

566
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,317
- Yeah, she's not going, "Ba-ba-ba..."
- Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

567
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,696
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

568
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,406
She ripped the sucker's head off!

569
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:24,911
I like when she goes,
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

570
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,373
Hey! Baby doll!

571
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,000
What's for dinner?

572
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,009
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

573
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,431
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

574
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,142
Come on, guys! Move it!

575
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,527
Feel better?

576
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:02,949
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

577
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,244
I can't do any of these vile things

578
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,955
and I wouldn't want to!

579
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,082
My life is like death!

580
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,461
My children are the spawn of hell,
and you're the devil.

581
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,922
Oh, God...

582
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,681
Baby, we like you.

583
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,935
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

584
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,272
- No more, "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba."
- Good. All right.

585
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,648
- Dad?
- Yeah?

586
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,400
Will she figure out we're tricking her?

587
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,069
Not if we don't blow it.

588
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,492
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

589
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,494
Memora-what?

590
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,331
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

591
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,668
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

592
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,338
Do we or do we not possess these things?

593
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,799
Well...

594
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,386
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

595
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:09,182
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

596
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,560
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because...

597
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,480
...you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

598
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,316
And it's possible that...

599
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,901
...we lost...

600
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,212
The closet...

601
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,548
...and you.

602
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,552
That's right. This is me,

603
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,555
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

604
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,308
Something's familiar.

605
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,063
You got it.
We used to do it in the closet.

606
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,565
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

607
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,692
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

608
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,321
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

609
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,157
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

610
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,285
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

611
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,496
All right. Good night, honey.

612
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,409
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

613
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,369
Billy, I want you to do me a favor.

614
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,872
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

615
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,956
- Who's that?
- No one.

616
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,624
Hey, is that Dean?

617
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,460
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

618
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,254
If you treat me like that,
I'm goin' home.

619
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,048
Come on, Gertie, don't be like that!

620
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,343
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

621
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:13,472
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not anymore. She's goin' home.

622
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,850
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

623
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,813
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

624
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,482
Oh, yeah.
Your dad showed up shit-faced.

625
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,777
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

626
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,655
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

627
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,743
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

628
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,330
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I always this miserable?

629
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:41,000
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

630
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,878
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

631
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,882
Look at this. Before you lost
the weight. Can you believe it?

632
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,386
All right. Now, that's it.
Are you satisfied?

633
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,848
- Yes.
- Good.

634
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,269
I suppose I belong here
in this... hovel.

635
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,689
Come on, Jackson!

636
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,068
Well, this is my life.

637
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,820
I didn't marry very well, did I?

638
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,577
Your body

639
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,456
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

640
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,084
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

641
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,002
Tofutti! I love it!

642
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,797
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

643
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,341
You're Kim and Kimberly...

644
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,552
- The Stayton yacht.
- Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs. Mintz.

645
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,471
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

646
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,848
I'd like to speak to my daughter.

647
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,268
They're not here, madam.
They've gone shopping.

648
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,695
A little bit lower.
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

649
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,741
That's good. That's good.

650
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,746
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

651
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,915
Why does he keep staring at me?

652
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,126
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

653
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,253
with his mouth open all through dinner.

654
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:11,257
Well, honey,
Billy was your high school boyfriend.

655
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,138
You don't get any of the old feelings
back when you look at him, do you?

656
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,732
I don't wanna do it!

657
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:31,777
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

658
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,780
It's part of the initiation!
Think about it.

659
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,492
That's good. Thanks a lot. Yeah.

660
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,789
Sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

661
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,917
Well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe... just one more...

662
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,128
...six-pack!

663
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,385
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

664
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,012
That's all the beer.

665
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,973
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

666
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,476
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

667
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,479
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

668
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:11,275
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

669
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,903
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

670
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,493
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

671
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,914
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

672
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,999
What's the score? I had my eyes closed.

673
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,501
Thirty-two-ten.

674
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,545
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

675
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,769
- Great!
- Who did this?!

676
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,063
Travis!

677
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,316
Hey, honey, what happened?

678
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,528
This happened.

679
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,242
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering!

680
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,369
- You won't punish them!
- Ease up there, love chop!

681
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:08,165
- Just ease up.
- Ease up? Ease up?

682
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,544
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

683
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,712
scrubbed, chopped wood.

684
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,383
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

685
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,803
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life,

686
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,348
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

687
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,393
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

688
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,228
Well, it bothers me now.

689
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,192
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

690
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,405
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today.

691
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,574
You really got her where you want her.

692
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,201
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

693
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,080
- This is flat. Give me another one.
- I only got six.

694
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,792
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

695
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,093
Good stuff!

696
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,387
Your chocolate cream pie.

697
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,105
Thanks, honey.

698
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,483
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

699
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,865
Honey, we need forks!

700
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,035
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

701
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,374
Wait a minute!

702
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,298
Fire, fire, fire!

703
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,097
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

704
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,980
- Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.
- She never did that before.

705
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,649
She did it now!

706
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,777
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

707
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,655
She went this way, guys!

708
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,990
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

709
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,535
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

710
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,500
I got you!

711
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,128
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

712
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,301
That hurts!

713
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,347
Leave me alone!

714
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,768
All right, time to get up.

715
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,355
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

716
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,108
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

717
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,320
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

718
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,531
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

719
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,159
I don't want to!
The teacher's a big fat tub!

720
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,246
Proffitt boys, come up here!

721
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:59,128
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

722
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,714
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

723
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,049
You may go stand in the corner

724
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,552
until you can talk like a little boy!

725
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,055
All of you children
are new in this school.

726
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,851
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

727
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,353
You must concentrate...

728
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,980
- Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

729
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,733
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

730
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,571
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

731
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,698
I see that, Amanda.

732
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,783
Joey, sit!

733
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,496
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

734
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,292
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

735
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,962
Yeah. We got a new mother now.

736
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,883
Well, good.
Then I'm calling both your parents!

737
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,892
Mrs. Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

738
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,563
Well, Mrs. Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

739
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,399
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

740
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,861
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

741
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:10,991
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

742
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,371
Sit still!
Your children are a discipline problem.

743
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,791
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

744
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,878
- What did you do now?
- They decided to play sick!

745
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,506
And not very convincingly.

746
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:30,135
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

747
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,971
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

748
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,349
and being reared by a father

749
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,102
who clearly isn't concerned
about their welfare,

750
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,146
but is himself just a large child!

751
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,983
- Excuse me, Mrs. Burbridge.
- The test results. Thank you.

752
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:49,154
I'll look these over as soon
as I'm finished with this... woman.

753
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,281
Oh, my God.

754
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,664
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

755
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,335
Mrs. Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

756
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:09,508
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

757
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,261
Well, no... Yes, but...

758
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:16,140
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

759
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:20,477
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

760
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:25,149
Tests which label children's potential,
a thing which cannot be measured!

761
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,026
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

762
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,907
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

763
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,618
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

764
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,288
And I think that they're
bright and sensitive.

765
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,124
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

766
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,044
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

767
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,047
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

768
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,549
Move!

769
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:57,890
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

770
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,641
Discipline problem?

771
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,479
My regards to Schwartzman and Heinliken.

772
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,191
I can't stop itching!

773
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,819
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

774
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:17,242
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

775
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,702
OK?

776
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,414
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.

777
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,876
- We like it like a disgrace.
- Dad lets us do whatever we want!

778
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,587
Yeah, well, it's trickling
down the stairway.

779
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,091
Joey, don't. Don't get that near your
eyes. Look, I want you to read this.

780
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,887
See what it says?
"Don't get near your eyes." Read on.

781
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:47,773
- What's this all about?
- He's embarrassed 'cause he can't read.

782
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,399
- Well, he's a small child.
- He can't read

783
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,528
- for a small child either.
- The teacher makes fun of him!

784
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,950
OK, we'll talk about this later.
Go to sleep.

785
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,327
- Dean!
- Where is that?

786
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,828
- Dean!
- Yeah!

787
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,206
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

788
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,084
Out. If I could ever find my...

789
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,795
Oh, wait. Wait!

790
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,214
Not tonight! We have to talk.

791
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,051
- When I get home. I'm in a hurry.
- Now!

792
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,556
You know, I let the water routine
slide by the other day,

793
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,015
but let's not push it, OK?

794
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,435
I got a little carried away with
the hose, but this is important.

795
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,397
OK, fine. What's on your mind,
sugarlips?

796
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,483
Stop calling me sugarlips!
I have a name. Call me Annie.

797
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:35,112
Get to the point, Annie. I'm busy.
The guys are waitin' for me.

798
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,449
You can't run out every time things get
complicated here. The kids are sick!

799
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,244
They got calamine lotion.
What do you want me to do?

800
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,663
Take on some grown-up responsibility!

801
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,291
I earn the money.
That's a responsibility.

802
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:52,212
Are you aware that Joey can't read?
That Travis only reads smut magazines?

803
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,131
I can't get him out of the bathroom.

804
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,758
He's 13!
I'll build you another bathroom!

805
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,637
They don't need that!
They need guidance from you!

806
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:05,100
Now, don't you worry about me
and my boys, OK? We're pals.

807
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,769
They have enough pals.
They need a father.

808
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,732
Hey, hey, hey, look. I decided
a long time before you... you and me...

809
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:15,736
We decided a long time ago,
before we started this family,

810
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:19,031
we'd raise these kids naturally,
not force bullshit rules...

811
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,908
I'm not talking about discipline.
I'm talking...

812
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:26,747
Stuff you shouldn't be talking about!
It's none of your business, anyway.

813
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,751
- My children are none of my business?
- Look... I have... Now I'm late!

814
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,253
Thanks a lot! Appreciate it.

815
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,550
Say, Annie. Are you asleep?

816
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,720
No. Go away.

817
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:24,930
Listen. I'm...

818
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:29,559
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard before.

819
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,355
- It's OK.
- Just so you won't think

820
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,733
I don't appreciate all the work
you're doin' in the house

821
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,945
and how you handle the kids
and all that...

822
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,407
You know, I think you're doin' great.

823
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:49,287
I mean, what you said about me
and the boys tonight...

824
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,373
I guess you probably...

825
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:56,420
You know, maybe you got a small point
there, and I just... I can't...

826
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,756
I can't talk to you
while you're turned away.

827
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,801
- Will you please get your head out?
- No.

828
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,761
- No!
- Why?

829
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,808
Because I'm so ugly.

830
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,019
I got poison oak, too!

831
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,648
Come on, now.
Nobody cares what you look like.

832
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:21,153
I mean, we do like the way you look.
Normally you look real pretty.

833
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,988
You just don't now.

834
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,366
All right, forget it.

835
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,871
I don't even have a wedding ring!

836
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:35,834
- What?
- I lost my wedding ring in the sea.

837
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,422
OK, come on. Come on.

838
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:42,883
Let's go.

839
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,678
Oh, no.
I'm not going back in the water barrel!

840
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,266
I'm puttin' you in the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

841
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,561
Oh, hey, listen.
I've had poison oak a million times.

842
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,355
Come on, guys. Up! Up!

843
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:01,777
Yeah. You know,
I once got poison oak on my bu... back.

844
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,695
And...

845
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:08,158
Well, don't you worry. It'll be
gone in no time. Lift your head.

846
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,036
- That's it. Is that better?
- Yeah.

847
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,497
- All right?
- Yes.

848
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,460
Tell me something about my life,
about my past. Please.

849
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,421
Something not horrible.

850
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,716
OK.

851
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,057
Yeah. Well, there was that time...

852
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,392
...when you were...

853
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,686
You were working at...

854
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,731
...yeah, Burger Boy over in Lewisville.

855
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:44,069
And this kid started
choking on a French fry.

856
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,447
Everybody there panicked,
including me, except for you.

857
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:53,411
You ran over to him and you gave him
that Heimlich maneuver, where you...

858
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,623
And poof! The kid puked up the fry

859
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,626
and they named you
Burger Boy employee of the month.

860
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:04,047
It was great. They put your picture
above the cash register and...

861
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:07,300
I was really proud of you. I mean it.

862
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,973
You can be quite charming
when you wanna be.

863
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,853
You just caught me on a bad day.

864
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,440
Good night... Annie.

865
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,443
Good night.

866
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,662
- Heads up!
- After I finished with the Coast Guard,

867
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,291
I looked up Dean.
We used to play football together.

868
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,961
Used to call him Mean Dean Proffitt.
Used to call me Bad Billy Pratt.

869
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,298
- Out!
- Now, Billy, when did we date?

870
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,135
Let's eat!

871
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,431
- It might be...
- Are we talking about the golf course?

872
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,350
Yeah. The guys with suits
come down in less than a week.

873
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,144
What do you think about this?

874
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,814
Sink 'Em and Drink 'Em.
18 holes based on famous breweries.

875
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,525
I think what I thought yesterday.
It's a lousy idea.

876
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,194
I thought you'd change your mind
now you're sober.

877
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,823
What about other places? Foreign places.

878
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,451
What do you mean?
Like France or Africa?

879
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,623
I speak French!

880
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,666
It just came out.

881
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,628
Do I know what I said?

882
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,504
Yes, I do.

883
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,007
I must have learned that in Paris.

884
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,468
When was I in Paris?

885
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,679
In the Navy.

886
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:38,141
- Navy.
- It's a stupid idea in any language.

887
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,685
Besides, we're building
these things in America.

888
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,188
Wait a minute. This isn't a bad idea.

889
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,191
I could invent some
wild things here. Go on.

890
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,945
Well, like... the Taj Mahal,
Seven Wonders of the World.

891
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:54,282
- Bring them to the people of Elk Cove!
- Well, I gotta bring it in for a price.

892
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,077
I can bring it in,
but can you draw me some pictures

893
01:05:57,244 --> 01:06:00,288
so I can see what you mean? Annie?

894
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,045
- What's this?
- Travis found a girlfriend.

895
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,131
Hey, Trav! Don't knock her up!

896
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,095
- Very funny! Watch your...
- Oh, Mom!

897
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,472
Yeah, "Oh, Mom!" Watch your language!

898
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,724
Come on! What are you talkin' about?

899
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,394
- Pick a wonder.
- Stevie Wonder.

900
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,145
- Pick another.
- Wonder Bread.

901
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,232
- Give me a wonder. One wonder.
- There's Mount Rushmore.

902
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,192
- The Parthenon.
- Parthenon, right.

903
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,488
- St. Basil's, the Russian cathedral.
- Grand Canyon. Everybody'll love that!

904
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,699
- Egyptian pyramids.
- The Eiffel Tower.

905
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:41,246
It's expensive. I gotta build...
If it rains... Hey, fiberglass! Perfect!

906
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,211
Let's clean up for an early dinner.
I've got a lot of drawing to do.

907
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,255
Isn't Dad gonna eat with us tonight?

908
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,383
No! He had to go out.

909
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,219
- He had to go bowling this time.
- Really?

910
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,389
It's pretty hard to go bowling
without a bowling ball.

911
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:18,450
I know I done you wrong

912
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,619
Do you remember
that rainy evening I put you out

913
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,830
With nothin' but a fine-toothed comb

914
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,540
What would you want
with old sweet-mouth?

915
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,626
Ain't that a shame, I know I'm to blame

916
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,796
Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

917
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:40,138
Scott Murphy,
bring your invoice up to the front.

918
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,683
This ain't your average
pile of fertilizer here.

919
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,313
No, siree.
This here's a special blend.

920
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:53,485
Fish heads, shrimp skins,
crab claws, earthworm droppings...

921
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,987
I don't wanna know that much about it.

922
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:59,115
- Here you go.
- After this, you shovel fish guts!

923
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,576
If you're lucky,
we'll let you clean the truck!

924
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:06,581
- I forgot to give you this.
- What have I got to put on airs for?

925
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,833
Oh, stop fussing. You look great.

926
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,378
Well, they put their pants on
just like me, one leg at a time.

927
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,507
Now, don't be nervous, OK?

928
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,425
If you don't get it, so what?

929
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,678
We've been through
rougher times than these before.

930
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,098
I think.

931
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:32,440
Gentlemen, this is Dean Proffitt,
inventor and master craftsman.

932
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,401
What we're here
for this evening is this.

933
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:39,489
It's the Wonders of the World
miniature golf course.

934
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:43,535
If you look at these pictures,
you can begin to sort of feel...

935
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:47,914
What we're trying to do is bring some
of this outer world here into Elk Cove.

936
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,917
The Leaning Tower of Pizza
doubles as a pizza stand.

937
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,420
That sort of gives us an idea
of where we might go in the future.

938
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,925
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
Here, let me get that.

939
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,469
Waitress! Get over here, will you?

940
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,723
Have you ever been nervous in your life?

941
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:14,649
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me if we got the money.

942
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,569
- Did you get the money?
- We got the money!

943
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:21,322
- Great! That's so great!
- Can you believe it?!

944
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:32,250
Step up! She rolls up here... and down.

945
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,922
It's got three choices. This time,
it's going through the oil funnel,

946
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:42,177
past the plastic fan, into
the kids' sand shovel and flour sifter.

947
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:46,139
Now, turn around quick. Here it comes.
It should be out about now.

948
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,267
- OK, now show me your invention.
- You're gonna hate it.

949
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,269
I'm not gonna hate it. I love 'em.

950
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,151
That's nice.

951
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,118
I gotta tell her, Billy.
I gotta tell Annie the truth.

952
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:10,121
In the beginning, it was OK
because it was part of a gag.

953
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,958
Now, it's more like lies. I...
I know what you're thinkin'.

954
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,795
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.
- Yeah, you are and I'm gonna tell her.

955
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,964
I know it's time to tell her!

956
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,012
Dr. Death looks mad.

957
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,350
- Joker's saying, "No".
- I know. What does he say up here?

958
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:33,353
"I will re... re... re..."

959
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,982
- Reduce.
- "Reduce your puny planet to rub..."

960
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,110
- Ru... ru..
- Rubble.

961
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,905
Good! That's very good, sweetie.

962
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,616
Are you gonna leave?

963
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,412
No. I'm your mommy.

964
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,165
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Sometimes moms leave.

965
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:58,503
Well, I guess maybe they do.
But I'm not gonna go anywhere.

966
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,213
Good.

967
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,926
What is this?
Is this a present for me?

968
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,638
- Yes. I made it from macaroni.
- I love it.

969
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,974
I'll always wear it.

970
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,936
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi! How's it goin', guys?

971
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,522
I got the part of Tiny Tim
in the school play.

972
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,024
- I got an A in English.
- I'm flunkin' math.

973
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:24,070
Well, I guess we better
work on it later on.

974
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,156
You're just in time.
Dr. Death is on the rampage.

975
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,702
Annie, I need to talk to you.

976
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,704
Alone, guys.

977
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,627
- Is something wrong?
- Well...

978
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,380
No. Yeah. Yeah.

979
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,551
No, I just... I need to tell
you somethin'. Here, sit down.

980
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,803
What is it?

981
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,057
Annie, I've done...
I've done something that...

982
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,060
...I'm ashamed of. And I just...

983
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:59,314
- I already know.
- You do?

984
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,610
- What... What do you know?
- You work nights

985
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,279
at the fertilizer plant.

986
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,202
You don't have to be ashamed
because you shovel fish guts.

987
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,956
I'm proud of you, no matter what you do.

988
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:20,084
- Is that it?
- Well, that's one of the things,

989
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:23,546
but I... No. Not really.

990
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,591
What is it?

991
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,140
Annie...

992
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,938
I...

993
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,109
I... God, I forgot your birthday.

994
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,946
- It's my birthday?
- Come on! Get dressed!

995
01:12:55,412 --> 01:13:03,461
Jim Dandy to the rescue

996
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,964
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

997
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,884
I'm sittin' on a mountain top

998
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,804
30,000 feet to drop

999
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,556
Spied a lady on a runaway horse

1000
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,059
Uh-huh, that's right, of course!

1001
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,895
Jim Dandy to the rescue

1002
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:24,148
Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

1003
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:28,319
- Come on, I've had it!
- What? Are we goin' home?

1004
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,321
- What?
- Are we going home?

1005
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,491
- Oh, no. I just... Aren't you hot?
- Yeah. Let's go outside.

1006
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,535
- Come on!
- Hey, let's not forget this.

1007
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,870
- It's $7 a pop.
- Don't worry about what it costs.

1008
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,373
It's your birthday! I got it covered.

1009
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,337
Just one last toast to your birthday.

1010
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:50,550
- I lost my bottom.
- Wait a minute.

1011
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:54,512
There! They always do that.
Now, this is...

1012
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,806
- Happy birthday, Annie.
- Thanks, Dean.

1013
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,102
I've never tasted
anything quite like this.

1014
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,604
It's good stuff.

1015
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,731
Boy, it sure is pretty, isn't it?

1016
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,986
Why do they honk three times?

1017
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,071
To signal they're comin' home.

1018
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,199
Yeah, it's a legend... of Arturo,

1019
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:17,702
who was a Portuguese fisherman.

1020
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,997
He met this beautiful girl
his first night in town, Catarina.

1021
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,167
And eventually they fell in love.

1022
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:28,504
But the problem was that Catarina's
father was the territorial governor.

1023
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,674
He didn't want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman.

1024
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,886
So he told Arturo
that he'd have to ship off,

1025
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:38,514
which he did, but he told Catarina
he'd be back for her.

1026
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:42,560
And when he came back,
he'd signal with three long blasts

1027
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:47,106
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat, and they'd be on their way.

1028
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,317
Oh, I love this story.

1029
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,236
So, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1030
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,572
But when she
was swimmin' out to the boat,

1031
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,784
the fog got so thick that
she couldn't find the boat.

1032
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:02,788
Arturo panicked
and he called out, "Catarina! Catarina!"

1033
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:05,208
Catarina yelled back, "Arturo!"

1034
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:09,545
With that, he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters, and they...

1035
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,131
- Kissed.
- No, they drowned.

1036
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,675
They never found each other
and they drowned.

1037
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:18,095
- Oh, that's a terrible story!
- Yeah, but the legend is

1038
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:22,517
they reunited at the bottom of the sea,
right over there,

1039
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:26,687
and every time you see
the spray goin' up, it's them.

1040
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,775
- Making love?
- Yeah.

1041
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,985
For ever and ever.

1042
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:46,624
For I can't help

1043
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,127
Falling in love...

1044
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,298
Dean?

1045
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,218
What, Annie?

1046
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,429
How old am I?

1047
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,645
Twenty-nine.

1048
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,877
- Dean.
- Yeah?

1049
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,546
Was it always like this?

1050
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:20,301
Every time with you
is like the first time.

1051
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,453
Oh, come on, guys!

1052
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,747
Hey, let us sleep for a while!

1053
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,916
Right, that's it! I'm gonna spank 'em.

1054
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,586
- No! Dean, please don't.
- Every one of them's gonna get it!

1055
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,172
Surprise!

1056
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,424
- A washing machine!
- Do you like it?

1057
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:03,552
Honey, it's so expensive.

1058
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,429
No shit!

1059
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,892
Thank you.

1060
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,019
She might have no tits,
but she has a nice ass.

1061
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,354
What did he say?

1062
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,246
Grant?

1063
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,207
Edith. Hello.

1064
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,294
This is ludicrous, Grant.
I have called every week for two months.

1065
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:39,171
I've looked forward to each call.

1066
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:42,717
Do you have the gall to tell me
that I've missed her again?

1067
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,594
- She's sleeping.
- I don't believe you.

1068
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:49,640
Grant, if you do not produce Joanna
in one week,

1069
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:53,477
I am going to hire a mass
of mercenaries to hunt you down

1070
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,440
and chop off the protruding parts
of your body. Is that clear?

1071
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:00,818
I'll find her. I mean,
you'll have your daughter soon. Bye!

1072
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:05,156
Andrew. Point the boat
back to Elk Snout.

1073
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,659
You and Mommy are going
to take a little trip, aren't we?

1074
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,495
We's gonna go bye-bye, yes!

1075
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:18,502
- Sit there and don't get dirty!
- I hate this.

1076
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,130
It's not so bad to get dressed up
every once in a while.

1077
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,591
It's like the goddamn Brady Bunch!

1078
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:27,511
- Dad's here!
- Mom, Dad's home!

1079
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,597
Hey, guys!

1080
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,477
I gotta go put on a suit.
Gertie's picking me up.

1081
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:37,021
How can you go hunting
on such an important day?

1082
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,190
Easy.
Pheasant don't play miniature golf.

1083
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,275
Hunting calms Billy down, honey.

1084
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,446
- The ceremonies start in an hour.
- Billy, hang this guy out.

1085
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,199
Sweetie, I'll be ready... in a second.

1086
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,577
I lent the station wagon to Gertie
so we have to take the truck.

1087
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,704
God! What a mess.

1088
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,541
Feathers!

1089
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:10,763
"JS."

1090
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,226
Honey, would you hand me a towel there?

1091
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,977
Thanks.

1092
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,188
What... What is this?

1093
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,732
No, that's my question.
They were in the truck.

1094
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,277
These are... I dunno what these are.
I... Who...

1095
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,614
Here. I... We gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

1096
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,407
Thanks for putting
my clothes on the bed.

1097
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,993
- Oh, stop it!
- This is nothing!

1098
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,330
Nothing?
I gave you the best years of my life.

1099
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,249
I've raised your children.

1100
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:42,086
I bore your fruit four times
and you tell me this is nothing?

1101
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,421
You're making a big deal
out of a little thing.

1102
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:47,508
It's the number one cause
of divorce in this country.

1103
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,803
Where's my jacket? What divorce?
What are you saying...

1104
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,722
- I'm saying what I'm saying.
- You're saying what you're saying!

1105
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:57,393
- What, you wanna divorce?
- Well... yeah, maybe I do!

1106
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,063
- Well, you can't have one.
- Oh, really. I can have a divorce.

1107
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,692
- Where did I put my damn boots?
- I can get a divorce if I want to.

1108
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,777
I don't need your permission.

1109
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,739
Do you love her?

1110
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,995
Do you?

1111
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:18,998
Tell me.

1112
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,751
Honestly? Yes and no.

1113
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:26,422
- More yes than no?
- This is unbelievable! How did you...?!

1114
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:33,470
I'm glad this happened.
I've been tryin' to figure out a way

1115
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:36,223
to tell you this for ever.
Come here. Sit down.

1116
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,975
I wanna tell you something.

1117
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,145
JS is you.

1118
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,315
These are yours and we're not married.
There. God, I finally said it!

1119
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,650
What's her name? Jacqueline? Josie?

1120
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,320
Honey, I'm not your husband
and you're not my wife.

1121
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:52,448
Is she from that fertilizer plant?
Does she hand out shovels?

1122
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,284
These aren't your kids!
You didn't bear anything!

1123
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:59,163
- Don't change the subject! Who is she?!
- Forget it! Come here!

1124
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,458
Guys, we gotta talk and this is serious.

1125
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,836
- Mom, we're still all clean!
- I just told her about her not

1126
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,631
being your mother
and I want you to tell her, too.

1127
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,846
- Go ahead, tell her.
- Dad, tell her what?

1128
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:19,058
- Tell her she's not your mother.
- But she is our mother!

1129
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,310
No. Don't tell her
what I told you to tell her.

1130
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,439
Just tell her the truth now, OK?
Tell her about the day she came home!

1131
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,900
She went for a swim.
We were really worried.

1132
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,610
I was up all night pacing.

1133
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:34,365
- You'd never seen her before!
- Don't speak to my children that way!

1134
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:39,995
- What do you think you're doing?
- We won't let you ruin everything.

1135
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:42,665
- We're keepin' her.
- She doesn't belong to you!

1136
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:45,292
She didn't belong to you,
but that didn't stop you!

1137
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,462
- I had my reasons!
- So do we.

1138
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,382
- We like her, Dad!
- You like her, do you?

1139
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:54,218
So much you'd rather live with her
than your own father?!

1140
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,770
- Found 'em in the glove compartment?
- Yeah. Tell me every sordid detail.

1141
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,773
Who is JS and what does she do to Dean?

1142
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:10,901
- Annie...
- Tell me everything. Be honest with me.

1143
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,071
Annie... That's my underwear.

1144
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:18,742
- What?
- I don't mean I wear it or anything.

1145
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,912
- It belongs to a girlfriend.
- What about Gertie?

1146
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,708
I strayed. See, I got lucky
with this phone-sex girl one night.

1147
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,585
I found one that accepted
personal checks and...

1148
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:32,423
You see, I don't have a back seat
in my truck so I... I used yours.

1149
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,676
Dean doesn't want you to tell Gert,
so he's covering for me.

1150
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,471
- What are you talking about?
- I confessed. The jig is up.

1151
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:42,266
The jig is up! I'm finally
trying to tell her the truth.

1152
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,018
I just did.

1153
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,479
See, I didn't get the reputation
for being Bad Billy Pratt by accident.

1154
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:50,107
Annie, I'm sorry.

1155
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,942
I got horny.

1156
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,779
- Do you hate me?
- Oh, no, I don't hate you.

1157
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:59,867
- I'm glad you're bad, Billy Pratt.
- Biggest load of bullshit I've seen.

1158
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:04,788
Honey, honey. Phone-for-sex girls
don't come to your truck, honey. They...

1159
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:08,584
No, stop trying to cover for him,
sweetie. Let's just forget it.

1160
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:12,296
Pretty expensive panties.
You can have these back.

1161
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,382
That girl must have more than one phone.

1162
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:18,802
Pretty good, huh?

1163
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,222
You did this to protect your ass
because you faked my pictures?

1164
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,268
No, I did it to protect your ass, OK?
You belong with her.

1165
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,498
Oh, cute.

1166
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:51,335
Mom! Help, he has my hand.

1167
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,713
Why do you stick your hands
in people's mouths, anyway?

1168
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,882
Let's go. Let's go to another one.

1169
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:10,437
I have been calling all over Elk Cove.

1170
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:16,193
No, no. Don't worry. No, no.
I will try Portland for a limousine.

1171
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,030
I really don't have anything
to say except that...

1172
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:23,408
...there would be no Wonders
of the World miniature golf course

1173
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:28,205
if it wasn't for the imagination
and the creativity of one woman.

1174
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,917
That's my Annie.
Annie, you wanna come up here?

1175
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,468
I love you, Annie.
I want you to be with me always.

1176
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,569
Everybody, play ball!

1177
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,490
Let's go clean up.

1178
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,777
- Hey, Dad! Whose car is that?
- Maybe it's a rich relative.

1179
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:45,115
- Sure, it's Daddy Warbucks!
- Maybe we won the lottery.

1180
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:09,306
Hi, Grant!
I just have to put these in some water.

1181
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,450
Grant? Is that you?

1182
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,499
Yes.

1183
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:41,088
Yes, you're Grant Stayton III.

1184
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,007
I remember!

1185
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:47,719
I remember. I'm Joanna Stayton.

1186
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,434
Dean, I'm cured.

1187
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,229
I can remember again.

1188
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,064
Oh, God!

1189
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,526
You can't imagine how terrible it is
not to know who you are.

1190
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:06,280
The doctor said that my mind would
come back suddenly and he was right.

1191
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:11,118
I saw you, I walked past you into the
house and poof! My memory came back.

1192
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,913
Ask me anything.
Ask me about my childhood in New York.

1193
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,165
About my mom. Her name is Edith.

1194
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,209
About my money. Money!

1195
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:22,879
I have money! I have lots of money!
I even have some in Switzerland!

1196
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,715
- Switzerland?
- See how I know me?

1197
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:27,551
Oh, God, this is
the happiest day of my life!

1198
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,512
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here

1199
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,973
and making me a wife and a mother and...

1200
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,725
Why did you do that?

1201
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,440
Why...?

1202
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,400
I know why.

1203
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:48,238
You're that sweaty carpenter
who hates me.

1204
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,956
And these are your children,
and you made me...

1205
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:00,417
...believe that...

1206
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,426
Oh, God...

1207
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,763
You tricked me.

1208
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,475
You used me.

1209
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,564
Say something.

1210
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,445
- Annie, it just started out...
- My name is not Annie.

1211
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,116
And I don't belong with you.

1212
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,120
And I don't belong with them.

1213
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,292
I have to... get my things.

1214
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:51,009
Don't get any ideas. I brought Olaf.

1215
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:52,302
Olaf!

1216
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,308
I think we can take Olaf.

1217
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,326
I won't have...

1218
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,790
There's nothing inside that's mine.

1219
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:35,220
Joanna, for whatever it's worth,

1220
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,305
thank you.

1221
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,570
Come on, dear.

1222
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,284
We'll get you out of these clothes.

1223
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:22,851
- Mom, wait!
- Mom!

1224
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,854
- Mom!
- Mom, come back!

1225
01:31:39,243 --> 01:31:42,287
- You said moms don't leave!
- Get!

1226
01:31:58,387 --> 01:32:00,764
We should have told her, Dad.

1227
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,766
She just would have left sooner.

1228
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,269
Come on.

1229
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,378
Welcome back, Mrs. Stayton.

1230
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:21,052
Dr. Korman, will she ever again
be the debutante I raised?

1231
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,679
Will she be one of us?

1232
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,432
Joanna wants
to rediscover her old self.

1233
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,726
Her memory's almost
completely restored.

1234
01:33:27,893 --> 01:33:30,520
She even recalled the session
where I wrote this.

1235
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:34,357
I love you madly
though you treat me badly...

1236
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:36,943
Dr. Korman! Please!

1237
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:41,197
We need analysis, not Moon River.
I want my wife back.

1238
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:45,160
Joanna knows who she is.
And she's trying to behave that way.

1239
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,912
- Happy?
- Good evening, madam.

1240
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:52,709
- My darling Joanna.
- You look radiant, Jo-Jo.

1241
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:56,171
Please don't call me that.
I feel like a Pomeranian.

1242
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,382
You liked being called Jo-Jo.
It was "diddums" you hated.

1243
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,552
Mother, why does
Dr. Korman have to be here?

1244
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,889
- I feel self-conscious enough as it is.
- Oh, sweetie.

1245
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,224
Just indulge Mommy.

1246
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:11,144
Come along, now. Sit, sit, sit.

1247
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,855
Andrew, I'm sitting.

1248
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:18,902
Now, Mrs. Mintz.

1249
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,405
Dr. Korman knows you so well, dear,

1250
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:24,407
and he only wants to help.

1251
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:27,911
- Champagne, madam.
- Thank you, Andrew.

1252
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,415
- Andrew, I'd love a beer.
- A beer?

1253
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,003
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- Nothing is ever wrong.

1254
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:41,299
Actually, I really don't see the harm
in accommodating her wishes, Andrew.

1255
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:47,681
- Cigarette, darling?
- I don't smoke, Mother. Do I?

1256
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,100
Of course you smoke.
You've always smoked.

1257
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:52,727
- I smoke.
- Why don't we all smoke?

1258
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:57,232
Why do I have to smoke? I've never
smoked. I get sick when I smoke.

1259
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,068
Why does everyone try to make me
do what I don't want to do?

1260
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:03,863
Grant, we are not
interested in your therapy.

1261
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:08,284
I had my nervous breakdown and I didn't
have therapy. I never had therapy!

1262
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,330
- Mother, would you like some?
- I'd love some.

1263
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:15,834
Put that down! Good God, Joanna!
We have servants for that.

1264
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:18,461
Now, really, this is going too far.

1265
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,506
Joanna, what motivated you
to rise and go get the serving tray?

1266
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,176
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

1267
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:28,722
- That's excellent.
- What's excellent about it?

1268
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:32,684
- I was hungry.
- Your beer, madam.

1269
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,311
Who cares that you were hungry!
She became a waitress!

1270
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:37,897
- My daughter's a waitress?!
- Hold it.

1271
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,612
Good stuff.

1272
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:54,914
I'll stay an extra few days, yes.

1273
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:09,179
- They won't come in.
- Shit.

1274
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:18,605
SpaghettiO Surprise.

1275
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,532
- What's goin' on?
- We're gettin' Mom back.

1276
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,535
- We miss her.
- She cuts the crusts off the bread.

1277
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:36,539
She doesn't take any of my shit either.
I need discipline.

1278
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:38,333
We got $3.04.

1279
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,377
We're gonna rent a fishing boat
and get her back.

1280
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:45,048
No fishing boat's gonna catch a yacht,
especially at that price.

1281
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:49,219
- Maybe she'll decide to come back.
- Dumbo, she's on her way to New York!

1282
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:53,348
- This is a job for Dr. Death.
- Yeah, Dr. Death could do it!

1283
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:56,643
- We gotta do somethin'. Right, Dad?
- Wrong!

1284
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,562
Now, she's gone, guys.

1285
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:01,231
She hates me!

1286
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:04,234
She's got her rich husband back,

1287
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,986
and her rich life,
and that's the end of it.

1288
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:33,429
I love the sound of the ocean.

1289
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:36,182
Hello!

1290
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:41,896
Tofutti.

1291
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:45,567
Tofutti, where are you
when I need you?

1292
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:49,237
Tofutti Klein...

1293
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:52,198
All together. And!

1294
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,493
Lick, shake, lick.

1295
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:56,786
Drink!

1296
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,289
Suck!

1297
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:04,961
- You sucked first!
- No, I didn't! I did it right!

1298
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:09,215
- Danger watch! Gotta go! Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

1299
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:10,800
Croissants in the morning!

1300
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,510
Dinner was wonderful.

1301
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:17,140
You best not lose these again, madam.

1302
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,642
- Again?
- With my apologies, madam.

1303
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,646
"Andrew! I seem to have lost
my ruby earrings somewhere between...

1304
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:28,067
...64th... and 68th Streets.

1305
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,944
Find them!"

1306
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:35,825
I've behaved so badly. I don't know
how you put up with me for so long.

1307
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,329
You've done so many
wonderful things for me

1308
01:38:39,496 --> 01:38:41,998
and I've never even once said thank you.

1309
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,043
I'm sorry.

1310
01:38:48,213 --> 01:38:50,131
Apology accepted, ma'am.

1311
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,594
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think they're right?

1312
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,680
Oh, no, madam. Oh, no.

1313
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:03,686
Most of us... go through life
with blinders on, madam,

1314
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:07,023
knowing only that one little station
to which we were born.

1315
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:10,735
But you, madam, on the other hand,
have had the rare privilege

1316
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:14,530
of escaping your bonds for just a spell

1317
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:18,368
to see life
from an entirely new perspective.

1318
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:22,872
How you choose
to use that information, madam,

1319
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,999
is entirely up to you.

1320
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,397
- Captain Karl?
- Yes, ma'am.

1321
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:50,525
- We've never really had time to talk.
- No, we haven't.

1322
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:52,443
Well, there's no time now.

1323
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,905
- What are you doing?
- Turning the boat around.

1324
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,950
- Why?
- I'm going home.

1325
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:01,077
You're turning that wheel too fast.

1326
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:27,603
Captain Karl! Why is the land
on the wrong side of the yacht?

1327
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:33,067
Oh, she did?
Well, she's gone too far this time.

1328
01:40:33,235 --> 01:40:35,319
She thinks she's dealing with an idiot!

1329
01:40:40,617 --> 01:40:42,952
So we're heading back
to the jungles of Oregon!

1330
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,413
- I want to go back, Grant.
- To him?

1331
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,875
Yes. I'm sorry.

1332
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:52,587
You haven't begun to be sorry,
you hillbilly harlot!

1333
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:56,215
Captain Karl, go below with the crew.
I'm taking over.

1334
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,468
Andrew, go get Dr. Korman! Go!

1335
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:00,136
- Get out of my way, Karl!
- But, sir!

1336
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,096
Now, I'm in charge!

1337
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:06,434
We're coming about...
at full speed ahead!

1338
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:26,329
- Who is it?
- Dr. Death. Let's go.

1339
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,830
We're gonna go get her!

1340
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:30,958
Come on! Billy's friends'll help us!

1341
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:43,096
- I hope I don't get court-martialed.
- Yeah, I owe you.

1342
01:41:44,014 --> 01:41:47,600
- Anything in the manual?
- Not about pulling alongside a ship

1343
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:49,852
and telling a passenger
you love them, sir.

1344
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,688
Put your nose in the manual
and find something, Lucas!

1345
01:41:52,856 --> 01:41:55,817
Whatever you do,
I'm getting off at the next port.

1346
01:41:55,984 --> 01:41:58,528
Don't be ridiculous.
Nobody leaves a Stayton.

1347
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:02,198
I don't love you anymore.
Please try and understand that.

1348
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,283
What has love got to do with marriage?

1349
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:09,831
You'd actually prefer living in squalor
with that cave dweller!

1350
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:15,878
They should have kept you
in the hospital psycho ward!

1351
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:19,298
What did you say?

1352
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:22,051
How did you know that?

1353
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,096
You left me there, didn't you?

1354
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,600
You snake!

1355
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:32,812
How could you do that?

1356
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,149
How could you be such a slime?

1357
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,568
Call me all the names you want,

1358
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,570
but many women adore me!

1359
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:42,947
Do you wanna know what I was doing?
I'll tell you.

1360
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:46,492
I was whacking the donkey
with painted ladies. They loved me!

1361
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,495
Yes! I did leave you.

1362
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,707
There! Now, I've confessed. So what?

1363
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:56,627
We're at sea. And I'm a god at sea!

1364
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:03,092
9:00 in the morning.
This better be good.

1365
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,803
Doctor, Grant's having
another nervous breakdown.

1366
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:09,223
- He thinks he's God. Keep him busy.
- All right.

1367
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:12,226
- Morning, Grant.
- Korman, my wife is insane.

1368
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:14,937
- Do we have a straitjacket?
- I always carry one.

1369
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,606
Good! Put her in it!

1370
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:22,403
You're overwrought, Grant.
I want you to take a Valium.

1371
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,280
Here, take one of mine.

1372
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:27,700
- Is Nino here?
- Nino on break.

1373
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:30,703
I have to stop the boat.
My husband's a little bit crazy...

1374
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,456
- The captain stop the boat.
- I'm the captain!

1375
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:36,542
No, please don't salute!
I have to find a red button...

1376
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:41,047
Vessel sighted straight ahead, sir!

1377
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:44,467
- Identify.
- There's a fat guy in my way, sir.

1378
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:47,303
Who you callin' fat, you little weasel!
Come here!

1379
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:51,682
Where's the thing? I need the red...

1380
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:53,601
- Here! Here it is!
- No, please!

1381
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,815
- The boat stopped.
- Yes, it stopped!

1382
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:03,527
- I need to get it turned around.
- Nino on the break.

1383
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:13,329
He's here!

1384
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:17,750
He's here! That's him!

1385
01:44:21,546 --> 01:44:26,175
Stop that boat immediately
and let me get my mom!

1386
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:29,887
Pee-Wee Herman.

1387
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:35,977
Come in, Immaculata.

1388
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:39,772
- He's here!
- There's mutiny afoot.

1389
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:49,949
She's at the bottom of this mutiny.
I'm gonna rid myself of this albatross.

1390
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,668
He's here!

1391
01:45:08,218 --> 01:45:11,387
- Go back to New York, Dr. Korman.
- Really? Thank you.

1392
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:13,889
- Dean!
- Madam! The ship has stopped.

1393
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:15,683
What happened? Did he strike you?

1394
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:19,061
- Did he make you do something?
- No! Everything's wonderful.

1395
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:22,189
- Message over the radio, sir.
- Annie!

1396
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,400
Looks like the fun's over.

1397
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,902
We've got some salmon poachers
fishing in illegal waters.

1398
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:29,030
That takes precedence
over your friend's love life.

1399
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:31,532
- Come about!
- Son, no more radio.

1400
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,202
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a... Hey!

1401
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,371
- Billy, what's goin' on?
- We're turnin' round.

1402
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,498
They're going after salmon poachers.

1403
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:43,961
He's leaving. Where's he going?

1404
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:59,977
- Catarina!
- Arturo!

1405
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:08,527
I'm coming!

1406
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:12,782
- Man overboard!
- Shit! Sound the horn.

1407
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:15,034
Coming about again, Czapowskyj.

1408
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:18,079
Annie!

1409
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,332
Oh, no, madam. I cannot let you do this!

1410
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,335
- What?
- Not without a life jacket.

1411
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,213
Dean! I'm coming!

1412
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:30,674
Madam, you really should
play a little hard to get.

1413
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:33,469
Tell my mother I'll call her!

1414
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:39,308
Woman overboard!
She's wearing an evening dress, sir.

1415
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:42,269
Get those kids out of the rescue boat.
Let's go!

1416
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:44,355
My mom's out there! Let me...

1417
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:47,149
Halt! You treasonous tramp!

1418
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:50,152
Conspiring with the enemy
at sea is mutiny!

1419
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,779
Pull!

1420
01:46:56,785 --> 01:46:59,161
Another man overboard!

1421
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:01,330
I am giving my notice, sir!

1422
01:47:11,466 --> 01:47:15,803
- Annie!
- Oh, Dean!

1423
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:22,184
Annie!

1424
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:43,164
I love you! I'll never leave you again!

1425
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:47,126
I'll never let you go!
You're my Annie. You always will be.

1426
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,795
Man overboard
is kissing woman overboard.

1427
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:52,965
Our rescue boat is starboard.

1428
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,719
The guy with the arrows
is being pulled in at port.

1429
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,597
It's a helluva day at sea, sir.

1430
01:48:01,349 --> 01:48:05,895
- I can't believe you did it.
- Oh, I saw you jump so I jumped.

1431
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:07,855
No, I don't mean that.

1432
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:10,524
I can't believe
you gave all that up just for me.

1433
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:12,818
- I didn't.
- What do... What do you mean?

1434
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:15,237
Well, the truth is that it's mine.

1435
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:17,907
The boat, the money, everything.
It's all mine.

1436
01:48:18,074 --> 01:48:20,868
Dean! Dean, it's OK!

1437
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:34,173
- Did you tell 'em?
- Yeah.

1438
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,926
They're making out
their Christmas lists.

1439
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:41,263
- Already?
- How do you spell Porsche?

1440
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,018
They got me thinking, though.

1441
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:49,772
What can I possibly give you, ever,
that you don't already have?

1442
01:48:57,447 --> 01:48:59,448
A little girl.

1443
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,963
Different people

1444
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:17,633
Different worlds

1445
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,635
You just call me

1446
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,805
And I'll be there for you

1447
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:25,808
We belong together

1448
01:49:25,976 --> 01:49:28,644
You know it's true

1449
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:32,064
'Cause there's something special about

1450
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:35,568
Me and you

1451
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:39,613
Something special about our love

1452
01:50:11,813 --> 01:50:13,939
It's all right

1453
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:17,901
Baby, it's OK

1454
01:50:18,069 --> 01:50:19,987
We're gonna make it

1455
01:50:20,155 --> 01:50:23,365
No matter what they say

1456
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:25,909
Sure as the stars shine

1457
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:28,871
In the sky above

1458
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:33,667
There is something special
about our love

1459
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:56,899
People change

1460
01:50:57,067 --> 01:51:00,402
As time goes by

1461
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,447
Others come between

1462
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:09,828
But I'll love you

1463
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:12,956
Till the day I die

1464
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:17,252
'Cause there's something special about

1465
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:20,172
You and me

1466
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:24,635
Something special about our love
