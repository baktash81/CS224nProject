1
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,701
What is the meaning of this check?

2
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:52,532
Do you want me to cheat?

3
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,003
No...

4
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,107
I'm just the middleman.

5
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,300
Do you want to play,
or cause me trouble?

6
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,935
Don't you think you'll be ahead of me...

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,377
...if I fall?

8
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,641
Look at this!

9
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:06,616
I'm the only Golden Leg!

10
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:08,516
You can't daydream about that.

11
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,520
No...I don't.

12
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:12,852
I just want to have some tick-back.
Please don't tell anybody.

13
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:15,017
You're trash!

14
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,028
I'm sorry. Catch you later.

15
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:48,188
Golden Leg! Golden Leg...

16
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:53,595
Golden Leg...

17
00:02:53,733 --> 00:03:01,333
Golden Leg...

18
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,618
Hung, you've been a star player
for twenty years.

19
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Since Fung missed the penalty kick
and lost his golden leg,

20
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,259
you no longer have any rivals.
Now your feeling is....

21
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:00,093
Oh, no! Don't talk about this!

22
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,222
Hung, your Evil Team

23
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,834
has already won the gold for five years.

24
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,129
What's the secret?

25
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,966
Secret? The secret is having
a great soccer coach.

26
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,801
So you should have confidence
to win gold again.

27
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:12,036
Is this your first time as a reporter? I
don't think you should ask that question.

28
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,240
Excuse me...

29
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,946
Good morning, Hung!

30
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:21,847
Golden Leg!

31
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,915
Good morning, Hung!

32
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,287
Good morning!

33
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,691
Hung, your shoe is dirty.

34
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,126
I will help you to clean it up.

35
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,425
It's fine. I can manage.

36
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,401
Hung, I'll take your car over.

37
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,875
Hung, you promised to offer
a coaching job to me.

38
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,946
I'm ready.

39
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:51,141
I've confidence I can train a team
as good as the Evil Team.

40
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:53,278
Do you think you still can be a coach?

41
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,545
Forget it.

42
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:55,984
But you said...

43
00:04:56,122 --> 00:05:00,422
Get real.

44
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,324
You see. You're a cripple now.

45
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,998
Do you think you can still
depend on this tattoo?

46
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,464
Hung...

47
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,727
I've served you for twenty years.

48
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,336
How can you say such a thing?

49
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,804
Today, I'm not in the mood.
Things change.

50
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,670
You looked great when you were young.

51
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,937
You see, you just look like a dog now.

52
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,603
Forget it. Get lost.

53
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,716
I've already taken care
of you for twenty years.

54
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,444
You know, it is a great deal of money.

55
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,144
Hung!

56
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,322
You're so vain!

57
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,651
If you didn't give me...

58
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,090
...the dishonour check twenty years ago,

59
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,128
I wouldn't be crippled now.

60
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,595
What? Are you losing your temper?
Why are you shouting so loudly!

61
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,393
Hey! Did all you guys hear that?

62
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,628
There're thousands of reporters outside.
Would you like me to let them come in?

63
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,228
You know,

64
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,273
I keep you here to shut your mouth.

65
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,899
Do you think anyone would trust...

66
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:52,136
...a handicapped beggar like you now?

67
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:54,269
- You!
- Don't be angry.

68
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,974
If you want to blame anyone,
that someone should be you.

69
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,342
You should blame your greediness.

70
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,214
Forget it

71
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,791
I'll tell you one more thing.

72
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:09,793
I was the one who arranged
the accident to your leg.

73
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:45,264
Damn it!

74
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,807
That's not the way to kick.

75
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,193
Pardon?

76
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,692
I said...

77
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,596
...that is not the way to kick.

78
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,366
So what's your opinion?

79
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:35,948
There has to be a fusion of
the strength from the waist and foot.

80
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,177
What's that?

81
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,066
My idol, Bruce Lee,

82
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:02,300
explained it.

83
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,875
If you want to learn more,

84
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,240
you can take two kung fu lessons with me.

85
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,438
Learn kung fu?

86
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:11,573
You just look like a cleaner.

87
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,278
Cleaning is just my job.

88
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,253
My real identity
is a post-graduate student.

89
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,017
Post-graduate student?

90
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,183
Focusing on how to

91
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,990
effectively develop Shaolin kung fu.

92
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,961
This is my name card.

93
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,535
Shaolin Orthodox School of Mighty Steel Leg.

94
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,265
Look! It's really strong.

95
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:40,044
Fighting is not my style.

96
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,805
I'm a well-educated man.

97
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,609
You're wrong.

98
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,151
Look at that girl.

99
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,757
I know she's sexy, so what?

100
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,860
- But I'm an educated...
- No...

101
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,758
Look at this!

102
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,605
If she had learned Shaolin kung fu,
Weight Vest,

103
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,373
she would not have fallen like that.

104
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:16,675
You see!

105
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,392
So Shaolin kung fu is great!

106
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,759
Hey! Do you want to learn kung fu?

107
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:32,728
You're crazy!

108
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,365
Look at the woman over there.

109
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,329
If she had studied Shaolin kung fu,
Iron Hand,

110
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:41,531
parking would be much easier.

111
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:48,771
So kung fu is wonderful!

112
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:50,280
Excuse me! Do you want to learn...

113
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,475
Okay...Get lost me!

114
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:55,848
This coin is not just yours.
I should have a share.

115
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:57,819
Don't do that to ruin our relationship!

116
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,424
Look at that!

117
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,459
What's wrong?

118
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:03,221
You've already spent a whole year
trimming the tree.

119
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,761
You're fired. Get away!

120
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,024
- I'm sorry...
- Get away!

121
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,930
If he had studied Shaolin kung fu,
Nine Fences of the Recluse,

122
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,502
he would not be in trouble!

123
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:17,070
Nine Fences of the Recluse
came from Hua Shan.

124
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:20,610
Don't you know all kinds of kung fu
originated from Shaolin?

125
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,166
Kung fu is absolutely fantastic
for people of all ages.

126
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,862
Brutality is just the wrong
impression of kung fu.

127
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,836
Kung fu is an art,

128
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,771
a kind of indomitable spirit.

129
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,536
I'm looking for a good method...

130
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,941
...to package Shaolin kung fu...

131
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,547
...to let people understand...

132
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:58,081
...the true meaning of it.

133
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,241
Enough, already!

134
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,647
I've not finished yet.

135
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,310
Almost finished.

136
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:03,786
I still have some appointments
with my clients.

137
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,390
It's done.

138
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,219
Please seize your opportunity!

139
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,123
The lame can also learn kung fu.

140
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:12,526
What are you talking about?
Who's lame?

141
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,792
You're not qualified
to talk soccer with me.

142
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm sorry!

143
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:16,732
Yes, I'm the lame.

144
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,963
It's none of your business.

145
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,334
The lame?

146
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,073
Bullshit!

147
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,210
What?

148
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:36,548
Do you think that would scare me?

149
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:40,125
Do you still want the garbage?
If you don't, I'll call the other guy.

150
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,157
I'm coming over.

151
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,590
Hurry up!

152
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:46,755
Did you think that would scare me?

153
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,853
Get out of here...

154
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,484
Excuse me! Would you help me
to put it over there?

155
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,020
No problem!

156
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,491
Your leg is so great!

157
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,025
- Twenty cents!
- Oh, no! Just twenty cents?

158
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,637
There are some cups and plates inside.
Would you give me ten more cents?

159
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:02,070
No more!

160
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,197
Wah, move it over there.

161
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:31,129
Mui, please give me ten steamed bread!

162
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:08,522
Using Tai Chi kung fu to make
steamed bread is a great idea.

163
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:14,128
The steamed bread looks sweet and tasty.

164
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:17,174
I'm so impressed...

165
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:24,511
...by her strong arms.

166
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,245
You...

167
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,017
What are you doing?

168
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,246
Singing is the best way...

169
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,223
for me to express
my true feeling of respect.

170
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:37,619
So beautiful!

171
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,434
I'm not beautiful. Don't laugh at me!

172
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,763
You see! The steamed bread is so great!

173
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:50,769
Tastes wonderful!

174
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,743
Your Tai Chi kung fu, Shifting Bodies
and Transposing Shadows...

175
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:57,144
It's a firm but gentle kung fu,
Shove a Thousand Cattle with Four Tales.

176
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,112
Well!

177
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:02,821
That's why the steamed bread
is so tender and tough.

178
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:06,916
They're Fifty cents each.
Two-steamed bread rolls for one dollar.

179
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,887
- So expensive!
- Really

180
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,122
Even though it's so expensive,
it's worth it.

181
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,762
I just have fifty cents right now.

182
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,527
Would you mind if
I pay you back in two days?

183
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,533
Nope.

184
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,867
Well! You're a typical kung fu master
speaking with grace and ease.

185
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,871
You know, we have something in common.
I'm also a Shaolin master.

186
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,302
Will you give me a discount?

187
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,205
No.

188
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,504
Okay!

189
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,275
This is a pair of precious sneakers.
The original price was two dollars.

190
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,477
Now, I'll give you a discount price,

191
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:40,423
Is my steamed bread ready?

192
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,322
Coming! Wait a minute!

193
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,361
Did the guy pay for the steamed bread?

194
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,699
He did.

195
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,300
What's this dirty stuff? Throw them away!

196
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,882
First Big Brother!

197
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,621
First Big Brother!

198
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:17,660
It's okay!

199
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,459
Keep working. Clean it up, please!

200
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,628
Are you sick, First Big Brother?

201
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:28,501
I've got a headache. I got drunk last night.

202
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,607
Anyway, what do you want?

203
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:32,336
I want to let you know
I have awakened.

204
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:34,537
- Truly? You have awakened.
- I have awakened.

205
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,647
I finally understand.

206
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,147
If I want to extend
Shaolin kung fu to the world,

207
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,272
I should package it
into a new and modern form.

208
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:40,476
What kind of package?

209
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,113
Singing!

210
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,254
You won't believe what I saw today.

211
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:49,384
- I saw a steamed bread shop...
- Stop bothering me!

212
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,292
But, what do you think
if I combine Shaolin kung fu...

213
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:53,363
...with singing and dancing?

214
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,329
I don't want to think about it!

215
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,558
How can you give up
without even trying?

216
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,998
Stop thinking about it!

217
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,468
I've already advised you to live
A more down-to-earth existence.

218
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,971
There's a vacancy for cleaning toilets.
It should be good for you...

219
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,836
...to take it rather than
all this dreaming.

220
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:07,139
If we don't have any dream in life,
we'll look like a salt fish.

221
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,112
You see, you're a real salt fish
without a pair of shoes!

222
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,114
How can you talk about dreaming?

223
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,548
Oh, no!

224
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:16,916
My burning desires
are not easy to blow out!

225
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,680
Why not? Just blow them out!

226
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,122
But I can light them up again!

227
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,693
Enough, already!

228
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:25,125
We both have our own lives.

229
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,788
Please don't bother me!

230
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,991
I should work to support my family.

231
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:31,830
You mean you are willing
to give your Iron Head up.

232
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,530
Did you forget how much effort
you made for it?

233
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:35,970
You're wrong!

234
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,408
I haven't given it up...

235
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,842
...even for one day!

236
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,174
Fei!

237
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:44,373
Boss!

238
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:45,984
Damn it!

239
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:47,710
The dancer's quitted the show already.

240
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,548
How can you stay here
and do nothing about that?

241
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,418
No! I have a great idea.

242
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,456
What's that?

243
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,686
Combining Shaolin kung fu
with singing and dancing.

244
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:57,955
What's kind of Shaolin kung fu?

245
00:18:58,097 --> 00:18:59,223
Look at this!

246
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,234
It can't be a solo effort.

247
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,428
He's good enough.

248
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:08,472
No! How about you?

249
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,869
Me?

250
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,604
Shit!

251
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:14,473
How about your Iron Head?

252
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,447
If you don't do it well,
I'll kill you tomorrow.

253
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,744
Yes.

254
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:22,182
First Big Brother, thank you!

255
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:36,097
Shaolin kung fu is great!

256
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,203
Really great!

257
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:40,498
Shaolin kung fu is wonderful!

258
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,698
Wonderful!

259
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,934
I'm Iron Head.

260
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,102
Iron Head.

261
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:49,339
You're Mighty Steel Leg.

262
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,642
I'm Mighty Steel Leg.

263
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:57,882
Be serious!

264
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,989
Shaolin kung fu is great!

265
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:03,390
Really great!

266
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,428
Shaolin kung fu is great!

267
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,332
Really great!

268
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,996
Shaolin kung fu is wonderful!

269
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,005
Wonderful!

270
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:19,303
I'm Mighty Steel Leg!

271
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,173
Mighty Steel Leg!

272
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:24,009
He's Iron Head!

273
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,816
Damn it!

274
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,620
What are you singing about?
Your voice is terrible.

275
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,120
The lyrics are appalling.

276
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,849
I can't understand
one sentence of this.

277
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,391
Who wrote the lyrics?

278
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,757
- Who did?
- Who did?

279
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,034
Creative work is highly subjective,

280
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,104
but I will follow up on your criticism.

281
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,537
Singing is just
the beginning of the show,

282
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:26,269
the climax is the performance of
Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head!

283
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,708
Iron Head?

284
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,675
I have already told you
that you write terrible lyrics.

285
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,715
I'm not Iron Head. He's...

286
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,976
Iron Head?

287
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:34,847
- I said...
- Iron Head?

288
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,045
Mighty Steel Leg!

289
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:38,247
He's Mighty Steel Leg!

290
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,984
You still say Mighty Steel Leg?

291
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,450
Kill him!

292
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:43,754
Mighty Steel Leg!

293
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,561
I'm the real Mighty Steel Leg!

294
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,800
Iron Head?

295
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,492
Don't you know Chinese? He's the real...

296
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:52,729
Iron Head?

297
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,133
You're so stubborn!

298
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,297
Iron...

299
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,932
Do you want to fight back against me?

300
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,644
Thank you so much!

301
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,215
Happy hour is going fast.

302
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,750
It's time for us
to say goodbye right now.

303
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,684
Let's listen to music!

304
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,086
You crazy guys!

305
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,895
Let's see if you can take more!

306
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,223
Thank you!

307
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,683
Bullshit!

308
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,225
What?

309
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,748
Go! Not interested!

310
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,261
Do you still want to fight with us?

311
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,667
I promised my Shaolin master I wouldn't
use kung fu to fight with anyone.

312
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:41,898
This guy is crazy.

313
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,201
But all you guys should apologize!

314
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,640
Apologize?

315
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,473
I don't think it's my problem.
It's all your fault!

316
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,656
Don't move! You said you would not
use kung fu to hit anyone.

317
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,178
I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to play soccer.

318
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:32,420
Shit!

319
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:39,126
You don't need to overdo it!

320
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:40,659
What?

321
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,562
I'm so sorry!

322
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,748
Do you have any coins?

323
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,815
Yes.

324
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,222
Thirty cents.

325
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:46,085
Are you taking my money?

326
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,358
Yes, I am. Did you learn Tong Long Fist?

327
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,398
I did.

328
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,593
Don't insult Shaolin kung fu anymore!

329
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,095
Would you let me

330
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,996
take a look at your leg?

331
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:28,165
I'm not in the mood. Go ahead!

332
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,477
Cool! It's the real, original kung fu.

333
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,159
A great killer slim leg.

334
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,390
It's Shaolin Mighty Steel Leg!

335
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:59,401
Is it possible
To use kung fu to play soccer?

336
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:02,531
Truly?

337
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,073
Yes, of course!

338
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,010
Yeah!

339
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,806
It's a great idea
- using kung fu to play soccer.

340
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,609
Why didn't I think of that?

341
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,241
Are you lame?

342
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:16,183
I'm not just lame,

343
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,222
I'm the ex-soccer player, Golden Leg.

344
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:20,790
Today, I'm a soccer coach.

345
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:22,654
That's great!
You should teach me to play soccer.

346
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:24,091
Hold on.

347
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,890
No! You told me I could use
kung fu to play soccer.

348
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:28,294
But I need time to consider!

349
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,196
I've no time to think anymore!

350
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,765
It's sunset already!

351
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,802
Time doesn't wait for anyone!

352
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,211
But we still need to prepare!

353
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,414
I'm ready! What do I need?

354
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:49,643
At least a pair of shoes!

355
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,020
Do you have enough money
to get your sneakers back?

356
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,595
No. But...

357
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,822
I threw them away.

358
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:01,090
Oh, my god!

359
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:04,827
Your sneakers were broken.
They were well worn.

360
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,563
- Yes, they were broken. But I...
- Go home!

361
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:11,340
My boss will shout at you
if she sees you when she comes back.

362
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:21,278
It's impossible
to get the broken one back.

363
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,410
There is a repaired one.
Do you want to have it?

364
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,242
First Big Brother, what are you doing?

365
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,008
First Big Brother, are you okay?

366
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,677
I'm fine.

367
00:29:57,722 --> 00:29:58,848
What do you want?

368
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,048
I've finally got a good idea

369
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,785
to develop Shaolin kung fu.

370
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:06,596
Playing soccer!

371
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,766
Please let me go!

372
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:12,597
You have already got me into trouble.
I was fired.

373
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,399
Now, I work in the rest room
to pay for my boss's loss.

374
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,871
So I've come here to help you.

375
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:19,568
No! Absolutely not!

376
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,939
If you force me anymore,

377
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,206
my whole family will commit suicide
in front of you.

378
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,873
Committing suicide is not a good way
to solve problems.

379
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:26,949
Be brave!

380
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:28,313
Don't be so silly!

381
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,717
I'm a loser!

382
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:31,981
Please don't come here anymore!

383
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,114
If you still want to form a soccer team,
you can call the other Brothers.

384
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,127
Please, don't bother me!

385
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,387
I beg you!

386
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:41,658
Iron Head.

387
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:48,736
Good morning, Fourth Big Brother!

388
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:50,005
Good morning, Sing!

389
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,665
How are you?

390
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,744
Let me introduce
a great guy to you! He's...

391
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,280
Nice to meet you!

392
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,718
This is Fung.

393
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:05,618
I know, Fung is famous
in the stock exchange.

394
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,054
You see! He has a great I.T. look.

395
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:08,216
Fung is a soccer coach.

396
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,690
Soccer coach!

397
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,352
Everyone knows that Fung is the most...

398
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,986
...famous figure in soccer.

399
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:14,928
Do you use your legs to play soccer?

400
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,466
You see! I'm right.
Actually, do you have a job?

401
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,933
I want you to join my soccer team.

402
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,367
Playing soccer?

403
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,496
I've no job for six months.
How can you ask me to play soccer?

404
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,437
If you can use your Empty Hand...

405
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:25,600
...to be the goalkeeper...

406
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,769
What's Empty Hand? That was many years ago.

407
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:30,540
You know,
I even forgot when our Master died.

408
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,910
Please listen to me!

409
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,211
We're going to sign up for
the National Soccer Tournament.

410
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,320
The prize is one million dollars.

411
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:39,651
Really? So you're the smart one.

412
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,453
You see! You're dressed up.

413
00:31:42,594 --> 00:31:45,495
Many years ago, our Master
ordered us to develop Shaolin kung fu.

414
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,860
Now, you guys get this great idea
of using Shaolin kung fu...

415
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,057
...to play soccer.

416
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,497
Look!

417
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:52,262
This is the group picture
of our Master and Brothers.

418
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,529
I always keep it under my pillow.

419
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:54,660
You should know what I mean.

420
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,865
Great! Let's sit down
to talk about what you mean.

421
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:02,143
I'll call you if I've time.
Remember, please leave a place for me.

422
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,873
I really don't have time to talk to you.

423
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:07,917
Some clients are waiting for me, I should
keep my eyes on the stock market.

424
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,576
You know, I earn more than a
hundreds thousand dollars trading.

425
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,052
Hello! What's the price right now?

426
00:32:11,189 --> 00:32:12,918
Today, my driver is on leave.

427
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,116
I just lent my car to a friend,

428
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,285
and left my wallet in the office.

429
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:18,656
I'm sorry! I don't have time
to have lunch with you guys.

430
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:19,888
I'm really busy!

431
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,431
Get away!

432
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,693
Third Big Brother, think about it!

433
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,325
If you can use Iron Shirt...

434
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,767
...to be the back...

435
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,738
What's Iron Shirt?

436
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:32,399
Look! The sky is full of planes.

437
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,168
The streets are full of computers.

438
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,439
It's the 21st century.
Stop living in a daydream!

439
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,573
So I think it's a good idea -
combining kung fu with soccer.

440
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,309
Really...
The prize is a great deal of money.

441
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:43,181
For Christ sake! You think I'm...

442
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:44,787
I earn more than a
hundreds thousand dollars trading.

443
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,084
There's absolutely no way I'll give up
trading to play soccer with you guys.

444
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,591
I'm sorry. You know, I'm very direct...

445
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:52,821
It's crazy to give my trading up
to play soccer with you, lame.

446
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,693
Forgive my brutal honesty.

447
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:57,596
Finally, it's also impossible for me
to win a fucking soccer game.

448
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:00,067
Truly, the probability of winning is 0%.

449
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:01,228
Probabi...

450
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,932
Probability!

451
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,066
Okay...

452
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:09,072
It's like heads or tails.

453
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,112
We never get the edge.

454
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,115
So the probability is 0%.

455
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:14,911
Let me try!

456
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,850
Get away!

457
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:18,889
I've an appointment
with my client at the coffee shop.

458
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:20,251
I'm very busy!

459
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:22,791
We can serve you to noodles
at the stalling store.

460
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,458
Bullshit! I earn more than a
hundreds thousand dollars trading.

461
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,564
Why would I want to have noodles
with you guys?

462
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:48,745
He's my Sixth Small Brother, Weight Vest.

463
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:51,252
This is the famous soccer coach, Fung.

464
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,721
Fung, how are you?

465
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,154
What's Vest?

466
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,591
Weight Vest.

467
00:33:57,729 --> 00:33:59,128
Nice to meet you! Mr. Vest.

468
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,489
Fifth Big Brother, are you thinking
about playing soccer?

469
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:03,327
Yes.

470
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:06,164
You can use Shaolin kung fu,
Weight Vest to be a forward with me.

471
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,932
Our attack will be invincible.

472
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:10,301
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

473
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,535
Great! Are there any diet pills?

474
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:15,644
It's useless.

475
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,216
Since the virus get into my brain,
there's no way for me to lose weight.

476
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,218
After I became like this, as was also
only unable to use Shaolin kung fu,

477
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:26,846
Weight Vest, but to walk quickly.

478
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,755
Yes, you're a little bit fat,
but it's not so important.

479
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,226
Forget it!

480
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,791
You see, it was my picture!

481
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:39,232
Since I became like this,

482
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,860
I even can't date a girl.

483
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,800
You don't understand that.

484
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,840
I do. I also can't date a girl!

485
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,204
Really?

486
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,141
There has been much gossip about
your girls in newspapers and magazines?

487
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,405
What kind of newspapers and magazines?

488
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,708
Oh! I'm sorry!

489
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:55,275
Since I've had this disease,
I can't control myself.

490
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,446
I'm sorry. Please leave me alone!

491
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:01,084
Small Brother!

492
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:05,587
You should have confidence!
You can do it!

493
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:07,689
Now, everyone calls me Lazy Pig...

494
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:09,732
You know, you're the only one
who calls me Small Brother.

495
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:14,562
Thank you!

496
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:17,538
Lazy Pig, please help me
to get the red box of tissues.

497
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,312
The red one!

498
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,794
Playing soccer?

499
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:47,962
Yes, Second Big Brother!

500
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,303
If you can use
Hooking Leg to be the back,

501
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:52,431
I believe...

502
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,941
The defence will be unbeatable!

503
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:54,840
Absolutely!

504
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:58,176
Do you think
I can still use Hooking Leg?

505
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:00,645
You just need some practice.

506
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,583
If you trust yourself,
you will get your Hooking Leg back.

507
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,052
Really?

508
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,247
I just saw you collecting
excrement and urine.

509
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,724
Why did you change
your job to wash dishes?

510
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:12,124
Why?

511
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:14,956
Why do you question what I do?
I don't understand either.

512
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,693
Why isn't my dad the richest guy,
Lee Ka Sing?

513
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,266
Why am I going bald,
even though I'm so handsome?

514
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:24,306
You guys are not going bald,
but you're so ugly.

515
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,273
Why could other kids
go to school when they were young?

516
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,934
Whereas I was forced
to study the Shaolin kung fu,

517
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,410
and then became a cleaner to wash dishes,

518
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:33,210
collecting excrement and urine?

519
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:35,174
Calm down! Second Big Brother.

520
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,787
If you're brave enough,
you can control your fate.

521
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:40,015
Calm down? If I wasn't calm,

522
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,592
I would kill you guys!

523
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:45,252
Calm down?

524
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,598
Why do you just sit here?

525
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,098
Don't you smell anything disgusting?

526
00:36:50,234 --> 00:36:52,725
If there's disgusting smell when I come
back, I will make you lick it up!

527
00:37:33,444 --> 00:37:35,378
Your apartment is great!

528
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,806
It's well furnished.

529
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,113
I can't imagine you work
as the cleaner downstairs,

530
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:44,481
but live in the Penthouse
on the 59th floor.

531
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:47,182
You've got good taste!

532
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:50,590
This kind of apartment is so popular

533
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,992
I can't even get one.

534
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:56,256
The pipes are okay.

535
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,027
Just a little bit noisy.

536
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:01,366
Would you mind if I move here?

537
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,485
Forget it!

538
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:19,021
Your Brothers are useless.

539
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:22,057
We can find others to join our team.

540
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:25,026
It was all my fault.
I couldn't persuade them.

541
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,890
It's okay.

542
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:29,622
You know, I'm so glad that you trust me.

543
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,394
Thank you.

544
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,323
I'll use the shortest period of time
to train all you guys

545
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,491
...to be professional soccer players.

546
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:41,002
So you should be serious
and mutually support each other.

547
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:42,298
I understand!

548
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,800
Let's go!

549
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,815
Please listen to me!

550
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,475
What would you do
if you were on my position?

551
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,712
Yes, of course.

552
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,413
I've a call. Hold on a second.

553
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:01,821
The ball is coming back!

554
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:09,892
Oh! So you're finally
willing to come back?

555
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,197
You let us wait for an hour -
a whole hour!

556
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:17,164
What are you doing?

557
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:18,468
Playing soccer!

558
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,770
The ball is over there!

559
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:28,580
You, come here!

560
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,646
Let me see you kick the ball here.

561
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:32,817
The ball is over there.

562
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:34,754
Yes. The ball is over there!

563
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,089
You can't even get the ball.
How can you kick it from here?

564
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,627
Actually, there are four
basic skills of playing soccer:

565
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,563
Pass, stop, hold and kick.

566
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,225
- I understand!
- Don't move!

567
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,201
Okay. Start from the beginning.

568
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:50,640
Yours.

569
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,607
Hold it!

570
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:55,837
Watch out!

571
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,782
Concentrate!

572
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,045
Come on! Move!

573
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:04,484
Yes...keep dribbling.

574
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,613
Almost. That's great dribbling.

575
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,289
Do more.

576
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,988
Fung, why can't I take
part in the training?

577
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:14,559
Even though your leg is so strong,

578
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:17,394
you can't control it freely.

579
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:19,196
How about if you
kick the ball into the sky...

580
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,395
and it hits a plane?
Can you pay for the damage?

581
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:23,404
- No.
- So...

582
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,941
Sixth Small Brother! I'm borrowing your eggs!

583
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,008
What?

584
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,543
If you can control the egg freely
in the air, you can play soccer.

585
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,410
- No problem!
- Okay!

586
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,148
Go ahead. It's not easy.

587
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,730
Sixth Small Brother, forget it!

588
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,739
Oh, my god! My egg!

589
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,636
I will return it to you in the future!

590
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:59,333
No way!

591
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:00,944
Give it back to me!

592
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:03,069
Concentrate...

593
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:09,285
My egg!

594
00:42:24,735 --> 00:42:26,532
Yes! Yes!

595
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,695
Yes! Yes!

596
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:32,671
Yours!

597
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,169
Right...

598
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,076
Good...

599
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:22,451
Yes! Go!

600
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,374
Mark him! Watch out!

601
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:43,673
How did you let him kick the ball?

602
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:45,639
Kick it!

603
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:47,683
Come on!

604
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,291
That's great!

605
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:33,327
He can play by himself.

606
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:38,267
No! It's about teamwork.
Soccer's not about individuals.

607
00:44:48,212 --> 00:44:51,807
The game is 30 minutes.
There is no break.

608
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:53,940
We'll follow the international rules.

609
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:56,382
I'm the referee.
Do you have any questions?

610
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,045
Don't be silly? You know,
how great Golden Leg plays as referee

611
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,487
and leads a young soccer team
to play against us.

612
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:04,560
We should be glad about that!

613
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:05,751
This is Fung!

614
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:06,828
Fung!

615
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,090
Okay...

616
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:11,531
This guy has some issues
with your team players.

617
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:14,661
Now, this game is about practising
our soccer skills.

618
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,602
It will solve this conflict.

619
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,230
You see! They play honestly.

620
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,037
From their tidy uniforms
and friendly faces,

621
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:24,511
I can deeply feel their sincerity
and the spirit of physical culture.

622
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:25,842
Thank you!

623
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:29,745
Calm down.

624
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:31,821
I'm a car repairer.

625
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:34,924
This wrench
is used to tighten bolts.

626
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:36,048
Does that make sense?

627
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:37,820
Yes, of course.

628
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,729
I explained it already.

629
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,765
Because I'm a car repairer,

630
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:45,892
it's all right for me to have a hammer.

631
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,061
Okay. Your team's style...

632
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:49,866
...is very famous
in the amateur soccer field.

633
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:51,440
I understand.

634
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,709
It's an undeserved reputation.

635
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:55,038
Like the cloud in the sky...

636
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:58,114
Okay. Anyway, take care of yourselves.

637
00:45:58,248 --> 00:45:59,476
Shake hands, please!

638
00:46:28,112 --> 00:46:29,101
Great!

639
00:47:16,326 --> 00:47:18,317
Help!

640
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:27,829
Third Big Brother!

641
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:57,960
Calling military base,
we have suffered a fierce attack.

642
00:48:58,095 --> 00:48:59,119
Send reinforcements!

643
00:48:59,263 --> 00:49:00,855
Send reinforcements!

644
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,843
Stand up.

645
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:17,707
Stand up!

646
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:19,179
Stand up quickly!

647
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,608
Stand up quickly!

648
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,419
What are you doing?

649
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:25,480
Coach, they are lawless.

650
00:49:25,622 --> 00:49:26,680
Why didn't you stop them?

651
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:28,723
I'm the referee. I don't stop them.

652
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:31,885
What's the meaning of this?
Do you want us to sacrifice ourselves?

653
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,326
You! Out!

654
00:49:35,732 --> 00:49:37,324
Are you nuts?

655
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:41,962
This is a test.

656
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,732
If you guys can't pass it,

657
00:49:43,874 --> 00:49:45,535
there's no way you can play soccer!

658
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:48,509
We're just playing soccer.
We're not fighting a war.

659
00:49:49,212 --> 00:49:53,012
A real soccer game is a war.

660
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,984
Surrender!

661
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:09,994
I surrender!

662
00:50:18,108 --> 00:50:20,338
I surrender!

663
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,944
If you were brave enough
to challenge me to play soccer,

664
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,910
why do you now surrender?

665
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,537
Do you play to lose?

666
00:50:28,218 --> 00:50:32,552
I can't stand for it anymore.
My bone seems broken.

667
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:34,748
I'm pathetic!

668
00:50:35,726 --> 00:50:37,660
Please let me go to see a doctor!

669
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:45,694
Put it on your head!

670
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:50,301
You see. You look like a dog.

671
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,441
Do you have any self-respect?

672
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:54,006
I don't want to see you.

673
00:50:54,144 --> 00:50:56,510
Put it on your head quickly
and go and see a doctor.

674
00:51:07,758 --> 00:51:14,163
Yes, I'm a dog.
I don't have any self-respect.

675
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:50,227
First Big Brother is coming back.

676
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:52,858
What?

677
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,767
They have returned.

678
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:10,968
- Do we still have any weapons?
- No more!

679
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:12,199
The final attack!

680
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:46,733
Oh, my God! I missed.

681
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,570
Help!

682
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:54,081
Thank you! Our kung fu strength
has returned.

683
00:54:54,684 --> 00:54:57,175
Thanks for coming back!

684
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,651
Thank you!

685
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:03,783
Don't be like this.

686
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,555
I'm the one who needs
to thank all you guys.

687
00:55:06,863 --> 00:55:12,392
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be rich! Thank you!

688
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:14,935
We'vee failed.
Please give us an opportunity...

689
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:16,095
...to join your team!

690
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,139
Please!

691
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:25,010
Please, give us a chance.

692
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:35,384
That's a lot of research.

693
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,715
The Evil Tem will be
the world champions.

694
00:56:44,894 --> 00:56:46,521
Who?

695
00:56:47,497 --> 00:56:48,828
The lame?

696
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:51,024
- Why not?
- I'm sorry.

697
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,135
I've played
soccer for many years,

698
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:55,533
- you want to stop me?
- The person in charge is not here yet.

699
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:56,764
Golden Leg!

700
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:58,032
What are you doing?

701
00:56:58,174 --> 00:56:59,607
- Hung!
- Hung, he...

702
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:00,607
Okay...

703
00:57:00,744 --> 00:57:02,974
Hung, my team wants to sign up
for the soccer game!

704
00:57:03,113 --> 00:57:05,638
It's an open competition,
everyone has the right to sign up.

705
00:57:05,782 --> 00:57:07,079
You're wrong.

706
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,548
I'm the chairman.

707
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:11,152
I've the right to decide
who can sign up.

708
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:13,016
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

709
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:14,646
What's the name of your team?

710
00:57:14,991 --> 00:57:17,221
Come on!

711
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,588
This is Hung.

712
00:57:19,028 --> 00:57:22,122
Hung!

713
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:37,670
This is a rare soccer team!

714
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:39,475
I really want to watch them
playing soccer.

715
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:41,146
What's the name again?

716
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:43,013
This is Shaolin...

717
00:57:43,153 --> 00:57:44,677
OK...

718
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:47,153
Go and sign up quickly.
I really want to watch them.

719
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,757
If you want, I can pay
your application fee.

720
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:50,291
Thank you!

721
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:54,827
It's okay! You, the lame,
are my brother.

722
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,364
My shoe is dirty again.

723
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:01,569
White shoes are easy to get dirty.

724
00:58:01,704 --> 00:58:03,365
So...

725
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,571
I can help you to clean it up!

726
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,642
I'm good at cleaning. Let me try!

727
00:58:08,178 --> 00:58:09,270
This is my duty!

728
00:58:09,412 --> 00:58:11,243
Hey! Let me try!

729
00:58:35,939 --> 00:58:37,065
Hi!

730
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:43,444
What are you doing?

731
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,774
Who are you?

732
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:51,317
Where do we go?

733
00:58:51,855 --> 00:58:56,656
Why are you so quiet? I need to go home.

734
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:04,529
I've waiting for a long time.

735
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,864
I'm sorry. Please, wait a moment.

736
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:40,467
Try this.

737
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:43,094
No. I just want to see the quality of it.

738
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:44,638
Touch it.

739
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:46,104
I'll make it dirty.

740
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:47,937
- No problem. Go ahead.
- No...

741
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:50,671
- Touch it.
- No.

742
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:56,351
- How about that?
- So smooth.

743
00:59:56,486 --> 01:00:00,149
- I promise I'll buy one for you.
- I've touched it already. That's enough.

744
01:00:01,324 --> 01:00:04,725
Tomorrow, I'm going to play soccer.

745
01:00:04,861 --> 01:00:06,021
Really?

746
01:00:06,162 --> 01:00:08,824
I must become a famous star player.

747
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:12,890
But if you didn't
help me to repair them...

748
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:15,027
I would never have played soccer.

749
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:18,238
You know, you're so important to me.

750
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:21,338
Tell me what you want.

751
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:23,308
I can afford it very soon.

752
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,876
If you become rich and famous,
please buy me sneakers.

753
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:33,685
No problem!

754
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:36,883
You should have confidence.

755
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:39,957
Actually, you're a beautiful girl
who's amazing at kung fu.

756
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,563
You know, you are perfect.

757
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:45,293
You shouldn't let your hair down
and cover your face like this.

758
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:47,261
Come on.

759
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,537
- Come on. Look at me.
- No...

760
01:00:50,673 --> 01:00:52,664
Look at me!

761
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:56,139
So beautiful!

762
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:58,310
Really?

763
01:00:58,448 --> 01:00:59,938
Yes, of course.

764
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:06,419
Is it a fly?

765
01:01:06,556 --> 01:01:08,615
Yes. But I didn't catch it.

766
01:01:08,925 --> 01:01:09,721
Have you caught it?

767
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:11,326
I have.

768
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:13,085
I'm sorry. I made your hand dirty.

769
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:14,457
No problem.

770
01:01:14,597 --> 01:01:17,532
You know, you're the most beautiful girl.

771
01:01:19,602 --> 01:01:20,762
Do you know that?

772
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:21,927
Yes. I do.

773
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:24,301
Thank you! Thanks so much!

774
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,203
Do you know?

775
01:01:28,244 --> 01:01:29,268
Where to go?

776
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:32,472
I let you bring a girl here because
you promised me you'd clean the store.

777
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:35,049
Hurry up! If you haven't finished
the work on time, I'll be in trouble.

778
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,618
Go home. I'll call you later.

779
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,114
Okay?

780
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:48,056
Remember! You should have confidence.
You're the best.

781
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:53,736
I like your shirt.

782
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,768
I like your socks, too.

783
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,201
- Good change.
- Very good...

784
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:57,897
Hey, guys! You didn't think
this would ever happen?

785
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,100
Just play like you're training.

786
01:02:00,243 --> 01:02:02,234
There'll be hundreds of reporters
and a huge crowd.

787
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:03,572
You guys should keep smiling...

788
01:02:03,713 --> 01:02:04,839
...and let the reporters
take pictures of us.

789
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:08,246
You also need to say hi and
thank the crowd for their support.

790
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:13,117
Thank you!

791
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:14,223
Thank you!

792
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:16,257
Thanks for your support!

793
01:02:16,392 --> 01:02:17,188
Thank you!

794
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:18,258
They're just cleaners.

795
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:19,884
A cleaner is also the audience.

796
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:21,519
Thank you!

797
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:24,292
Shut up!

798
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:27,095
The auditorium is so small and empty.
You said...

799
01:02:27,236 --> 01:02:28,726
This is just the first round.

800
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:31,499
So we should play well
and get into the finals.

801
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:36,704
- Great! Get into the finals!
- Shut up!

802
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:45,514
Shaolin Team?

803
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,292
Look at this guy!

804
01:02:54,797 --> 01:02:56,822
Look at that guy!

805
01:02:59,869 --> 01:03:01,200
What happened?

806
01:03:01,804 --> 01:03:03,066
No smoking here?

807
01:03:17,453 --> 01:03:18,920
What happened?

808
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,252
It's impossible! Just an illusion!

809
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:32,925
What are you doing?

810
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:37,732
It's okay, just an illusion.

811
01:03:37,874 --> 01:03:40,104
I think we should
show off our real power.

812
01:03:40,243 --> 01:03:41,301
Great!

813
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,511
What's wrong?

814
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:58,049
Please don't play like this!
I really want to play soccer!

815
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:03,055
Hung, it's your call.

816
01:04:07,503 --> 01:04:11,098
I'm not scared. It's just an illusion.

817
01:04:45,341 --> 01:04:47,935
What? Forty nil?

818
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,412
Yeah!

819
01:05:14,937 --> 01:05:18,839
Got a goal! Iron Head!

820
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,677
Yes, we use Shaolin kung fu
to play soccer.

821
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:58,302
So kung fu is great and wonderful!

822
01:05:58,447 --> 01:05:59,539
- We lie low...
- And...

823
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:01,240
I want to thank my parents
and my Shaolin master.

824
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:02,544
Even though they've already passed away.

825
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:05,176
I want to thank my good friend, Mui.

826
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,152
Mui...How are you?

827
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:10,187
Have you had dinner yet?

828
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:22,662
Hi! Can I help?

829
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:23,601
I want...

830
01:06:23,739 --> 01:06:26,970
I understand. Let me take care of you!

831
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:36,785
Would you mind showing us kung fu?

832
01:06:36,919 --> 01:06:38,352
Yes, of course, Sixth Small Brother.

833
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:40,755
1, 2, 3!

834
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,288
Great!

835
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:45,519
Can you show us one more?

836
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:49,654
- Sure!
- Big Brother, one more please.

837
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:06,046
Take it easy!

838
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:11,811
My Brothers,

839
01:07:11,954 --> 01:07:15,117
today we say goodbye to our old sneakers.

840
01:07:19,762 --> 01:07:20,956
Don't throw anything here!

841
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:23,292
Sorry...

842
01:07:30,706 --> 01:07:32,071
Mui?

843
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,573
What's up?

844
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,978
I can't believe
you are that kind of person.

845
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:38,543
What is it?

846
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:40,411
I know what you are doing.

847
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:42,210
What? You are bad.

848
01:07:43,085 --> 01:07:44,279
You can't frighten me.

849
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:46,344
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

850
01:07:47,523 --> 01:07:48,820
What do you mean?

851
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:51,119
Nothing. It's for you.

852
01:07:59,268 --> 01:08:00,929
I think...

853
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:03,264
I think i'm a little bit different.

854
01:08:03,406 --> 01:08:04,464
Truly.

855
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:08,566
You've confidence now.

856
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,946
I want to tell you something.

857
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:18,383
What's up?

858
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:21,280
I like you!

859
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:23,221
I like you, too!

860
01:08:26,162 --> 01:08:28,562
Is this love?

861
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:33,433
You...

862
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,901
You're kidding.

863
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:40,434
No. I'm serious.

864
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,408
Absolutely not. This is not love.

865
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,713
We're friends forever...

866
01:08:51,287 --> 01:08:53,084
Don't you think it's good for us?

867
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:55,386
Okay! It's fine.

868
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:08,165
So you'll come to see me often?

869
01:09:08,637 --> 01:09:11,435
If your shoes are broken,
I'll help you to repair them again.

870
01:09:11,574 --> 01:09:15,374
No, thanks. If my shoes are broken,
I must throw them away.

871
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:18,002
We should look forward to the future.

872
01:09:18,214 --> 01:09:21,240
I'll never wear any broken shoes.

873
01:09:29,825 --> 01:09:31,417
Don't be like this.

874
01:09:32,561 --> 01:09:34,552
What's wrong? You're crying?

875
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:38,127
Don't do this.

876
01:09:50,212 --> 01:09:51,770
I understand.

877
01:09:53,516 --> 01:09:54,949
Thank you!

878
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,917
Come here!

879
01:10:00,055 --> 01:10:03,650
- Mui, you look very nice today.
- Cheers!

880
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,330
After winning this round,
we'll go to the finals.

881
01:10:13,469 --> 01:10:14,333
Go to the finals!

882
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:15,732
But we can't look down at our opponent!

883
01:10:15,871 --> 01:10:17,338
Look down at our opponent!

884
01:10:21,043 --> 01:10:24,240
We're a really strong team.

885
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,677
I won't let you get into the finals.

886
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:37,090
Oh, my God! How come?

887
01:10:37,226 --> 01:10:39,091
It's the special effects?

888
01:11:58,574 --> 01:11:59,632
Good morning, Hung!

889
01:12:00,175 --> 01:12:01,073
Good morning!

890
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,404
Come here!

891
01:12:02,544 --> 01:12:05,138
You're a lucky guy.

892
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:07,044
You're so lucky to get this great team.

893
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:08,046
Thank you.

894
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:11,641
Actually, Iron Head and Iron Shirt
are like street performers.

895
01:12:11,787 --> 01:12:13,778
It's amusing for your guys
to use kung fu to play soccer

896
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:15,446
and then to reach the finals.

897
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,650
You did a good job.

898
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,452
Don't waste our time!

899
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:24,695
Give up on the finals
and join my Evil Team!

900
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:28,769
It's not a dishonour check.

901
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:31,498
You can get the money
before signing up with me.

902
01:12:32,374 --> 01:12:33,966
It's a lots of money.

903
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:36,168
Probably, I can break my left leg
and then retire.

904
01:12:36,312 --> 01:12:39,213
Sure! We're brothers.

905
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:41,009
Thank you.

906
01:12:41,283 --> 01:12:43,148
But I think I can't take it.

907
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:46,921
What? Don't you think I'm afraid of you?

908
01:12:47,056 --> 01:12:51,516
I think your team has great potential.
So maybe we can join together.

909
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,527
Don't be so easily upset.
Think about your future.

910
01:12:54,697 --> 01:12:56,722
Forget the hostility. Okay?

911
01:12:56,999 --> 01:13:00,526
Hung, I didn't keep
the hostility in mind.

912
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:05,163
I know, it was all my fault.
I can't blame anyone.

913
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:08,139
You're lying!

914
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:12,144
I know you so well. You're so greedy!

915
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:15,973
You're right!

916
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:19,615
I'm very greedy. My team is greedy, too.

917
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:21,814
But we've not got
an insatiable greed for money.

918
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:24,619
We've an insatiable greed
for the championship.

919
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:27,327
See you on the soccer field.

920
01:14:01,797 --> 01:14:03,458
Wait! Wait for a moment! Thank you!

921
01:14:09,004 --> 01:14:10,266
Mui!

922
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:11,701
She died!

923
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:13,234
How come?

924
01:14:14,343 --> 01:14:15,742
I killed her!

925
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:16,674
Oh, no!

926
01:14:16,812 --> 01:14:18,712
Mui is the master-hand of Tai Chi.

927
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:20,940
She's been treated unjustly!

928
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,983
What do you want?

929
01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:24,949
Revenge!

930
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:27,651
Don't be silly! It's just a joke!

931
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,524
She's still alive.
She just doesn't work here.

932
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:32,926
Why?

933
01:14:33,395 --> 01:14:36,193
You know, my stall
is well-known for sweet steamed bread.

934
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:37,559
But now the steamed bread...

935
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,189
she makes has become salty and bitter.

936
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:41,131
She's ruined my business.

937
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,602
I didn't have any choice.

938
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:44,967
Salty and bitter?

939
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:46,631
Yes.

940
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:49,539
What's your name? Can I help?

941
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:54,314
No, thanks.

942
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:03,252
It's time to go!

943
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:44,258
Boss, how many goals
do you expect to score today?

944
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:47,665
Goals are not the only way to win.

945
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,962
I've a great idea to help us win.

946
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:30,462
Impossible.

947
01:20:34,635 --> 01:20:37,968
I hadn't imagined how wonderful
American drugs could be!

948
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:00,960
Actually the referee, linesman,

949
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:04,552
soccer association, soccer federation
and soccer committee...

950
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:06,892
all stand by me.

951
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:08,899
How can they fight with me?

952
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:44,698
No problem!

953
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:48,570
- Great!
- Fit!

954
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:50,434
Wonderful!

955
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:50,898
Throw-in?

956
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:53,131
He did it on purpose.

957
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:56,106
How could you judge to be throw-in?

958
01:22:56,309 --> 01:22:59,335
Hung, are you fighting or playing soccer?

959
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:01,606
Fighting. So what?

960
01:23:01,748 --> 01:23:04,911
I should break all your guys' legs
and make you all cripples.

961
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:07,282
Cripples! Cripples! Cripples!

962
01:23:07,421 --> 01:23:08,683
How are you going to fight me?

963
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:13,982
I'm sorry. I should take a break.

964
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:16,288
It's okay. You just physically leave us,

965
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,421
but your spirits
will stay in our minds forever.

966
01:23:36,616 --> 01:23:39,084
Bend over! It's my turn.

967
01:23:57,671 --> 01:23:58,763
Sixth Small Brother!

968
01:24:35,709 --> 01:24:38,906
What's wrong? Why didn't you stop it?

969
01:24:46,052 --> 01:24:47,883
All your guys are badly injured
after the first half.

970
01:24:48,021 --> 01:24:49,113
How can you play the second one?

971
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:51,850
Go home! There's no way your guys
can play the second half!

972
01:24:51,992 --> 01:24:53,152
Not interested!

973
01:24:53,293 --> 01:24:55,853
Maybe I can go down and dance for a show.

974
01:24:55,996 --> 01:24:59,090
No! It's not your turn. It's mine!

975
01:25:04,371 --> 01:25:05,770
Bullshit!

976
01:25:21,922 --> 01:25:25,619
Get out!

977
01:25:25,825 --> 01:25:27,554
You guys don't want to play anymore!

978
01:25:28,728 --> 01:25:30,423
Who did it?

979
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:31,719
Anyone see it?

980
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:35,100
Hit my face, if you're brave enough!

981
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:37,699
Rub gently.

982
01:25:37,837 --> 01:25:40,431
I can't believe it,
they're much more lawless than me.

983
01:25:40,574 --> 01:25:41,973
I can't believe that...

984
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:44,269
my reputation is ruined.

985
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:48,308
I've knew that
they'd do something to us,

986
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:50,109
but I didn't imagine they'd be so cruel.

987
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,774
The Evil Team is not so terrific.

988
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:54,250
They must take pills or have injections.

989
01:25:54,387 --> 01:25:56,116
Call the police!

990
01:25:56,256 --> 01:25:57,188
Anyway,

991
01:25:57,357 --> 01:25:58,585
we should try our best to keep going.

992
01:25:58,725 --> 01:26:00,124
We'll get the win!

993
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,319
My house is on fire, I need to go!

994
01:26:02,462 --> 01:26:03,690
I'm sorry. My wife is giving
birth right now.

995
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,388
I should go home to take care of her.

996
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:06,821
Can you ask her to wait
until the end of the game?

997
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:08,525
You can't give up!

998
01:26:08,668 --> 01:26:10,465
They're not playing soccer.
They're killing us!

999
01:26:10,604 --> 01:26:12,572
I beg you. Please don't leave us!

1000
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:14,196
I beg you back.

1001
01:26:14,374 --> 01:26:15,363
Please let me go!

1002
01:26:18,144 --> 01:26:21,079
Calm down!

1003
01:26:21,214 --> 01:26:23,148
Calm down!

1004
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:27,283
Yes, he's right!

1005
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:31,288
We should keep going.

1006
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,051
Now, we just have eight players.

1007
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,024
If there is one more injury,

1008
01:26:35,161 --> 01:26:37,288
we'll fail.

1009
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:40,330
We must try our best
to fight for the killer kick.

1010
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:43,129
How come? If you fight for
one killer kick, I'll fight for three.

1011
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:44,794
What are you talking about?

1012
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:49,441
Calm down!

1013
01:26:49,576 --> 01:26:50,702
Calm down!

1014
01:26:50,844 --> 01:26:52,175
Shut up!

1015
01:26:58,818 --> 01:27:00,809
I'm not sure if I can fight for it.

1016
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:19,666
Shaolin Lou Han Array!

1017
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,167
Array?

1018
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,672
Can't stand for a single shot!

1019
01:27:30,884 --> 01:27:32,977
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

1020
01:28:12,092 --> 01:28:13,491
Chun!

1021
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,491
- Tin?
- Yes.

1022
01:28:15,962 --> 01:28:17,623
I've kept a secret
in my mind for many years,

1023
01:28:17,764 --> 01:28:20,358
but I really want
to tell you at this moment.

1024
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:23,559
Chun, I love you!

1025
01:29:09,549 --> 01:29:11,346
Do you think we're that cruel?

1026
01:29:11,651 --> 01:29:14,518
- I don't think so!
- Really?

1027
01:29:14,654 --> 01:29:16,781
So we can be harsher.

1028
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:51,147
Brothers! Go!

1029
01:29:52,025 --> 01:29:53,424
What?

1030
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:59,121
Be careful!

1031
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,588
Watch out!

1032
01:30:29,762 --> 01:30:30,786
Shit!

1033
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:59,349
Hurry up! Don't pretend to be injured!

1034
01:30:59,492 --> 01:31:02,518
You're so smart! I'm fine.

1035
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,567
Time is almost up! Use the final attack!

1036
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,101
Final attack?

1037
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:45,929
It's useless for you guys...

1038
01:31:46,072 --> 01:31:47,403
...to stall for time.

1039
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:48,999
Win!

1040
01:31:54,814 --> 01:31:55,872
Shaolin Team.

1041
01:31:56,516 --> 01:31:58,416
Now, you only have seven players.

1042
01:31:58,551 --> 01:32:00,382
If you don't have any substitute players,

1043
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,078
I'll stop the game...

1044
01:32:02,221 --> 01:32:03,620
and announce that the game's over.

1045
01:32:09,429 --> 01:32:10,555
Any substitute players?

1046
01:32:12,966 --> 01:32:15,400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1047
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:18,896
My turn!

1048
01:32:20,206 --> 01:32:21,969
I'm the substitute player.

1049
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,401
I'm the goalkeeper.

1050
01:32:30,216 --> 01:32:32,582
Why did you dress up as E.T.?

1051
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:36,020
I don't know how to cut my hair,
so it's easier for me to shave it.

1052
01:32:36,155 --> 01:32:37,520
For what?

1053
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:39,180
I want to help you.

1054
01:32:39,325 --> 01:32:40,383
How can you do that?

1055
01:32:40,526 --> 01:32:41,959
Go back to Mars,

1056
01:32:42,095 --> 01:32:43,653
Earth is so dangerous.

1057
01:32:43,796 --> 01:32:44,728
I really want to help you.

1058
01:32:44,864 --> 01:32:46,092
Trust me! Let me try!

1059
01:32:46,232 --> 01:32:49,827
- No way!
- You see,

1060
01:32:49,969 --> 01:32:51,334
your shoes were broken.

1061
01:32:53,539 --> 01:32:54,665
Put these on.

1062
01:33:40,653 --> 01:33:41,585
The opposite end.

1063
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,396
Go!

1064
01:33:56,135 --> 01:33:56,931
Great!

1065
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:13,645
Watch out!

1066
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:25,345
What happened?

1067
01:36:25,484 --> 01:36:26,781
What happened?

1068
01:36:26,919 --> 01:36:28,386
Boss, watch out?

1069
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:30,216
Damn it!

1070
01:36:33,426 --> 01:36:36,486
Boss!

1071
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:39,461
Boss!

1072
01:38:04,116 --> 01:38:08,644
Shaolin win the championship!

1073
01:38:10,823 --> 01:38:12,882
Evil team uses drugs and
receive a permanent suspension.

1074
01:38:13,025 --> 01:38:16,222
Leader Hung was sentenced to 5 years in jail.

1075
01:39:33,472 --> 01:39:38,842
Wait! Stop it!
