1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,274
The word is "banns".

2
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,775
Bands, bands, bands, bands.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,277
Bands. Oh-h...

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,981
There's gotta
be something I can think of.

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:18,484
With a "d" sound or
without a "d" sound?

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,487
Um, you said it's
a homonym and you told me what it means,

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,990
but am I allowed to ask
what its homonym means?

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,491
All right, i'm
starting over.

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,497
B-a-n-...

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,001
D...

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,504
What I have so
far is b-a-n-d.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,508
I don't know if that
was a great idea but...

13
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,510
Oops, maybe I shouldn't
have said that. Oh well.

14
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,894
Yesterday, the artist in the blue smock

15
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,497
sketched and painted
Margaret Ann's portrait.

16
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,502
Who sketched and painted
Margaret Ann's portrait?

17
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,005
How do you guys describe life out here?

18
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,506
Boring.
Boring.

19
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,008
Boring.

20
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,711
There's nothing much to do

21
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,213
except go to the theatre.

22
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,113
Terrible there.

23
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,115
I know.

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,116
It's terrible there.

25
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,621
I've had some of my friends

26
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,023
sign the cards.

27
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,025
Like Chelsea, she's
a good friend of mine.

28
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,526
If I see that name

29
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,028
and it's right
next to the word,

30
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,031
I kind of think that
she's cheering me on,

31
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,632
you know, to win
the spelling bee.

32
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,137
I also wrote down
words on poster board

33
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,140
and I glued 'em
on here, and...

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,242
I kind of made this
little crossword puzzle.

35
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,745
Who taught you these methods of learning spelling?

36
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,749
I guess I kind of just...

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,652
Came up with them myself.

38
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,154
Whoo-oo-oo!

39
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,664
Whoo-oo!

40
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,169
Whoo-oo!

41
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,072
Angela was kind of giving him a hard time

42
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,574
the other
day, that...

43
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,076
'Cause he didn't
know any English,

44
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,078
and she said, "you know,
you've been here for 20 years

45
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,080
and you can't speak English."

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,581
He says, "well I've been
taking care of cattle

47
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,584
for 20 years. They
don't speak English."

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,593
He's worked here,

49
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,094
practically, I think,

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,595
for about... what is it?

51
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,098
19 or 20 years now?

52
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,099
20.

53
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,600
Huh?

54
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,602
20.

55
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,604
30...

56
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,608
20!
20.

57
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,110
I knew it was
19 or 20 he's worked here.

58
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,615
He's a real
reliable...

59
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,719
He's a reliable
Mexican.

60
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,223
And of course
you run into a few Mexicans pretty reliable.

61
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,726
They're not all
just bums and tramps, you know.

62
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,230
There's a lot
of good ones mixed up in them.

63
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,231
...Border patrol agents.

64
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,733
Senator Judith zaffirini
wants to give agents

65
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,235
the right to make arrests,

66
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,736
searches and seizures

67
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,538
for violations
of state law.

68
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,541
The father of a
border agent shot to death last year

69
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,043
is the one who requested
the legislation.

70
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,146
They're just
so proud that...

71
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,648
I mean, they didn't come
over here for nothing.

72
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:48,154
They thought we would
have better educational opportunities over here.

73
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,658
And I guess it has all
been worth it for them.

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,972
He was scared 'cause
back in his youth,

75
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
he had tried crossing
illegally and he had gotten caught,

76
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,976
and spent...

77
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,481
Quite a bit of time
in an immigration detention centre.

78
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,783
And he wasn't
treated very well.

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,486
I kind of had
an idea, as old as I was, believe it or not,

80
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,489
that, you know,
we weren't doing what... what was right.

81
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,994
To me, I just, you know,
I remember my mother

82
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,997
as, you know,
such an innocent...

83
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,999
Girl back then,
that was, you know...

84
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,001
Had these two children.

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,402
And I remember...

86
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,405
You know,
actually walking to the river.

87
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,408
She held me by
the hand and had my sister in her arms

88
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,409
when we
crossed.

89
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,911
Are you talking
about Angela?

90
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,415
How...

91
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,918
How did she
learn to speak English so well

92
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,922
since they
speak Spanish all the time?

93
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,924
Well, the
first way is...

94
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,926
First deal,
she's smart.

95
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,929
She don't
have to hear something but one time

96
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,932
and she knows
what it is.

97
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,245
When I took her home the other afternoon,

98
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,146
she said, "miss slaughter,

99
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,149
what if I don't win?"

100
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,151
And I said, "so you don't win.

101
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,152
You know, you've...

102
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,653
You're already...
You've won.

103
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,155
So you don't spell
the right word, okay."

104
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,659
I said, "then you
don't have to study for the next month."

105
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,161
She said, "yeah!" You
know how she is. "Yeah!"

106
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,564
I have been waiting for...

107
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
Tomorrow,
for that day.

108
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,268
I've been waiting
for it forever.

109
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,271
All year. All year.

110
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,773
And it's... I
can finally say,

111
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,276
"tomorrow is the
regional spelling bee."

112
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,777
I could finally say that.

113
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,792
As you know, the spellers

114
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,295
are under a
tremendous amount of stress and pressure.

115
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,096
So we'd like... we need
to try for the audience

116
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,199
to keep as quiet
as you possibly can.

117
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,200
Speller 21.

118
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,202
"Cultivation."

119
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,205
Cultivation:

120
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:26,212
C-u-l-t-i-v-a-t-i-o-n.

121
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,213
Cultivation.

122
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,220
C-o-m-e-d-i-a-n.

123
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,221
Comedian.

124
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:40,726
P-o-d-a-n-t-i-c.

125
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,731
P-e-d-a-n-t-i-c.

126
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,733
Correct spelling:

127
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,736
R-a-p-p-e-l-l-e-d.

128
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,244
Could I have spellers 21 and 24 to the mic, please?

129
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,746
"Angstroms."

130
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,251
A-n-g-s-t-r-o-m-s.

131
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,756
"Atrophy."

132
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,258
A-t-r-o-...

133
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,260
"Extenuate."

134
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,761
Extenuate.
"Bludgeon."

135
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,262
Bludgeon.
Radiocin.

136
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,764
I-o-c-i-....

137
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,265
"Chapeau."

138
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,267
"Renowned."

139
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,768
"Perpetuate."

140
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,770
Interrogatory...

141
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,572
Prophylaxis...
Feasible...

142
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,974
Post-prandial...
Stamina...

143
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,978
"Valetudinarian."

144
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,981
Val-et-udinarian:

145
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,985
V-a-l-e-...

146
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,490
T-u-...

147
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:50,496
D-i-n-a-r-i-a-n.

148
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,497
Valetudinarian.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,501
"Cabana."

150
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,505
C-a-b-a-n-y-a.

151
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,006
Cabanya.

152
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,009
I'm sorry, it's incorrect.

153
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,911
Angela, you now have
a chance to spell the championship word.

154
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,914
"Crocodilian."

155
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,417
C-r-o-c-

156
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,420
o-d-i-l-i-a-n.

157
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,421
We have a champ.

158
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,734
I did it.

159
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,736
Turn around here.

160
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,238
...around the
other side.

161
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,740
Put you in
the middle. Yeah.

162
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,841
Put you in
the middle.

163
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,742
There you go, gram, that's good.

164
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,745
Talk about your winner.
That looks great.

165
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,248
Oh, I did it.
I did it!

166
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,653
Maybe.
Washington.

167
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm just... i'm
like, "whoa."

168
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,162
See you
Friday. Okay...

169
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,963
I don't even
know some of them.

170
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,466
An eighth grader
in perryton was the guest of honour

171
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,468
at a pep rally
and parade today.

172
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,970
Angela arenivar is
off to Washington, D.C. this weekend

173
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:05,972
for the national
spelling bee.

174
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,974
She's the regional
spelling champ.

175
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,475
And today, Angela's
teachers and classmates

176
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,976
gave her a
royal send-off.

177
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,979
A-r-e-n-i-v-a-r,

178
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,080
in case you're
wondering.

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,081
You cheated.
See you tonight.

180
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,182
Good night.

181
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,684
I mean, I was crying
after the spelling bee.

182
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,187
I'm... I've never
cried, like, for being happy, you know?

183
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,191
That's how happy I was.

184
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,693
Your dad was crying. He... oh...

185
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,194
I've never seen
my dad cry.

186
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,099
He's going to go.

187
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,102
He didn't really
want to go at first,

188
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,405
but you know he's been
out here for 20, 25 years.

189
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,407
He came here...

190
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,410
His... I think that it
would be closing for him

191
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,911
to go to Washington
and see Angela

192
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,413
because this is
what he came here for.

193
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,415
He didn't come
out here to work.

194
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,417
I mean, that's part of it.

195
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,918
But the closing
in it for me,

196
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,419
the end of the
story is for him

197
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,121
to get to go to
Washington and see her.

198
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,044
Mesoseismal:

199
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,145
Of, or relating to,

200
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,647
the centre of an area of
earthquake disturbance.

201
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,451
My parents were very
pressured to succeed,

202
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,454
especially in
India, because...

203
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,357
Academics there are taken
very, very seriously.

204
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,470
People from India have a very strict philosophy

205
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,971
about education
with their children,

206
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,073
and I notice that with
all the children from India

207
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,575
who come into my class.

208
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,076
I'm always thrilled

209
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:55,081
to see any child come in
who is from India

210
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,084
because I know that
they're going to have a great work ethic,

211
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,585
and they're going to be
good students. And it's...

212
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,087
I've never been wrong,
not one single time.

213
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,195
Hymenoptera:

214
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,098
An extensive
order of highly specialized insects...

215
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,202
Nupur, can you
spell "laicize"?

216
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,405
L-a-i-c-i-z-e.

217
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,607
B-u-s-h-i-d-o.

218
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,109
And she always liked big
words for some reason.

219
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,111
Right? Yeah.

220
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,012
The bigger the word,
the better she liked it.

221
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,513
She would say things like,

222
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,716
"I don't have
any opportunities"

223
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,718
when she had
no idea what opportunity meant.

224
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,919
Yeah.
But she liked the sounds.

225
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,920
So there she be

226
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,322
at two and a half and
she had no opportunity.

227
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,824
"Munchausen."

228
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,325
Oh, Munchausen syndrome.

229
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,330
M-u-n-c-h-a-u-s-e-n.

230
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,332
Hm-hmm.

231
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,539
She had a lot of trouble
beating the trio there,

232
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,841
sid, Alex and ju jing.

233
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,342
It was the eighth grade bee,

234
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,345
and they were going to
send the eighth grade representative

235
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,146
to the "tampa tribune"
to compete.

236
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,648
All we did was
try to win.

237
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,549
Oh yeah. I wanted
to beat her.

238
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,552
They would be like,
"oh, nupur, we're gonna go out there

239
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,055
and we're gonna beat
you. We're gonna try so, so, so hard."

240
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,557
She had this
little tactic. She would...

241
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,560
She acted
like she was not nervous.

242
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,562
And then I remember,
one of the boys,

243
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,364
especially the one who
had seemed very confident,

244
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,568
he got the word
mongrel, and suddenly he blanked out.

245
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,070
I spelled it
m-o-n-g-r-o-l.

246
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,571
I don't know...

247
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,073
I guess I was just
pretty nervous.

248
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,174
And then it was
the three of US,

249
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,976
two of those boys and me.

250
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,678
We went on for, I think,
11 or 12 rounds.

251
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,681
Well, I got out
on "stethoscope".

252
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,083
He was a fast speller.

253
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,584
He didn't like
definitions.

254
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:43,589
So he started
going, "s-t-h-t-..."

255
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,591
And then all of
a sudden he goes...

256
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,292
And then he covers
his face with his hands

257
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,395
and he's like, "no."

258
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,897
My word was
"iridescent."

259
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,899
I, like...

260
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,900
I thought it
had two rs.

261
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,401
We all thought
it had two rs. Yeah. Every...

262
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,203
A lot of
people thought it had two rs.

263
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,705
And then they
started looking it up in the dictionary,

264
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,707
so we waited up there
for five minutes.

265
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,710
And I remember him
wringing his hands the whole time,

266
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,212
wondering, "oh my gosh.
Am I right? Am I right?"

267
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,715
He wanted to win. He
wanted to win very badly.

268
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,716
He was wrong.

269
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,119
So that's our
story. She beat US.

270
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,123
And that was the most
nerve-wracking experience of this entire...

271
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,624
Of all these
preliminary bees.

272
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,630
She was very happy,

273
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,732
and her mother
was very happy.

274
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,234
I was boo-hooing, sobbing,

275
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,736
you know, so hard

276
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,237
that they came over
to me and said,

277
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,739
"you must be her mother."

278
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,144
They are part of this community.

279
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,547
People accept them
for who they are

280
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,050
and can
look beyond differences,

281
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,452
you know, to
find things that are common.

282
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,557
We're very community involved.

283
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,560
We saw one of the people
from our community

284
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,962
being recognized as a
spelling bee champion,

285
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,965
and... so we right
away put it up and congratulated her.

286
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,070
Last year, I would say

287
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,074
the only bad experience
I had the entire bee was getting out.

288
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,976
This year I came back with
a lot more determination.

289
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,979
And I said, "you know,
you could always come back next year."

290
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,482
And she said, "oh,
I am. I'm coming back next year."

291
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,885
She said, "I know what
to do. I'm gonna work."

292
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,887
You don't get any
second chances in India

293
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,288
the way you do in america.

294
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,621
"Mayonnaise."

295
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,122
Mayonnaise:

296
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,123
A-... uh...

297
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,625
I messed up already.

298
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,129
Fine.

299
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,132
M-a-y-o-n-n-a-i-s-e.

300
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,133
Mayonnaise.

301
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
That is correct.

302
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,335
We have our winner.

303
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,837
We have our winner.

304
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,540
Congratulations.

305
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,043
Have you watched the national bee on TV before?

306
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,046
No. I never even heard
of it before this year.

307
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,548
The teacher just asked me
if I wanted to be in it,

308
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,050
and the school
provided the $50.

309
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,854
Wow.

310
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,856
That's going to
go right in the centre of the mantle.

311
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,073
I don't think Ted has any really close friends.

312
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,575
And sometimes
this school can be...

313
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,081
A little less
than kind to new people,

314
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,083
and new people who
are especially a little different,

315
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,085
and Ted is, because
he's that intelligent.

316
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,888
But he knows how
to handle that.

317
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,891
His size helps him.

318
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,692
You're the man.

319
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,696
Go, go, go!

320
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,500
There are a couple smart kids in my grade,

321
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,002
but... not many.

322
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,108
Our class only has,
like, 40 kids in it.

323
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,311
They just like
using simple words,

324
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,313
words that
you'll understand.

325
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,316
A lot of the time,
they just talk about the same things.

326
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,319
A kid in my class, all
he talks about is trucks.

327
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,822
So anything you say to
him that doesn't have to do with an engine

328
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,827
or how the truck
runs, besides real basic English,

329
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,328
he won't understand
what you're saying.

330
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,133
Here's the
peacocks.

331
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,636
One of them is the five- year-old male.

332
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,639
It's the one
with all the feathers.

333
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,140
We have a
five-year-old female

334
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,042
and, like, a
nine-year-old female.

335
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,045
If you pick
them up by their feet

336
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,547
and they hang
like a "j",

337
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,549
they get
real docile.

338
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,461
They'll remain...

339
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,465
Like this for a
long time until they get a head rush.

340
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,966
I've always liked
it out here.

341
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,467
It's calm and
it's peaceful.

342
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,470
We don't end up having
a lot of traffic. We...

343
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,973
Can do pretty much
whatever we want

344
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,974
as long as we're not...

345
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,478
Causing problems
for anybody else.

346
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,481
Older boy needs
direction, and...

347
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,982
I think the marines
would be good for him.

348
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,984
And... his interests

349
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,986
just are not things that...

350
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,987
They're not like...

351
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,488
I'd push him to do it,

352
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,991
but it's the things
he's interested in, guns and explosives

353
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,492
and weapons
and all that... I told him you gotta be

354
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,994
on the right
side of the law with his interests,

355
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:49,995
or he'll
be in jail.

356
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,305
I think it's pretty cool.

357
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,707
See, I know he
is really smart.

358
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,710
What's his IQ?

359
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,414
I think his IQ is one
short of being a genius.

360
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,916
I'm really not that
good in spelling.

361
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,718
I'm really good in math.

362
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,722
I teach learning
disabilities now and...

363
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,724
I'm certified to teach
regular education

364
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,726
and learning
disabilities both.

365
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,728
And I think I just
had a lot of empathy

366
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,731
for the kids that
were struggling and having a hard time.

367
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,342
"Chapm." "chapm."

368
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,844
Hey, chapm,
how you doing?

369
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,052
It's nice 'cause he's not real...

370
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,054
Conceited
about it.

371
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,056
And if he ever got
that way, we'd...

372
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,061
Try and bring
him down a little bit.

373
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,365
Are you nervous about the national bee?

374
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,266
Yeah.

375
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,768
Yeah, I've never been
to Washington before.

376
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,771
Pretty much stayed
in the midwest.

377
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,773
Haven't been to
the east coast or the west coast.

378
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,776
I think this is going
to open some doors for him to realize,

379
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,780
"hey, there's a lot
of people out there that are like me.

380
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,283
I will be able
to fit in."

381
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,584
You know, there may
not be a lot of them,

382
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,086
and they're not
going to be.

383
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,495
If there's no one that can really understand you

384
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,097
so it makes you feel like
you're above them. But...

385
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,101
It's kind of strange.
It's kind of hard to make friends

386
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,604
when no one can understand
what all you can do.

387
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,520
B-u-r-g...

388
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,324
B-u-r-g. Burg, burg...

389
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,333
Pusillanimous.

390
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,835
Spelling is kind of just like...

391
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,838
I do it because...

392
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,340
I don't know, my
competitive side kind of comes out.

393
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,343
And I don't
love spelling.

394
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,845
I do it 'cause
I want to compete.

395
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,849
I want to say,
"hey, look at me. I'm good at this.

396
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,351
'Cause I ride with people
who are better than me

397
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,152
and I sing with people
who are better than me."

I just talk, I think, like
a normal teenager would,

409
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,086
maybe with some big
words, but nothing out of the ordinary.

410
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:07,693
...divided by 3x over
9 times x minus 2.

411
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,694
Okay now, Emily,
what are you going to do

412
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,195
with a squared
minus b squared?

413
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,696
There's a difference
of squares,

414
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,699
that's it.
So it's a minus b, a plus b.

415
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,701
Okay.

416
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,203
Most of the words that I learn, I don't know what they mean.

417
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,704
I just remember
how to spell them.

418
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,208
And a lot of the ones
that I use, like a Moroccan desert wind...

419
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,310
And when am I
going to a chance

420
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,811
to use that
in a sentence?

421
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,014
Easy to spell
"cool" and "d-uh."

422
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,016
How do you
spell "d-uh?"

423
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,018
D-u-h.
Oh, okay.

424
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,519
Well I hate all the
words I've gotten out on.

425
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
I hate oracle, ossicular
and despotism,

426
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,523
are the three words
I've gotten out on in the past three years.

427
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,426
And I'm probably going
to hate one more word after Washington's over.

428
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,928
Cargador?

429
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,033
What's the language
of origin?

430
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,035
Spanish.

431
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,039
And once a letter is said, you can't take it back.

432
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,543
C-a-r-g-a-d-o-r.

433
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,045
Cargador.

434
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,548
Emily stagg gets the word correct.

435
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,453
Well, the first year we went,

436
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,954
we brought the
au pair as well.

437
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,456
We brought Claudia
from Germany.

438
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,957
And last year I
was just, like...

439
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,960
When we had to
fill out a form to say who we're going to bring,

440
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,462
I was like,
"mom, you forgot the au pair. You forgot Marie,"

441
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,464
who was our
then au pair. And she's like,

442
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,965
"well, I don't
think we're going to bring the au pair this year."

443
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,168
And I'm like,
"why not?"

444
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,669
You know? But
then we went,

445
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,671
and it was like
a family thing.

446
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,675
It was like a real
time to be with my mom and my dad

447
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,677
and... it was nice.

448
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,079
You're going on trips, you're going to picnics.

449
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,082
You're going
to ice cream socials.

450
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,084
And I was very
impressed. And when...

451
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,586
On the first...
Bus trip we had

452
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,588
before the actual
spelling bee,

453
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,591
I sat with a
mother of a girl

454
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,492
who was now
back for her second year.

455
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,996
And I vividly
remember saying how wonderful this all seemed.

456
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,300
And she had said,
"well I think it's a different form of child abuse,"

457
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,201
which sort of
took me aback.

458
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,704
And then the next day
Emily is, you know,

459
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,405
out on the first round,
and all the emotions

460
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,907
that came
with that,

461
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,910
and you see your
child who's really worked hard

462
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,913
seemingly, you
know, knocked down pretty hard,

463
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,914
and you start
to think, "well maybe... "

464
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,415
And it's like,
yeah, it is.

465
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,616
"Maybe this
woman is right."

466
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,918
"Heuristic."
Greek.

467
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,921
Heuristic?
Heuristic.

468
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,424
Didn't we do
this last night?

469
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,926
Don't remember.

470
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,428
At the beginning of the year,

471
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,431
we talked about whether
Emily wanted to work towards the goal

472
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,133
of returning to the
national spelling bee.

473
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
I just almost
feel like I would disappoint people

474
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:35,239
if I didn't do
as well as I did last year.

475
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,242
My daughter is very capable and talented

476
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,244
and I know she
could do well.

477
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,746
So there's a part of
me that wants to see her strive for that.

478
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,749
On the other hand, I knew
it would be a stress

479
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,751
and I really felt that
it was her decision.

480
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,656
I heard the
winning word was something that I had studied,

481
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,159
I would just be
like, "oh, that was dumb," you know.

482
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,662
Doesn't mean you
would've gotten that winning word though.

483
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,480
Obviously I'd like to win.

484
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,483
Everybody would like
to win. I don't think that's realistic.

485
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,484
People have told
me I'm up there

486
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,486
because I'm one of the
few returning spellers,

487
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,488
you know, that
placed high.

488
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,992
I'm not holding my breath
for anything great.

489
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,009
My life is like a movie.

490
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,012
How's that?

491
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,014
Because I go through
different trials and tribulations,

492
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,016
and then I finally
overcome them,

493
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,017
you know?

494
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,220
It's hard.
It's hard.

495
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,724
With the jobs and
everything, and...

496
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,226
Economy being like
it is, it's hard.

497
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,229
And the healthcare
situation...

498
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,731
It's hard.

499
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,233
I don't really
go outside much

500
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,736
because it's boring to me

501
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,738
because I don't
have any...

502
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,239
Peers around here,

503
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,242
and if I do,
well, I don't...

504
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,143
I rarely see them.

505
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,646
Our playground's
over there.

506
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,948
It's called kids' view.

507
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,951
It seems like it's
very fun for the boys

508
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,452
because they
play basketball.

509
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,954
It's like,
wherever you go,

510
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,958
if there's a
basketball court,

511
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,759
the boys are
always on there.

512
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,760
Girls just...

513
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,764
Stand around
talking and things.

514
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,071
Permeability:

515
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,073
Use, especially
of a substance,

516
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,075
that allows
the passage of fluids.

517
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,078
Permeability.

518
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,086
Per-me-a-bility.

519
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,587
I look at Ashley...

520
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,088
This is funny...

521
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,690
Like a little angel.

522
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,693
It's almost like you
know this perfect child.

523
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,796
It's like, of the full
package all around.

524
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,797
Think about it.

525
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,500
Is this supposed
to be "oasis?"

526
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,503
Mm-hmm.

527
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,012
I remember when she won citywide

528
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,215
and I said, "what's next?

529
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,716
What does she study from?"

530
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,217
They said,
"the dictionary."

531
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,720
All right, I'll tell you what.

532
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,722
Here. You
open it up.

533
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,726
And wherever
you go, that's where we going to start.

534
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,230
Where do you start with the dictionary?

535
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,032
"A", in the middle?

536
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,034
You know, I mean,
where do you start?

537
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,739
I hope there'll be
a big turnout on...

538
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,741
On... what day is that?

539
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,242
During the spelling bee.

540
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,245
I done called everybody.

541
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,447
I just hope they have
enough seats for 'em.

542
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,948
Two of her
uncles are incarcerated, but...

543
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,552
They'll watch it on TV.

544
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,053
They'll be there
with her, regardless.

545
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,856
Mm-hm.

546
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,858
What I would like
for her to do

547
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,360
is when she... I'll
be extremely happy

548
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,864
when she crosses that
stage at 12th grade with honours.

549
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,273
I'll have a job that pays well,

550
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,675
and I will love
my profession.

551
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,177
And I'll have
a house and...

552
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,181
And whenever my mother or
a family member needs me,

553
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,482
I'll be there for them.

554
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,985
I mean, they focus on children doing crime

555
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,987
and always talk
about negative,

556
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,488
and then they
have somebody that's from the district,

557
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,491
that's representing
the district, and they're not giving...

558
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,494
I don't think
they're giving Ashley her proper...

559
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,497
You know... her props.
Put it that way.

560
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,901
They told me I would receive a certificate

561
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,503
and a bag full of goodies

562
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,707
by the superintendent
of D.C. public schools

563
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,810
for winning the
citywide spelling bee.

564
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,313
There was a bomb
threat in the building.

565
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,815
What does that
mean... there was a bomb threat?

566
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,817
Because somebody
called and told them

567
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,318
that they were
going to bomb the building.

568
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,821
"Hines student is top speller, Ashley white."

569
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,823
They made an error.

570
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,125
11 years old. She's 13.

571
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,628
You see how
this stuff is going on now,

572
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,130
as far as
publicity-wise?

573
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,133
They're not
publicizing my...

574
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,636
Or recognizing
my daughter.

575
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,638
They're not
recognizing my daughter.

576
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,640
But it's fine.
It's okay.

577
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,742
'Cause she gonna
be all right.

578
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,243
Ashley, tell the truth.

579
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,246
When did you get
your spelling...

580
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,247
Your spelling material?

581
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,649
Your real
spelling material?

582
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,150
March something...

583
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,654
March what?

584
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,657
Your contest
was march 24th.

585
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,159
It was like, early in
the beginning of march.

586
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,663
And if she wins this,
prove me wrong,

587
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:03,167
but I know she won
the race even if she lost at the nationals.

588
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:07,172
But I'm not thinking...
Pessimistically.

589
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,175
I'm thinking
optimistically.

590
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,876
My baby gonna win.

591
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,879
And the word coming up
for you is "plague."

592
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,981
Plague.

593
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,482
Would you give me a
definition, please?

594
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,984
A destructively
numerous influx

595
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,487
or multiplication
of a noxious animal.

596
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,490
Plague...
Plague.

597
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,492
P-l-a-g-u-e.

598
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,495
I think, ladies and
gentlemen, we found our champion.

599
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,498
Man, that was the glorious day of my life.

600
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:38,102
Lord have mercy.
My baby spell that right.

601
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,103
Go girl,
go girl...

602
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,604
See? Look
at her.

603
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,506
She can't
believe herself.

604
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,509
That was the happiest
moment of my life.

605
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,611
I felt really good.

606
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,613
I think I prayed.

607
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,616
I prayed that night also.

608
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,117
I've been praying...

609
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,918
I think I'm a
prayer warrior.

610
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,922
I don't know why, but
it's some reason I just can't stop praying.

611
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,026
So whatever happens, I'll be happy for her.

612
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,528
As long as she
place in the top 50.

613
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,531
But I want her to
win in first place.

614
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,533
I would like for her to.

615
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,836
As I go higher, my
goals go higher also.

616
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,839
And so, I just gotta
keep on reaching, keep on reaching.

617
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,843
So this year, I Rose
above all of my problems

618
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,845
and I went straight
through the local,

619
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,346
straight through
the regional.

620
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,550
I was determined that
I was going to win the citywide spelling bee.

621
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,051
I told the photographer.

622
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,553
He was like, "so what
are you gonna do when you get to citywide?"

623
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,555
I said, "I'm gonna win."

624
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,557
And sure I did.

625
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,159
I won citywide
spelling bee.

626
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,660
Now I'm going
to the nationals.

627
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,074
"Hybrid."

628
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,075
H-y-b-r-i-d.

629
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,077
"Hydrophyte."
h-y-d-r-o-p-h-y-t-e.

630
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,079
"Hygiene."
h-y-g-i-e-n-e.

631
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,581
"Hymeneal."
h-y-m-e-n-e-a-l.

632
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,083
I-d-e-n-t-i-f-y.

633
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,584
"Ideology."
i-d-e-o-l-o-g-y.

634
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,588
"Idiosyncrasy."
i-d-i-o-s-y-n-c-r-a-s-y.

635
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,389
Excellent.

636
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,392
You've done 4,000
words and you got one mistake.

637
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,693
You're doing
good now.

638
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,194
We did all
the words

639
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,197
that were ever
given to spellers in the competition.

640
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,699
We collected the
data from all the previous spelling bees

641
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,203
and saw why
people were failing on certain words

642
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,205
and tried to
correct that for our kids.

643
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,208
So to derive a
complete number would be hard,

644
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,211
but I can tell
you that in the final days of the competition,

645
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,113
we're doing
between 7,000 to 8,000 words a day.

646
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,116
Very good.
"Sacrosanct."

647
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,118
S-a-c-r-o-s-a-n-c-t.

648
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,121
Sacrosanct means
mostly holy or overly sacred.

649
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,624
"Sardion."
s-a-r-d-i-o-n.

650
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,827
What we do is, to get
the meaning of the word,

651
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:45,329
we get the
language of origin,

652
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,332
we get the
root word,

653
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,334
we tell them to use
it in a sentence,

654
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,836
we tell them to
re-pronounce the word,

655
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,839
we understand the
meaning in our head.

656
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,343
Say the spelling
alphabetically inside your own head.

657
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,347
Match it with the
sound that you're going to come out with

658
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,349
that you just pronounced,

659
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,351
re-pronounce the
word in the head,

660
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,353
and then spell the
word out loud slowly.

661
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,758
That's what we do.

662
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,760
There are 46
words and you missed 3 words.

663
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,761
That's not bad.

664
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,764
And we still
have 25 days. Yeah.

665
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,766
So, thank god
for what we have.

666
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,667
It is definitely a
bonding experience.

667
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,170
We were close,
but this was like a crisis,

668
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,672
and we all had
to pitch in to help

669
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,174
whichever way we could.

670
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,676
If I could help him
pull his clothes out

671
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,179
and make sure that
they're ready for him when he takes shower

672
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,181
and he can save
two minutes,

673
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,483
that also was important.

674
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,486
When you fight in a war,

675
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,987
everybody has
the same goal.

676
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,493
He's only 12 years old.

677
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,895
He's in the 8th grade.

678
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,898
So he comes off the
spelling bee cycle

679
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,401
because he's academically
advanced early on.

680
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,303
So this is his first
and last chance.

681
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,304
This is my trophy

682
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,806
for winning the
orange county spelling bee.

683
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,210
And for, like, the
rest of that afternoon,

684
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,812
I was seeing, like,
white flashes and stuff.

685
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,515
I don't know why. I
guess I was just, like, too happy or something.

686
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,517
At the
spelling bee, I mean,

687
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,518
you'll find a
lot of people

688
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,519
that are
bookworms,

689
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,020
do wear really
thick glasses.

690
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,521
You know the
stereotypical,

691
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,524
quiet, shy,
studious types.

692
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,025
And then you'll
find people like my brother

693
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,526
who's, like, an athlete,

694
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,029
has, like, almost
a black belt in tae Kwon do.

695
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,031
He hangs out with
his friends, you know.

696
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,532
We go... I mean, yeah,
we do watch movies.

697
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,535
We watch TV.
We have a life.

698
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,442
I don't think every child can excel.

699
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,944
And the reason
it doesn't happen

700
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,446
is because they don't have
a way of concentrating

701
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,449
on what they're doing.

702
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,451
I think if
everybody meditated,

703
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,352
the competitions
like spelling bees

704
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,354
would become very,
very difficult.

705
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,461
We are very blessed and lucky to have kids like Neil,

706
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,864
and to be blessed
with this abundance.

707
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:04,368
I am so indebted to my
spiritual master and to god

708
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,371
and to this country,
you know, which will accept a stranger come in

709
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,873
and give them this
opportunity and...

710
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,375
America is just great.

711
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,677
This is our little house.

712
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,682
Me and my brother built
this house ourselves.

713
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,686
Every single thing
that you see here, we had no contractor.

714
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,188
We got the sub-contractors
and we did it all.

715
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,690
Granite, marble,
fireplace...

716
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,195
Stucco work,
sheffield doors,

717
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,698
backyard, hypo-allergenic
trees all around.

718
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,001
There is no way you can
fail in this country.

719
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,503
That's one guarantee
in this country

720
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,506
that if you work
hard, you'll make it.

721
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,008
And that's not existent
in the rest of the world,

722
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,509
at least in many
parts of the world.

723
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,526
I am a firm believer of having the best coach

724
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,027
for the problem
that you have.

725
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,028
"Dissent."

726
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,030
D-i-... oh, wait.
There's two.

727
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,531
Yeah, this...
Not coming down.

728
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,033
This is to
disagree.

729
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,435
D-i-s-s-e-n-t.
Uh-huh.

730
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,936
Well, I work with
Neil Monday, Tuesday,

731
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,338
Wednesday and Thursday.

732
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,839
We worked about 3 to 3 1/2 hours

733
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,042
and I get home about
11:00 o'clock at night.

734
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,543
We did that 4
nights a week.

735
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,045
And then Saturday, I
would sometimes come up

736
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,447
and work anywhere from
4 to 8 hours with him.

737
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,948
I'm tutoring
him in French.

738
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,951
He isn't taking
French as a subject,

739
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,954
but I'm tutoring him
in the French words

740
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,956
that may come up in the
national spelling bee.

741
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,358
Same thing
we did with a Spanish teacher

742
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,859
who came and
showed them the Spanish words

743
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,862
or why to break
them down.

744
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,363
And then we got
a German teacher to come in

745
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,064
and break down
the German words.

746
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,566
Now fortunately for both of them,

747
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,069
they've got excellent
Latin teachers at school.

748
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,574
But Neil is studying
really hard.

749
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,477
I mean, he's... he's
studying really hard.

750
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,480
O-h-m-m-a-t-e-r.

751
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,981
You're
wrong, Neil.

752
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,184
There you go.

753
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,986
Okay, we're done
with the state bee preparation.

754
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,290
I think he's more serious
about it than I was.

755
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,292
No. You're
forcing it on yourself.

756
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,394
I want you to
step back, take a deep breath

757
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,896
and use your
technique again.

758
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,899
Re-pronounce
the word, please, for me.

759
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,501
What are you
trying to spell? S-a-d-e-r.

760
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,003
Great, Neil.
Not missing a single word.

761
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,205
"Senility."

762
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,207
I'll be the first one
to admit it is hard.

763
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:27,711
But what is... what
is valuable in life

764
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,213
that is easy to achieve?

765
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,714
Nothing.

766
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,718
It's a once in a
lifetime experience.

767
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,721
And... I mean, after
you've studied so hard,

768
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,723
it would... it
would just be...

769
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,228
It would just feel great
to be up there and win.

770
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,729
"Epitaph."
e-p-i-t-a-p-h.

771
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,732
"Epithet."
e-p-i-t-h-e-t.

772
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,233
"Epitome."
e-p-i-t-o-m-e.

773
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,235
"Equable."
e-q-u-a-b-l-e.

774
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,237
"Existence."
e-x-i-s-t-e-n-c-e.

775
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,938
Keep on
going, champ. "Description."

776
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,440
D-e-s-c-r-...

777
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,154
Here she is,
winning a bee in...

778
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,356
This was seventh grade.

779
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,359
And Billy, her brother,
look what he put...

780
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,861
Another face on it.
He made a little cartoon face.

781
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,066
My mom and dad both
like to play with words

782
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,967
and make funny sayings

783
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,669
and stuff like that.

784
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,673
"Ain't mis- bee-having."

785
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,677
And I have stationary
that says "bee happy."

786
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,678
B-e-e.

787
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,479
And it's bumblebees
flying around.

788
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,882
I think that's where my
love of words came from.

789
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,885
Well, you're full of
jabberwocky tonight,

790
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,386
aren't you?

791
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,387
I've got another
word for it.

792
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,793
They remind me of
Edith and Archie bunker

793
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,197
because Archie's
always getting mad at Edith for being dumb.

794
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,000
And the cover is just...

795
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,004
Has fallen off.

796
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,007
She was really glad
to get the new one

797
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,511
because this one had
gotten kind of battered.

798
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,513
However, we'll
never throw it away.

799
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,316
Smithsonian material.

800
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,620
I think I worked
pretty hard at...

801
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,121
Maybe a little too hard.

802
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,627
In the summer, I
kind of worked...

803
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:27,130
Around eight to
nine hours a day.

804
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,134
But... as school began,

805
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:34,938
I just worked about
five or six hours a day.

806
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,442
Our lives have
revolved around April and the spelling bee.

807
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,943
I mean, I
hardly could see my friends.

808
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,946
They would call
me up and say,

809
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,449
yeah.
"When can we get together for lunch, breakfast,

810
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,950
whatever you
can squeeze in?"

811
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,454
Well, the
spelling bee's coming up,

812
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,955
and this
was just the regional.

813
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,458
This is the
regional word list

814
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,960
and sponsor
bee guide collection.

815
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,463
I ended up going
through this book three times in all.

816
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,967
And I've pretty
much memorized it.

817
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,770
She didn't even like to go to the mall.

818
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,774
Yeah.
It became where that was actually...

819
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,776
Right.
A young girl that doesn't want to go to the mall.

820
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,277
I mean, with
girlfriends. Right.

821
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,779
Not with her
parents, with her girlfriends.

822
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,281
Right.
"I can't... I can't go.

823
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,782
They want me to
go Friday night

824
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,285
but I can't
go because I gotta study. I can't..."

825
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,487
And we'd
say, "April, lighten up,"

826
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:24,488
you know?

827
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,691
In the classroom,
if there's a break,

828
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,293
right away, out come the
cards and the notebooks.

829
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,297
I'm also the
softball coach here, and she was part of the team.

830
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,400
But any break in play,
if it was stopped or for whatever reason,

831
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,001
out came the
spelling words.

832
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,004
The kids used
to tease her. Yeah.

833
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,805
Even in the
beginning of this year,

834
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,809
they would say, "oh April.
Why don't you get a life?"

835
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,914
How could anybody
want to study words

836
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,917
and not have
another interest?

837
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,619
Besides spelling, I like
to ride roller-coasters...

838
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,122
And I'm a vegetarian.

839
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,125
And I like to drink coffee.

840
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,828
Here's another one. Look.

841
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,330
I can't even
pronounce these words.

842
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,832
It's... rather
sad, but...

843
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,835
I know she can.

844
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,137
It's just...

845
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,539
A world of...

846
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,542
Of knowledge
here. I'm...

847
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,044
I want to go back to
school, tell you the truth.

848
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,151
I've been working in the bar business 45 years.

849
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,154
Yeah, I was born
across the tracks.

850
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,357
That was the depression
centre back there.

851
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:37,361
That was all the houses
for the people that worked in the asbestos mill.

852
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,864
And then they found
out that the asbestos stuff was coming up,

853
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,267
seeping through
the ground, so they closed it all off now.

854
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,269
There's a lot of people in
this town have asbestosis.

855
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,270
Died from cancer.

856
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,573
I didn't go far.

857
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,576
I went from that side of
the street to this side of the street, really.

858
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,077
Not a real success story.

859
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,488
I'd always...

860
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,990
Used to dream that i'd
go down on an easy word

861
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,592
or something like that.

862
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,596
I never dreamed
of doing well or anything like that.

863
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,902
I pretty much always had
a pessimistic attitude.

864
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,005
Only one night did she say to me,

865
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,808
"mom, I would really
want to win this thing."

866
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,310
And I said, "oh,
I know, April."

867
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,913
I didn't want her to
get disappointed though,

868
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,416
or have too big a goal.

869
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,318
But I loved hearing
that she was giving that thought

870
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,822
because sometimes
her confidence was a bit shaky.

871
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,825
So I was happy to
hear that that was in the back of her head.

872
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,828
"I would really like
to win this bee."

873
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,937
Wait, I can't... I'm gonna start over.

874
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,941
Okay. Moshe and izzi
are working in a factory,

875
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,443
and Moshe asks
izzi, "what time is it?"

876
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,944
And he says, "it's
3:00 o'clock."

877
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,446
And later he
asks him again,

878
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,448
"what time is it?" And
he says, "it's 3:30."

879
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,949
And later he
asks him again,

880
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,451
"what time is it?" And he
says, "it's 4:00 o'clock."

881
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,953
And later he asks him
again, "what time is it?"

882
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,455
And he says, "it's 4:30."

883
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,957
Then izzi asks Moshe,
"when you go home at night and it's dark out,

884
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,960
how do you know
what time it is?"

885
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,461
And he says, "oh, that's
simple. I get out my horn,

886
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,463
blow a little
toot-toot on my horn

887
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,466
and everybody... and
everybody pulls up their shades and yells out,

888
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,968
"you idiot! What are you
playing your horn for?

889
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,471
It's 3:00 o'clock
in the morning!"

890
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,974
I guess you could
call me talkative.

891
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,476
Not really. I mean...
If... I mean...

892
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,880
But, yeah, sort of.

893
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,881
What's that? This is a dictionary,

894
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,383
a big dictionary.

895
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,885
I don't know why
it's in my room.

896
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,186
Okay, but it seems like it's got

897
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,688
all sorts of
pieces of paper in there.

898
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,690
Oh yeah. Um...

899
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,192
Well that was so
my mom could find the definitions

900
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,195
of the words
we were studying.

901
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,497
This thing isn't
edible, is it?

902
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,306
In fourth
grade, Harry entered...

903
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,308
They have
in Glen rock a 4th/5th grade bee

904
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,311
which is not related to the
Howard scripps at all.

905
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,313
And he was out... he was
the first person out.

906
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,814
The very first person out.

907
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,315
How many hours
a day would you say

908
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,818
you spent
studying with your mom?

909
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,624
Maybe one-half, or one,

910
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,125
or maybe one-quarter.

911
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,128
I don't know. I
really don't know.

912
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,632
Probably one-half.
That is my guess.

913
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,136
Does this sound like
a musical robot?

914
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,442
This year, I saw an ad in "the record" about the bee,

915
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,446
and we didn't practice
for it at all because I didn't even realize...

916
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,448
I forgot what day it was.

917
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,949
Harry never came
home with a paper.

918
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,451
One day, it's a Friday.
I come home from...

919
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,954
I usually come home
about the same time as he does from...

920
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,957
From my office. He's not
home. I wait and wait.

921
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,959
It's, like, 3:30.
He's not home.

922
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,461
I call up the school.
Call the library.

923
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,963
All the places I think
he might be at the school.

924
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,965
Finally someone gets
on the phone and says,

925
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,466
"oh, I have some
good news for you.

926
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,469
Harry won the
spelling bee."

927
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,672
Harry and this
boy, oshgay,

928
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,473
they were the last
two in the last bee,

929
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,976
and they went for
a very long time.

930
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,978
They told me they'd never
had a bee go that long.

931
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,980
We went for quite
a while before...

932
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,482
Before he finally he
missed "discotheque".

933
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,985
In my generation,
everybody knows "discotheque",

934
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,987
but in this generation
the kids really don't.

935
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,488
But we had studied
"discotheque",

936
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,991
and Harry knew as soon
as... you could see it.

937
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,492
He's there and
he's like...

938
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,495
He just couldn't wait to
get up there and spell it.

939
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,997
And that was, of course,
one of the words that stuck in my head,

940
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:34,998
for some reason.

941
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,302
Look at this.

942
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,805
"Huked on fonix
wurked fur mee!"

943
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:16,940
Lordsadler
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

944
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,447
Acrophobia,

945
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,848
aoristic,

946
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,850
rayonnant,

947
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,551
cucurbit,

948
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,053
orenda...

949
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,255
I'm a little nervous right now,

950
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,757
but I think
that's natural.

951
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,960
I think every speller
is a little bit.

952
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,462
Llanero,

953
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,965
staurolatry...

954
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:42,966
I'm nervous.

955
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,870
There's so much
luck in it. It's not...

956
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,872
You can't not
be nervous.

957
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,373
It's too scary.

958
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,177
Well I don't think I'll win,

959
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,580
but I'm going to
try hard anyways.

960
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,581
It would be funny to win.

961
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,983
Up, up, up, up.

962
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,287
Right there, like that.

963
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,789
Well, I think the
parents and children

964
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,992
who come away with the
most valuable experiences

965
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:13,196
are the ones who
approach it with realistic expectations.

966
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,998
I don't really
expect to win.

967
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,001
I don't know. I've
studied enough.

968
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,004
So I just have to
see what happens.

969
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,010
And how was the trip
to the capitol today?

970
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,514
The part we went to,
which was about five minutes, that was fine.

971
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,018
Then mom and I decided
we'd rather study and went home in a taxi cab.

972
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,019
Left me high
and dry.

973
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,223
Of all the 10 million
participants,

974
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,427
there's only going to be
one child at the very end

975
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,429
holding that trophy
high above the head.

976
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,434
I would spell all the
words if I had to get...

977
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,436
A chance to win $10,000.

978
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,639
I... I would spell every
word in the dictionary.

979
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,641
Repetiteur,

980
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,142
clavecin,

981
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,643
marotte,

982
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,646
cabot...

983
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,949
Cabotinage. Cabotinage.

984
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,952
It has been
a very odd experience for me

985
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,454
because I do
get stopped.

986
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,957
I have been
stopped in restaurants in Ohio

987
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,460
and just total strangers
say, "I've seen you.

988
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,962
I know I've seen
you somewhere,"

989
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,463
and then suddenly
remember,

990
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,967
or people just walk
up out of nowhere, months from now,

991
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,468
and say, "I've seen
you on television.

992
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,870
I want to shake
your hand."

993
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,373
If you start to
spell a word... ord,

994
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,377
can you... and you stop
in the middle... iddle,

995
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,878
can you ask
for information

996
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,880
then, you know like,
the language of origin,

997
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,882
concerning stuff
like... can you say the first letter,

998
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,883
then ask for the
language of origin,

999
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,684
then once you know
that, keep on spelling?

1000
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,186
One of them just
came running up

1001
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,188
because he said he
wanted to tell me

1002
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,691
that he really
enjoyed hearing old English pronounced.

1003
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,294
And... then he took off.

1004
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,796
"Pernicious."

1005
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,298
P-e-r-n-i-c-i-o-u-s.

1006
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,208
He's good
now. Very good. "Tamarack."

1007
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,909
Very, very good.

1008
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,521
From the minute I walked in on Sunday to register,

1009
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,624
I was in total shock
at how huge it was,

1010
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,125
how grand the whole
affair would be.

1011
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,127
Oh yeah.

1012
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,730
It's our stop.

1013
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,338
I picture myself getting that winning word,

1014
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,841
and then jumping up
and screaming,

1015
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,843
and getting a trophy.

1016
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:45,548
And I picture
myself appearing on Rosie O'Donnell.

1017
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,293
"Cephalalgia."

1018
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,196
Cephalalgia?

1019
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,697
A pain in the head.

1020
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,303
"Cephalalgia."

1021
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,805
Cephalalgia:

1022
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,809
C-e-p-h-...

1023
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,816
A-l-a-l-g-i-a.

1024
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,117
Cephalalgia.

1025
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:02,325
Z-w-i-e-b-a-c-k.

1026
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,627
Zwieback.

1027
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:09,132
T-u-y-e-r-e.

1028
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:09,932
Tuyere.

1029
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,439
T-r-a-c-h-o-d-o-n.

1030
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,640
Trachodon.

1031
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,141
"Nephelognosy."

1032
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,642
Dysphasia...

1033
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,144
"Xerostomia."

1034
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,645
Quaquaversal...

1035
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,447
"Siphonapterology."

1036
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,550
Could you repeat that
word again, please?

1037
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,051
Zaibatsu...

1038
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,552
"Chateaubriand."

1039
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,258
May I have the language of origin?

1040
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,260
It is from amboinese.

1041
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,363
Is the origin Latin?

1042
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,264
And it's French?

1043
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,369
...p-h-a-l-o-n.

1044
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,370
Encephalon.

1045
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,674
...d-i-l-l-a.

1046
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,677
Quesadilla.

1047
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,483
"Lycanthrope."

1048
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,192
A werewolf is a lycanthrope.

1049
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,799
I just hope and I pray to god

1050
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,004
that I'll get a
presentable place, or a good place at least...

1051
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,006
The top 5, top 10.

1052
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,508
It really doesn't
matter to me. It's...

1053
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:29,412
I mean, spelling
is something that I love to do.

1054
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,715
How can you
compete and be scared?

1055
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,417
You're trying
to win.

1056
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,427
Lycanthrope:

1057
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:53,937
L-y-c-a-n-t-h-r-o-p-e.

1058
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,438
Lycanthrope.

1059
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,750
That concluded round one.

1060
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,162
"Mattock."

1061
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,164
Mattock...

1062
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,466
Can I have the
definition, please?

1063
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,467
A mattock
is a tool...

1064
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,968
My mom tells me that sometimes,

1065
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,471
I would be saying
words in my sleep.

1066
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,974
I was so scared
and nervous

1067
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,477
'cause I really wanted
to get past that first day.

1068
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,979
Well, it's more
intense than any competition

1069
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,482
because in
baseball, your kid gets up in the first inning;

1070
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,984
he strikes out.
He gets up in the third inning.

1071
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,987
Then he gets up
in the sixth inning and the ninth inning.

1072
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,288
This one,
one letter,

1073
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,289
and you're out.

1074
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:54,297
M-a-t-t-o-c-k.

1075
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,134
Ted's... he is really competitive.

1076
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,636
I don't know if
he can memorize all those words or not.

1077
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,939
Yeah, he
plays to win.

1078
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,942
"Distractible."

1079
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,443
Distractable:

1080
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,647
D-i-s-t-r-a-c-t-a-b-l-e.

1081
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,650
Distractable.

1082
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,254
Distractible is d-i-s-t-r-a-c-t-i-b-l-e.

1083
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,257
How you feeling?

1084
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,758
Fine.

1085
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,260
Just kind of annoyed.

1086
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,261
I was surprised
that...

1087
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,263
That an easier
word got him

1088
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,766
after practicing
those real long jaw-breaker words.

1089
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,869
I think
Ted's got the advantage

1090
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,973
of parents that
think it's great that he's here, irregardless.

1091
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,774
He's a champ in my eyes.

1092
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,777
I still think
he spelled it right.

1093
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,984
"Wheedle."

1094
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,287
"Wheedle."

1095
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,788
Wheedle?

1096
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,290
"Wheedle"
or <i>wheedle.</i>

1097
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,793
Wheedle...

1098
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,196
Wheedle...

1099
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,598
If I win the
national spelling bee,

1100
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:39,201
oh man, i'd
be... ecstatic.

1101
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,703
I would like
for her to...

1102
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,706
To be satisfied with
whatever place she gets.

1103
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:46,710
However, from what
I saw yesterday,

1104
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,211
there isn't any reason
why she can't win.

1105
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,113
Could I please have
the language of origin?

1106
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,917
The origin
of the word in unknown.

1107
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,421
Wheedle...

1108
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,126
"Wheedle",
<i>wheedle.</i>

1109
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,833
Wheedle... wheedle...

1110
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,444
W-h-e-e-d-l-e.

1111
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,860
...E-r-v-...

1112
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,762
A-i-l.

1113
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:50,974
Thank you.

1114
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,683
Thank you, Dr. Cameron.

1115
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,685
That's concluded round two.

1116
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,687
At this time, we
are going to take

1117
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,289
our 15-minute
mid-morning break.

1118
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,293
Spellers, you need
to leave your placards on your chairs,

1119
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,296
and we will resume
spelling at 10:20.

1120
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,103
So this time,
you just want to get through the next round.

1121
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,606
This time, I want
to get a word like, you know, like pasimology,

1122
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,608
which I know
pasi means signs.

1123
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,610
Or I want to
get a word that I've studied,

1124
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,112
like something
nat's notes that I actually remember,

1125
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,616
which is,
like, 5%. Right.

1126
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,117
What's really special about being at the bee

1127
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,620
is whereas in New York,
where we come from,

1128
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,322
Amy is considered
kind of like a geek,

1129
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,325
you know, because
she's into the words

1130
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:43,826
and she's into
the vocabulary,

1131
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,328
and the kids look at her
when she uses these words

1132
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,329
that she doesn't
understand...

1133
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,331
That they don't
understand;

1134
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,833
when we come here,
it's so refreshing

1135
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,336
to see all of these bright
kids in one environment.

1136
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,838
And here she's
accepted. Here she's one of the crowd.

1137
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,942
Here she's popular.
Everybody loves her here.

1138
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,444
No, I've not had any lunch
or dinner or breakfast,

1139
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,945
nothing, because
I just cannot eat.

1140
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,050
Neil's paternal
grandfather in India

1141
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,553
has actually
paid 1,000 people

1142
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:15,057
to be chanting and
praying around the clock for Neil to win.

1143
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,559
And should he win,

1144
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,563
I believe he's going
to pay to feed 5,000 people in India.

1145
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,565
So there's a lot
more resting on this

1146
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,066
than just maybe
the $10,000 prize

1147
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,069
and all the glory
he'd get here.

1148
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,570
There are a lot of
hungry people in India

1149
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,672
that could be fed
if Neil wins.

1150
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,678
We will go right on to round three.

1151
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,682
"Odyssey."

1152
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:49,492
O-d-y-s-s-e-y.

1153
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,493
Odyssey.

1154
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,801
"Heleoplankton."

1155
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,803
Heleoplankton?

1156
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,806
Could I please have
the definition?

1157
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:08,610
Plankton typical of small bodies of still, fresh water.

1158
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:17,319
H-e-l-i-o-p-l-a-n-k-t-o-n.

1159
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,324
Heleoplankton
is h-e-l-e-o-

1160
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,426
p-l-a-n-k-t-o-n.

1161
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,532
"Utilitarian."

1162
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,237
Me. I thought
it was right!

1163
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,740
I did, I did, I did.

1164
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,241
Man...

1165
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,243
Heleoplankton,

1166
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,746
I never would
have guessed it was h-e-l-e-o...

1167
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,748
I kind of
feel relieved

1168
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,251
because I don't
have to prepare for spelling bees any more.

1169
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,554
But I think
I will kind of miss this.

1170
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,556
...All the time preparing,

1171
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,558
is it pretty
disappointing when you're up there?

1172
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,560
Or what
goes through your mind? Not really.

1173
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,563
I already feel
like a champion just getting here.

1174
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,565
I mean, I think
that's enough

1175
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:06,468
because a
lot of people don't even accomplish that.

1176
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:10,973
K-r-a-v-a-t.

1177
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:11,975
Kravat?

1178
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,276
Crap.

1179
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,003
"Corollary."

1180
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,504
Corollary?

1181
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,006
May I have the
definition, please? A proposition...

1182
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,409
Last year I got out in the third round,

1183
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,411
and I was already
nervous because...

1184
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,613
That was kind of,
like, my jinx round.

1185
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,616
Even before the bee,
it's like we were trying to work through lists,

1186
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,618
which we didn't do
last year at all

1187
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:58,621
because I thought,
"she's so close that maybe this word

1188
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,623
or the other word we
do or maybe..." You know.

1189
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,825
It could be just
one of those words that would help her.

1190
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,828
I don't know what happened. Maybe I blanked out,

1191
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,830
maybe the pressure was
getting to be too much.

1192
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,433
But I asked whether
it had anything to do with the word corolla.

1193
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,937
Does it have to do
with, like, a corolla?

1194
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,439
What's a
corolla?

1195
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,241
I don't know,
like the car.

1196
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,349
I'm sorry.
We need a...

1197
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,551
We just need
a little more information if you could...

1198
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,053
Every time she went to
pronounce the word, I...

1199
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,556
For some reason,
I closed my eyes.

1200
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:35,057
I didn't realize that
I'm closing my eyes.

1201
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,060
But I just don't
know why I did it.

1202
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,661
I got so nervous that...

1203
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,164
I just kept... when
she walked up, whoa.

1204
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:45,168
If I had blood
pressure, it would've rocketed high sky.

1205
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,271
May I have the
definition again?

1206
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:52,575
A proposition that follows
upon one just demonstrated

1207
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,777
and that requires
no additional proof.

1208
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,384
C-o-r-o-l-l-a-r-y.

1209
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:09,992
Mercenary...

1210
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:20,302
M-e-r-c-e-n-a-r-y.

1211
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,304
Mercenary.

1212
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:35,818
F-i-b-u-l-a.

1213
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:43,425
"Kookaburra."
kookaburra.

1214
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,327
I think if I get out really early,

1215
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,029
I'm going to be, like,
a little bit of relief,

1216
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:50,032
kind of like,
"oh, it's over. I don't have to do this again.

1217
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,134
I can be a
normal kid."

1218
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,337
But mostly,
I think it's going to be,

1219
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,838
"how come
I didn't do as well?"

1220
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,840
You know, I
don't want to go back home and tell kids,

1221
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,842
"oh, I got out
in the first round again,"

1222
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,543
or, "I got out
in the second round this time."

1223
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:09,552
K-o-o-k-a-b-u-r-r-a.

1224
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,553
Kookaburra.

1225
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,061
"Ecclesiastical."

1226
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,566
Would you give me the
definition, please?

1227
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,367
This is an
adjective.

1228
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:29,372
It means
belonging to, suggestive of, or suitable for,

1229
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:33,175
use in a church
building or service of worship.

1230
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,678
Ec-cleviastic?

1231
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,179
Eccleviastic?

1232
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,681
"Ecclesiastical."

1233
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,383
Ecclesiastical?

1234
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:44,186
Ecclesiastical...
Am I pronouncing the word correctly?

1235
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,389
Ashley, why don't you lower the microphone just a little bit

1236
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,891
and turn toward US.
There you go.

1237
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,393
Ecclesiastical?
Ec-clesiastical?

1238
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:53,796
E-...

1239
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,299
C-...

1240
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,301
C-...

1241
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,502
L-...

1242
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,322
E-c-c-l-...

1243
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:27,930
E-a-s-t-i-c-a-l.

1244
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,932
Oh-h-h...

1245
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:34,937
Ecclesiastical
is e-c-c-l-e-s-

1246
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,439
i-a-s-t-i-c-a-l.

1247
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,151
Oh, is she crying?

1248
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,354
You did good.

1249
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,856
You're
finished, okay?

1250
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:59,361
That's great.
I'm proud.

1251
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:02,865
That's right.

1252
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:05,868
She did good.

1253
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:08,370
You did
good, baby.

1254
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,873
It wasn't your
fault, honey.

1255
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:11,874
You remember
that now,

1256
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,876
baby, you
came to the national.

1257
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,377
You came,
that's why. You're still a winner.

1258
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,881
That makes a total of 104 spellers

1259
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,884
that will be coming
back to spell tomorrow,

1260
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,086
and we'll see everyone
back here in the morning

1261
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,689
to begin promptly
spelling at 8:00 o'clock.

1262
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,191
- Oh, I just die.
- Relieved?

1263
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,692
I just die.
I just die...

1264
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,195
Well... wait
for the word.

1265
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,696
And I heard
"disclaimant."

1266
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,699
I said, "okay."
I know she could handle that.

1267
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,701
And the next word
was kookaburra.

1268
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,704
I had no clue
what this word was.

1269
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,707
And she... she
saw me pained.

1270
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,711
And she... she
smiled at me and told me, "I know this word."

1271
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,213
Okay. Supper.
You eat now? I'll eat.

1272
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,814
First food
today.

1273
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,817
I could spell
some of the words

1274
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,319
but I couldn't spell
all of them, and...

1275
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,822
I hate to say it, but
there is some relief,

1276
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,624
like, "oh, I didn't get
that word. I'm so happy."

1277
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,126
Ah, baby.

1278
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,931
Every time it was nearing
for April to spell,

1279
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,433
my hands were wet right
in the centre here.

1280
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,235
Just real wet.

1281
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,938
And then when she
spelled her word and I breathed a sigh of relief,

1282
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,440
they would
dry instantly.

1283
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:22,144
I walked around this hotel
three times, outside.

1284
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,646
Right before she
got ready to spell, I walked around, and...

1285
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,649
Then I would come back
just as she was spelling.

1286
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,151
Three times in a
row. That's too... it's too much.

1287
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:33,155
I don't even expect
to get past the first round tomorrow.

1288
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,656
But...

1289
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,158
We're more
optimistic, and...

1290
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,660
And that... feeling
she has there...

1291
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,165
I wish she could
just shake it

1292
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:47,169
because she has a
lot going for her.

1293
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,670
And I think she's
going to do very well.

1294
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,673
I don't know. Huh.

1295
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,176
I just... I'm more
of a pessimist. But...

1296
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,179
The words get
really hard and...

1297
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,881
It's really the
luck of the draw.

1298
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,888
One thing I remember

1299
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:09,191
that as the spelling bee
approached its end

1300
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,193
with three,
and then two and so on,

1301
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,695
my father
was right on the steps

1302
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,597
leading up
to the...

1303
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:20,102
The stage, and as soon as I
spelled the word correctly,

1304
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:22,104
he rushed onto the stage.

1305
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,106
He was not an emotional
man in general,

1306
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,508
but he was very
emotional that time.

1307
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,510
It was a big thing,

1308
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,512
getting to the national
spelling bee, of course.

1309
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,714
And my older brother

1310
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,216
had made it to the
second day of competition,

1311
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,118
got a word that he
unfortunately misspelled,

1312
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,621
and that really
broke my mother up

1313
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,123
and she was crying
in the balcony.

1314
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,625
And I tried to comfort
her and I told her,

1315
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,128
"mom don't worry. I'll
win it for you some day."

1316
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,932
1985, I was so
focused on this

1317
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:55,437
that they actually selected
four people to lay a wreath

1318
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,939
at Arlington cemetery

1319
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,941
at the tomb of the
unknown soldier.

1320
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,944
And so they called me
a couple days before the championship

1321
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,946
and they said, "hey,"
you know, "you've been selected.

1322
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,449
Would you like to be
there as part of this?"

1323
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,951
I didn't even
ask my parents.

1324
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,452
I'm like, "no.
I gotta study."

1325
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,958
It's an extremely heady
experience for any child.

1326
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,961
You know, you
go from being relatively anonymous

1327
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,464
to being mobbed by
all the major media in the United States.

1328
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:25,568
I don't think it
really helped me...

1329
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,572
In my love life, my
nascent love life.

1330
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,575
I think that having won
something like that

1331
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:36,579
could be regarded as being
a significant liability.

1332
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,582
We got letters from places

1333
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,483
that we'd never heard of

1334
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,487
because, you know,
it appeared in all the national newspapers.

1335
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,989
So from a local newspaper,
somebody put a cutting

1336
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:51,493
in an envelope and
then addressed it to balu natarajan:

1337
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,996
"He won the national
spelling bee."

1338
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,697
People always
knew about it.

1339
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,200
"Oh, she's the girl that
won the spelling bee."

1340
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,202
And it's certainly
something

1341
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:04,606
that has always
captured people's attention and imagination.

1342
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,909
It's just a great
americana tradition

1343
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,912
that has basically
filtered out throughout the entire world.

1344
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,414
One thing he said,
"they'll always remember

1345
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,916
is you won the
first spelling bee."

1346
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,820
And that is true.
I get the... credit for being the first.

1347
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,947
Yesterday, we began with 249 spellers.

1348
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,849
Today, 104 remain.

1349
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,853
By mid-afternoon, one
of them will be declared

1350
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:55,457
the 1999
scripps Howard national spelling bee champion.

1351
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,358
At this time, I
would like to turn

1352
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,161
the 72nd annual
scripps Howard national spelling bee

1353
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,164
over to
Dr. Alex j. Cameron,

1354
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:05,367
with the 605th word
of the competition.

1355
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,368
Thank you.

1356
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,873
The word
is "banns".

1357
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,375
It's a
plural noun.

1358
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,379
This banns means
notice of a proposed marriage

1359
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:21,182
proclaimed
in a church or other place prescribed by law.

1360
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,185
Bands, bands, bands, bands,

1361
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,686
bands, oh...

1362
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,689
There's gotta
be something I can think of.

1363
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,196
Take a deep breath, Harry,

1364
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,497
and let's finish
the word, please.

1365
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,103
All right, i'm
starting over.

1366
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,108
Let's see. What do
I've got so far? Bands.

1367
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,111
I've got
b-a-n-d.

1368
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,112
Gotta think
of something.

1369
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,017
Harry. Turn toward the microphone

1370
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,519
and let's finish
the word, please.

1371
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,520
Okay, then.

1372
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,024
B-a-n-d-...

1373
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,654
...s? Bands?

1374
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:37,159
Banns is
b-a-n-n-s.

1375
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:47,969
I didn't know. I was
just trying out anything.

1376
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,973
But... well, the
guy pronounced it wrong anyway.

1377
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,177
How did he say it? "Bands."

1378
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,679
I didn't know it.
People told me that if I was catholic,

1379
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,683
I might've known
it, because it's a church word.

1380
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,684
It's...they put up...

1381
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,186
It's something
to do with some certificate they put up

1382
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,887
when someone's going to
get married in the church.

1383
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,390
I probably should have
tried something like d-e-s

1384
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,891
or t-s, or...

1385
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,895
Or even n-d-s.

1386
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,397
And I felt bad for
the boy who was from Texas and got "yenta."

1387
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,998
"Yenta."

1388
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,000
Yenta?

1389
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,604
...or even d-z. Something.

1390
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:26,107
But for some reason,
I didn't take any of those...

1391
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,610
Well, you can't really
call them good ideas.

1392
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,112
And I went with... but I
went with the worst idea,

1393
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,615
which was d-s,
and I got out.

1394
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:34,616
I got out.

1395
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,618
But still, he did
pronounce it wrong

1396
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,620
even though I did
make my worst guess.

1397
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,736
"Darjeeling."

1398
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,139
Can I have the
etymology, please?

1399
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,640
It's from a...

1400
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,142
Bengali
geographical name.

1401
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,445
Darjeely?

1402
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,946
Say it toward US again, Neil.

1403
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,448
Darjeely.

1404
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:07,949
Slow down the ending.

1405
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,451
Dar-jeely.

1406
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,455
No. <i>Darjeeling.</i>

1407
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,456
Darjeeling.

1408
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,159
So this is a noun.

1409
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,661
A noun.

1410
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,865
Can you pronounce the
word again, please?

1411
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,267
"Darjeeling."

1412
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,271
This is the last spelling bee I'm ever going to go to.

1413
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,572
And so, it would feel good

1414
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,074
to come out successful
at the last one.

1415
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,577
But...

1416
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:40,582
I'm still happy
if I go into the comfort room and...

1417
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,084
And at least in, like,
one of the higher rounds.

1418
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,487
After Neil finishes
this spelling bee

1419
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,988
and after he's done
with all this,

1420
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,991
at least he'll have
fond memories of what...

1421
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,994
What it was to
strive for something that's very difficult

1422
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,497
and to keep your
mind focused, whether you succeed or not.

1423
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,499
You still continue to
strive in other things.

1424
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,802
Darjeeling...

1425
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,311
D-...

1426
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,314
A-...

1427
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:15,818
R-...

1428
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,824
J-...

1429
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:26,328
E-e-...

1430
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,330
L-i-...

1431
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,633
N-...

1432
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,139
G. Darjeeling.

1433
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,053
Viant?

1434
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,356
I don't think I'd remember any letters.

1435
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,457
I mean, it's like...

1436
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,459
I sit there
with the camera so nervous.

1437
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,460
And don't take
any pictures.

1438
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,961
It's like,
i'm, like...

1439
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,763
Paralysed
by seeing her at the mic.

1440
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,265
You can know every single
word in a round but one

1441
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,767
and get that one.

1442
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:06,968
It's statistical.

1443
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:07,970
I mean, you're not
going to do well

1444
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,471
without having trained.

1445
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:12,674
Is it from French?

1446
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:17,379
Yeah, Latin,
but from French to US.

1447
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,881
From the French word
<i>viande,</i> meaning meat?

1448
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:21,884
Yes.

1449
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,388
V-i-a-n-d.

1450
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,089
Viand.

1451
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,795
"Palimpsest."

1452
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,698
Palimpsest.

1453
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,199
Am I pronouncing
it correctly?

1454
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,601
Palimpsest?

1455
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,707
This is not the most important thing in life

1456
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,009
to be a best speller
in the world.

1457
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,312
In your spare time, if
you can do the spelling

1458
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,813
and then do well,
that's good.

1459
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,314
Otherwise, you know,
it's not that important.

1460
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,216
Well, she had those words down.

1461
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,219
She was determined
to come back this year.

1462
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,020
Come back.
She wanted to go the whole way.

1463
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:01,023
Palimpsest:

1464
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:07,029
P-a-l-i-m-p-s-e-s-t.

1465
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:08,330
Palimpsest.

1466
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,737
"Alegar."

1467
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,438
Alegar?

1468
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,940
Can I have the
language of origin?

1469
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,442
Latin.

1470
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:25,447
A-l-e-g-a-r.

1471
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,159
I could tell by her...

1472
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:40,662
Her flair, whatever
you can call that,

1473
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,164
that she studied
that word.

1474
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,666
Yes.

1475
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,668
Yes.

1476
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:47,669
I did too.

1477
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:51,172
Bee happy.

1478
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,674
B-e-e.

1479
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,776
This concludes round four.

1480
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,278
There are 48
spellers remaining.

1481
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,881
At this time we are
going to take our break.

1482
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:03,584
You need to leave
your placards on your chairs, spellers,

1483
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:07,589
and you need to be
back promptly at 11:50

1484
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:11,993
in time for the
12:00 o'clock ESPN live broadcast.

1485
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,308
Welcome to Washington, d. C.

1486
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,812
For the 72nd annual
scripps Howard national spelling bee.

1487
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,814
We're at the
grand Hyatt hotel

1488
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:37,318
where yesterday
249 spellers began competition.

1489
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,821
Through the first
3 rounds, overnight, 104 survived.

1490
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,323
We're now in
the 5th round.

1491
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,326
There are 46
spellers remaining.

1492
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,829
Well, it's as
difficult as handicapping, say, the belmont stakes.

1493
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,831
But can you
give me a couple of people to watch today?

1494
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,332
I do have
a couple favourites today.

1495
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,834
Let's watch for
Emily stagg.

1496
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,335
She's from Connecticut,

1497
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,838
and she's done a great job
with foreign languages,

1498
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,239
which helps a lot
with spelling.

1499
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,242
And this is her
third visit here.

1500
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,744
My other favourite
is George thampy.

1501
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,847
He's from Missouri and he
placed fourth last year.

1502
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:09,050
He's home-schooled and
he seems to study spelling around the clock.

1503
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,053
I'd put my money
on Georgie.

1504
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,955
He was in the
top five last year,

1505
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:17,758
and he had a very
good understanding of the words.

1506
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,261
I mean, you could tell
this kid was processing the information.

1507
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:24,266
I think that
George thampy will do... probably do well.

1508
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,767
He was incredible
last year.

1509
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,770
He remembers
everything he studied

1510
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,973
when he was four or
five or six years old.

1511
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,975
Whatever he learned
at the age of four,

1512
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,977
he still remembers
every bit of it.

1513
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,979
He doesn't have to
review anything at all.

1514
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,395
This country needs godly values.

1515
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,397
We are in
a bankrupt society

1516
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,900
with respect
to principles and character.

1517
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,503
Georgie thampy is going to Washington, D.C. again

1518
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:07,008
for the national
spelling bee where he came in fourth last year.

1519
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,610
I believe he's going
to win it all this year.

1520
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,614
But you know, that's
not the most remarkable thing about Georgie.

1521
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,617
His father has told me
on a number of occasions

1522
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:19,621
that Georgie honours his
father and his mother.

1523
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:23,124
That is a lot more
important to god,

1524
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,628
and that's a lot
more important to Georgie's future.

1525
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,732
There's three tips I have for other spellers,

1526
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,736
Trust in Jesus.

1527
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,738
Trust and
believe in Jesus.

1528
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:40,742
Honouring
your parents,

1529
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,643
Hard work.

1530
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,647
All right. 46 spellers are ready to begin competition.

1531
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:49,550
The speller on stage
right now is Neil kadakia.

1532
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,052
Hypsometer:

1533
01:19:53,855 --> 01:20:00,761
H-y-p-s-o-

1534
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:06,667
m-e-t-e-r.

1535
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:07,669
Hypsometer.

1536
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:18,580
"Apocope."

1537
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,984
What is the language
that this word is from?

1538
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,485
This is Greek.

1539
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:27,789
Apocope...

1540
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,999
I think it's a peculiarly American tradition.

1541
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,500
Competition is...

1542
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:46,508
A more important
part of American children's upbringing,

1543
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:50,411
I think, than it
is a European... European child's.

1544
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,913
That's
part of my misgivings now.

1545
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,414
It's kind
of just like everyone saying,

1546
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:54,416
"oh, you're
going to win."

1547
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,817
I'm like, "no,
I'm not. I'm really not."

1548
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:59,320
Um... the beginning,

1549
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,823
does it come from the root
a-, meaning, like, "not?"

1550
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,428
I don't see that listed here.

1551
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:16,738
A-p-o-c-o-p-e.

1552
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,239
Apocope.

1553
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,546
"Marotte."

1554
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:31,152
M-a-r-o-t-t-e.

1555
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,863
Tergiversate:

1556
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:50,872
T-e-r-g-i-

1557
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:56,177
v-e-r-

1558
01:21:56,177 --> 01:22:00,681
s-a-t-e.

1559
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:02,684
Tergiversate.

1560
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,493
This concludes round five.

1561
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,996
There are 17
spellers remaining.

1562
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:23,605
"Cosset."

1563
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,007
"Audace."

1564
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,010
"Microphakia."

1565
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,112
"Beignet."

1566
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,915
"Cucurbit."

1567
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,023
"Hellebore."

1568
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,326
Telibore...

1569
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,827
No. "Hellebore."

1570
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,328
Helebore...

1571
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,532
Hellebore
is any

1572
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,034
of a genus of
poisonous herbs

1573
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,336
of the buttercup
family, having showy flowers

1574
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,838
with petaloid sepals.

1575
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,845
Is the root word
helios, meaning... sun?

1576
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,348
No.

1577
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,849
I don't find
that listed here.

1578
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:18,760
H-...

1579
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:24,765
E-l-

1580
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,069
e-b-o-...

1581
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,575
R-e.

1582
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:34,576
Helebore.

1583
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,882
Hellebore is h-e-l-l-e-b-o-r-e.

1584
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,597
I made it through the first day,

1585
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,799
and I was pretty
happy with that

1586
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,301
because that was
the first goal I set.

1587
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:01,802
And then on the...

1588
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:03,805
On the second day, my
second goal was to...

1589
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,807
Was to make it to ESPN

1590
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,309
and then I made it
to ESPN, and so...

1591
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:12,313
And then I set another
goal to make it into the top 10, which I did.

1592
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:15,816
To come 9th at
12 years of age is phenomenal.

1593
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:19,320
Because he's in
the 8th grade, he might not be able to come back,

1594
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,822
but I know that
if he's 14 and he was in the 8th grade,

1595
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,326
we would have
an easy street, 2 more years in a row.

1596
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,328
But that's
not what it is all about.

1597
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,829
So for US
it was great.

1598
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,132
Just
phenomenally great.

1599
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,446
There are 8 spellers remaining.

1600
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,456
We are now ready
to begin round 7.

1601
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:58,359
Speller number 28, you may
step to the microphone.

1602
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:05,366
A-c-e-l-u-s.

1603
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,367
Acelus.

1604
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:09,971
Quinquevere:

1605
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:15,977
Q-u-i-n-q-u-e-v-e-r-e.

1606
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:21,582
"Repetiteur."

1607
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,585
Repeditor?

1608
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,086
Or <i>"repetiteur."</i>

1609
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,089
Can I have the
origin, please?

1610
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,091
I didn't panic when
I heard the word

1611
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:32,093
because I thought maybe
I could figure it out.

1612
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,695
You just almost
can taste victory.

1613
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,197
And it just seemed like...

1614
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,701
It could be...

1615
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,703
It could be
coming our way.

1616
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:46,007
"Repetiteur,"
<i>repetiteur.</i>

1617
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,009
Repetiteur:

1618
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:55,516
R-e-p-e-t-i-t-e-u-r.

1619
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,428
Can you say it again, please?

1620
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,531
"Clavecin."

1621
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,541
Can you pronounce the
word one more time?

1622
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,042
"Clavecin."

1623
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,945
Clavison...

1624
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:24,946
Clavison?

1625
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:38,759
C-l-a-v-i-s-o-n.

1626
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,762
Clavison.

1627
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:44,766
Clavecin is c-l-a-v-e-c-i-n.

1628
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,776
We are incredibly
proud of Emily.

1629
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:56,778
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1630
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:58,279
Emily did a
phenomenal job. She did.

1631
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,281
There's a bunch
of kids in there and they were all very good.

1632
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:01,782
And she's
up there. Yeah. I think...

1633
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,785
I think the
kids in the end all...

1634
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:05,286
All had the
chance of winning.

1635
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,988
I think the
last... probably the last eight.

1636
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,991
Part of me is kind
of just like...

1637
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,493
You know, "it's over. This
part of my life is over."

1638
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,995
And that's a little bit
of a letdown, but...

1639
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,998
I can throw
away the books.

1640
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,000
Don't have to do it again.

1641
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:27,408
"Cabotinage."

1642
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,910
Could you repeat the
word again, please?

1643
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,412
"Cabotinage."

1644
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:33,414
Cabotinage?

1645
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:36,917
Inside I had butterflies in my stomach.

1646
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,620
May I have a
sentence, please?

1647
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:42,123
Like, and my heart
was pounding, my hands were clammy.

1648
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:44,625
I was just trying not
to dwell on the fact

1649
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:47,629
that there were thousands
of people in the audience.

1650
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,630
"Cabotinage."

1651
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,432
Cabotinage:

1652
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:59,941
C-a-b-o-t-i-n-a-g-e.

1653
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:00,942
Yes.

1654
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,654
4 spellers remain.

1655
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:15,657
April, you may once again
step to the microphone

1656
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:18,159
to begin round 10.

1657
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,560
There is a homonym to this word.

1658
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,063
The word is
"terrene," or <i>terrene,</i>

1659
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:27,568
and this one means
relating to this world of life, mundane.

1660
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,573
Does this come from the root terra, meaning earth?

1661
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:33,674
Yes.

1662
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,176
Okay.

1663
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:41,683
T-e-r-r-i-n-e.

1664
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:46,587
Terrene is
t-e-r-r-e-n-e.

1665
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:03,804
She calmed me because she
was very cool up there.

1666
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,308
She manages to
stay that way

1667
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:09,310
and yet...

1668
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,812
Maybe when we go back
to the room, she'll fall apart a little.

1669
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:16,317
But up on the stage,
she really keeps a very good presence.

1670
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:17,818
So I'm real proud.

1671
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,821
I'm happy with
my placement.

1672
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:21,322
I'm a little disappointed

1673
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:23,223
because I only
missed one letter.

1674
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:25,226
I guess I wouldn't be
any happier if she won.

1675
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:28,229
It wouldn't have made
any difference to me.

1676
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,231
If she had won or
come in second...

1677
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,233
I mean, she just
did so good.

1678
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,443
Curtle...

1679
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:53,754
C-u-r-

1680
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:56,758
t-l-e.

1681
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,559
Curtle?

1682
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,060
Oh-h-h....

1683
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,963
Kirtle is
k-i-r-t-l-e.

1684
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:13,974
That concluded round 10.

1685
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:16,177
There are 2
spellers remaining.

1686
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,678
At this time we
will be moving

1687
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:20,681
to the championship
word sub-section.

1688
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:25,186
"Opsimath."

1689
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,089
Opsomath? Opsomath?

1690
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,601
O-p-...

1691
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:47,608
S-o-m-a-t-h.

1692
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:56,517
Opsimath is
spelled o-p-s-i-

1693
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:58,218
m-a-t-h.

1694
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:12,934
Now, that does not necessarily make nupur the winner.

1695
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:17,638
"Logorrhea."

1696
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:25,746
Logorrhea. May I have a definition?

1697
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:30,050
Pathologically
excessive and often incoherent talkativeness.

1698
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,254
Logorrhea. May I have a sentence, please?

1699
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,256
The patient's
logorrhea

1700
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:38,759
was indicative
of deep emotional problems.

1701
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,964
Somehow or other,
in america,

1702
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:47,969
spelling, although it's a
fairly mechanical process,

1703
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:50,471
in small communities
it was identified with, you know,

1704
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,874
the beginning of being
able to read and write and handle language.

1705
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:59,380
In this country,
spelling has always been a community process.

1706
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,682
We tried to raise him that...

1707
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:03,183
Try, and if you
do it, great,

1708
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,685
and if you
don't...

1709
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:06,987
Just roll on.

1710
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,693
Oh, my god. I'm sixth,

1711
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:14,795
but I could've won.
I knew those words that she was spelling.

1712
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,296
Did you know
the words that she got?

1713
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,798
Nociceptor
and logorrhea? Yeah.

1714
01:32:17,798 --> 01:32:19,299
Yes. That's
why I'm so mad.

1715
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:20,301
I know. I'm
just like, "oh, I could've won."

1716
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,304
Some part of me wants to think

1717
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,307
that I could have
gotten that word right,

1718
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,309
and if I'd gotten
that word right

1719
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:32,413
then maybe I'd have
a chance at winning or something like that.

1720
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,415
There's such a thing, I guess,

1721
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:36,417
as coming too close

1722
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:40,421
and yet not coming,
you know, close enough.

1723
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:44,825
But that's... there
has to be someone in third place, right?

1724
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,032
If I lose,

1725
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,534
it'll be okay because...

1726
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:56,036
I'll be upset for
a little while,

1727
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,538
and then I'll
rise above it

1728
01:32:57,538 --> 01:33:00,440
because that's just
another obstacle.

1729
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,446
In america, back in
the 18th century,

1730
01:33:05,446 --> 01:33:07,948
people had this
sense of opportunity.

1731
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:09,951
You could leap out
of one's social class.

1732
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:11,953
You could move up, and
I think they understood

1733
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:15,456
education was a
basic part of that.

1734
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:21,462
The process of going through some- thing that complex,

1735
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:24,865
that hard, and you
still put in energy with a passion.

1736
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:26,366
And if they can do
that in anything else,

1737
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:28,869
that they take in
these very qualities

1738
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,371
will make them successful
and happy at what they do.

1739
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:33,374
Whooo-ooo!

1740
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,778
I don't know that I could
do that for my family.

1741
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,279
I don't know
that I could say,

1742
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,281
"well you know, we're
going to another country

1743
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,583
so that you can have
a better way of life."

1744
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:46,386
Maybe it's because of my background

1745
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:48,389
that I work so hard.

1746
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:52,392
He has said that if he were to die today,

1747
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,395
he would die
a happy person

1748
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,897
because he feels like...

1749
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,401
We have...

1750
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,905
Accomplished what
he wanted US to.

1751
01:34:04,905 --> 01:34:07,407
Oh, you want
to talk to her too.

1752
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,209
We've got
nupur-mania here.

1753
01:34:10,511 --> 01:34:12,012
I go to college,

1754
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,514
and I want to do
something in neurology.

1755
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,516
Just forget about all the
people in the audience.

1756
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:17,818
Forget about all
the other spellers...

1757
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,319
See, right
now we're seeing video of you coming home,

1758
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,821
and you said
it kind of shocked you

1759
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,323
how many people
actually showed up for that. Yeah. It...

1760
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,826
You can get a sense of belonging in america

1761
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:28,428
outside of India,
which you don't get anywhere else.

1762
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:30,931
We wanted our children
to have that.

1763
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:48,348
L-o-g-o-r-r-h-e-a.

1764
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,249
That is correct.

1765
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:56,257
Scripps Howard is most proud to present

1766
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:59,360
the 1999 national
spelling bee champion

1767
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,963
from the "tampa tribune,"
nupur lala.
