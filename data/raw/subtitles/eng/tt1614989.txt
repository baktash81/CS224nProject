1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,712
Rule number one... make sure you know
everything about those you visit.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,196
Two... never spend
more than 10 minutes.

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,989
Every minute increases the chance
of someone coming home unexpectedly.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,232
Three... don't leave any DNA traces.

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,158
Four... don't waste time
getting an expensive reproduction.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,956
Even a simple forgery
will take weeks to be discovered.

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,678
Five... sooner or later,
one of two things is bound to happen.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,073
You find a work of art so valuable
that you never need to worry again.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,073
Or you get caught.

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,394
My name is Roger Brown.
I'm 1.68 metres tall.

11
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,473
You don't need a shrink to realise
that needs compensation.

12
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,635
For instance, my house
is worth 30 million kroner.

13
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,073
I don't like it. And I can't afford it.
But she loves it.

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,708
Please come. How often does
one of your girlfriends open a gallery?

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,195
I told her I had inherited the money.
But all I've inherited is bad genes.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,359
This has been an intricate case.

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,479
For someone like me to get
what he wants, only one thing matters...

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,349
lots of money.

19
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,116
But there is one thing
Diana wants more than anything else.

20
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,269
Exactly the one thing
I don't want to give her.

21
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,116
- Isn't she cute?
- Real cute.

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,877
Diana Strøm-Eliassen
is one of those tall, smart beauties.

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,391
Those used to being loved.
Those who take love for granted.

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,751
And there are plenty of men
who would give her love.

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,559
Men taller than 1.68.

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,637
But soon my time will come.
My opportunity. I can feel it.

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,796
Meanwhile, I play for high stakes.
If you don't gamble, you don't win.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,079
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Why?

29
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,798
We're invited to a dinner.

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,278
We're invited to a dinner.

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,270
- We are invited to a dinner?
- Yes.

32
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,439
- Are you telling others about us?
- There's someone I want you to meet.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,392
- This ends right here and now.
- Please don't...

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,793
- You and me do not exist.
- Please stop it.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,992
- An impressive CV, Lander.
- Thank you.

36
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,278
Yes, I believe
I'm the right man for Pathfinder.

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,560
- What about life outside the job?
- Is there such a thing?

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,470
You live here iNoslo, at Skøyen,
and are married to...?

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,235
Camilla. Been married nine years.
Two kids. They are in school.

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,956
- She holds a job?
- Yes, at a downtown law firm.

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,913
- Who stays home if a child falls ill?
- She does.

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,475
- No maid?
- No.

43
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,993
- Dog?
- No.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,272
- Allergic?
- No.

45
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,438
How much
is your reputation as leader worth?

46
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,359
My reputation?
What do you mean?

47
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,272
This work by JuliaNopie
is worth a quarter of a million.

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,392
- Got any equally expensive art?
- I do.

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,996
A Munch lithograph. 'The Brooch'.

50
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,398
Could you estimate its value
just by looking at it?

51
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,792
This one consists of a few circles
and lines. It's monotone, no texture.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,553
All that makes it worth a quarter
of a million is the artist's reputation.

53
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,514
- And the same thing goes for leaders?
- Exactly.

54
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,394
And that is why
you will not land this job.

55
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,873
- What?
- My God, you applied for it yourself.

56
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,957
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Get someone to tip us about you.

57
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,357
Pretend you didn't know about it
when we contacted you.

58
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,353
- But...
- It's all a game, Lander.

59
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,390
I want you to meet Pathfinder's
chairman and manager tomorrow.

60
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,159
Listen politely, then tell them
why you're no longer interested.

61
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,232
- I would seem unreliable.
- No.

62
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,631
They would see you as ambitious.
Someone who knows his own worth.

63
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,998
- Landler, this is your opportunity.
- Opportunity?

64
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,472
Let me build your reputation.

65
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,760
Andl I promise you a position which
quintuples your income within two years.

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,832
How can you promise this?

67
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,309
Because I have never given a client
a recommendation he hasn't followed.

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,950
- But how?
- The answer starts with an 'R'.

69
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,870
- Reputation...
- My entire career is based on it.

70
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,631
Hi.

71
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,874
You have an interview with Jeremias
Lander and Pathfinder tomorrow at 12.

72
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,794
- The information is in the file.
- Great.

73
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,034
Your wife is opening her gallery
this weekend, and I wondered...

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,028
- Could I attend?
- Are you invited?

75
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,118
- Am I?
- Are you?

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,519
I got an invoice of 357,000 for
redecoration at Kasper Hansen Street.

77
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,677
Correct. I helped Diana with some
expenses. Her gallery opens Friday.

78
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,078
You have to cut your expenses.
You may go bankrupt.

79
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,231
I'm working on it.

80
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,473
I have to make you aware
how serious this is.

81
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,673
You have overdrawn your account
by hundreds of thousands.

82
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,229
There's a call coming in.
I'll call you later.

83
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,713
We have a candidate.
Jeremias Lander, lives at Skøyen.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,313
- OK. Got him. When?
- A meeting at Alfa tomorrow at 12.

85
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,472
- Nobody home?
- No dog or maid. Wife works downtown.

86
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,198
See you in 20 minutes.

87
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,190
The handler in Gothenburg
wanted 50%.

88
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,353
Ove Kjikerud charged 20%
to disconnect alarms, bring the art

89
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,630
and bring it to Sweden.

90
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,031
To place him at Tripolis
was one of my smartest moves.

91
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,796
I was left with 80,000.

92
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,396
Not even enough for
my next instalment on the house.

93
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,676
Something had to be done.

94
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,955
Nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.

95
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,631
- Looking real good.
- Not half the guests have arrived.

96
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,039
- I don't have the time to greet...
- It's absolutely fine.

97
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,589
- Congratulations. Great exhibition.
- Thank you.

98
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,230
Something crazy happened today.
I can't tell you now.

99
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,672
- But I want you to meet him.
- Meet who?

100
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,435
- This is my husband. Roger Brown.
- Clas Greve.

101
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,108
Clas just moved here
from the Netherlands.

102
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,353
Are you on your way?
No, a few kids just liven up the party.

103
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,793
- What brings you to Norway? Work?
- I inherited my grandma's apartment.

104
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,110
- She was Norwegian?
- Yes.

105
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,952
I just went into early retirement.
I came here to redecorate the flat.

106
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,632
- You retired? From what?
- I was the CEO of a Dutch company.

107
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,513
We developed GPS technology.

108
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,108
- Dutch? Not HOTE, by any chance?
- Exactly.

109
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,034
Weren't they just bought up
by a large American company? Amtech?

110
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,756
- You're in the business?
- No.

111
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,751
- But why did you quit?
- I won't bore you with job chatter.

112
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,754
I'm in the recruitment business.
You won't bore me.

113
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,078
- Do you know Pathfinder?
- Of course. Our competitors.

114
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,874
Small, but competent.

115
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,436
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Enjoy your evening.

116
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,434
Clas...
Pathfinder seeks a new manager.

117
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,070
Someone who can stand up
against foreign takeovers.

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,198
- How about a meeting?
- Sorry, Roger.

119
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,830
Then lunch. Monday at 12.
We could talk about other things.

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,595
Art, redecoration, Polish handymen...

121
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,634
Could I have a pen? I'll write down
the name of a good restaurant.

122
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,309
A farewell present
for long and faithful service?

123
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,873
No, I stole it.

124
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,877
See you then.
My regards to your charming wife.

125
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,516
- This is my husband.
- Roger Brown.

126
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,871
- Brede Sperre, Kripos.
- We've seen you on TV.

127
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,476
- He investigates the art burglaries.
- Not murder cases?

128
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,992
We focus all our resources on this.
We're going to stop this.

129
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,755
- Are you also in the art business?
- No, I work as a headhunter.

130
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,597
- In the recruitment business. Alfa.
- One of the partners, then.

131
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,230
I complimented your wife
on her exclusive earrings.

132
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,230
She said they were a present from you.

133
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,110
The best of us get good bonus deals.

134
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,592
I wish we had those
in my line of work as well.

135
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,634
Sperre? We're from VG.
Could we have a photo?

136
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,353
Of course.

137
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,118
Roger? Are you coming?

138
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,195
Look at this.
The 'Calydonian Boar Hunt', by Rubens.

139
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,193
Stolen by the Germans
in Antwerp in 1941.

140
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,069
It's been missing ever since.
Do you know where it is?

141
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,588
- No.
- In Clas Greve's apartment.

142
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,197
Clas's grandmother had a secret affair
with a German officer during the war.

143
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,437
But he was arrested
and shot a few days later.

144
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,596
- She was scared of being exposed.
- And hid the painting?

145
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,471
- But it's not genuine.
- Did the Germans want reproductions?

146
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,919
- Why did he tell you?
- He asked if I could evaluate it.

147
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,192
Or if I knew someone who could.

148
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,750
You think Clas Greve has a genuine
Rubens hanging in his apartment?

149
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,751
- Here in Oslo?
- Yes.

150
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,954
I offered to contact an art museum,
to have it moved as soon as possible.

151
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,353
Next week. You don't place a painting
like this into a safe-deposit box.

152
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,271
- How much do you think it's worth?
- Tens of millions. Maybe a hundred.

153
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,520
Do you know what I think?
That you and I should celebrate.

154
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,392
- Celebrate what?
- That you opened your own gallery.

155
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,271
- And the twwo of us.
- Thanks for supporting me, Roger.

156
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,195
- Everything is going to be fine.
- What do you mean?

157
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,199
That you and I should start
thinking about the future.

158
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,318
- Ove here.
- We have a candidate.

159
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,917
- Do you know what the time is?
- Clas Greve. 25 Oscar Street.

160
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,789
- What, he is grave?
- No, his name is Greve.

161
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,239
Ove?

162
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,348
- Ove, what's happening?
- Sorry. Natasha is here.

163
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,393
- Come again?
- Meet me at the cabin tomorrow.

164
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,311
No, not tomorrow! It's Saturday.
I've got her for the whole weekend.

165
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,353
This is a big deal, Ove.
We only have a couple of days.

166
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,392
- One o'clock!
- OK!

167
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,918
- You are so sweet.
- Good morning.

168
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,238
- Listen...
- Yes?

169
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,398
What you said yesterday
about the future...

170
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,350
Does it include the sound
of tiny feet in these corridors?

171
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,832
- Maybe.
- Don't give me maybe, Roger.

172
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,833
I told you
that everything would be fine.

173
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,158
- I want that conversation now.
- But I have an important meeting.

174
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,472
Do you think I'm stupid?
An important meeting?

175
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,069
Was it set up during the night?

176
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,357
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

177
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,073
- What are you so scared of?
- Nothing.

178
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,789
Dogs, and you when you're like this.

179
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,997
If you want us to be childless forever,
I would like to know.

180
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,239
We'll have the conversation,
but now I have an important meeting.

181
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,756
- I've tried to talk now for seven years.
- And there'll be seven more.

182
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,592
If you continue nagging this way!

183
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,831
I didn't mean that.

184
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,871
You will never give me a child.

185
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,232
How many millions
are we talking about?

186
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,671
- Maybe up to a hundred.
- A hundred?!

187
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,079
This happens every time.

188
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,589
I've told you I don't like
those things lying around.

189
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,673
You know I always carry weapons.

190
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,634
At home I've got weapons everywhere.
Got a gun within reach in every room.

191
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,391
You shouldl get one as well.
Sooner or later they'll be coming.

192
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,878
We do it this way... you go to
Gothenburg and get a reproduction.

193
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,352
We need a good one. I have lunch
with Clas Greve on Monday...

194
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,754
Ove?

195
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,277
- I told you to stay in the car!
- But I have no light!

196
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,835
Out! We're having a meeting!

197
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,553
Women...

198
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,794
Like I said before I was interrupted
by a Russian prostitute...

199
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,269
During lunch Monday I'll find out
when the apartment is empty.

200
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,319
- You go to Sweden immediately. Now.
- OK.

201
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,951
- Shit. No, I can't. I'm busy.
- Busy?

202
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,352
Natasha is here.
I'll make a new film with her.

203
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,030
I've arranged everything
with the guys at work.

204
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,830
- You're filming her?
- I need something to watch.

205
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,755
I just activate the alarm
and the cameras start rolling.

206
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,679
- She doesn't know you're filming?
- No way.

207
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,236
And the Tripolis guards
are watching the two of you...?

208
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,188
The cameras are not directed
towards the bed!

209
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,708
They see her undress
and a bit of fingering. That's it.

210
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,357
She's cut her hair.
Looks nice.

211
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,235
The rest is private.
Cool, eh?

212
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,153
The painting is removed
in only a few days.

213
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,195
- Do you realise how big this is?
- She's here twwice in six months.

214
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,278
You'll be left with millions.

215
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,117
With that kind of money, you can
buy her. For the rest of your life.

216
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,511
The one without scampi jelly,
and dressing on the side.

217
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,319
Will you settle in Oslo now,
or will you commute?

218
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,432
Three and a half million,
plus stock options.

219
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,316
I'm afraid you take things for granted.
Remember you're a foreigner.

220
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,317
Norwegian companies want...

221
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,435
I don't doubt that your methods
will work on most people.

222
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,875
But we've been
in this situation before.

223
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,476
You practically dribbled...

224
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,236
You drooled when we met at the gallery.
And with good reason.

225
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,359
The problem was only
that I was not interested in a job.

226
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,072
But redecoration is not that interesting
in the long run.

227
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,518
So if it's OK with you,
let's just drop the charade.

228
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,830
OK. I surrender.

229
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,551
- But I still need more data on you.
- Do you play squash?

230
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,396
- Married?
- Divorced.

231
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,278
- Children?
- No.

232
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,035
- Dog?
- Yes.

233
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,033
- Still in Amsterdam.
- In quarantine?

234
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,509
I'll fly down to get him tomorrow.

235
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,319
The GPS business is a tough one?

236
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,470
- Your back.
- Oh. That's from the army.

237
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,911
I enrolled when I was 18.

238
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,789
After a few years, I entered
an elite unit which specialised...

239
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,554
- In what?
- Tracking.

240
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,950
- Tracking of...?
- People.

241
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,628
Missing people. Fugitives.

242
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,079
- And the technology came from HOTE?
- Exactly.

243
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,277
They produced
microscopic transmitters.

244
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,912
I hadl improvement suggestions.
So they recruited me.

245
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,595
- Where did you get those scars?
- Bolivia.

246
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,157
- Were you tortured?
- I was lucky. I got out in time.

247
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,916
- Sounds like something from a film.
- No, you've never seen this on film.

248
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,990
- When can we meet with Pathfinder?
- Any time.

249
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,919
- When are you back?
- The day after tomorrow.

250
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,872
Let's do it then.

251
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,912
Diana?

252
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,519
OUT WITH CLIENTS.
HOME LATE. D.

253
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,150
No, Murphy. Come here.

254
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,557
This is Diana. I cannot answer
the phone right now. Have a nice day.

255
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,797
- Hi.
- You're so late.

256
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,471
- I tried to call your mobile phone.
- I must have left it at the gallery.

257
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,839
- Anything urgent?
- No.

258
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,838
I just wanted to hear your voice.

259
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,755
That's sweet. Come and sit down.
This film just started.

260
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,754
No. I...

261
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,919
I'm totally beat.
I'm going to bed.

262
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,190
OK.

263
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,872
We developed this gel containing
hundreds of transmitters per millilitre.

264
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,873
It adlheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove.

265
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,951
You mean Trace.

266
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,069
The disadvantage is that Trace
is hypersensitive to dirt and mud.

267
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,152
I know this from my experience
as a soldier.

268
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,438
When you're stuck in, pardon
my French, the arsehole of the world,

269
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,871
then you are dependent
on your equipment.

270
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,675
Being introduced by Brown
is of great significance.

271
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,070
His recommendations are vital.

272
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,834
Just a moment.

273
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,471
- Great meeting. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you so much.

274
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,596
When will you write
the recommendation?

275
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,718
- We have to make a decision first.
- What was that?

276
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,870
There are other candidates.
We have to consider the total picture.

277
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,197
Did we attend the same meeting?

278
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,477
They were readly to sign the contract
here and now.

279
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,438
Well, then your chances are good.

280
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,439
Hi.
You go to Gothenburg tonight, Ove.

281
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,236
The painting has to be traded for money,
as quickly as possible.

282
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,670
Hi. I have to talk to you.

283
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,594
- Don't look me up this way, Lotte.
- Please. Just twwo seconds.

284
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,310
I'm sorry if it's my fault
you're feeling this way, but we have...

285
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,952
There's really
nothing more to talk about.

286
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,519
Do you need money?

287
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,673
I miss you so much.

288
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,513
Lotte...

289
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,912
Lotte... Don't contact me again.

290
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,159
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

291
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,039
- Anything wrong?
- No.

292
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,516
- A lot to do at work?
- Quite a bit.

293
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,310
I had a meeting today with Pathfinder
and Clas Greve.

294
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,550
- Did it work out fine?
- No.

295
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,797
- He won't get the job?
- Definitely not.

296
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,151
Tomorrow, I'll call
all the other agencies.

297
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,788
I'll make sure he won't get
a single job in Norway.

298
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,710
Why is that?

299
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,309
By the way,
did you find your mobile phone?

300
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,712
- You saidl you lost your mobile phone.
- Yes, I did.

301
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,792
- In the gallery?
- Yes.

302
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,872
Great. More wine?

303
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,198
Ove?

304
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,153
Ove?

305
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,593
Ove?

306
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,875
Hi.

307
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,638
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

308
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,550
I saw you go down here,
and you didn't come out.

309
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,393
- I got worried.
- About what?

310
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,074
Nothing.

311
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,590
- Roger...
- Yes?

312
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,230
Have a nice day at work.

313
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,149
I love you.

314
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,511
Ove? Ove?

315
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,275
- Ove, where do you live?
- Natasha...

316
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,398
Ove? Ove!

317
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,154
Where do you...?

318
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,075
What happened in the garage, Ove?

319
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,669
Did you see anyone?

320
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,794
Answer me.

321
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,232
Did you see what happened?
Was there anyone there?

322
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,119
- Natasha...
- What?

323
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,878
What the hell is going on here?

324
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,158
Ove, what's the password?

325
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,029
- The password for the alarm?
- Natasha...

326
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,273
We have to deactivate the alarm.
What's the password?

327
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,477
- The password!
- That's what I'm saying! Natasha!

328
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,198
With 'sh' or 'sch'?

329
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,953
Ove?

330
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,831
Ove, how is it going?

331
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,476
- What happened?
- You sat on a syringe in my car.

332
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,552
A syringe?

333
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,518
- You were lucky.
- Lucky?!

334
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,271
It must have hit your knee.
You didn't absorb all the poison.

335
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,876
- Did you fuck up?
- That's not what it's about!

336
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,353
- Diana has an affair with Clas Greve.
- That's no reason to kill you!

337
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,795
- Call 113!
- We don't want the police here!

338
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,232
Please, Roger.
I need to get to a hospital.

339
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,676
- Or else I die.
- I'll get you some milk.

340
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,555
Milk neutralises poison. That's what
they would do at the hospital.

341
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,838
Here...

342
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,074
- Call them.
- Don't do anything stupid.

343
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,111
Then I do it myself.

344
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,791
Just calm down now...

345
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,356
Roger.
I would like to talk to you.

346
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,630
No!

347
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,877
Our main research
was into the tracking of people.

348
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,876
Microscopic transmitters.

349
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,038
Hello. I'm just visiting the cabin.

350
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,476
- I thought you were Kjikerud.
- No.

351
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,193
- It's his car.
- Yes.

352
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:47,436
- Aren't you some kind of businessman?
- I was fired.

353
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,752
- May I park the car inside the barn?
- 500 per 24 hours.

354
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,674
You could park for free
by the roadside.

355
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,359
If you touch the tractor,
I want compensation!

356
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,551
- What a rush of people today!
- I'm just visiting Roger Brown.

357
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,714
- That businessman?
- Yes.

358
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,196
- What do you want from him?
- We have an appointment.

359
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,273
It's none of my business, but...

360
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,035
He probably didn't invite you
for coffee and cakes in the cabin.

361
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,475
In the cabin?

362
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,597
And since it's my property, maybe
a slight compensation would be fair?

363
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,553
Search!

364
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,078
Hello?

365
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,789
Who are you?

366
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,518
Oh, shit...

367
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,910
You're not supposed to be out of bed!

368
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,234
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No. Get back to bed.

369
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,116
Except for the police.
They're waiting for you in the corridor.

370
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,357
I told them you should
have your breakfast first.

371
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:35,354
Because if you manage to
smash the larynx, you're a good fighter.

372
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,791
Ever heard about ko-daw-ying?

373
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,873
No wonder. Do you know
how many martial arts there are?

374
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,508
3,000.

375
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,035
You've got wushu,
martial arts from China,

376
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,273
Taahtib, Egyptian stick fighting...

377
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,074
That's him. He's running away!

378
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,871
Freeze!

379
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,999
Sunded, I've got him!

380
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,033
My name is Olav Sunded, from Kripos.

381
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,755
You're a suspect in the murdler
of the farmer Sindre Aa.

382
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,715
Come with us, Kjikerud, and we'll
go through the rest at the station.

383
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,276
You are Ove Kjikerud?

384
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,795
Yes.

385
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,592
- Where are we going?
- To Elverum, for questioning.

386
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,992
I hope you cooperate, so that
I can go back to Oslo tomorrow.

387
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:24,280
- Attention, all patrol cars.
- In other words, both of them.

388
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,919
Bravo 3-0 here.

389
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,992
Egmon Karlsen has reported
his truck stolen.

390
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,551
- Did Karlsen sound sober? Over.
- Not exactly.

391
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,754
Call Bamse Pub.
It's probably parked there.

392
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,074
- Why did you kill the farmer?
- I have no idea what you mean.

393
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,670
Your Mercedes was parked
in Sindre Aa's barn.

394
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,308
- Andl you ditched his tractor.
- I've never heard that name.

395
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:57,392
- No truck outside the Bamse Pub.
- I've got more urgent matters now.

396
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,630
Check behind Kiwi.

397
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,311
- We have several witnesses...
- Damn, there it is!

398
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,396
Call Egmon. I see his truck.
Probably his son stole it again.

399
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,351
What are you doing, Brugd?

400
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,154
Like I said, Kjikerud,
we have plenty of evidence.

401
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,590
And you still deny everything.

402
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,231
So start feeding me details,
because you lost me completely.

403
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,552
Aa's neighbour found you
in the ditch beside the tractor.

404
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,429
We developed this gel containing
hundreds of transmitters per millilitre.

405
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,558
It adheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove.

406
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,273
I love you.

407
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,637
- We have to get out.
- No, we don't.

408
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,318
He will kill us all.
He has rubbed transmitters into my hair!

409
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,556
We have to get out!

410
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,999
He'll kill me.
He rubbed transmitters into my hair!

411
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,317
- He'll kill me!
- Calm down!

412
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,710
We have to get out!

413
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,833
Hi, this is Diana.

414
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,116
Hello?

415
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,033
Hello? Roger, is that you?

416
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,072
After this, we'll go to Forensic.

417
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,276
And then we'll have a look
at Kjikerud's house.

418
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,317
"Hi, I'm a single girl from Gjøvik.
You're Norway's sexiest policeman.

419
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,752
"And the best. Would you like to
meet me? I agree to most everything. "

420
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,472
What the hell happened here?

421
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,837
Lotte, wait.

422
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,915
- What do you want? What happened?
- I need help. Please.

423
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:37,113
- I don't mean to involve you in this.
- In what?

424
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,314
When they ask, don't lie.
Just tell them I was here.

425
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,439
Tell them I forced my way in.

426
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,352
What has happened?

427
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,910
Wait here.
I'll get something to rinse it with.

428
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,876
Got some scissors?

429
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,998
Lotte, who are you contacting?

430
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,188
- Give me that phone!
- Stop it.

431
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,158
- "Roger is alive. He is in my flat. "
- It's not what you think...

432
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,513
- What's happening?!
- I don't know!

433
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,752
- It's not my fault!
- What's going on?!

434
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,276
- Please...
- What does Greve want from me?

435
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,830
- It's the Pathfinder job.
- You don't kill people for a job!

436
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,390
It's about billions.

437
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,395
They worked on this for months. Ever
since Pathfinder sought a new CEO.

438
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,156
- Who are 'they'?!
- Clas.

439
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,710
- He still works for HOTE.
- What?

440
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,273
What?!

441
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,432
They have
massive economic problems.

442
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,599
Amtech demands that HOTE provide
them with Pathfinder's technology.

443
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,228
- This was Clas's assignment.
- Are you all insane?

444
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,229
I was to get to know you,
then introduce you to him.

445
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,149
But he had to change plans, since
you didn't want to see me anymore.

446
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,950
He had to find a way to meet you.

447
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,277
His grandmother had an
old reproduction of a Rubens painting.

448
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:56,117
He made up a wild story that she had
gotten it from a German officer.

449
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,274
He told Diana the story,
and she believed him.

450
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,998
Then he met you.

451
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,433
The only thing I've done
is to rub transmitters into your hair.

452
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,194
Did you do that?

453
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,755
Did you smear that shit
into my hair?!

454
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,237
- Is Diana involved?
- I think so.

455
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,757
- You think so?!
- I didn't want this to happen!

456
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:37,996
I just want to get away from him.
Please help me.

457
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,871
May I have a glass of water?

458
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,673
Lotte!

459
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,957
The suspect dlied in the accident,
with three of the four policemen.

460
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,991
The last police officer is still missing.

461
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:34,797
Military divers are now searching
along the river.

462
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,233
Diana.

463
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,678
Roger?

464
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,117
What happened to you?

465
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,952
Don't look at me that way.

466
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,389
I know why you left. There's
nothing more between Clas and me.

467
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,348
I tried to tell you in the garage,
but I couldn't.

468
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,031
- What do you know about...?
- I have to tell you this now.

469
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,070
I didn't want it to happen.
But you hurt me.

470
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,676
He was so easy to talk to,
and I just...

471
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,308
I couldn't stand it anymore.

472
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,468
But it was wrong.
And I'm so ashamed.

473
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,359
Because you are the one I want.

474
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,195
If you really think we shouldn't
have children, we don't need to.

475
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,835
I'm willing to do anything.

476
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,193
You really do love me...

477
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,359
You must never doubt that.
Promise me.

478
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,468
- And you didn't know anything.
- About what?

479
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,790
You didn't know anything.

480
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,953
Oh, my God.
What has happened?

481
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,634
Come here.

482
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,713
Dog bites are very serious, Roger.
You have to see a doctor.

483
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,990
It's not that convenient right now.

484
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,798
Hold this.

485
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,835
- What are you planning to do?
- I don't know.

486
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,872
They'll soon find out
who died in the accident.

487
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,872
I have to remove evidence.

488
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,356
And then?

489
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:12,076
I have to get away from here.
Make a new start.

490
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,518
Maybe you and I could...

491
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,436
I can wait a while
before I report it stolen.

492
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,870
I have to clean these too.

493
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,878
Did you love her?

494
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,357
No.

495
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,992
How could you be
so goddamn stupid?

496
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:20,392
Steal works of art,
to buy things I don't need?

497
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,437
Who do you think I am?

498
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:47,191
You have asked me
what I'm scared of.

499
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,554
And I've been scared
since I first met you.

500
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:01,271
I've been scared
that you would leave me.

501
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:07,310
Scared that we would have a child
which you would love more than me.

502
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,156
And I've been scared
that you would see me as I really am.

503
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,556
And hate it.

504
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,478
I have to meet you. Diana.

505
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,308
- I'm sorry about this, Greve.
- It's quite alright.

506
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,758
Roger Brown is on
an unexpected journey abroad.

507
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,272
- Sounds exciting.
- To save an important contract.

508
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,991
But you're in safe hands now.
There are only formalities left.

509
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,991
So it won't take very long.

510
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,875
We were supposed
to change a fan at B4.

511
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,874
We've been in and out the whole day,
but this card doesn't work.

512
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,353
FORENSIC INSTITUTE

513
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,758
Thank you.

514
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,956
Hello, guys.
Sorry, we're a bit behind here.

515
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:19,154
A lady just got in who's been lying dead
on heating cables for two weeks.

516
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,472
- Any thoughts on this?
- Typical car accident injuries.

517
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,029
The cause of death
is internal haemorrhages.

518
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:32,070
Where are the peanuts?
It says here there was a bag of peanuts.

519
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,595
Well, I didn't eat them.

520
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,238
- Has anyone unauthorised been here?
- To steal a bag of peanuts?

521
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,155
Who's that?

522
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:33,235
What the hell
is going on here, Roger?

523
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,713
Are you removing evidence?
Think you'll get out of this?

524
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,555
What the hell?

525
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,035
So you realised
the transmitters were in your hair?

526
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,310
And that it was Lotte...?

527
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,950
- That's why you killed her?
- Does it feel like a loss?

528
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,276
I'll give you a choice.

529
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,389
If you tell me what's going on,
I'll shoot you in the head.

530
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,633
- If not, a bullet in your stomach.
- Don't you feel anything?

531
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,435
I would like to know
if people like you really exist.

532
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:20,074
People like me?

533
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,995
People who are not capable of love.
Who are without empathy.

534
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,230
- Empathy?
- Yes.

535
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,996
If you want the answer,
just look in the mirror.

536
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,720
- I'm not like you.
- You're not?

537
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,438
No.

538
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,840
- I have lovedl someone.
- You have loved someone? Diana?

539
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:50,878
You have loved her?
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.

540
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,478
She tells me she longs for me.
She wants me.

541
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,593
And I'm only human.

542
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,470
Have you ever loved anyone?
Except for your dead dog?

543
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:20,396
I have no time for this. I've got
an appointment with Diana tonight.

544
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,712
You went and got the hair?
You knew I'd be coming for you. Why?

545
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,998
A shot in the stomach means
a slow death. You'll beg me to kill you.

546
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,795
So I ask you for the last time...
why am I here?

547
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,276
What are you smiling at?
Why am I here?

548
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,998
Hold it right there!

549
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,870
Do you know
why I was smiling, Clas?

550
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,871
Because you just proved
that Diana loves me.

551
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:07,830
She didn't come to you
because she wanted you.

552
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,679
She came to change the cartridges
in your pistol.

553
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,192
She exchanged the bullets in your gun
for blank cartridges.

554
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,831
Or what do you call them in Danish?
Blanks?

555
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,313
- What are you talking about?
- She hates you.

556
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,035
She wants you to die.

557
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,192
But I will give you one chance.

558
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:45,554
I have no idea how many bullets
Diana managed to switch.

559
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:52,596
This is not like you, Clas.

560
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,752
Is it over?

561
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,515
Yes.

562
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:26,430
I may not know myself, but I know
others. And that's what I gambled on.

563
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:33,676
Welcome to this press conference,
led by the Oslo Police and Kripos.

564
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:37,116
I had prepared well.

565
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,593
The police would find the pistol
from the crash on Kjikerud's night table.

566
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:48,995
This pistol also killed Lotte Madsen,
whom the press called Greve's lover.

567
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:55,514
How the "art burglars" Ove Kjikerud
and Clas Greve killed each other...

568
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,232
...was watched by a whole world
on the internet.

569
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,354
The police would find
that the pistol Greve fired

570
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,478
was identical to the one
that killed Ove.

571
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:14,195
He should never
have picked up that gun.

572
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,670
We are pleased to present
a breakthrough in the case.

573
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,308
But even though
I had done everything right,

574
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,478
there was one thing
I could not change.

575
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,797
Ove was already dead
when I shot Greve.

576
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,350
But Brede Sperre is Norway's
most renowned investigator.

577
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:36,594
Unsolved cases is not his style,
especially after VG called him

578
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,955
"the man who makes Norway
sleep well at night. "

579
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:43,472
Because he is competent?
Obviously.

580
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:48,031
But mainly because he knows
what it takes to get ahead in this world.

581
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,509
And what would that be?

582
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,273
The answer starts with an 'R'.

583
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,637
Reputation.

584
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:03,635
It gets you on TV and providles you
with SMSes from unknown women.

585
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,555
We think they celebrated the theft
and that it got out of control.

586
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:16,434
They end up torturing a dog
and killing the farmer.

587
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,669
That's correct.

588
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,956
FOR SALE

589
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,876
Have a nice day.
Both of you.

590
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,396
- We are ready.
- Send in the candidate in one minute.

591
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,239
Ferdinand... Thank you.

592
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,597
Hi. I'm sorry. Please sit down.

593
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,116
I asked you to come here
because we are at the end of

594
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:53,474
a long and dramatic hunt
for Pathfinder's new leader.

595
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,871
In the last round,
he could not leave his position.

596
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,914
Without promising too much,
I think I have persuaded him.

597
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:04,317
Please welcome... Jeremias Lander.

598
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,391
Nice to see you again.

599
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,395
My name is Roger Brown.
I am 1.68 metres tall.

600
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,393
And you know what?
That's more than enough.
