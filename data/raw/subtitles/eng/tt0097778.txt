1
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:42,008
I think your bookkeeper
paid for the flatware twice.

2
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:46,340
Albert, stop.
I can't do this any more.

3
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:49,432
Mollie, I love you and you love me.

4
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:54,309
Albert, you're great in bed
and you're my biggest account . . .

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,888
. . . but you're married!

6
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:03,484
And I'll never fall in love with
anyone else while I'm seeing you.

7
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,784
You know I'm leaving Beth.
It just takes time.

8
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:14,488
Every time I say the word divorce,
she loses five pounds.

9
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

10
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,666
- I can't wait for you forever.
- It's going to work out soon.

11
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:29,211
The doctor prescribed new pills
and she's starting ballet classes.

12
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:35,890
- It'll be like the playwriting.
- She knows this can't make her fat.

13
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:39,562
She said
writing made her ass spread.

14
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:44,560
Which is insane, she's got
a great ass for a 40-year-old.

15
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:48,984
I'll tell Mr. Ross to give
your account to someone else.

16
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:56,039
I won't let him. I'll never let
anyone else touch my books.

17
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:07,126
God, Mollie, I'm going to burst
if you don't kiss me soon.

18
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:52,836
Follow me. I know where I'm going.
I've got the map. Come on.

19
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:59,098
Come on, keep up, you kids.
Here we go.

20
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,893
Wait a minute, I see something.

21
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:07,564
I think this is it,
right over here.

22
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:12,278
This is definitely it.
This is the place.

23
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,022
Jackpot!

24
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:20,575
Right down here, kids.
Here we go.

25
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:28,708
Dig in, you kids. Here we go.

26
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,297
It's kind of tough here.

27
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:37,673
Oh, oh . . .

28
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:40,849
I'm in!

29
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:12,791
Are you okay?

30
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:16,299
- I broke up with George.
- Who?

31
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:24,263
George. I met him in Joe Allen's.
He turned out to be stupid.

32
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:33,643
You look lousy, doll.

33
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,904
- Stomach flu. It's going around.
- Nobody has the stomach flu.

34
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:43,943
They don't?
You want to hear about Albert?

35
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:47,869
- Listen to me.
- I am.

36
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:53,202
Albert's shrink said his wife would
never recover if he kept seeing me.

37
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,841
- He's decided to leave her.
- Albert's leaving his wife?

38
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:04,511
No, he's leaving his shrink. She was
really an obstacle between us.

39
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:08,846
Leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave his wife.

40
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,604
He's going to. He can't leave her
while she's sick. She's bulimic.

41
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,397
Don't give me that look.
It's a very serious disease.

42
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,813
What in the . . . Wait a minute.

43
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,898
I've got two of these things.
Look at that, they match.

44
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:06,776
- You ate all that already?
- How weird, I don't like ice cream.

45
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:11,364
- There he is.
- This is sick.

46
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,700
He looks so sweet with the kids.
If only Beth would stop throwing up.

47
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:22,881
Miss Popularity, you can't expect to
find a husband if you never go out.

48
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:27,878
- You're in every night of the week.
- Ma, it's tax season.

49
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:31,259
I was studying to pass a CPA exam, -

50
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:36,262
- and I still managed
to catch your father.

51
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,438
What if Daddy was married
when you first met him?

52
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:46,063
- I wouldn't have fallen for him.
- You can't control that.

53
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,068
Why not?
Listen, take your father here . . .

54
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:56,322
His favourite food was cheesecake,
and what did the doctor tell him?

55
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,921
- "Cut back on cholesterol."
- Now he doesn't eat cheesecake.

56
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:05,754
Ma, that doesn't make any sense.

57
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:10,137
You never used to like my food.
Something's wrong.

58
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:13,639
- Nothing's wrong.
- Louie, something's wrong.

59
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,758
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Something's wrong.

60
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,107
No.

61
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:30,899
Oh, no!

62
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:34,943
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

63
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:40,791
- This wasn't a planned pregnancy?
- This wasn't even a planned affair.

64
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,456
Well . . .
Iet's see how far along we are.

65
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:56,257
Time out! Holy cow,
what was that? Who's that?

66
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,683
How could this have happened?

67
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:04,515
- How old are you now, Mollie?
- 33.

68
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:08,985
Remember,
your biological clock is ticking.

69
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:24,620
Beth finally agreed to a divorce.
Mollie, I'm so glad you waited.

70
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:29,955
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

71
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:37,387
Remember your biological clock.

72
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:58,068
My biological clock is ticking . . .

73
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:01,992
I know, I've already said that.
I didn't plan on this.

74
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:06,078
I'm not asking for anything.
I don't want to trap you.

75
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:12,005
But this baby . . . it's you and
me, and I'm not getting an abortion.

76
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:18,461
I wasn't going to ask you to.
This will be an incredible baby.

77
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,262
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

78
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:29,062
- We'll get little Armani diapers.
- It will be a great kid.

79
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:33,312
Having my baby
what a way to say you love me

80
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:38,113
Albert, you're making me sick.
I hate that song.

81
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:42,858
Stop singing.
She gets sick, I get sick.

82
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:46,620
What are you going to tell people?

83
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,792
That I got artificially inseminated.

84
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:55,666
What?
How could you do such a thing?

85
00:10:55,842 --> 00:11:00,053
I went to the clinic
and bought some frozen sperm.

86
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:06,259
- I inserted it, now I'm pregnant.
- Where's the frozen pop?

87
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:12,271
- There's no frozen pop.
- There's no husband.

88
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:16,225
I control my life
and I want to have a baby.

89
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:20,982
This kind of thing a girl does
if she's very ugly or a lesbian.

90
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,784
This is not the act
of a beautiful intelligent girl.

91
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:30,415
You never liked
any of my boyfriends, anyway.

92
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:35,542
- Where did this sperm come from?
- A medical student.

93
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:40,174
He goes to Columbia.
His parents live on the lsland.

94
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:44,804
His father's in piece goods.
His mother works in cosmetics.

95
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:48,757
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, you'll see.

96
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:52,635
Someday you'll have children.

97
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:10,117
Look . . . an arm. It's an arm.

98
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:16,374
Look . . . isn't it cute?

99
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:39,398
Here's the head . . . isn't it?

100
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:56,242
Get some apple juice down here!

101
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:06,498
- Thirsty?
- Go ahead.

102
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,301
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds."

103
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:16,603
"By the second trimester
they are identifiable."

104
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:20,436
Look, another arm
coming in down there . . .

105
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:25,068
How am I going to get that
in my mouth?

106
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:31,362
Miss, excuse me . . .

107
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:36,035
- What can I do for you?
- Albert is expecting me.

108
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:42,161
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

109
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,835
- I think you're going to enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.

110
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:55,306
- Remember to dust it every day.
- See you later.

111
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:59,010
Hi, come on in.

112
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:12,071
Albert, was that woman pretty?

113
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:17,236
- No, you're pretty.
- I look like a big, fat pilgrim.

114
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:20,948
How do you like the desk?

115
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,205
- It's made of stone.
- It's all right.

116
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,958
It's going to be great in here.
This is all going.

117
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:34,712
I'm having a custom-made mural
of an ancient Navajo design.

118
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,681
Leather craftsmen in Mexico
are going to make all new couches.

119
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:47,140
- What do you think?
- I like the deco stuff.

120
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:52,656
- Don't gain too much weight.
- My doctor says my weight is fine.

121
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:59,703
Beth only gained 21 pounds.
She jogged three miles a day.

122
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:03,572
- Maybe you should marry her.
- Don't start.

123
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,168
- I've got problems, too.
- Sorry. I'm afraid of giving birth.

124
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,587
- I've never been real big on pain.
- You been to Lamaze?

125
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:18,426
I quit.
It's just a bunch of breathing.

126
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:22,845
It's so much better for the baby.
When Beth had Priscilla . . .

127
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,063
I'm so sick of hearing about Beth!

128
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,560
How could you be in love with her
and then in love with me?

129
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:35,235
I have a degree.
She took belly-dancing lessons.

130
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:41,029
When I found out I was pregnant,
I decided to make out a will.

131
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:46,410
When Beth had the girls, she had
a reading of their past lives.

132
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:53,202
- And you're still with her!
- Oh yeah? Look at this receipt.

133
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:57,379
- Galleria Apartments.
- I moved out. I did it.

134
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,719
I put down a deposit this morning.

135
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,675
I can't believe it!
Should I come by tonight?

136
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:09,720
You'd better not.
We've still got to be careful.

137
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:14,394
Albert, I'm so happy!

138
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:23,323
I wonder if this store
has a bathroom. I have to go again.

139
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,407
I love this . . . Look,
it takes two of them to cover me.

140
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:34,665
- Yeah, but you're having a baby.
- You try it on.

141
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,335
- Should I have a baby with Neal?
- Do you love him?

142
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,345
No.

143
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:48,302
Try some of that
Nobel Prize winners' sperm.

144
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,597
Don't you want a smart baby?

145
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:57,810
That's all I need. A baby
telling me what an idiot I am.

146
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:03,692
- I found a nice family man.
- Except it's someone else's family.

147
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:08,695
That's why he left.
He loves me and we're having baby.

148
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:14,115
It sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

149
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:27,594
- Mollie!
- Albert!

150
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:33,270
- Let me explain . . .
- These dresses aren't paid for.

151
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:39,440
- Don't take this shit from him.
- I'm going to call the cops.

152
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,362
After you. Thank you.

153
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,824
- Albert, what's going on?
- Mollie, I've fallen in love.

154
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:50,824
Beth knows.
I'm going to live with Melissa.

155
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:55,991
I don't know if it'll last.
It just happened.

156
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:59,418
Why didn't you say anything to me?

157
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:03,538
You were so close
to the end of your pregnancy.

158
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,504
I don't believe this is happening.

159
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:11,221
This sounds awful, but
I'm going through a selfish phase.

160
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:15,555
- A selfish phase?
- I admit the timing is bad.

161
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:19,809
- A selfish phase?
- It just happened.

162
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:24,230
A selfish phase!
Albert, you dick.

163
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:29,481
- You lousy prick!
- Leave him alone.

164
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:33,408
- Come on.
- Here.

165
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,534
Hey, what the . . .

166
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,535
- Wait, please, I'm in labour.
- I was here first.

167
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:48,876
Asshole! Taxi! Please . . .

168
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:58,179
St. Jerome's Hospital.

169
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,642
Oh, shit!

170
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:11,113
- Slow down! It can take hours.
- So can the midtown traffic.

171
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:24,086
Pull over till the ludes wear off.

172
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,504
God, you idiot!

173
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:35,378
Come on, move it.

174
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:43,388
Christ, this traffic . . .
We're going as fast as we can.

175
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:49,351
Hold onto my hand. Bear down, that's
what they say in the hospital.

176
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:56,611
- Come on, move it.
- God, my water just broke.

177
00:19:56,786 --> 00:20:02,290
- Hey, buddy, move it.
- You can't get through here.

178
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,835
- I've got an emergency.
- Sorry, buddy, move it.

179
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:14,921
Just relax.
Hold on, we're almost there.

180
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:18,429
Look out! You're going to hit . . !

181
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:26,019
Hold on!

182
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,984
You stupid son of a . . !

183
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:35,571
- Are you doing your Lamaze?
- Look out!

184
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:43,698
- Breathe deep.
- Don't try to help, just drive!

185
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,908
You've got to use Lamaze.
My sister-in-law used it.

186
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:53,464
- It's better for the kid.
- All men are stupid idiots.

187
00:20:55,134 --> 00:21:00,176
- Should I call your husband?
- I don't have a husband.

188
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:04,511
- I was artificially inseminated.
- Are you a lesbo?

189
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:27,699
Stupid jerk! My kid will probably
be brain damaged because of you.

190
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,044
Don't touch me! I'll have this baby
without you touching me.

191
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:41,007
- Excuse me, I'm in labour.
- Do you have your medical card?

192
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,090
- I left it at home.
- I have to have your medical card.

193
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:51,510
- This is my first baby.
- She's getting close. Upstairs.

194
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:56,731
You didn't finish this.
I cannot do my job . . .

195
00:21:56,903 --> 00:22:03,404
- Put these on over your clothes.
- I'm not the father.

196
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:09,661
- Nurse, another one's coming.
- Deep breaths, come on.

197
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:13,166
Okay, this'll pass. Watch the head.

198
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:17,547
God! I need some drugs.

199
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:22,211
- Slow down your breathing.
- Fuck my breathing!

200
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:27,926
- You've got to calm down.
- Get me some drugs.

201
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,976
- No, you don't want drugs.
- I do. I'm going to split in two.

202
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:37,643
By the time they
take effect she could be delivering.

203
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:42,943
- But what about now?
- I'm waiting for a doctor.

204
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,242
Are you a doctor? Come on.

205
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:55,918
- Water break?
- Half an hour ago.

206
00:22:56,086 --> 00:23:01,542
- Are we doing our Lamaze breathing?
- I dropped out of Lamaze.

207
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:05,761
I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

208
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:10,637
- How about some Demerol?
- God, that'd be great!

209
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:15,803
I'd like some of that.
Give me a lot of it.

210
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,349
So it doesn't wear off
during the birth.

211
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:25,563
I think maybe I'm in a bit more pain
than most of your patients.

212
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,191
Be sure and give me enough.

213
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:34,824
- There we go.
- Thank you a really lot.

214
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:39,079
That is a little more like it.

215
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:43,250
Hey, here's Mr. Hand here.

216
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:49,798
Now that is very cosmic.
I don't understand . . .

217
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:54,598
What's that light down there?

218
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,594
That's it, breathe!

219
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:04,518
Attagirl, push. One more.

220
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,906
Stop with that pushing!
I'm falling!

221
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,660
Help!

222
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:22,952
No, put me back in! Let go
of my head and put me back inside!

223
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,205
It's a boy.

224
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,298
It's a boy.

225
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:33,710
Who are you?
Lady, I'm freezing. I'm so cold.

226
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,590
Get that thing away from me.

227
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,932
- You want to do the cord?
- No, you take this one.

228
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,475
I need that!

229
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:50,562
Lady, a blanket,
something, I'm frosty out here.

230
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,317
No, don't do that!

231
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:05,373
Where are we going now?
Hey, don't drop me.

232
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:10,503
Oh, very nice . . .

233
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,806
I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.

234
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,762
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

235
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,558
You're the one
that ate the spicy food.

236
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:37,990
This is the weirdest thing that's
ever happened to me . . . so far.

237
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:47,166
I don't get it. I just don't
get it. Where did I go wrong?

238
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:52,959
Where are my thumbs?
I want to suck my thumbs.

239
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:58,887
- I have to get my own place.
- I've been reincarnated so quickly?

240
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,507
What a surprise!

241
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:07,476
Who stole my sucking thing?
I need my sucking thing!

242
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:10,851
I just remembered
I hate childhood.

243
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,737
Look at all those daddies.

244
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:29,710
Making goofball faces
and taking pictures of their babies.

245
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:32,997
You won't find your father here.

246
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:37,004
I really messed things up for you.

247
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:42,467
Don't be upset.
I'm going to find you a daddy.

248
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,590
And not just some handsome guy
I'm in love with.

249
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:54,065
You're all that matters to me.
I'll get you the best daddy ever.

250
00:26:58,322 --> 00:27:05,404
Out, down, in, out . . .
Well, we got that.

251
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:08,995
What have you got there?
A hand?

252
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:12,202
Yeah, two of them.

253
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:23,254
Oh, my God!

254
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:33,974
"On the third or fourth day
your breasts may swell slightly."

255
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:38,810
Slightly?
I look like a Russ Meyer movie.

256
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:49,031
Workman.

257
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:54,282
- Oh, no! Sorry.
- Real nice.

258
00:27:56,087 --> 00:28:01,044
- You got your figure back.
- This is not my figure.

259
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:05,428
Sorry I hit you and yelled at you,
but I was in a lot of pain.

260
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:11,681
I still owe you that cab fare,
but somebody stole my purse.

261
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:16,348
- How do you like New York so far?
- It's my kind of town.

262
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:22,312
I'll get you the rest later . . .
Wait a minute . . .

263
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:27,908
- How did you know where I lived?
- You left it in the cab.

264
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:31,362
Thanks.

265
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:36,663
You should look through that thing.
You've still got your diaphragm.

266
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,757
Don't smoke that around my baby.

267
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:51,301
There's a 62% higher rate of cancer
in people who live with smokers.

268
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:56,848
What are you trying to say?
You don't want me to move in yet?

269
00:28:57,021 --> 00:29:01,599
Do you think the drugs
had any effect on him?

270
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:06,105
- How did you know I had drugs?
- I don't. I didn't.

271
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,613
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

272
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:17,529
- He does not. He looks perfect.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

273
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:23,876
If you tried passing a watermelon,
how hot would you look?

274
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:28,424
Ouch! I should call
my mother more often. Get it?

275
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:33,504
- Do you want a sub?
- No, will you just watch him?

276
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:39,138
Don't take him out of his chair
and don't touch him a whole lot.

277
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:43,095
Hi, Mikey. I'm James.

278
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:49,526
- Good to meet you.
- Do you mind if I suck on that?

279
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:56,495
- How long have you been here?
- About five years.

280
00:29:56,662 --> 00:30:03,744
- Were you born in New York?
- Are you with the census bureau?

281
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:11,167
How do you like the outside world?
It's weird, isn't it?

282
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:17,346
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Here, your first lesson in coffee.

283
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:22,676
- Can you say black coffee?
- No.

284
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:28,359
Regular coffee has two sugars and
milk . . . which they have forgotten.

285
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:35,692
Can I borrow some of yours?
Coffee regular, I love it.

286
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,319
That's breast milk.

287
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,536
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're on your own.

288
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,794
I'll see you guys later.

289
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:54,546
I'm going to take my sub and
my breast milk and get out of here.

290
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,882
I've got something
cold and wet in my shorts.

291
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:04,051
Could you get somebody for me?
Fellas?

292
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:10,646
You guys are no help. I'm cold and
wet and there's nothing I can do.

293
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:15,776
It's okay, Mikey. Mommy's here.

294
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:21,404
That Mommy person's here again.
She's okay. I like her.

295
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:28,457
I start crying
and she comes in with a bottle.

296
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:31,747
Crying, I can handle that.

297
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,756
Taxi!

298
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,219
Taxi!

299
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:49,824
"80% of all women experience
post-partum depression."

300
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:52,074
I won't.

301
00:32:55,337 --> 00:33:01,256
Like a lot of parents, I can't
always be there on birthdays.

302
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:07,464
Help, somebody burp me
before I blow up.

303
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:15,980
That's it! You have some exotic
disease and I look like a zombie.

304
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:21,391
And your father deserted us so he
could pork his interior decorator.

305
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:25,782
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

306
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,825
- Hello!
- I was wrong.

307
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:36,038
Where's my grandson?

308
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,748
There he is.

309
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:47,050
- Mikey, do you know who I am?
- No, actually, I don't.

310
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:52,048
- I'm your grandma.
- Okay, if you say so.

311
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:55,725
- Yes, I am.
- What do you want from me?

312
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:03,853
- Who's got a wet tushy?
- I give up.

313
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:13,113
After a new diaper, I like
some of that white stuff on me.

314
00:34:13,288 --> 00:34:18,365
If you had a man instead of a frozen
pop, all this would be put together.

315
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:23,668
You make it sound like I had
an affair with a frozen dessert.

316
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,672
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

317
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:30,963
You're using too much powder.

318
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:37,473
Why don't you get out of the house?
I'm going to give Mikey a bath.

319
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:40,218
A what?

320
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:44,725
She's gone!

321
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:56,621
Who would you want
as your child's father?

322
00:34:56,788 --> 00:35:00,537
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair . . .

323
00:35:00,709 --> 00:35:07,210
- A guy to help raise your child.
- Are there men who do that?

324
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:12,174
I'm looking for a guy
who's not married, -

325
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:17,422
- not into drugs, not a deadbeat,
but not a workaholic.

326
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,888
- And cute.
- Cute is of no importance.

327
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:26,852
You're my first date
since my baby was born.

328
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:30,644
This looks delicious.

329
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:36,064
What is this?
I asked for well done. This is raw.

330
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:40,407
I asked for no dressing,
this is covered with slop.

331
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:46,536
Are you deaf or something?
Who do I have to kill to get a roll?

332
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:53,842
What's this "C" in algebra?
How many times did we go over it?

333
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:56,632
Are you an idiot?

334
00:35:56,805 --> 00:36:04,101
Dating is difficult, but you've got
to take a chance in life sometime.

335
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:08,351
I'm not so sure about that.
Excuse me.

336
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:14,777
This fork and this plate are dirty,
and there's something in the water.

337
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:17,735
Check your water.

338
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:24,493
Mikey, what is this mess?
Sort out these socks.

339
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:29,126
Why are school shirts
mixed up with after-school shirts?

340
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:32,166
Straighten this up properly.

341
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,384
- Hi.
- Hey.

342
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:46,852
- Somebody call for a cab?
- Yeah, small world.

343
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:51,398
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco.
I don't even know this guy.

344
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:56,941
Let me have them. Put them up here,
the postman will take care of them.

345
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:03,651
- It's good seeing you again.
- You, too. See you.

346
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:11,578
- You're stealing my mail!
- I'm not stealing your mail.

347
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:15,621
- You put it in your pocket!
- These are mine.

348
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:21,138
- I sent them here. I'll explain.
- I'm going to call the police.

349
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:25,468
My grandfather Vincent
needs an old-age home -

350
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:31,762
- and there's a place in Manhattan,
but he needs to be a resident.

351
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,059
You want to use my mailing address?

352
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:41,024
I could have you arrested. Screwing
with the mail is a federal offence.

353
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,031
Stealing mail is,
not screwing with it.

354
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:50,707
- Can I get the other letters?
- No, I don't want to get involved.

355
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:55,667
I went out of my way
to bring you back your purse.

356
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,294
Thank you very much,
but this happens to be illegal.

357
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:06,676
You're not going to get caught.
I'll do something for you, okay.

358
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,763
- I'll baby-sit.
- Come on . . .

359
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:16,096
- You don't know about babies.
- My sister has kids.

360
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:21,020
- I know a lot about babies.
- All right, Friday night.

361
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:26,819
- No can do, Friday's out.
- Then forget the whole deal.

362
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:32,617
- Okay, Friday, but that's it.
- And during my aerobics classes.

363
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:36,041
- One aerobics class.
- Saturday.

364
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:38,666
Can't do. I teach.

365
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,124
What do you teach?
Taxi driver's ed?

366
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,132
- That's not funny.
- Here's the deal.

367
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:51,725
Friday nights, two aerobics classes,
and you can't bring chicks over.

368
00:38:51,893 --> 00:38:56,555
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

369
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:59,732
- Sucker.
- Good.

370
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:04,194
- Don't force-feed him like that.
- I'm not!

371
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:09,737
- Why don't you take a nap?
- He doesn't need a nap.

372
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,537
- He knows when he's tired.
- I'm not tired at all.

373
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:19,326
If he doesn't take a nap -

374
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:24,414
- he will wake up and want
to eat when it's time to sleep.

375
00:39:24,591 --> 00:39:28,256
- Who says?
- All those doctors.

376
00:39:28,428 --> 00:39:33,304
- They just want to sell books.
- Dr. Spock is not like that.

377
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:38,516
Dr. Spock loves us. He protested
during the Vietnam war.

378
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr. Spock.

379
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:47,694
I can't believe she's getting
upset about a Vulcan.

380
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:54,661
- Have you got any other letters?
- They're in the hallway.

381
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:11,881
Mommy's asleep. Watch this.

382
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:44,289
What do you say you and me take
a ride so your mother can sleep?

383
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:50,879
- Is that a deal?
- Just bring the milk.

384
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:55,262
See that? That's my cab.

385
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,092
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

386
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:08,103
Okay, this is called driving.

387
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:12,487
When you get older,
I'll teach you how.

388
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:17,400
First, you put the little stick
in the hole.

389
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:21,954
Then you move your foot
back and forth. Okay, what next?

390
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:24,993
You move the big circle around.

391
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:29,544
No problem, I can do this.
I can drive.

392
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,108
- Hey.
- Hey, Jimmy.

393
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,565
That silver plane is a VJ-1 0.

394
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:01,778
That big plane is a Viscount.

395
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,998
- Hey, Carrie.
- What a sweetie.

396
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:09,748
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, but he needs a mother.

397
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:15,714
I'm kidding. Is this my schedule?

398
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:21,423
- There's nothing on it.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:26,555
Do these things come in different
sizes? What are these, jumbos?

400
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:32,066
- What are you staring at?
- Lunch.

401
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,738
Mikey?

402
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:45,326
Mikey?

403
00:42:55,756 --> 00:43:00,880
I want to report a missing baby.

404
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:05,761
Maybe he was kidnapped,
or maybe he's with a complete idiot!

405
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:08,933
Hey, Grandpa.

406
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:11,675
That's Grandpa.

407
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,974
Do I know you?

408
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:26,740
- Jimmy!
- Grandpa.

409
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:32,118
- I don't remember your baby.
- It's a friend of mine's.

410
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,953
- You sure it isn't yours?
- I've got more teeth than him.

411
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:41,756
What are those hairy jobs
over your eyes?

412
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:46,587
Let me see those things.
There we go. How does that feel?

413
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:51,758
- Mikey, lay off him.
- What a crack-up.

414
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:55,931
- Honey, I'm home.
- Me, too.

415
00:43:56,106 --> 00:44:03,484
- Hey, you're up.
- My baby! Honey, honey . . .

416
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:06,775
Mommy and her baby . . .

417
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:13,120
Idiot! I called the police.
I was worried out of my mind.

418
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:18,414
- You knew I was with him.
- You might be a kidnapper.

419
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:23,663
- I was baby-sitting for you.
- That means the baby stays here!

420
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:26,795
Damn it! I got a splinter.

421
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,006
Let me see it.

422
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:34,594
- Have you got a needle?
- In there.

423
00:44:37,188 --> 00:44:39,975
Sit down.

424
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:43,852
Oh, stop.

425
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:48,488
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this. It doesn't hurt.

426
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:52,240
It hurts. Don't do it that way.

427
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:57,405
- You're poking me!
- Hold still while I get it out.

428
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:01,794
- It can't hurt that much.
- How would you know?

429
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:08,296
- Look at that. That's a big one.
- I've never had one that big in me.

430
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:16,131
- All better.
- Mikey needs a nap.

431
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:23,597
Mikey, I've got to go.
See you.

432
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:31,818
Ready? High-five.
Low-five. Baby-five. Bye.

433
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:37,780
- Bye.
- My little angel-head.

434
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:48,754
- Mollie, who was that?
- The babysitter.

435
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:54,548
The babysitter?
He's not the frozen pop, is he?

436
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:58,671
- Ma!
- All right, give me the baby.

437
00:47:09,461 --> 00:47:12,996
- Ma . . .
- What?

438
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:18,250
- You ever get bored with Daddy?
- How can I get bored with Daddy?

439
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,855
Mikey needs a father.

440
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:35,017
- I just can't find the right guy.
- Mikey will like whoever you like.

441
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:39,857
- I don't like anybody.
- You know what the secret is?

442
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:45,786
Find someone you have something
in common with, like Daddy and me.

443
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:52,290
We both like to go to the movies.
I know someone perfect for you.

444
00:47:52,462 --> 00:48:01,134
He's in Daddy's firm. He's handsome
and smart. You'll love him.

445
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:06,094
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

446
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:10,763
I'm surprised, that's usually
the first thing she says.

447
00:48:10,938 --> 00:48:13,144
Come on in.

448
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:19,567
This is my son Michael. I'll get
dressed. Make yourself comfortable.

449
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:23,866
- Hi, little guy.
- Who's this yutz?

450
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,652
Are you watching some TV?

451
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:32,159
Don't touch that.
I don't want to watch football.

452
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:36,960
Hey, it's the bear show.
Look at that.

453
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:42,966
- Leave it on football.
- Leave it alone.

454
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:47,299
- That guy's a good actor.
- Cut it out. It's the play-offs!

455
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,053
You dick.

456
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:03,109
- Baby! Hot mama!
- You're such a goofball.

457
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:07,278
- Don't I look good?
- You look slightly cute.

458
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:11,745
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I've got a hot date.

459
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:15,698
You'd better call her.
I'm going to be late.

460
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:20,503
Yeah, right. You've got a date
with an accountant. 9:30 tops.

461
00:49:20,673 --> 00:49:24,456
- Don't count on it.
- Besides, my woman will wait.

462
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:28,882
Harry, this is the babysitter.
I'll just get my coat.

463
00:49:29,056 --> 00:49:34,892
- I'm just watching the game here.
- Yeah, I've got money on this game.

464
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:39,640
So you're an accountant?
You and Mollie will get along great.

465
00:49:39,816 --> 00:49:44,395
- She's a CPA.
- I know, her mom told me.

466
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:48,438
It's got to be tough
being a mom and a CPA.

467
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:55,330
But Mollie is tough. She hates it
when guys open doors for her -

468
00:49:55,498 --> 00:50:00,160
- or pick up the tab.
It really pisses her off.

469
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:05,247
- She's liberated?
- Come on. A guy babysitter?

470
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:10,715
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

471
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:14,802
- Do this.
- Jeez!

472
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:19,056
Give it back.
This is really embarrassing.

473
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,729
May I just say one thing?

474
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,435
- You look better without it.
- I think so, too.

475
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:29,447
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

476
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:34,490
- All right, I'll leave it off.
- Great.

477
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:41,459
Bye-bye. See you.
Mikey, high-five.

478
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:45,292
- Yeah, all right.
- Who was that clown?

479
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:51,175
It was very uncomfortable.

480
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:57,133
A kind of bloated, gassy . . .
belchy sensation.

481
00:50:57,475 --> 00:51:02,636
I'd sit down in the bathroom . . .
and nothing would happen.

482
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,731
Nothing would come out.

483
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,274
I called my doctor about two . . .

484
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:14,733
. . . three weeks after this started.

485
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:20,781
He said I'd better come in
and have an ultrasound.

486
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:25,414
- What was I saying?
- Ultrasound.

487
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:30,331
So I went in for the ultrasound
and they checked it out.

488
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:35,846
It wasn't gallstones.
They didn't know what it was.

489
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:41,968
The doctor said I'd better have
an upper G. I. So I went in again.

490
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:47,055
- Have you ever had a barium enema?
- Not recently.

491
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:51,230
It's disgusting,
but I did get to see my colon on TV.

492
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:57,523
Is it true that colons
look 1 0 pounds heavier on TV?

493
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,824
How so?

494
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:08,285
They never do that for me.

495
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:22,468
Get on my knee.

496
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:33,610
- Hold it. Okay.
- Get down, Mikey.

497
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,321
Yeah, I can do that.

498
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:46,659
Let's walk.

499
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:53,790
I'm dancing. I'm bad.

500
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:57,380
- Check me out now.
- Jump.

501
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:05,049
Hey, can I get paid?

502
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:20,481
Two, please.

503
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,870
Are you ready?

504
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,542
I'm gonna throw up,
but I like it!

505
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,834
Okay, shake it up.

506
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,428
Right on.

507
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,926
Ready? Shake it, Mikey.

508
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,097
Let's go.

509
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,771
Aeroplane.

510
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,651
Mikey's a plane.
Look at that boy.

511
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:12,157
All right.

512
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,621
Finally, I passed the stone.

513
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,841
It's the most excruciating thing
you can have, next to giving birth.

514
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,627
- I had a really good time tonight.
- I bet you did.

515
00:54:26,804 --> 00:54:33,934
A lot of guys would feel threatened
by a woman always wanting to pay.

516
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:37,519
- What?
- Your babysitter told me.

517
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,525
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

518
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:45,106
- Come here.
- No, I really have to go up.

519
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:51,319
- Come on, Mollie, it's early.
- Yeah, but I'm broke.

520
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:54,117
Jerk.

521
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,502
Shit!

522
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:21,019
I'm home.

523
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:26,185
You can go on your date now.

524
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:57,847
- Hey, Mikey!
- Sarah, how are you doing?

525
00:55:58,018 --> 00:56:01,138
- I want to talk to you.
- Sorry, got to go.

526
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:06,894
Right back at you, babe.

527
00:56:07,069 --> 00:56:13,522
- Hiya, Mickey.
- Look at that hat.

528
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:20,035
- Megan, good to see you.
- Mikey, where've you been?

529
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:24,536
- Did you get your hair cut?
- Yeah, what do you think?

530
00:56:24,711 --> 00:56:28,578
I hate it.
My mother did it herself.

531
00:56:28,757 --> 00:56:32,457
It looks great.

532
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:35,755
I used to have curls at the end.

533
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,880
- I remember.
- I was the one with the cute curls.

534
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:44,638
- Now they're gone.
- You're still cute.

535
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:49,725
- I look like a boy. No offence.
- Nice talking to you.

536
00:56:54,615 --> 00:57:01,116
How many babies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

537
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:07,124
- How many?
- What's a light bulb?

538
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:12,290
I don't get it.

539
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:16,843
Where's she going?
Who's that big guy?

540
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:23,097
- Who is he?
- That's okay. That's her daddy.

541
00:57:23,268 --> 00:57:26,222
What's a daddy? What do they do?

542
00:57:26,396 --> 00:57:31,473
The big men types
who hang around with the mommies.

543
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:35,316
I get it. Maybe I'll ask James
to be my daddy.

544
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:48,956
We 'll eat all the pudding now . . .

545
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:56,339
- I still ain't eating it.
- Yummy.

546
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:04,297
All right, don't look at Mommy.

547
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:21,615
You've got to love her.

548
00:58:39,926 --> 00:58:43,544
Watch this, Mikey.

549
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:57,600
- Now that's entertainment.
- Not in front of Mikey.

550
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:02,854
- Look at the look on his face.
- He looks like his father.

551
00:59:03,032 --> 00:59:06,483
You said
you were artificially inseminated.

552
00:59:06,661 --> 00:59:11,702
I was, but I never make that face.
I assume his father does.

553
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:16,002
You know what I thought
you'd enjoy doing today?

554
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:21,211
- Go to my grandfather's new home.
- You thought I'd enjoy that?

555
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:26,294
Yeah, you'd enjoy it . . .
Maybe you'd sign a few papers.

556
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:31,180
You are such a baby. If you want me
to do something, just ask.

557
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:37,224
Would you please come with me
to sign these papers?

558
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:41,479
- That's how you handle a woman.
- Really?

559
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:50,696
You want to go to lunch
at North Eastern Life lnsurance?

560
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:55,117
- Employees get free lunches.
- We'll get caught.

561
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:59,336
I must know 20 ways
to get a free lunch in this town.

562
00:59:59,504 --> 01:00:02,624
- You do this a lot?
- Sure.

563
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:09,252
I don't pay for L. D.'s, either.
Long distance phone calls.

564
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:12,515
I go up to a company receptionist.

565
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:19,765
I pretend I'm a lost messenger,
and they let me use their phone.

566
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:25,400
I wouldn't be driving this cab
if I made more instructing.

567
01:00:25,571 --> 01:00:31,111
- What do flight instructors make?
- If I hustle, about 1 , 1 00 . . .

568
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:37,204
. . . a month.
But I get to accumulate air time.

569
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:45,369
- Give me my bag!
- He's not stealing our bags.

570
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:49,593
- I've got my teeth in there.
- They're coming with us.

571
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,510
Tell him not to touch my teeth.

572
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:01,260
Welcome, gramps.

573
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:06,778
- Are we stopping for a bite to eat?
- No, this is your new place.

574
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,894
- They got good shrimp here?
- And lobster.

575
01:01:11,074 --> 01:01:14,774
This is it. Enjoy your stay.

576
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:18,119
Grandpa, this is great.

577
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:23,628
You've got a terrific view.
No roommate to bug you. Television.

578
01:01:23,794 --> 01:01:26,712
Can I talk to you for a minute?

579
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:32,385
He's got a sweet tooth.
Give him one candy bar a day.

580
01:01:32,553 --> 01:01:39,006
- Just don't let him find the bag.
- No problem.

581
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:41,343
That smells good.

582
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,854
- Grandpa, that smells good.
- I'd like to see you eat it.

583
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:50,696
Watch this.

584
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,858
Let me try that.

585
01:01:59,037 --> 01:02:03,201
- What do you want?
- Mollie helped us get this place.

586
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:09,876
The woman has thousands more nerves
in the sexual organs than the man.

587
01:02:10,048 --> 01:02:15,173
- I bet the kid's not even yours.
- That's it! Be nice.

588
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:22,507
He's worse at this than I am.
Let me give you a hand.

589
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:25,888
Come on, taste it.

590
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:28,021
Open wide.

591
01:02:30,693 --> 01:02:35,022
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

592
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:39,147
- You want to go flying?
- That would be way too expensive.

593
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:45,080
- Maintenance flights are free.
- You get everything for free.

594
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:49,911
Free phone calls, free lunches . . .
You're a scam artist.

595
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:56,457
I've got the town wired. If we were
poor, we'd still live like kings.

596
01:02:56,635 --> 01:03:00,467
- Fly with me.
- I'm not that kind of person.

597
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:05,431
- Come on. Are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared!

598
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:11,306
- Where are the parachutes?
- There are no parachutes.

599
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:17,069
Didn't you ever see
"The Buddy Holly Story", "La Bamba"?

600
01:03:17,238 --> 01:03:21,984
There's one big difference.
They were rock legends. You're not.

601
01:03:24,287 --> 01:03:28,332
- Is your wing smoking?
- No . . . Oh, my God!

602
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:33,457
- It was just a joke to relax you.
- I'm just so nervous.

603
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:36,547
I feel so out of control.

604
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:42,801
I'll give you your first lesson.
Put your hand on my stick.

605
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:47,799
- I'm not touching your stick.
- This is not a sexual thing.

606
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:50,681
That feels good, baby.

607
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:54,852
Get familiar with the stick.

608
01:03:55,025 --> 01:04:00,150
- There you go, you're flying.
- I'm flying!

609
01:04:00,322 --> 01:04:06,407
I'm doing a good job. This is easy!
What a good sensation!

610
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:12,414
- It's like great sex, isn't it?
- I personally wouldn't remember.

611
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:17,460
- He's pretty tired.
- He's had a busy day.

612
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:26,924
- Do you want a drink?
- Do you want to watch a movie?

613
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:24,936
Stop it!

614
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:30,529
Stop yelling or your father will
give you something to yell about.

615
01:05:30,702 --> 01:05:34,450
Knock it off!

616
01:05:34,622 --> 01:05:39,699
Princess,
you're making my mouth water.

617
01:05:39,878 --> 01:05:42,084
I'm hungry.

618
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:48,375
Hold your horses, or I'll knock you
from here to kingdom come.

619
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:52,965
You know that dumpster behind
the supermarket? Look what I found.

620
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:58,811
A perfectly good head of lettuce,
just peel off the outer layers.

621
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:05,183
Who wants a surprise?
Could be lunch meat or peaches.

622
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:11,233
The point is this: Just because
it's free, don't mean it's no good.

623
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:16,913
- Do we live like kings, or what?
- We sure do.

624
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:28,961
Again!

625
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:32,218
Wait a minute.

626
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:36,550
- I'm sorry, I really do want this.
- I do, too.

627
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:39,298
- It's Mikey.
- He's asleep.

628
01:06:39,477 --> 01:06:46,358
I have to be very clear
on the choices I make for him.

629
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:53,524
I can't make any more mistakes
that are going to hurt Mikey.

630
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:59,453
- But I'm crazy about Mikey.
- I know that I was leading you on.

631
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:03,869
You're such a good kisser and
I haven't had sex in a long time . . .

632
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:09,496
Goodbye. Please . . . Goodbye.

633
01:07:09,673 --> 01:07:15,676
- Mollie, could I talk to you?
- Hold just a minute, please.

634
01:07:15,846 --> 01:07:21,137
Just between you and me,
what's with you and Chubby Charles?

635
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:24,014
What do you mean?

636
01:07:24,188 --> 01:07:28,896
Pearlman's doing the bank recs.
Rubenstein's doing the quarterlies.

637
01:07:29,067 --> 01:07:33,694
Now Albert's returns are due.
So what's with you?

638
01:07:33,864 --> 01:07:40,151
I traded Rubenstein two accounts
for the Chubby Charles account.

639
01:07:40,328 --> 01:07:43,531
I can't do it anymore . . .
It's personal.

640
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:48,250
We're accountants . . .
we're not personal.

641
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,287
- I don't . . .
- You've worked for him for years.

642
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:55,799
Now, with all the new tax laws,
you desert him.

643
01:07:55,969 --> 01:08:00,298
- You don't understand . . .
- I want you up there tomorrow.

644
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:06,760
Don't give me that look.
And you, get back to work.

645
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:16,063
Please, give me a second chance.
This has been like a bad dream.

646
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,607
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

647
01:08:19,783 --> 01:08:26,497
You've been such an asshole,
I'd have to torture you.

648
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:30,283
That's okay. I want you to.

649
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:33,995
- Mollie, Mollie . . .
- What?

650
01:08:34,172 --> 01:08:38,300
- I'll burst if I don't kiss you.
- Tough!

651
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:46,679
Albert can see you now.

652
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:56,193
- Mollie, how's Mickey?
- Mikey.

653
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:59,397
- Is he talking yet?
- No.

654
01:08:59,572 --> 01:09:03,486
Crawling?
I remember Astrid crawling . . .

655
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,360
I'm not interested in your stories.

656
01:09:07,538 --> 01:09:14,252
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- I'm here to do your taxes.

657
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:20,372
Eyelash tinting,
body wraps, facials . . .

658
01:09:20,551 --> 01:09:25,509
- You can't deduct any of this crap.
- And the exercise instructor?

659
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:33,096
Not unless she suffered any injury.
What's the little woman been up to?

660
01:09:33,272 --> 01:09:37,768
Is Priscilla sick?
These doctor bills are for her.

661
01:09:37,943 --> 01:09:41,193
Therapy.
Beth communicaes with the dead.

662
01:09:41,363 --> 01:09:44,613
It really frightens Priscilla.

663
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:50,738
We're all seeing a psychiatrist now.
I've been learning a lot.

664
01:09:50,914 --> 01:09:55,742
- I'm happy for you, Albert.
- I know you've been through a lot.

665
01:09:55,919 --> 01:10:01,791
You've got to believe I love you.
I never meant for this to go bad.

666
01:10:01,966 --> 01:10:07,209
- It just turned out that way.
- It took $20,000 to find that out?

667
01:10:07,388 --> 01:10:12,596
- Do you have a picture of Mickey?
- Mikey!

668
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:16,766
- I think about you two every day.
- You'd never know it.

669
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:20,557
I try to call, but I can't do it.

670
01:10:20,735 --> 01:10:25,443
I'm too ashamed.
I'm afraid of what you'll say.

671
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:29,233
I've been so confused.

672
01:10:40,587 --> 01:10:44,087
- He has my eyes.
- I know.

673
01:10:44,258 --> 01:10:48,884
It's confusing loving someone
who looks like someone you hate.

674
01:10:49,054 --> 01:10:51,379
Could I see him?

675
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:59,145
All right.
I'll be home this evening.

676
01:10:59,314 --> 01:11:04,439
Next time you talk to your mom,
put in a good word in for me.

677
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:07,446
Hit me. Hit it again.

678
01:11:07,614 --> 01:11:10,899
- No . . . yeah?
- Hit it again.

679
01:11:11,075 --> 01:11:16,615
- I know what I'm doing.
- Damn! You won again.

680
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:22,744
I told you I could play. I've been
thinking about this daddy business.

681
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,455
I want you to be my daddy.
I'll tell Mommy.

682
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:32,093
- Who is it?
- Mollie?

683
01:11:35,683 --> 01:11:39,894
- Is Mollie here?
- No, she's at aerobics class.

684
01:11:41,272 --> 01:11:45,933
- Is Mikey here? I'm his father.
- His father?

685
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:50,522
- Are you the sperm donor?
- I'm the kid's father?

686
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:56,783
- He's from artificial insemination.
- I've known Mollie for years.

687
01:11:56,954 --> 01:12:00,536
- I have a key.
- We're changing it.

688
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:05,539
- What?
- That's my kid in there. Let me by.

689
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:09,579
If you are the father,
answer me a few questions.

690
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:14,633
- When was he born?
- July third.

691
01:12:14,804 --> 01:12:18,469
What's his favourite toy,
Fred or Barney? Fred?

692
01:12:18,641 --> 01:12:23,802
No, Barney. How many diapers
does he go through a day? Six.

693
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:28,558
- A father should know.
- How much is she paying you?

694
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:32,684
- Go play some video games.
- Don't give me that shit.

695
01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:38,951
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

696
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,200
Go for the body!

697
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:52,037
Get out of here!

698
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:58,882
Yes, that feels good.

699
01:13:04,394 --> 01:13:09,140
- What happened?
- Who's Albert?

700
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:13,894
- Why, was he here?
- Is he Mikey's father?

701
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:21,070
- You lied about the insemination.
- He was married.

702
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:26,120
Do you love him?

703
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:29,742
- What?
- Do you love him?

704
01:13:29,919 --> 01:13:32,920
I don't know who I love.

705
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:37,751
The only thing that matters to me
is who's best for Mikey.

706
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:45,175
Albert is successful, responsible
and he's good to his other kids.

707
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:50,974
- I don't want him seeing Mikey.
- Don't start pulling this on me.

708
01:13:51,148 --> 01:13:56,143
- He has a right to see his son.
- Where has he been all year?

709
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,990
- You are not his father.
- I'm the closest thing he's got.

710
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,694
Look at you. You're like a big kid.

711
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:10,782
Are you responsible enough
to be a father?

712
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,577
Is getting pregnant by a married man
responsible?

713
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:17,542
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

714
01:14:17,716 --> 01:14:23,754
I've seen you use Mikey to push guys
away, and now you're doing it to me.

715
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:28,177
- Get out!
- I live here!

716
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:40,020
Can a person past
a certain age change?

717
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:42,865
Daddy's lipids fell to 1 85.

718
01:14:43,032 --> 01:14:48,275
I'm not talking about cholesterol.
Can someone become nicer?

719
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:50,660
I don't know.

720
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:55,292
When you met Daddy at that dance,
did you know he'd be a good father?

721
01:14:55,461 --> 01:15:01,748
- I liked the look of his uniform.
- They all wore uniforms.

722
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:05,129
I didn't like
the sailors' bell-bottoms.

723
01:15:05,304 --> 01:15:11,674
You had no idea if he was
a mature responsible person.

724
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:17,475
If I thought like that, we wouldn't
have had so much fun the first week.

725
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:23,106
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy.

726
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:27,815
Hi, Lupe.

727
01:15:27,993 --> 01:15:32,453
I just want to talk to Mikey
for a minute.

728
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:37,907
Hey, Gerber-face, high-five.

729
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:46,384
Look, Mikey . . . I don't know
if I can keep coming to see you.

730
01:15:46,552 --> 01:15:49,886
- What's the matter?
- It's your mom.

731
01:15:50,056 --> 01:15:54,801
She's got this crazy idea
that I wouldn't make a good father.

732
01:15:54,977 --> 01:15:59,686
She probably wouldn't
have picked my father, either.

733
01:15:59,857 --> 01:16:06,275
I think he did an okay job.
Want to hear some fatherly advice?

734
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:11,570
Hi, Lupe.

735
01:16:11,744 --> 01:16:18,742
- The man's in the baby's room.
- Okay, I'll write you a check.

736
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:25,086
He said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're asking for it."

737
01:16:25,257 --> 01:16:27,463
What about pushing them?

738
01:16:27,634 --> 01:16:35,428
He'd say, "Finish your meat,
you know how much that cost? "

739
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,306
The one that sticks out the most
was probably . . .

740
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:46,439
"lf your friend jumps off a bridge,
does that mean you've got to?"

741
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:53,325
To this very day,
I still use that piece of advice.

742
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:57,780
It doesn't amount to much.

743
01:16:57,955 --> 01:17:05,702
A good father keeps the mother happy
so she doesn't drive the kids crazy.

744
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,008
She called me a big kid . . .
She's probably right.

745
01:17:10,176 --> 01:17:14,339
You're one year old
and my best friend in the world.

746
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:18,262
Anyway . . .

747
01:17:20,728 --> 01:17:25,306
- I'll miss you.
- Don't be sad. Here, take this.

748
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:37,191
- No, I want you to have it.
- Okay, thanks.

749
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:40,904
He'll take good care of you.

750
01:17:46,169 --> 01:17:50,712
- We're going to see Daddy today.
- I was just thinking about James.

751
01:17:50,882 --> 01:17:57,003
- The blue or the lamb?
- They both look pretty lame.

752
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,964
- The lamb?
- Not lamb, lame!

753
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:05,638
Please don't make me wear clothes
with animals on them.

754
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:10,309
I don't like this.
It makes me look stupid.

755
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:15,989
- You look great.
- I feel like a retard.

756
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:23,527
Look at this room.
Look at these guys.

757
01:18:23,706 --> 01:18:27,039
I bet I could take those apart.

758
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:32,713
Little metal things . . . I'll stick
them in those little holes.

759
01:18:33,632 --> 01:18:39,006
Mollie, hi. This must be Mikey.

760
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:44,339
Hiya, fella. What are you doing?

761
01:18:44,518 --> 01:18:48,765
- Aren't you a handsome . . .
- Milk in the eye.

762
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:51,227
Bull's-eye!

763
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:56,524
It's all right.
It's just milk, it won't stain.

764
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:04,318
- He's beautiful. He looks like you.
- A lot of people say that.

765
01:19:04,496 --> 01:19:09,952
I know the circumstances
you had him under were terrible.

766
01:19:10,126 --> 01:19:15,120
- But I know it wasn't a mistake.
- I bet he's glad to hear that.

767
01:19:15,298 --> 01:19:19,509
You will never escape me.

768
01:19:19,677 --> 01:19:23,627
- Mikey, don't do that!
- What did I do?

769
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:31,470
Some people don't have the strength
to get out certain situations.

770
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:35,727
What are you trying to say?
Mikey, don't touch that.

771
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:42,105
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

772
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:48,486
- And what about Mikey?
- Count on me. Whatever he needs.

773
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,072
He needs a father.

774
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:58,502
I'm living alone for the first time
in 1 7 years. I'm in therapy.

775
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:04,130
I can't be anybody's father now.
I need to be by myself.

776
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:09,725
- I've raised my kids.
- Raised them? They're 1 1 and 9!

777
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:14,851
- Have they moved out?
- Too much fruit!

778
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:19,483
It wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

779
01:20:19,652 --> 01:20:24,113
- Is he taking a dump?
- No, he's thinking real hard.

780
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:32,955
- I'll get you cleaned up.
- Use the washroom in the back.

781
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:39,043
- He'll ask about his daddy.
- I want James to be the daddy.

782
01:20:39,213 --> 01:20:44,420
Don't do that here.
That's a $1 0,000 desk!

783
01:20:44,593 --> 01:20:49,421
- Now it's junk!
- I thought you'd understand.

784
01:20:49,598 --> 01:20:56,596
Of course I understand. You're going
through a selfish phase.

785
01:20:56,772 --> 01:21:01,813
I know you will understand that I'm
going through a destructive phase.

786
01:21:06,907 --> 01:21:09,824
Let's trash the place.

787
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:20,541
I'm sorry about that stupid outfit.

788
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:25,872
I'm sorry I made you meet
that mean man. Never again.

789
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:32,053
Every time I take you someplace,
people are crazy about you.

790
01:21:32,223 --> 01:21:38,059
Yet the person who has a genetic
bond to you treats you like a jerk.

791
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:42,226
Everybody loves you.
All the kids at the playground.

792
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,436
Ma loves you. Rona loves you.

793
01:21:45,611 --> 01:21:50,985
James loves you.
Mikey, do you love James?

794
01:21:53,577 --> 01:21:59,081
- Give him a call.
- Do you want to play telephone?

795
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:02,120
Hello?

796
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:07,454
It's for you. You take this one,
I'll take the other one.

797
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:12,923
This is Lou Franklin,
I'm phoning about your grandfather.

798
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:16,963
He's become abusive and violent.

799
01:22:17,142 --> 01:22:22,765
- Should I call Health & Welfare?
- No, I'll come and pick him up.

800
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:37,031
- What's going on?
- I'm a hostage.

801
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:40,204
He's a mean old bastard!

802
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:44,620
- Look what he did to my arm?
- Don't talk to him like that.

803
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:48,626
- They're hiding Dora.
- They are not.

804
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:54,800
- Then where is she?
- Sit down. I'll find her for you.

805
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:00,890
Let's get your face cleaned up.
You want to look good for her.

806
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:07,730
You're my favourite daughter-in-law.
You're smart and a good person.

807
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:12,775
That's why Jimmy loves you so much.

808
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:20,074
- There you go.
- Let's go find James.

809
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:24,408
I'll show you some pictures.

810
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:30,334
Grandpa, did you eat all these
candy bars today?

811
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:35,001
- The bastards stole my candy.
- We'll get some more.

812
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,877
- Where's the director's office?
- Down the hall.

813
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:43,349
- We're busy.
- I'll keep my eye on them for you.

814
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:47,100
I'll be back in a minute.

815
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:54,401
This isn't his usual behaviour.
My husband made arrangements.

816
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:59,196
It isn't the orderly's
responsibility to control his diet.

817
01:23:59,366 --> 01:24:02,652
He requires a private nurse.

818
01:24:02,828 --> 01:24:12,330
No, he doesn't. The orderly was told
to give him one candy bar a day.

819
01:24:12,504 --> 01:24:16,454
- He said no problem.
- That was Bill.

820
01:24:16,633 --> 01:24:22,256
Bill always says no problem.
The man can't speak English.

821
01:24:24,182 --> 01:24:27,966
- So can Grandpa stay?
- Of course.

822
01:24:28,144 --> 01:24:34,728
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming down so fast.

823
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:41,192
- Hi.
- Hi.

824
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:47,238
- Your grandfather can stay.
- You didn't have to do that.

825
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:52,573
- I wanted to do it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

826
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:55,159
- Don't bother.
- Fine!

827
01:24:55,338 --> 01:24:59,916
D.J. , it's time for lunch.
Let's go.

828
01:25:00,092 --> 01:25:04,386
- Are you okay with him?
- Get the hell out of here.

829
01:25:06,474 --> 01:25:10,851
Steven and Paulie,
they're your cousins.

830
01:25:12,271 --> 01:25:16,897
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello, Esther.

831
01:25:21,572 --> 01:25:26,814
Esther . . . I'd like you
to meet my grandson.

832
01:25:27,953 --> 01:25:31,452
Hey, there goes James.

833
01:25:31,623 --> 01:25:36,415
Where's he going?
Maybe he's going downstairs.

834
01:25:36,586 --> 01:25:41,960
- They took me to the beauty salon.
- Where's the elevator.

835
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:45,336
Going down.

836
01:25:45,512 --> 01:25:49,177
I'll just press all these.

837
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:55,303
Perfect! I'll just hitch a ride
with the fruit cups.

838
01:25:58,107 --> 01:26:01,975
There we go. Take her away, boys.

839
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:08,026
- Mikey.
- Grandpa, where's Mikey?

840
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:14,570
- He was just here.
- How long ago did he leave?

841
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:18,828
- I'll check the hallway.
- I'm calling the police.

842
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:23,338
Hi, toots. Anyone seen my dad?

843
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:29,711
- That's lda's grandson.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

844
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:35,642
- Here, fella, go find your grandma.
- Thanks for nothing.

845
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:41,397
When the police get here,
will you show them these pictures?

846
01:26:41,566 --> 01:26:44,816
All right, I'm on the case now.

847
01:26:47,155 --> 01:26:51,022
That is exactly what I need.

848
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:56,491
I could find him in one of those.
Let's see if I remember this.

849
01:26:56,664 --> 01:27:01,622
I'll set this thing down right here
and get that door open.

850
01:27:01,794 --> 01:27:05,128
What was it James said?

851
01:27:05,298 --> 01:27:09,509
Stick this in here . . .
There it goes.

852
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:13,342
Move the circle around
and we're off.

853
01:27:13,556 --> 01:27:15,844
Mikey!

854
01:27:16,017 --> 01:27:18,768
Mikey!

855
01:27:22,565 --> 01:27:27,357
- He's in the back of that car.
- Let's get the cab.

856
01:27:27,528 --> 01:27:31,228
- Hey!
- Stop!

857
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:43,201
I got this driving thing knocked.

858
01:27:48,632 --> 01:27:51,586
Move it!

859
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:58,046
There he is. Look at me.
Hey, James, I'm driving!

860
01:27:59,392 --> 01:28:05,929
James . . . where's he going?

861
01:28:09,777 --> 01:28:12,897
- What are you doing?
- I'll cut him off.

862
01:28:13,072 --> 01:28:15,480
You'll lose him.

863
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,658
I know this alley
like the back of my hand.

864
01:28:37,054 --> 01:28:42,131
Mikey! He's gone!

865
01:28:42,309 --> 01:28:44,551
Mikey!

866
01:28:44,728 --> 01:28:50,149
- You had a little boy in there.
- What are you talking about?

867
01:28:50,317 --> 01:28:53,104
He's about this big.

868
01:28:53,278 --> 01:28:58,070
- This is a good place to spot him.
- Mikey!

869
01:28:58,241 --> 01:29:01,527
Mikey, stop!

870
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:05,072
- James, is that you?
- Mikey, don't move.

871
01:29:05,248 --> 01:29:08,747
James, Mommy . . .

872
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:11,290
Here I come.

873
01:29:11,462 --> 01:29:14,962
- Mikey!
- I'm coming.

874
01:29:25,601 --> 01:29:31,271
- Did you see what just happened?
- Give me my baby.

875
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,271
Are you all right, honey?
Let me see you.

876
01:29:39,448 --> 01:29:42,651
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

877
01:29:42,826 --> 01:29:45,697
I finally got you both together.

878
01:29:45,871 --> 01:29:49,703
I better take
him to the hospital anyway.

879
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:54,038
Ma, I want James to be the daddy.

880
01:29:54,212 --> 01:29:58,709
- Thanks for all your help.
- I'll take you home now.

881
01:30:00,302 --> 01:30:06,636
- Dada.
- I think he called you Dada.

882
01:30:06,808 --> 01:30:09,429
No, I'm talking
to hear myself speak.

883
01:30:09,602 --> 01:30:14,099
- He thinks you're his father.
- I've spent a lot of time with him.

884
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:18,686
He probably thinks
we're going to end up together.

885
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:31,571
I hope
they don't get stuck together.

886
01:30:35,878 --> 01:30:40,587
Should I tell them
I need a new diaper?

887
01:30:40,758 --> 01:30:42,797
No, I'll wait.

888
01:31:36,813 --> 01:31:41,225
- Hi, honey.
- Mikey, this is your sister Julie.

889
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,974
Say "Hi, Julie."

890
01:31:44,153 --> 01:31:49,527
Don't start with me, kid! I've had
a day you wouldn't believe.
