1
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,350
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,870
What the hell...?

3
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,170
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,140
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,150
Nice night for a walk?

6
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,280
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,410
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,370
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,590
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

10
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,920
Your clothes, give them to me.

11
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,970
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,780
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

13
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,080
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

14
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,750
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it! Go.

15
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,920
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

16
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,930
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

17
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,010
- Thursday.
- What year?

18
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,240
He's got my gun. Let's go.

19
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,830
Guard it for me. Big Buns.

20
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,460
Hi. I'm late.

21
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,550
So am I.

22
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,430
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

23
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,930
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,810
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

25
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,020
That's mine, but I didn't order fries.

26
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,480
- Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly-beef?

27
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,490
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,030
I'm so sorry.

29
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,160
Thisisn't real leather, isit?

30
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,540
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

31
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,430
Look at it this way.
In 100 years. who's gonna care?

32
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,230
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

33
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,270
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

34
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,860
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

35
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,450
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

36
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,830
The beam comes on - you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

37
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,540
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

38
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,340
Hey, just what you see, pal.

39
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,090
The Uzi nine millimetre.

40
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,680
You know your weapons, buddy.

41
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,100
Any one of these is ideal
for home defence.

42
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,140
So which will it be?

43
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,850
- All.
- I may close early today.

44
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,270
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

45
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

46
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,140
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

47
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,480
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

48
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,900
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

49
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,860
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

50
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,290
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

51
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

52
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,350
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

53
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,030
Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
You're going to love this.

54
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,030
- What?
- ...compiled from several witnesses.

55
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,450
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,

56
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,990
brutally shot to death this afternoon.

57
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,370
You're dead, honey.

58
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,360
...if you're into sound,

59
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,820
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

60
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,080
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

61
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,580
We've got graphic equalisers
and sound balancers that...

62
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,730
Sorry.

63
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,370
Hello?

64
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,710
First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,

65
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,170
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

66
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,670
And then slowly...slowly pull
your jeans off inch by inch.

67
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,010
Ginger, it's Matt.

68
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,270
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

69
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,640
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

70
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,270
Who is this?

71
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,570
God. Sarah?

72
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,690
Jesus. I'm sorry.

73
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,450
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?

74
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,030
Sure.

75
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,700
It's the creep.

76
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,670
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

77
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,590
You fucking pigs. Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me.

78
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,550
Ed.

79
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,020
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

80
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,770
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

81
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,610
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.

82
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,780
You know, these work.

83
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,740
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

84
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,160
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

85
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,120
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

86
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,620
Look at the name, Ed.

87
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,460
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

88
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,460
You're kidding.

89
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,220
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

90
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,720
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

91
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,140
So...

92
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,020
Better than mortal man deserves.

93
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,490
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

94
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,990
I thought you did.

95
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,250
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

96
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,630
You mind your mother.

97
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,890
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

98
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,770
Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.

99
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.

100
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,440
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

101
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,240
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

102
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,410
I'll live.

103
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,780
I'll break his kneecaps.

104
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,290
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

105
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,960
God. It's disgusting.

106
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

107
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,880
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

108
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,220
Damn it, Matt.

109
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,910
Shit.

110
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,160
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

111
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,620
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

112
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,260
That coffee's two hours cold.

113
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,770
I put a cigarette out in it.

114
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,400
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

115
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,060
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

116
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,530
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

117
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,530
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

118
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,700
Give me a cigarette.

119
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,630
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

120
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,840
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

121
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,680
Same shit.

122
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,440
I can hear it now, he's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

123
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,780
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

124
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,950
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

125
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,120
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

126
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,040
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

127
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,790
Well, how do I look?

128
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,250
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

129
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,550
This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim

130
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,180
in the second of two murders
which took place today.

131
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,720
Incredibly, the names of the
two victims are virtually identical.

132
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:01,020
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...

133
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,400
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...

134
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,020
Don't touch it.

135
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,610
Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths

136
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,030
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

137
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,960
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

138
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,920
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

139
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,510
Hey. Four-fifty.

140
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,970
You have reached the Los Angeles
Police emergency number.

141
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,850
All lines are busy. If you need a police car
sent out to you, stay on the line.

142
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,210
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

143
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,140
Don't make me bust you up, man.

144
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,210
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

145
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,290
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

146
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,500
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

147
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,170
Wait for the beep.

148
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,630
This is Sarah. Pick up if you're there.

149
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

150
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,730
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

151
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,440
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

152
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,940
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

153
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,370
The number here is 5 559 175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

154
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,680
It's her.

155
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,310
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

156
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,770
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

157
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,150
I won't. Can you tell me where you are?

158
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,230
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it. It's on Pico.

159
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,030
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

160
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,280
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

161
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,200
You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.

162
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,420
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

163
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,400
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

164
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,520
Come with me if you wanna live.

165
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,660
Come on!

166
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,060
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

167
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,530
Suspect vehicle - late model
grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

168
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,820
He's really moving - punching lights.

169
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,700
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

170
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,080
Hold it.

171
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,680
Hold on.

172
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,400
Are you injured? Are you shot?

173
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,040
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

174
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,660
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

175
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,080
Do you understand?

176
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,760
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

177
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,770
I'm here to help you.

178
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,570
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38 416. Assigned to protect you.

179
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,030
You've been targeted for termination.

180
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,420
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

181
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,010
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

182
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,850
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

183
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,480
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

184
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,520
It's not a man. A machine.

185
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,150
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

186
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,330
A machine? Like a robot?

187
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:36,000
Not a robot. A cyborg -
cybernetic organism.

188
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,960
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

189
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,800
Get your head down.

190
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,310
Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration
unit. Part man, part machine.

191
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,360
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

192
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,940
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.

193
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,410
Flesh, skin, hair, blood -
grown for the cyborgs.

194
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,370
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

195
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,950
I gotta ditch this car.

196
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,250
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

197
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,880
But these are new. They look human.

198
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,840
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

199
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,560
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

200
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,350
Look. I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

201
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,400
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

202
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,070
Are you saying it's from the future?

203
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,910
One possible future...
from your point of view.

204
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,160
I don't know tech stuff.

205
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,040
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

206
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,210
- Right.
- Right.

207
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,760
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

208
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,890
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

209
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,480
That Terminator is out there.

210
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,520
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

211
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:08,360
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

212
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:14,450
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

213
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,420
Can you stop it?

214
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,720
I don't know.

215
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,180
With these weapons. I don't know.

216
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,120
All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...

217
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,080
Reese, why me?

218
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,840
Why does it want me?

219
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,850
There was a nuclear war.

220
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,680
A few years from now.

221
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:09,440
all this, this whole place, everything.

222
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,150
it's gone, just gone.

223
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,990
There were survivors.

224
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,160
Here, there.

225
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,920
Nobody even knew who started it.

226
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,880
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

227
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,550
Defence network computers.

228
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,390
New, powerful,

229
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,310
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

230
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,980
They say it got smart -
a new order of intelligence.

231
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,820
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

232
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,820
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

233
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,370
Extermination.

234
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:18,800
Did you see this war?

235
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,360
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

236
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,570
Starving, hiding from the H-Ks.

237
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,580
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

238
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,620
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

239
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,380
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

240
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,380
This was burned in by laser scanner.

241
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,390
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

242
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,140
Loading bodies.

243
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,940
The disposal units ran night and day.

244
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,150
We were that close to going out for ever.

245
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,900
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

246
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,070
To storm the wire of the camps.

247
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,790
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

248
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,040
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

249
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,500
His name was Connor. John Connor.

250
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:38,260
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

251
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,790
Drive.

252
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,790
Reese!

253
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,440
No, Reese. No, no. They'll kill you.

254
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,360
You in the Cadillac.
let me see your hands now.

255
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,280
Get out of the car.

256
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,790
Drop to your knees.

257
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,210
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

258
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,910
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

259
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,700
Listen, are you sure it's them?

260
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,830
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

261
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:02,170
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

262
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,340
Ginger. Kiddo.

263
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:15,100
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

264
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,270
Tell him everything Reese told you.
Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

265
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,440
Yeah. I guess so.

266
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,240
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

267
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,160
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

268
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:00,370
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

269
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:07,090
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

270
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,010
That's the year 2027?

271
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,170
That's right. Then I was assigned...

272
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,090
- This is fucking great.
- ...under John Connor.

273
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,310
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...

274
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,730
Goddamn! Sorry.

275
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,350
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

276
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,520
I see.

277
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:33,450
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

278
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,870
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

279
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,240
A sort of retroactive abortion?

280
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,250
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

281
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,460
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

282
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,250
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

283
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,920
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

284
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,510
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.

285
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:01,010
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

286
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,060
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

287
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,980
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found...What is it called?

288
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,570
The time displacement equipment?

289
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:15,530
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

290
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,700
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

291
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,490
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

292
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,660
I can't.

293
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:29,920
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

294
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,590
It's just him and me.

295
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,530
It's just him and me.

296
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:29,700
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.

297
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,710
Don't you have ray guns?

298
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,380
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

299
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,170
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

300
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,010
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.

301
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,640
OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal...?

302
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,270
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

303
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,230
Great stuff,
I could make a career out of this guy.

304
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,320
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

305
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,070
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

306
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:08,910
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.

307
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,710
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

308
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,540
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

309
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,550
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

310
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,470
- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

311
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,930
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.

312
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,890
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

313
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:31,060
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

314
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,230
Shut up!

315
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,020
You still don't get it, do you?

316
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,400
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

317
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:47,120
You can't stop him, he'll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

318
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,740
- Doc.
- Let go of me!

319
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,510
He's crazy?

320
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,050
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

321
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:11,140
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.

322
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,520
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

323
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,900
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

324
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,690
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

325
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,530
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

326
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:29,120
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

327
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,280
Thank you.

328
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,670
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.

329
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,960
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

330
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,220
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

331
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,680
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

332
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,810
Thank you.

333
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,650
- Good night.
- Good night.

334
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,790
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

335
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,460
No, can't see her.
She's making a statement.

336
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,210
Where is she?

337
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,090
It make take a while. If you wanna wait.
there's a bench over there.

338
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,650
I'll be back.

339
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,290
Stay here.

340
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,620
Watch him.

341
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,690
Ed...

342
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,640
Sarah!

343
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,810
Reese.

344
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,350
This way.

345
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,560
KFLB news time. 4.36.

346
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,980
Top story - the largest single
law enforcement mobilisation

347
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,190
in California history
is currently underway.

348
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,200
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

349
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,700
Take this.

350
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,790
All right. Let's get this off the road.

351
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,990
- You cold?
- Freezing.

352
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,840
Reese?

353
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,220
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

354
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:09,930
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

355
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,770
White light.

356
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,030
Pain.

357
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:25,820
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

358
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,740
I caught one back there.

359
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:37,540
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK, forget it.

360
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:42,590
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

361
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,400
Jesus.

362
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,110
See? It passed right through the meat.

363
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,650
This is gonna make me puke.

364
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,950
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

365
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:09,620
I don't know. Anything,
just talk. Tell me about my son.

366
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,500
He's about my height.

367
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:17,960
He has your eyes.

368
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,090
What's he like?

369
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,930
You trust him, he's got a strength.

370
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,720
I'd die for John Connor.

371
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,100
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

372
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:43,030
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

373
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:46,030
John never said much about him.

374
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:49,240
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

375
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,370
I don't wanna know.

376
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,920
So was it John that sent you here?

377
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:04,670
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

378
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:11,640
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organise.

379
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,930
prepare from when he was a kid.

380
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,770
When you were in hiding before the war.

381
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:23,650
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

382
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:26,320
It's driving me crazy.

383
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,080
Are you sure you have the right person?

384
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,370
I'm sure.

385
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,420
Come on! Do I look like
the mother of the future?

386
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:45,170
I mean, am I tough? Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

387
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:52,220
Look, Reese. I didn't ask
for this honour and I don't want it.

388
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,680
Any of it.

389
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:01,980
Your son gave me a message
to give to you, made me memorise it.

390
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:05,190
Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

391
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,990
I can't help you with what you must
soon face. The future is not set.

392
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:12,660
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

393
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,120
You must survive or I will never exist.

394
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,290
That's all.

395
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,920
It's a good field dressing.

396
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,090
You like it?

397
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,470
It's my first.

398
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,680
Get some sleep, it'll be light soon.

399
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,730
OK.

400
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,820
Talk to me some more.

401
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,250
About what?

402
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,040
Tell me about where you're from.

403
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:11,010
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

404
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:16,300
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

405
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:22,600
But they're not too bright,
John taught us ways to dust them.

406
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,150
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

407
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,990
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

408
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:44,960
Traversing your sector in search mode
750 metres north of your position.

409
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,550
Let's go.

410
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:39,220
- Reese, DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

411
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:14,150
Terminator!

412
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,810
I was dreaming about dogs.

413
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,020
We use'em to spot Terminators.

414
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:41,030
Your world is pretty terrifying.

415
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,860
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

416
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,290
Fuck you, asshole.

417
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,100
God damn.

418
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,600
Thank you.

419
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,070
Is this enough?

420
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:07,320
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

421
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,620
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

422
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,870
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

423
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,560
I am dying for a shower.

424
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:41,020
We should check your bandage, too.

425
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,740
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

426
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,660
Keep this.

427
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,140
No. I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

428
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,350
I need to know where to reach you.

429
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,070
I am worried sick here.

430
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:33,740
OK. OK, here's the number.

431
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,160
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

432
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:42,830
It's 4 085 551 439. Room nine.

433
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,840
- Got it?
- I've got it.

434
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:49,340
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

435
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,510
I love you, Mom.

436
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,310
I love you, too, sweetheart.

437
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,820
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

438
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:17,540
What have we got?

439
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:26,290
Mothballs..., corn syrup...ammonia.

440
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,670
What's for dinner?

441
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,970
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

442
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,140
What is it?

443
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,850
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

444
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,850
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

445
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,530
Make sure there's none on the threads.

446
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:58,120
Like this.

447
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,830
Screw the end cap on.

448
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,580
Very gently.

449
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:10,090
You must've had a fun childhood.

450
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,510
That's good.

451
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:20,600
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

452
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:33,200
He'll find us, won't he?

453
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,490
Probably.

454
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,550
It'll never be over, will it?

455
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,770
Look at me, I'm shaking.

456
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:13,990
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

457
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:18,740
No, I'm not.

458
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:31,880
Kyle, the women in your time,

459
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,300
what are they like?

460
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,260
Good fighters.

461
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,060
That's not what I meant.

462
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,100
Was there someone special?

463
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,400
Someone...?

464
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,770
A girl, you know.

465
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:55,320
No.

466
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,700
Never.

467
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,830
Never?

468
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:10,670
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

469
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,880
So much pain.

470
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:21,510
Pain can be controlled,
You just disconnect it.

471
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,970
So you feel nothing?

472
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,230
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

473
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,990
I didn't know why at the time.

474
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:43,120
It was very old, torn, faded.

475
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:53,290
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

476
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:58,550
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

477
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:02,180
I memorised every line,

478
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,350
every curve.

479
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,560
I came across time for you, Sarah.

480
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:15,900
I love you. I always have.

481
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,250
I shouldn't have said that.

482
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:09,220
Think fast.

483
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:39,810
Trade places.

484
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:53,780
Faster. Drive faster.

485
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,590
Kyle. Oh, my God.

486
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:56,660
You stay here.

487
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,520
Let's get outta here.

488
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,560
Get out.

489
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:45,620
Kyle, come on. Get up.

490
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,800
Come on.

491
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,760
Help me. Get out. Get out.

492
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,410
Don't stop. Run.

493
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:41,880
Sarah.

494
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,840
Kyle.

495
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,350
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

496
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,170
No.

497
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:16,390
Wait.

498
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,360
What are you doing?

499
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,820
Cover, so he can't track us.

500
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:38,790
Come on.

501
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:43,300
No, Kyle. Come on.

502
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:47,260
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

503
01:32:56,930 --> 01:33:01,610
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

504
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:05,190
On your feet. Move it.

505
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,310
Get back. Go back.

506
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,550
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

507
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,430
Run.

508
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,520
Run.

509
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,270
Come on, motherfucker.

510
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:59,550
No.

511
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:00,460
You're terminated, fucker.

512
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,900
Kyle.

513
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,920
Seven, November 10. Where was I?

514
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:28,930
What's difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

515
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:33,770
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

516
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:38,850
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

517
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:16,850
Fill her up.

518
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:22,900
Should I tell you about your father?

519
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,280
Boy, that's a tough one.

520
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:32,450
Will it effect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

521
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:36,290
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

522
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:39,500
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

523
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:46,630
I suppose I will tell you.

524
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:49,010
I owe him that.

525
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:53,640
Maybe it'll help if...

526
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:58,930
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,

527
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:03,440
we loved a lifetime's worth.

528
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:19,790
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

529
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,460
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

530
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:29,590
Pretty good hustle, kid.

531
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,940
What did he just say?

532
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:51,150
He said there's a storm coming in.

533
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:56,700
I know.
