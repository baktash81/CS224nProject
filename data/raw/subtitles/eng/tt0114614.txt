<i>It's 2033. The world is screwed now</i>.

32
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:46,210
<i>A while ago, this humongous comet</i>
<i>came crashin' into the earth</i>.

33
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:50,422
<i>Bam! Total devastation</i>.
<i>End of the world as we know it</i>.

34
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,758
<i>No celebrities, no cable TV</i>.

35
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:55,427
<i>No water! It hasn't rained in 11 years</i>.

36
00:02:55,594 --> 00:03:00,140

<i>Whatever I can scrounge up</i>.

40
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,972
<i>Uh-oh! Ripper raptors</i>.

41
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:47,188
<i>The Rippers are a demonic army</i>
<i>of bloodthirsty, human-eating,</i>

42
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:50,482
<i>purse-snatchin', mutant creatures</i>.

43
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,651
<i>Witness Exhibit A</i>.

44
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:58,490
<i>Euch! You are so dead. They're led</i>
<i>by the infamous Johnny Prophet</i>.

45
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:03,078
<i>They spend most of their time raidin'</i>
<i>the WP. That's short for Water and Power</i>.

46
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,832
<i>They control most of the water,</i>
<i>and got all the power</i>.

47
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,820
<i>Oh, wait. One last thing</i>.

48
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:40,533
<i>My friends and me, we do not</i>

49
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,454
<i>Yeah, we steal water, but as long as</i>

50
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,129
<i>Ah, there it is. Home, sweet home</i>.

51
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,802
That's a beauty.

52
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,179
I'm gonna go water the vegetables.

53
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,607
Town, you fixed the pump, right?
I'm goin' down.

54
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:16,443
Yeah, go for it!

55
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:39,091
You've been stealing water.

56
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:42,803
- What gave you that idea?
- Take off your clothes.

57
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:48,267
- Now!
- Shit. Right, right, right, right, right.

58
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,868
There.

59
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,371
Did I tell you to stop?

60
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,796
Now...

61
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:22,885
Salute me.

62
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm not too good under pressure.

63
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,474
Well, you'll learn, then, won't you?

64
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,563
- Gross out!
- Come on. They're bein' weird again.

65
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:37,608
- Let's get outta here.
- Let go.

66
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,777
Damn!

67
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,074
- I was just gettin' into that one.
- Gimme that.

68
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,343
Sam.

69
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:07,179
I thought you was workin'
on my Doris Day bust?

70
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:12,518
I didn't trade you my autographed Doris
picture just for... whatever this is.

71
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,940
I know, but the wood talks to me.
It said Ripper.

72
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,070
How would <i>you</i> know what one looks
like? No one's ever seen a Ripper.

73
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:26,448
No one's ever seen
your peanut dick either.

74
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,284
- I'm tellin'.
- Go ahead.

75
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,953
Rebecca! Don't forget guard duty.

76
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:54,059
Adam was dust until God
injected him with life.

77
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,938
And do you know
what was in that injection?

78
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,483
Water.

79
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:05,321
Water is life. Water is power.

80
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,326
Well done. You've all
done a masterful job.

81
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:14,872
95 per cent of the desert
and all the water it contains

82
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,708
now belongs to Water and Power.

83
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,213
I think that deserves a little toast.

84
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:25,716
To Captain Derouche,

85
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,136
for securing most of the desert.

86
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:34,266
- Captain Derouche.
- Captain Derouche.

87
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:43,567
I can promise you, sir, the Rippers
will only be a minor setback.

88
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:46,195
Once I take care of them,

89
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,198
that final crack of land will be ours.

90
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:59,166
This crack of land, Captain?

91
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:04,129
Well, it's just a small crack.
It doesn't matter. We'll let that go.

92
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:11,929
Oh, my. Now look what's happened.

93
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,098
We lost the Feta Plains.

94
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,937
And the Tenelson Ridge!

95
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,109
And so on!

96
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,454
There are three million litres of water
underneath the Blue Dunes.

97
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,874
And you will retrieve it.

98
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:42,626
Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?

99
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,462
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,506
Good!

101
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,635
Remove your boots, Captain.

102
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:03,606
Now come here.

103
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,465
The Fool.

104
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,387
It was foolish not to carry out my order.

105
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:38,474
It was foolish to walk across
a floor full of glass.

106
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:42,645
If I were you, I wouldn't have done it.
I would have killed me first.

107
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,023
But you lack that courage,
don't you, Captain?

108
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,861
Come closer.

109
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,243
Walk.

110
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,620
Sergeant Small,

111
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,998
it's your show now.

112
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,170
Please,

113
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,756
- try not to let me down.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,103
Lovely.

115
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,737
<i>I take guard duty very seriously</i>.

116
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:19,992
<i># Before I was even born</i>

117
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,578
<i># It's such a gamble when you get a face</i>

118
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:25,581
<i># It's fascinating</i>

119
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:29,543
<i># But when I dine,</i>

00:12:32,254 --> 00:12:35,799
<i># And I can take it or leave it each time</i>

00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,721
Elvis! Elvis! Come out and play.

123
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:44,141
Hey, baby. What do you say?
Me and you, Vegas?

<i># Triangles were fallin'</i>

126
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,949
Bollocks!

127
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:25,474
Boo!

128
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,767
Rebecca?

129
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:28,978
Rebecca?

130
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,021
Rebecca?

131
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,440
Rebecca! Rebecca!

132
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,151
Got you!

133
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,321
- You buttsmear.
- What'd I tell you?

134
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:42,950
Don't say "buttsmear".
It's not becoming. Say...

135
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,287
"asshole" or "dickwad".

136
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,913
- Trade you.
- What?

137
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:50,958
I'll sneak you some food
for that dangerball you found.

138
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,128
I don't know. You know how to work it?

139
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:57,089
If you don't... you're steak tartare.

140
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:01,218
All right.

141
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:03,846
First... go get me my food.

142
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,318
Happy birthday.

143
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,924
I knew you couldn't resist me.

144
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:47,264
Snip, snip.

145
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,392
Don't come any closer.

146
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,064
You gotta stay there... and watch.

147
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,152
<i># Blow me away, see if I</i>...

148
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:07,451

<i># Wish you were here, see how I feel</i>

152
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:26,762
OK. You can come a little bit closer.

153
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,227
But you can't touch.

154
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,947
Hi.

155
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:51,203
- Lose the scissors.
- Shit.

156
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,508
Water and Power! Hands in the air!

157
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:13,475
- Over here! Over here!
- Get the typewriters!

158
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,770
Confirmed.
They've been siphoning water.

159
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:22,026
Well, keep goin'.
We're just gettin' to the good stuff.

160
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,158
Ooh, yeah.

161
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,872
OK.

162
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,930
Drop something?

163
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,682
Ah, shit.

164
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,554
Rebecca! Help! Rebecca!

165
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,348
Sam!

166
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,142
No! No!

167
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,107
No!

168
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,611
Richard!

169
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,927
Come on!

170
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:14,430
Work! Shit!

171
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,852
We got her!

172
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:27,484
You've been stealing water. Not smart.

173
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:32,364
We could have a lot of fun with this one.

174
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,868
Well, well.

175
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,538
Don't you know
you shouldn't own animals?

176
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,921
There's a water shortage.

177
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,052
There's your water.

178
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,480
Oi, you.

179
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,150
Look at me when I'm talkin' to ya.

180
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,744
That cut looks painful.

181
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,288
I like pain.

182
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:25,835
And what else do you like?

183
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,631
Hot oil.

184
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,800
Vacuum attachments.

185
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:36,679
Yup.

186
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:42,518
Hey... which of you gorgeous guys
would like an oil change, hm?

187
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,314
Don't be stupid. She's gonna bite it off.

188
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:55,990
The moment I feel teeth, you feel lead.

189
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:04,081
Well? What are you waitin' for?

190
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,003
I'm gonna need a microscope
and tweezers. It's like...

191
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:17,887
You know, you're gonna have to stop this.
You're really gettin' me hot.

192
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,894
Freeze!

193
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,521
What?

194
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,937
She's all yours, sir.

195
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,154
Just how many of my men did you kill?

196
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:23,118
Eight, sir.

197
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,915
Eight, eight, the burning hate.

198
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:33,045
Between Sunday and Monday
hangs a day so dark it will devastate.

199
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:38,425
Excuse me.

200
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:47,852
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

201
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,898
Look, you wanna torture me,

202
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:55,776
spank me, lick me - do it.

203
00:21:56,485 --> 00:22:00,573
But if this poetry shit continues,
just shoot me now, please.

204
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:06,287
What, and waste all that talent?

205
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:12,668
I'm offering you the chance of a lifetime.
The honour of working for me.

206
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,714
Not interested.

207
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:20,801
Not yet.

208
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,184
Put her to work.

209
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,896
Dig or die!

210
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,981
You people are pathetic!

211
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:39,904
These water pipes should
have been dug yesterday!

212
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:43,240
Just stand still.
Hey, this punk's got a knife!

213
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:47,077
Thought you could use it, huh?

214
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:57,171
Enjoying yourself?

215
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,472
Hey, what time is it?
I don't wanna miss <i>Baywatch</i>.

216
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:24,031
Hey, Jet. How's the jet, Jet?

217
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,786
I asked you a question!

218
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,998
There are stress cracks
in the turbine blades,

219
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:36,669
and the manifold pressure
sensor's leaking like a sieve.

220
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:41,131
I'm doing a full teardown. I'll have
her back together by Wednesday.

221
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:45,386
You'll have it back together by morning.
I don't care if you have to work all night.

222
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:49,765
That is, of course, unless...
you wanna make me change my mind.

223
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:54,436
I'll have it fixed by morning.

224
00:23:58,858 --> 00:24:02,361
<i>Failure to recycle</i>

Wait a minute! Where are you goin'?
What is your problem?

234
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:09,178
I have gone out of my way
to be nice to you!

235
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,265
If it wasn't for me, you would
just be another whore around here.

236
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,684
Now, all I'm asking for

237
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:18,062
is just a little bit in return.

238
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,899
Quit pickin' on my girlfriend.

239
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:32,952
Shit!

240
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:34,995
God, that is...

241
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,581
Thanks. It worked.

242
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,627
What worked?

243
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:58,018

00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,417

- Know the security code to this thing?
- Yeah.

260
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:24,874
Good. Then get me outta here.

00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,128
<i>Go. Do it. Get cranking</i>.

262
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:34,758
They're hijacking a tank.
Sir, if you want my opinion...

263
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:36,927
No, I don't.

264
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,680
<i>Places to wreck, people to do</i>.

265
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:44,435
This... this tank, it... it... isn't...

266
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,062
Isn't? Isn't?

267
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:49,190
- Isn't...
- What?

268
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:54,528
Just one little adjective. We'll have a
whole sentence here. The tank isn't glad.

269
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:56,697
Sad. Mad.

270
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:00,451
Lonely.

271
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,746
It isn't op... operational.

272
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:08,834
- How do I know you're not lyin'?
- Because if I was lying,

273
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,004
your lungs'd be full of cyanide gas.

274
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,340
Cool. So we get a new tank.

275
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:20,304
Wait. Wait! Look, nobody gets
out of here without a clearance.

276
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:25,309
We're all prisoners here.
And if they catch you...

277
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:30,105
<i>Then - don't tell me - they'll take away</i>
<i>my TVprivileges? I'll live with it</i>.

278
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:36,654
My, my. She'll be fun to break.

279
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:48,749
How's your lover?

280
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:52,586
I wouldn't get too attached.

281
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,381
She's not gonna be around much longer.

282
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:04,598
I bet you just can't wait to take
this baby for a test drive, huh?

283
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,851
That's too bad,

284
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:09,979
cos you just lost your flying privileges.

285
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:13,649
And... the whole hangar is off limits, too.

286
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,736
You happy?

287
00:30:43,095 --> 00:30:45,306
Miss me?

288
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,726
- What are you doing?
- I was thinkin' about leavin' this place.

289
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:51,896
It's been swell,
but the swelling's gone down.

290
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,567
What do you reckon?
We go to New York, see <i>Cats</i>.

291
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,279
You don't understand.

292
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:05,993
The better you behave,
the more they leave you alone.

293
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:10,706
And... the more they leave you alone,
the better off you are.

294
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,125
Well, that's a bore!

295
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:17,546
There's nothin' to be scared of.

296
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:22,301
You just gotta think about it like...
the first time you got laid.

297
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:26,722
You just gotta go:
"Daddy, are you sure this is right?"

298
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,601
- You're sick.
- How come you do that?

299
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:33,562
How come you always cover
your mouth when you smile?

300
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:36,148
You got bad teeth or somethin'?

301
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,944
- I don't know.
- Come on.

302
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:43,489
What do you say we bolt?

303
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:47,993
I'm really startin' to like it here.

304
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,455
People are nice, food's great,
and I love my job.

305
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:55,042
I can see why you wanna hang around!

306
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,355
Morning.

307
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:28,450
It's really hard for me...

308
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,662
to play with myself in this thing.

309
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:35,416
That's a shame.

310
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:42,173
Look, you want to play, I'll play.
And I'll win.

311
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:46,927
No. Not if it's Monopoly,
cos I really kick ass at that game.

312
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:50,848
But... I get to be the shoe.

313
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,644
I'm going to ask you just one more time.

314
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:59,356
Do you want to work
for Water and Power?

315
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:03,819
Yeah! That sounds groovy.

316
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:07,114
Do I get to wear
a cute little outfit like yours?

317
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,758
The pipe.

318
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:28,344
You're gonna really love this one.

319
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,515
It goes down 40 metres.

320
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:40,064
Gets smaller and smaller
the deeper you go.

321
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,233
Sounds wicked.

322
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:46,070
Can I go first?

323
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,538
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

324
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,499
Drop her!

325
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:16,475
Bye.

326
00:34:25,192 --> 00:34:26,610
No!

327
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:28,988
- Rebecca! Rebecca!
- No!

328
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,787
Rebecca!

329
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:38,998
Help!

330
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,792
Rebecca!

331
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:13,282
Full metal. They didn't have
a chance to squeeze off a round.

332
00:35:14,158 --> 00:35:16,702
Another outpost lost to those Rippers.

333
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,580
At this rate, we'll lose <i>all</i> our water.

334
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:23,584
Rippers must have come up
from some underground sub-gate.

335
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:28,255
Well then, I know just
the young lady to help us find it.

336
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:31,258
Absolutely, sir.

337
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:53,280
Well, I'm so glad
you see things my way now.

338
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:56,283
You know what I see?

339
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:01,372
No. What?

340
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,836
This... big... honkin' booger,

341
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:09,380
hangin' outta your left nostril.

342
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:16,136
If I was you,
I'd use this finger to pick it out.

343
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:27,565
I win.

344
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:36,073
Yeah. Lucky you.

345
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:41,537
And just wait till you see
what you've won.

346
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:04,476
Excuse me.

347
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,104
Relax. It's only a locator.

348
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:10,441
This is your pulse.

349
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,028
Now I'll always be close to your heart.

350
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:19,867
Your job is to penetrate
this sub-gate we found,

351
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:23,412
which could be the entrance
to the Rippers' base.

352
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:28,501
Most of these are booby-trapped,
so if we hear a loud bang... sorry.

353
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,255
If not, congratulations.
You just found the Rippers' hideout.

354
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,591
Either way, I win.

355
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:40,679
Like a piece of cheese
at the end of a fishing hook.

356
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,848
- That's you.
- Ready?

357
00:37:43,724 --> 00:37:44,850
Move!

358
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:15,005
Condor Control, Condor 05.
I'm detecting Ripper activity...

359
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,710
Oh, my God!

360
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,883
That's what you get for messin' with me.

361
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,392
Mine.

362
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:55,189
Well, whaddaya know?

363
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:58,609
Am I close to your heart now, Kesslee?

364
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:01,195
What happened to the rest of ya?

365
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:03,948
Butthead.

366
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:09,578
Cool!

367
00:40:10,996 --> 00:40:12,289
Shit!

368
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,092
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

369
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:26,887
- I thought the Rippers got you.
- Hell, no.

370
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:31,308
Come on, let's go.

371
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:34,895
I ain't goin' back there.
You're gonna have to kill me first.

372
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,064
No... I'm not.

373
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:44,280
Cos I'm not gonna go back there either.

374
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,492
We're free.

375
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:51,745
Oh, no.

376
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:55,791
We'd better go before they come back
for us. You take the tank.

377
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:00,629
Are you sure?

378
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,850
Go! Go!

379
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,855

Stop!

383
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:28,699
No! Rebecca, come on!

384
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:32,536
Rebecca, turn the engine off!

385
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:36,373
Kill the engine!

386
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,794
You're crazy!

387
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:53,516
Are you OK?

388
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:02,483
Sorry about the bonker on the head.
I think I need to go practise some more.

389
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:03,859
- No!
- Yes!

390
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:06,028
Take that! And that!

391
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:15,120
You didn't have to
rough me up so bad, Becky.

392
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,292
Look! No hands!

393
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,162
You could do that for a living.

394
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:09,884
Your face has been gutted,
Mr Kesslee, sir.

395
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:14,972
To be honest, your chances of seeing
are as likely as your arm growing back.

396
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:18,017
However, I can make you comfortable.

397
00:43:18,142 --> 00:43:19,768
No!

398
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,896
No painkillers.

399
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:25,316
Do I make myself clear, Doctor?

400
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:28,944
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

401
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:32,781
Now... what is the prognosis?

402
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:36,785
- Not good, sir.
- Not good.

403
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,580
Excuse me.

404
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:44,460
- Sir, this is Mr Che'tsai.
- What? What?

405
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:46,629
Che'tsai.

406
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:50,841
He specialises in cybergenic
reconstructive surgery.

407
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:54,428
Go ahead, sir.

408
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,850

Doctor, come here.

413
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:19,954
You see the glass half-empty.

414
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,665
I prefer to see it half-full.

415
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:26,377
- Don't you agree, Sergeant?
- I don't understand.

416
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:34,677
We can't be in here. We're trespassing.
What if somebody catches us?

417
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:37,680
Jet, there she blows, matey!

418
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:46,105
Put it down. It's not funny.

419
00:44:57,449 --> 00:44:59,910
What is it?

420
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:03,205
Raise your hands to the sky gods!

421
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,584
The rains are coming.

422
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:10,296
But it hasn't rained since the comet.

423
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:13,716
I need metal to complete my ark.
I'll be taking your tank.

424
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,926
No, see, you won't be taking the tank.

425
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:19,972
The Rippers are waiting.
I must save them from the floods.

426
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,934
Tell me the security code.

427
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:29,773
All right, listen, Rain Lady.

428
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:32,151
Where'd you get this?

429
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,361
- I made it.
<i>- Liar</i>.

430
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:36,071
- She's lying.
- How do <i>you</i> know?

431
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:38,991
It's something I designed -
a spectrum analyser

432
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:42,494
which recognises
voice-pattern stress modulations.

433
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,789
- It detects lies.
- But I only speak the truth.

434
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:48,250
<i>- Liar</i>.
- All right...

435
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:52,254
I... I caught it in my fishpond... on a stick.

436
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:55,382
<i>- Liar</i>.
- All right, all right, all right.

437
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:59,720
They were selling a girl's stuff after
they had taken her prisoner. I bought it.

438
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:03,390
- It was sad, really.
- What'd they do with the girl?

439
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:06,644
First tell me what
Water and Power want with her.

440
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,939
We're not Water and Power.
We're escaped prisoners.

441
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:15,069
In that case... It was terrible. They put
her to work in town at Liquid Silver.

442
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:19,156
Come on, Jet. We gotta go get her.
To the Bat Tank!

443
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:22,826
Wait! Wait! We can't go into town
with those Water and Power vehicles.

444
00:46:23,786 --> 00:46:26,956
You can fix them up here in my garage.

445
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:57,004
Yes!

446
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:09,850
Hey, Jet.

447
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:12,144
Nice work.

448
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:23,447
They took the bait, sir, and they're
on their way to Liquid Silver for the girl.

449
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:28,160
- Make sure I get the girl first, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,792
I'm outta here.

451
00:49:03,445 --> 00:49:06,115
What you got there, little boy?

452
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,617
No, I don't need
none of that today, thank you.

453
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:13,831
- Nice hats.
- Do you know what kind of place this is?

454
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:16,500
Yeah. Come on.
Let's split up and find Sam.

455
00:49:18,794 --> 00:49:21,714

For real.

465
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:07,009
Introduce him to Sam.

466
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:09,053
She's just a girl.

467
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,222
Not for long.

468
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:17,811
<i>- Dancers, welcome to Liquid Silver</i>.

<i>If you have followed instructions</i>
<i>properly, you should appear as so</i>.

483

Lock up your sons.

484
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:36,640
Now, you stop this
childish behaviour this instant.

485
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:40,477
Do you want me to tell your mother
how naughty you've been? Do you?

486
00:51:40,603 --> 00:51:43,439
Don't take my silver.
It's all the money I've got.

487
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:46,192
Silver. I'll have that.

488
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,580
The Clapper. That's what
you get for being a perv.

489
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,626
Hey! You're gonna get fired,
you keep treatin' the guests like that.

490
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:05,794
Rebecca!

491
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:19,892
There she is! And the little girl. Get them!

493
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:26,106
Kill her. Kill them both.

494
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:29,318
Not a good idea.

495
00:52:31,362 --> 00:52:35,241
Now... everybody drop your guns,

496
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:38,827
or I scrape off all her make-up.

497
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:43,332
This might take me a really long time.

498
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:49,046
Sam! Is this the lady who put you
in a room with that scumbag?

499
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:52,049
- Yeah.
- A ten-year-old girl.

500
00:52:52,174 --> 00:52:54,176
She has to learn sometime.

501
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:57,137
Look, you got two choices.

502
00:52:57,263 --> 00:53:00,057
Either I improve that lovely hairdo,

503

Rebecca!

- Sam!
- You let her go!

552
00:56:25,763 --> 00:56:27,264
No!

553
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,606
Sam!

00:56:51,705 --> 00:56:55,668
Don't worry. Your friends'll
be along shortly to save you,

555
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,170
my little princess.

556
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:11,851
The Rippers? Are you kidding?
You don't know what they're like.

557
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:15,020
Are you out of your mind?
You haven't seen these things.

558
00:57:15,187 --> 00:57:19,149
They're not human. They're
demons from hell. I'm telling you.

559
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:23,863
Look, if we're gonna rescue Sam, we're
gonna need an army. They're an army.

560
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:24,864
Yeah, but...

561
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,700
Rebecca, we've been
combing the desert all night.

562
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:29,827
We'll never find the Rippers' sub-gate.

563
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:34,331
Look, Rain Lady said the Rippers'
sub-gate was around here somewhere.

564
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:36,750
Near two rocks.

565
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:39,128
I can't believe we're doing this.

566
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:44,216
Rebecca? Rebecca?

567
00:57:44,383 --> 00:57:45,801
Rebecca!

568
00:57:45,968 --> 00:57:47,970
Where are you?

569
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,681
What's going on? Rebecca!

570
00:57:52,474 --> 00:57:54,518
Rebecca!

571
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:57,021
Rebecca!

572
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:13,787
- Jet, what took you so long?
- Rebecca.

573
00:58:16,248 --> 00:58:18,167
What?

574
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:22,588
What?

575
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,761
See hell, go to hell.

576
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,686
Oh, my God. It's the Elephant Man!

577
00:58:40,981 --> 00:58:45,194
Hey, Quasimodo guy! We're hungry
in here. How 'bout some food?

578
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:48,697
Now you've done it!

579
00:59:15,891 --> 00:59:19,270
So, like,

580
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:21,647
what are your names?

581
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:30,614
- Gimme the gas.
- And, like, what are you doing here?

582
00:59:30,781 --> 00:59:34,577
Is it true what they say
about guys with big shoes?

583
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,706
- Yeah.
- He asked you a question. Answer it!

584
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:41,917
Hey, I have two words for you.

585
00:59:42,084 --> 00:59:44,086
Brush your teeth!

586
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:49,466
They're spies. They got
Water and Power logos all over.

587
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:52,428
Yeah, I was thinking that,
but then I was also thinking

588
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:55,014
that if they are Water and Power...

589
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:56,348
No, no, no, no!

590
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,226
Why would they come here advertisin' it?

591
00:59:59,393 --> 01:00:04,732
Check it out. Tattoos.
Wonder where else they got 'em.

592
01:00:04,857 --> 01:00:08,444
I don't think those are tattoos.
Who would want some alphabet soup?

593
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:14,450
I'd rather have a dragon or somethin'
more Aquarian-related, you dig?

594
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:17,620
- They're prisoner stamps.
- Prison, my ass.

595
01:00:17,786 --> 01:00:19,914
That's exactly what they want us to think.

596
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:23,167
Or, better yet, that isn't
what they want us to think.

597
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:26,921
That way we'll think
what they think we might think,

598
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:29,757
- but actually...
- Booga.

599
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,884
Try not to speak.

600
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:37,264
- How much did they pay you to spy?
- Two dollars and 15 cents.

601
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:39,433
Shut up!

602
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:43,771
You should go easy on the truth serum.
It might send 'em off.

603
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:50,152
That could be to our advantage.

604
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:53,822
Good. I'm tired of asking 'em
questions anyway. I say we kill 'em.

605
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:57,326
- I say we hump 'em.
- I say we get crumpets and tea.

606
01:00:57,451 --> 01:01:01,038
Tasty. Crumpets and tea. All in favour
of crumpets and tea say aye.

607
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:04,542
- Aye.
- Ain't gonna be no crumpets and tea!

608
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,919
We're gonna take 'em
outside and waste 'em.

609
01:01:07,086 --> 01:01:09,797
I think they're nice. I say we let 'em go.

610
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:12,842
Let 'em go? They're spies!
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.

611
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:17,555
Wait! Now, I don't remember
anybody puttin' you in charge, T-Saint.

612
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:21,517
Yeah. He's right.
We're a committee now. We'll vote on it.

613
01:01:21,684 --> 01:01:25,813
Dig. All in favour of killing 'em,
raise your tail.

614
01:01:29,859 --> 01:01:32,945
And all those in favour of not killing 'em...

615
01:01:35,948 --> 01:01:38,826
- Gentlemen, it's a tie.
- Coin-toss time.

616
01:01:39,702 --> 01:01:41,745
This is pathetic.

617
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:46,208
No cheating. Ready? One, two, three.

618
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,544
Got you.

619
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:51,797
- Hi.
- Hi.

620
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:59,221
Do you suppose me and Jet
could go to the bathroom?

621
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:03,726
Totally negatory.

622
01:02:10,608 --> 01:02:13,235
- Hi.
- Hi.

623
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:18,490
You know, me and Jet
could make it worth your while.

624
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:21,493
Put a little smile on that kangaroo face.

625
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:34,632
You got baseball cards?

626
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:40,262
No, but I know where
I could get you some.

627
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:42,473
She does.

628
01:02:43,224 --> 01:02:46,769
- Totally negatory.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

629
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:50,773
Come on. You don't wanna be
like those other manimals in there.

630
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,816
We're not manimals.

631
01:02:52,983 --> 01:02:55,194
What are you?

632
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:58,030
The army wanted to build
the ultimate soldier,

633
01:02:58,197 --> 01:03:01,867
so they messed with kangaroo NDA and...

634
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:04,453
You mean DNA.

635
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,205
Yeah.

636
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:09,083
And they created us.

637
01:03:10,292 --> 01:03:15,089
And then the war ended
and they told Johnny to poison us.

638
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:18,050
- Johnny Prophet?
- Yeah.

639
01:03:18,175 --> 01:03:22,304
- Why?
- Because he was the one that made us.

640
01:03:24,515 --> 01:03:28,519
But then he didn't do it because
he decided that he liked us too much.

641
01:03:28,644 --> 01:03:34,483
I have this great idea. You, me and Jet
go for a visit with Johnny Prophet.

642
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:37,987
When he gets back, yeah. Well... maybe.

643
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:40,197
Where did he go?

644
01:03:40,364 --> 01:03:43,534
To... New Zealand, for a little while,

645
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:48,789
to help some scientist guy who was
makin' sea water so you could drink it.

646
01:03:48,914 --> 01:03:51,959
Does she need to know that?
Do they need to know that?

647
01:03:52,084 --> 01:03:54,128
Get your ass outta here!

648
01:03:59,842 --> 01:04:04,346
<i>- Go ahead, WP2. We have</i>...
- Hey, you guys, hey!

649
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:07,516
- Water and Power's gettin' a shipment.
- What kind of shipment?

650
01:04:07,683 --> 01:04:10,686
- I don't know. It's comin' from Red Sands.
- When?

651
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:11,979
Tonight.

652
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:15,065
- What if it's an arms shipment?
- It's a trap.

653
01:04:15,191 --> 01:04:18,694
What if they want us to think
it's a trap but it's really not?

654
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:22,323
That way, when we get there,
it could still be one.

655
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:26,410
- Or, better yet, what if...
- Booga.

656
01:04:26,535 --> 01:04:30,164
Why don't you make yourself useful
and go and choke on somethin'?

657
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:32,374
That's cold, man.

658
01:04:35,794 --> 01:04:40,633
OK. We're gonna give you chicks
a chance to prove yourself.

659
01:04:40,758 --> 01:04:43,219
Call it an initiation.

660
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,889
You fail, you die.

661
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:49,725
Yeah, but first you gotta strip.

662
01:04:51,644 --> 01:04:54,230
- That's not in the plan.
- Why not?

663
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:09,203
Hold on, cats. All right.

664
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:16,585
All you have to do is confirm
the shipment. Copacetic.

665
01:05:16,836 --> 01:05:22,174
You're gonna use this, but you have to be
really careful, because I designed it with...

666
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:25,928
I especially built it
with a visual-send processor.

667
01:05:26,053 --> 01:05:30,599
It's a little invention - that I invented
myself, I might add, actually.

668
01:05:30,724 --> 01:05:33,143
- Smile.
- And these are so you can hear us.

669
01:05:33,269 --> 01:05:35,479
This one's for you.

670
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:38,899
And this one... I made especially for you.

671
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:44,113
Let me help you put it on cos it's kinda
tricky. I'm sorry. How clumsy of me.

672
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:47,032
- Get off!
- It was hard to clip on.

673
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,830
OK. So, we can hear <i>you,</i>
but how are you gonna hear us?

674
01:05:52,997 --> 01:05:56,709
Just speak facin' west.
We'll hear you all right.

675
01:05:57,209 --> 01:06:01,839
The code will be: "On the Road". Yeah.

676
01:06:01,964 --> 01:06:04,341
He's Jack Kerouac incarnate.

677
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:09,346
We're all reincarnated. That means you're
not really dead or you think you're dead...

678
01:06:09,513 --> 01:06:12,600
- Who'd you used to be?
- A cop.

679
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:14,852
Figures.

680
01:06:16,854 --> 01:06:22,193
I used to be Ted Smith, assistant manager
at Chief Auto Parts in Cincinnati, Ohio.

681
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:24,361
- Fascinating.
- Thank you.

682
01:06:24,486 --> 01:06:27,323
I was a dog,
but because I was really good

683
01:06:27,448 --> 01:06:30,367
they moved me up to human-being status.

684
01:06:32,036 --> 01:06:34,413
Sort of.

685
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:09,073
Strike.

686
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,962
North. Wait. South... west.

687
01:07:23,128 --> 01:07:25,965
Mr Kerouac, I am sending you an image.

688
01:07:32,054 --> 01:07:36,141
- Here it comes.
<i>- This is the south side of the warehouse</i>.

689
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,313
That's gotta be it. Let's move.

690
01:07:42,439 --> 01:07:45,109
All I see is a coupla workers
unloadin' some crates.

691
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:49,446
That could be toilet paper. I don't see
no Water and Power vehicles out there.

692
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:52,825
Tell you the truth, I don't see jack shit.
We need more proof.

693
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:55,411
Yeah. I'll give you more proof.

694
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:59,623
<i>- I got your proof</i>.
- There it is.

695
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:02,751
- Oh, my.
- Tasty.

696
01:08:08,382 --> 01:08:10,217
Damn it.

697
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:14,805
We gotta get in closer if we're gonna
take pictures of those weapons.

698
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,683
What are you doing?
Those guys'll mangle you.

699
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:21,729
Jet... they're men.

700
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:25,858
Move it or lose it.

701
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,744
Becca. What's this for?

702
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,418
- Work with me, girl.
- What do you mean, work with you?

703
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:46,795
What are you doing?

704
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:50,090
Oh, fabulous.

705
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:52,843
I have died and gone
to hard-body heaven.

706
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:56,305
Sheneequa, don't dally.

707
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,350
You are giving me realness.

708
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:07,274
Delfrieda, darling. Be a good little girl and
let's get set up. Over there by the crates.

709
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:10,361
- Take off your shirt.
- What are you doing here?

710
01:09:10,486 --> 01:09:14,698
- This is a restricted area.
- I know you're not talking to me like this.

711
01:09:14,823 --> 01:09:17,451
- Obviously you didn't get the memo.
- What memo?

712
01:09:17,576 --> 01:09:22,373
Darling, we are doing
a "Men of Water and Power" calendar.

713
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,963
And I think you would be
the perfect supermodel cover.

714
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,385
You mean we get to be calendar guys?
Can I be December?

715
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:37,680
Baby, you can be any month you want.

716
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:41,225
LeSean, have we left
ourselves in our purse?

717
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,855
Shoot the men near the crates.
It's more... manly.

718
01:09:47,064 --> 01:09:49,358
Quickly.

719
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:51,735
Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on.

720
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:53,821
All right. Here we go.

721
01:09:53,946 --> 01:09:59,118
Oh, my goodness. You are
so beautiful you're making me sick.

722
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,828
Smile for me.

723
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:06,250
Yes! OK.

724
01:10:10,713 --> 01:10:13,257
- What's this?
- I don't know.

725
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:15,759
Let me see... Open your shirt.
Quick, quick!

726
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:18,345
All right, now. Smile.
Let me see those teeth.

727
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,931
OK. Yes, yes. Yes, I like that.

728
01:10:23,267 --> 01:10:26,770
Those are definitely weapons
in those crates. We better move.

729
01:10:26,896 --> 01:10:30,482
No way. The whole thing is
so convenient, man. If they wanna be

730
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:33,319
<i>down with us,</i>
<i>tell 'em to hijack the shipment</i>.

731
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:37,114
<i>- If they pull it off, we'll think about it</i>.
- I'll have the goods in an hour.

732
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:39,283
Asshole!

733
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:45,456
The glamour has left the building.

734
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:49,585
There is no magic, there is no sparkle,
there is no <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.

735
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,379
- Come, Jetina.
- Hold your chest. Come on.

736
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:55,132
Yes, that's brilliant. That's great.

737
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:59,094
- Jetina, come.
- Oh, God. That's great!

738
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:04,767
- You're so brilliant! You're a supermodel!
- The super has left the model, girl.

739
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:07,061
- Come on!
- When's the calendar comin' out?

740
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:37,258
Let's go!

741
01:11:38,008 --> 01:11:40,052
Turbo booster!

742
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:46,267
What the hell...?

743
01:11:54,733 --> 01:11:56,986
Suck on this, dirtbag!

744
01:11:57,987 --> 01:12:00,739
And keep your ass outta the fast lane!

745
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:06,120
Damn!

746
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:09,290
Jet, what are you wearing tonight?

747
01:12:09,456 --> 01:12:13,502
<i>Jetness. Remember me?</i>
<i>Hijacking shipment. Me, you</i>.

748
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:14,962
Jet! Hello!

749
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:19,800
Shit! I've got a malfunction.

750
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,344
Fix it fast and get
your narrow butt over here.

751
01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:24,930
I wouldn't want you to miss all this fun.

752
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:33,355
Do you mind?
I'm tryin' to have a little lunch.

753
01:12:36,775 --> 01:12:38,777
Now you're workin' my tits.

754
01:12:39,987 --> 01:12:42,531
You guys can't shoot worth a shit!

755
01:12:44,074 --> 01:12:45,993
Hail!

756
01:13:10,643 --> 01:13:12,686
Where is she?

757
01:13:16,065 --> 01:13:18,359
Road kill.

758
01:13:19,818 --> 01:13:21,862
I'm too young for this shit.

759
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:33,582
Well, I guess we got rid of her, huh?

760
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,710
Jack... Jack!

761
01:13:37,336 --> 01:13:38,963
Hi!

762
01:13:41,006 --> 01:13:44,718
- Feeling a little inadequate?
- Get outta here!

763
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:16,333
Hey, girl. Glad you could join me.
I'm in the semi, and I got the goods.

764
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,295
Rebecca! Can you hear me?

765
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,798
There's a big cliff coming up on you.
Now hit the brakes.

766
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:28,721
<i>- Hit the brakes!</i>
- Brakes aren't working, girl! Plan B!

767
01:14:28,846 --> 01:14:31,557
- Get outta there! Quick! Jump!
- Jet!

768
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:14,183
Rebecca!

769
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:17,144
Come on!

770
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,488
I came as fast as I could. I know
you probably didn't need help,

771
01:15:27,655 --> 01:15:30,074
but I got here as fast as I could.

772
01:15:31,325 --> 01:15:34,161
I had it all under control, Booga.

773
01:15:35,412 --> 01:15:39,708
- That squash is really good.
- A toast... to our newest members.

774
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:44,004
May their energies enhance
the spirit of our circle.

775
01:15:48,884 --> 01:15:51,053
Great. Now let's check out the weapons.

776
01:15:51,178 --> 01:15:54,265
After the ceremony
the weapons'll be disposed of.

777
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,642
Why? After all that!

778
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:00,771
We don't use guns.

779
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,274
You don't use guns.

780
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,944
Prophet taught us to fight
without the corruption of guns.

781
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:09,321
Let us all hold hands.

782
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:13,242
Please.

783
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:21,458
I'd like to recite a poem that I've written.

784
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:34,763
Laugh, you butterfly

785
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:37,391
That dances in the mud

786
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,437
Laugh, you piece of dental floss

787
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:44,940
You burn, me toast.

788
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:57,703
Laugh, you pig that flies in the sky

789
01:16:57,828 --> 01:17:01,457
With rainbow twinky fluid

790
01:17:01,624 --> 01:17:06,754
And three litres of high-octane petrol.

791
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:17,348
Bravo.

792
01:17:19,141 --> 01:17:20,809
Bravo.

793
01:17:20,935 --> 01:17:22,770
Thank you.

794
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:26,315
Now... let's pray.

795
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:01,183
Come on, Jet.

796
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:15,531
- What are you doing?
- We're praying to the spirit of freedom.

797
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:19,743
- Prophet taught us religion.
- Hallelujah!

798
01:18:21,161 --> 01:18:22,997
- Come on.
- I can't.

799
01:18:23,163 --> 01:18:25,165
It's OK. I have condoms.

800
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,965
Hit it, Jet!

801
01:18:36,218 --> 01:18:38,679
Booga, where did you learn to dance?

802
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:59,200
<i># Now where'd it go?</i>

803
01:18:59,825 --> 01:19:03,162
<i># Aurora</i>

804
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:10,002
Oh, wow.

805
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:14,381
It's one of Johnny Prophet's dreams.

806
01:19:15,758 --> 01:19:18,469
See how the people are all free,

807
01:19:18,594 --> 01:19:22,681
and the water just
comes down from the sky

808
01:19:22,806 --> 01:19:25,267
and it don't cost nothin'.

809
01:19:26,685 --> 01:19:29,897
With flowers and rainbows.

810
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:35,736
It's beautiful.

811
01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:46,539
This is just like Christmas.

812
01:19:46,664 --> 01:19:50,543
I love opening things, especially
when you don't know what's inside.

813
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:54,213
I remember the first Christmas
I got to open something.

814
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:58,467
It was a book. I didn't know what the title
was cos the cover was ripped off,

815
01:19:58,592 --> 01:20:02,221
but it had these really cool pictures of...

816
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:05,432
- Booga.
- OK, OK. I'm done.

817
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:07,977
Let's get this one. Two... three!

818
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:15,025
- It's dirt.
- This is bullshit.

819
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,486
- We've been had.
- Good job.

820
01:20:17,653 --> 01:20:20,698
Come on. Help me open
this one over here.

821
01:20:20,865 --> 01:20:22,867
One... two... three.

822
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,789
Jesus Christ!

823
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,918
Johnny Prophet.

824
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:35,921
Motherfuckin' Kesslee killed Prophet!

825
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:03,866
OK, guys. Here's the plan.

826
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:09,205
Water and Power has mines
all the way from here to here.

827
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,832
There's no way through 'em.

828
01:21:11,999 --> 01:21:14,293
- How about we go over 'em?
- That's great.

829
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:17,004
How you plannin' on
sneakin' over the top? Fly?

830
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:19,089
Yep. We've got the stolen flier.

831
01:21:19,256 --> 01:21:23,719
All we have to do is paint it
back the way it was and... pow!

832
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:27,515
- And when they ask for a security code?
- Yeah. Then what?

833
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:32,353
Well, maybe we could wait till
another flier does a routine scout,

834
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,772
we capture his ID code and we're in.

835
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:37,816
Brilliant. OK. I will meet you there.

836
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,237
Wait. What do you mean, meet us there?

837
01:21:41,737 --> 01:21:44,448
- I'm not goin' in without my tank.
- Let's go.

838
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:50,496
We're listenin' to her now? I thought
we were a committee. We gotta vote.

839
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:53,123
Everybody for that pathetic plan,
raise your paw.

840
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,292
Majority. Let's go.

841
01:21:58,462 --> 01:22:00,339
Committee!

842
01:22:23,153 --> 01:22:25,489
<i>Condor to 04, respond when airborne</i>.

843
01:22:25,614 --> 01:22:27,867
OK. OK, I've got us an ID card.

844
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:30,035
You are just too cool.

845
01:22:30,202 --> 01:22:33,539
All right. Now, try to sound relaxed
and, whatever you do,

846
01:22:33,664 --> 01:22:37,001
- only repeat what I tell you. Got it?
- Yeah.

847
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:43,174
- Condor Control. This is Condor 04. Over.
- OK.

848
01:22:43,299 --> 01:22:46,969
Condor Control. Condo...
I mean, Condor 4.

849
01:22:47,261 --> 01:22:51,557
<i>- Come in. Over</i>.
- Condor 4, we just sent you out.

850
01:22:51,682 --> 01:22:55,144
You must have a stabiliser
in your left modifier, OK? Go ahead.

851
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:58,647
Must be a stabiliser in the left...
in the modifier.

852
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:01,984
Condor 4, why aren't you using
your assigned frequency?

853
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:04,653
- Must be a short haircut.
- No!

854
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:07,114
Short circuit.

855
01:23:10,743 --> 01:23:13,037
<i># Because she's quick to flip</i>
<i>and empty out the clip</i>

856
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:15,331
<i># And make a man understand</i>
<i>where she's comin' from</i>

857
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:17,750
<i># Her hard core's connected</i>
<i>to the base of her fate</i>

858
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:20,711
<i># She just breaks</i>
<i>and brings drama to the situation</i>

859
01:23:20,836 --> 01:23:24,048
<i># Ejaculation, a hot projectile</i>

860
01:23:24,215 --> 01:23:25,966
<i># Better recognise</i>
<i>that she comes, she comes</i>

861
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:29,428
<i># She says she had enough of men</i>
<i>and now she's lookin' for payback</i>

862
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:32,056
<i># And there's no way</i>
<i>that you can fade her sun</i>

863
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:35,017
<i># She walks softly</i>
<i>but she carries a big gun</i>

864
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:37,770
- Just repeat what she tells you.
- You're blowing it!

865
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:41,690
- Say again, 04.
- You're blowin' it. Just listen to me, OK?

866
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:43,150
- We're dead.
- We're dead.

867
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,986
Condor 04, you said you're dead?

868
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:49,240
That's it. Turn this boat around
or you're gonna get us killed.

869
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:52,493
- Now! Do it now!
- No! We're going in!

870
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,578
You are gonna listen to me for once!

871
01:23:54,745 --> 01:23:58,123
You're gonna shut your deformed face
and let me do my stuff!

872
01:23:58,249 --> 01:24:00,167
Have you got that?

873
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:02,044
All right.

874
01:24:02,169 --> 01:24:05,589
Home Plate, this is Condor 4.
We have pirate interference.

875
01:24:05,714 --> 01:24:09,176
Obviously a Ripper ploy to confuse you.
Now here's the situation.

876
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,137
This bird has no electrical,
and in about two minutes

877
01:24:12,304 --> 01:24:14,807
we're gonna be kissing gravel,
so listen to me!

878
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:17,226
Get off your butt and clear us for landing

879
01:24:17,393 --> 01:24:21,105
or I'm gonna fly this rocket
right up your socket!

880
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,487
<i>- Roger, 04. You're cleared for Hangar A</i>.
- Cool.

881
01:24:28,612 --> 01:24:31,156
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

882
01:24:40,749 --> 01:24:42,793
About time.

883
01:24:45,212 --> 01:24:46,005
Damn!

884
01:25:29,423 --> 01:25:31,425
Start the water.

885
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:42,978
Shoving a small,
innocent child down the pipe

886
01:25:43,145 --> 01:25:45,856
and then slowly letting her drown.

887
01:25:47,608 --> 01:25:50,069
Is that wrong?

888
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,954
It's all clear.

889
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:02,122
Let's go, daddy-o.

890
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:06,210
- Did you hear that?
- What? I don't hear anything.

891
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:09,547
- Must be 150 of 'em.
- 163.

892
01:26:09,672 --> 01:26:11,507
We're toast.

893
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:14,760
Actually, 164. Definitely.

894
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:18,097
Rebecca! Are you OK?

895
01:26:24,311 --> 01:26:27,189
OK. Come on. Come on.

896
01:26:33,779 --> 01:26:36,490
- Come on.
- Go, go, go, go.

897
01:26:39,577 --> 01:26:41,620
No!

898
01:26:44,915 --> 01:26:49,336
You see that light down there?
Light is not our bag.

899
01:26:49,503 --> 01:26:52,882
Yeah. We're much better in the dark.
Like Count Chocula.

900
01:26:53,048 --> 01:26:55,050
Dracula, fool!

901
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:58,971
Count Chocula's the guy
on the laundry-detergent box.

902
01:26:59,138 --> 01:27:02,474
- If I asked you somethin', I...
- No, he is. He's right.

903
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,268
Shut up!

904
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:07,771
Thank you. Could we just figure out
what we're gonna do, please?

905
01:27:07,897 --> 01:27:10,608
There are power boxes
down at the end of this aisle.

906
01:27:10,733 --> 01:27:13,652
- If only we could get to them.
- Later, cats.

907
01:27:13,819 --> 01:27:15,821
Deetee!

908
01:27:20,242 --> 01:27:24,622
- Sir, we got action!
- Let's get this over with quickly.

909
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:45,643
- We've lost power.
- What the hell happened to the lights?

910
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:56,028
Guard! Watch our back.

911
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:59,323
Oh, no. Deetee?

912
01:28:06,372 --> 01:28:08,832
Hold on, man. Hold on.

913
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:12,044
Deetee!

914
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:14,880
Oh, my God.

915
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:19,927
I'll see you cats at that big jam in the sky.

916
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,642
No... No!

917
01:29:24,617 --> 01:29:25,993
Help.

918
01:29:27,411 --> 01:29:29,830
Rebecca! Help!

919
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:32,750
Hang on! I hear you!

920
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:35,294
I can't breathe.

921
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:39,673
Please! Help me.

922
01:29:44,845 --> 01:29:47,389
I can't breathe.

923
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,434
Please help me.

924
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:57,608
If you're looking for Sam,
she's in the pipe!

925
01:30:02,071 --> 01:30:04,698
What, again? Piece of shit!

926
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:08,369
There's somethin' about you
that's different. I think it...

927
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:12,873
I'll tell you what's different. I've lost
my patience. And you've lost the fight.

928
01:30:21,674 --> 01:30:26,846
I played you.
I played you like an old fiddle.

929
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:31,725
<i>Well, maybe we could wait till</i>
<i>another flier does a routine scout,</i>

930
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:34,937
<i>- we capture his ID code and we're in</i>.
<i>- Brilliant</i>.

931
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:38,691
Jet. She's been workin' for you
this whole time.

932
01:30:38,816 --> 01:30:44,530
No. <i>You</i> were. You're a walking,
talking, living microphone.

933
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:47,366
I had them planted all over your body.

934
01:30:48,784 --> 01:30:51,453
Thank you for serving up the Rippers.

935
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,252
They'll make great
shoe leather for my soldiers.

936
01:31:17,771 --> 01:31:19,982
Need a hand?

937
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:21,358
Come on. Get up.

938
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:24,153
Oh, I'm so pretty.

939
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:28,282
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
your children will be born bruised.

940
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:29,742
Get up!

941
01:31:42,505 --> 01:31:44,673
Marvellous, isn't it?

942
01:31:45,424 --> 01:31:48,511
State of the art. Holographic technology.

943
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:56,393
Know what it means? It means
I can hurt you, but you can't hurt me.

944
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:37,017
I won and you know it.

945
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:38,727
Come on.

946
01:32:39,061 --> 01:32:43,399
Say it, say it. Just say I won.

947
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:46,485
- I won.
- No! No!

948
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:49,405
- Say <i>I</i> won.
- I won.

949
01:32:54,785 --> 01:32:58,455
Say it... and the little girl lives.

950
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:03,752
I'd rather her die than live as your slave.

951
01:33:21,145 --> 01:33:23,314
What took ya so long?

952
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,526
Well, well, well.

953
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:32,865
I win.

954
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:43,334
What's the matter with you? Finish him!

955
01:33:47,963 --> 01:33:50,633
Oh, shit. Don't tell me you're outta ammo.

956
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:55,179
Don't move a muscle.

957
01:34:01,227 --> 01:34:04,063
I hate wastin' good beer for nothin'.

958
01:34:07,024 --> 01:34:08,817
Thirsty?

959
01:34:33,592 --> 01:34:35,678
Screw this, man.

960
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:05,749
Higher! Higher!

961
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:07,918
Come on!

962
01:35:12,715 --> 01:35:14,466
One for the road.

963
01:35:26,478 --> 01:35:29,690
I'm melting! I'm melting!

964
01:35:36,447 --> 01:35:38,574
Is that the best you can do?

965
01:35:42,828 --> 01:35:45,247
Try this close to your heart, asshole.

966
01:36:02,932 --> 01:36:04,975
Did I hurt you yet?

967
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,354
It's not over... over.

968
01:36:08,521 --> 01:36:13,025
It's not over. It's not...
It's not... It's not... It's not...

969
01:36:19,156 --> 01:36:22,326
- Help.
- Hang on! I hear you!

970
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:25,162
Help. Help!

971
01:36:45,516 --> 01:36:47,434
Fuck me.

972
01:36:48,352 --> 01:36:50,771
How many times do I have to tell you?

973
01:36:50,896 --> 01:36:53,607
I don't want to.

974
01:37:04,994 --> 01:37:06,370
Don't move!

975
01:37:06,495 --> 01:37:08,706
Down!

976
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:13,794
See you in the next world.

977
01:37:13,919 --> 01:37:15,921
Atten-hut!

978
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:23,721
General, we have taken out the airfields
and now have control of the bridge.

979
01:37:23,888 --> 01:37:26,182
Awaiting your next command, sir.

980
01:37:28,225 --> 01:37:31,770
I took the bullets outta their guns.
That was smart, huh?

981
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:34,398
Booga, that was very smart.

982
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,665
Whaddaya say we blow this joint?

983

01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:27,284
