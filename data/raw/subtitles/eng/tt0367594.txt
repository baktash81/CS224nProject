1
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,670
This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

2
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,880
...named Charlie Bucket.

3
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,100
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

4
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,850
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

5
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,810
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

6
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,280
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

7
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,820
He just didn't know it yet.

8
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,420
- Evening, Buckets.
- Evening.

9
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,050
Hi, Dad.

10
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,390
Soup's almost ready, darling.

11
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,230
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

12
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,690
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

13
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,690
Charlie...

14
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,610
...I found something I think you'll like.

15
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,120
Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

16
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,330
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

17
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,340
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

18
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,340
It's exactly what I need.

19
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,970
What is it, Charlie?

20
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,520
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

21
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,690
- What piece was it?
- A head for Willy Wonka.

22
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,110
Well, how wonderful.

23
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,320
It's quite a likeness.

24
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,150
You think so?
- Think so?

25
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,910
I know so.

26
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,740
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

27
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,200
- I used to work for him, you know.
- You did?

28
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,910
- I did.
- He did.

29
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
He did.

30
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
I love grapes.

31
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,840
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

32
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,890
Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

33
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,350
But the whole world wanted his candy.

34
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,060
- Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?

35
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,020
We need more Wonka bars...

36
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,030
...and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?

37
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,650
Birds.

38
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,870
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

39
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,200
Now open.

40
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,460
The man was a genius.

41
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,300
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

42
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,130
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

43
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,810
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

44
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,850
- But that's impossible.
- But Willy Wonka did it.

45
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,230
Before long...

46
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,940
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

47
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,200
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

48
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,660
Fifty times as big as any other.

49
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,350
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

50
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,230
Tell him about the Indian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

51
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,060
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

52
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,020
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

53
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,900
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

54
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,700
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

55
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,370
It will have 100 rooms...

56
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,170
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

57
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,630
True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

58
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,550
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

59
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,600
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

60
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,350
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

61
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,440
It is perfect in every way.

62
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,730
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

63
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

64
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,200
I intend to live in it.

65
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,450
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

66
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,290
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

67
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,550
Mmm.

68
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,210
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

69
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,170
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

70
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,050
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

71
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,020
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

72
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,880
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

73
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,430
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

74
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,390
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

75
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

76
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,690
The thievery got so bad...

77
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,020
...that one day, without warning...

78
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,730
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

79
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,740
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

80
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,120
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

81
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,580
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,310
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

83
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,730
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time. "

84
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,610
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever. "

85
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,440
- Now, Pops.
- The factory did close, Charlie.

86
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,620
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

87
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,450
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

88
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,500
- The factory was back in business.
- Did you get your job back?

89
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,790
No.

90
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,790
No one did.

91
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,090
But there must be
people working there.

92
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,800
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

93
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,640
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

94
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,020
No. The gates are always closed.

95
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,850
Exactly.

96
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,520
But then, who's running the machines?

97
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,650
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.

98
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,150
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

99
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,870
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

100
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,960
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

101
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,670
...already packed and addressed.

102
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,260
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

103
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,510
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

104
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,060
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

105
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,190
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

106
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,150
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as
close as any of us is ever going to get.

107
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,530
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time
we let your grandparents get some sleep.

108
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,780
- Good night, Grandpa George.
- Night, Charlie.

109
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,040
- Night-night.
Chair.

110
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,080
Thank you, dear.

111
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,500
Night, Grandpa Joe.

112
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,210
Good night, Grandma Georgina.

113
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,550
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.

114
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,030
- Good night.
Night, Charlie.

115
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,780
Sleep well.

116
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,460
Indeed, that very night...

117
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,090
...the impossible
had already been set in motion.

118
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,770
Dear people of the world...

119
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,690
...I, Willy Wonka...

120
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,490
...have decided to allow five children
to visit my factory this year.

121
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,330
In addition, one of these children
shall receive a special prize...

122
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,080
...beyond anything
you could ever imagine.

123
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,500
Five golden tickets have been hidden...

124
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,000
...underneath the ordinary wrapping
paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.

125
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
The bars may be anywhere...

126
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:34,300
...in any shop, in any street, in any
town, in any country in the world.

127
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,260
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie,
to open a bar of candy...

128
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,840
...and find a golden ticket inside?

129
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,720
I know, but I only get one bar a year,
for my birthday.

130
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,560
Well, it's your birthday next week.

131
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,190
You have as much chance
as anybody does.

132
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,400
Balderdash. The kids who are
going to find the golden tickets...

133
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,400
...are the ones who can afford
to buy candy bars every day.

134
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,490
Our Charlie gets only one a year.
He doesn't have a chance.

135
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,280
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.

136
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,410
Mark my words,
the kid who finds the first ticket...

137
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,960
...will be fat, fat, fat.

138
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,380
Augustus. This way.

139
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,300
I am eating the Wonka bar...

140
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,760
...and I taste something
that is not chocolate...

141
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,560
...or coconut...

142
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,430
...or walnut or peanut butter...

143
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,850
...or nougat...

144
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,770
...or butter brittle
or caramel or sprinkles.

145
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,990
So I look...

146
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,950
...and I find the golden ticket.

147
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,280
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

148
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,200
I eat more candy.

149
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,290
We knew Augustus would find
the golden ticket.

150
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,210
He eats so many candy bars a day...

151
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,130
...that it was not possible
for him not to find one.

152
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,470
Yes, it is good, Augustus.

153
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,890
- Golden ticket claimed and four more...

154
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,640
Told you it'd be a porker.

155
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,930
What a repulsive boy.

156
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,020
Only four golden tickets left.

157
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,820
Now that they've found one,
things will really get crazy.

158
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
- Of every shape, size and hue.

159
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,570
Veruca.
Can you spell that for us, please?

160
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,290
V- E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.

161
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,620
As soon as little Veruca told me she had
to have one of these golden tickets...

162
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
...I started buying all the Wonka bars
I could lay my hands on.

163
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,880
Thousands of them.
Hundreds of thousands.

164
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,470
I'm in the nut business, you see.
So I say to my workers:

165
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,010
Morning, ladies. From now on,
you can stop shelling peanuts...

166
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,430
...and start shelling the wrappers
off these chocolate bars instead.

167
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,870
Three days went by,
and we had no luck.

168
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,580
Oh, it was terrible. My Veruca
got more and more upset each day.

169
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,210
Where's my golden ticket?

170
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,710
I want my golden ticket.

171
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,880
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see
my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

172
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,590
I vowed I would keep searching
until I could give her what she wanted.

173
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,390
And finally, I found her a ticket.

174
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,210
Daddy, I want another pony.

175
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,130
She's even worse than the fat boy.

176
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,260
I don't think that was really fair.
She didn't find the ticket herself.

177
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,890
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
That man spoils his daughter.

178
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,980
And no good ever comes
from spoiling a child like that.

179
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,690
Charlie, Mum and I thought...

180
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,740
...maybe you wanna open
your birthday present tonight.

181
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,620
Here you are.

182
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,640
Maybe I should wait till morning.

183
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,640
- Like hell.
- Pop.

184
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,640
All together, we're 381 years old.
We don't wait.

185
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,360
Now, Charlie,
you mustn't feel too disappointed...

186
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,490
...you know, if you don't get the...

187
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,830
Whatever happens,
you'll still have the candy.

188
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,020
Ah, well.

189
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,190
That's that.

190
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,700
- We'll share it.
- Oh, no, Charlie.

191
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,490
Not your birthday present.

192
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,700
It's my candy bar,
and I'll do what I want with it.

193
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,880
Thank you, darling.

194
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,420
Thank you, Charlie.

195
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,220
Bless you.

196
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,330
All right, let's see who found it.

197
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,260
"The third ticket was found
by Miss Violet Beauregarde. "

198
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,300
Hah! Hah! Hyah!

199
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,570
These are just some of the 263
trophies and medals my Violet has won.

200
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when
I heard about these ticket things...

201
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,540
...I laid off the gum,
switched to candy bars.

202
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,910
She's just a driven young woman.
I don't know where she gets it.

203
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,630
I'm the Junior World Champion
Gum Chewer.

204
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,800
This piece of gum
I'm chewing right now...

205
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,880
...I've been working on for
three months solid. That's a record.

206
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,470
Of course, I did have my share
of trophies, mostly baton.

207
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,100
So it says that one kid's gonna get
this special prize, better than all the rest.

208
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,480
I don't care who those other four are.
That kid, it's gonna be me.

209
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,110
Tell them why, Violet.

210
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,860
Because I'm a winner.

211
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,150
What a beastly girl.

212
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,450
Despicable.

213
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,820
You don't know
what we're talking about.

214
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,490
Dragonflies?

215
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,330
But wait, this is just in.

216
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,000
The fourth golden ticket has been found
by a boy called Mike Teavee.

217
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,770
All you had to do was track
the manufacturing dates...

218
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,350
...offset by weather
and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

219
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,650
A retard could figure it out.

220
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,530
Most of the time
I don't know what he's talking about.

221
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,610
You know, kids these days,
what with all the technology...

222
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,030
Die! Die! Die!

223
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,040
Doesn't seem like
they stay kids very long.

224
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,540
In the end,
I only had to buy one candy bar.

225
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,710
- And how did it taste?
- I don't know.

226
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,260
I hate chocolate.

227
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,390
It's a good thing you're going to a
chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...

228
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,110
That question is,
who will be the winner of the last gold...?

229
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,240
- Dad?
- Yes, Charlie?

230
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,490
Why aren't you at work?

231
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,540
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory
thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

232
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,580
Like summer vacation?

233
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,630
Sure. Something like that.

234
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,970
In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.

235
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,270
The upswing in candy sales
had led to a rise in cavities...

236
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,480
...which led to a rise
in toothpaste sales.

237
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,940
With the extra money,
the factory had decided to modernize...

238
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,070
...eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.

239
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,960
We were barely making
ends meet as it was.

240
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,170
You'll find another job.

241
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,500
Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just
thin down the soup a little more.

242
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,970
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket,
our luck will change.

243
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,930
I know it.

244
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,140
Charlie.

245
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,660
My secret hoard.

246
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,500
You and I are going to have
one more fling...

247
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,960
...at finding that last ticket.

248
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,960
You sure you want to spend
your money on that?

249
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,840
Of course I'm sure. Here.

250
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,600
Run down to the nearest store...

251
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,600
...and buy the first
Wonka candy bar you see.

252
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,310
Bring it straight back,
and we'll open it together.

253
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,410
Such a good boy, really.

254
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,870
Such a good...

255
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,870
Grandpa?

256
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,370
- You fell asleep.
- Have you got it?

257
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Which end should we open first?

258
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,720
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.

259
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,080
Did you see that some kid in Russia
found the last golden ticket?

260
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,340
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.

261
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,010
Good boy. Come on, George.
Good boy.

262
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,150
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious
Fudgemallow Delight, please.

263
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,810
Okay. Here you go.

264
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,200
The nerve of some people.

265
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,120
I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.

266
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,130
It's a golden ticket.

267
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,470
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.

268
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,140
In my shop too!

269
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,690
Listen. I'll buy it from you.
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.

270
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,980
Are you crazy?
I'd give him $500 for that ticket.

271
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,690
You wanna sell me your ticket
for $500, young man?

272
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,150
That's enough of that.
Leave the kid alone.

273
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,870
Listen. Don't let anyone have it.
Take it straight home, you understand?

274
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,700
Thank you.

275
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,170
Mom! Dad!

276
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,220
I found it!

277
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,890
The last golden ticket! It's mine!

278
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,400
Yippee!

279
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,580
Here.

280
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,540
Read it aloud.
Let's hear exactly what it says.

281
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,500
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of
this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.

282
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,130
I shake you warmly by the hand.
For now, I invite you to my factory...

283
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,510
...and be my guest
for one whole day. "

284
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,930
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you
around the factory myself...

285
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
...showing you everything
there is to see. "

286
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,270
"Afterwards,
when it is time to leave...

287
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,810
...you will be escorted home
by a procession of large trucks...

288
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,280
...each one filled with all the chocolate
you could ever eat. "

289
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,160
"And remember, one of you lucky
five children will receive an extra prize...

290
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,530
...beyond your wildest imagination.

291
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,080
Now, here are your instructions. "

292
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,160
"On the 1 st of February, you must come
to the factory gates at 10 a. m. Sharp.

293
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,710
You're allowed to bring one member
of your family to look after you.

294
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,920
Until then, Willy Wonka. "

295
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,130
The 1 st of February.

296
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,090
- But that's tomorrow.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

297
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,430
Wash your face, comb your hair,
scrub your hands...

298
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,100
...brush your teeth, blow your nose.

299
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,560
And get that mud off your pants.

300
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,770
We must all try and keep very calm.

301
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:44,650
First thing that we have to decide is this:
Who is going with Charlie to the factory?

302
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,070
I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.

303
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,950
How about you, dear?
Don't you think you ought to go?

304
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,660
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know
more about it than we do, and...

305
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,660
Provided, of course,
he feels well enough.

306
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,410
Yippee!

307
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,670
No. We're not going.

308
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,260
A woman offered me $500
for the ticket.

309
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,510
I bet someone else would pay more.

310
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,050
We need the money more
than we need the chocolate.

311
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,520
Young man, come here.

312
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,030
There's plenty of money out there.

313
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,320
They print more every day.

314
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,200
But this ticket...

315
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,290
...there's only five of them
in the whole world...

316
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,790
...and that's all
there's ever going to be.

317
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,720
Only a dummy would give this up
for something as common as money.

318
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,470
Are you a dummy?

319
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,720
No, sir.

320
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,350
Then get that mud off your pants.
You've got a factory to go to.

321
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,770
Daddy, I want to go in.

322
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,440
It's 9:59, sweetheart.

323
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,150
Make time go faster.

324
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,530
Do you think Mr. Wonka
will recognize you?

325
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,660
Hard to say. It's been years.

326
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,790
Eyes on the prize, Violet.

327
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,250
Eyes on the prize.

328
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,520
Please enter.

329
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,950
Come forward.

330
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,090
Close the gates.

331
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,350
Dear visitors...

332
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,730
...it is my great pleasure to welcome you
to my humble factory.

333
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
And who am I?

334
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,230
Well...

335
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

336
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,870
The amazing chocolatier

337
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,040
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

338
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,160
Everybody give a cheer!
Hooray!

339
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,210
He's modest, clever and so smart

340
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,040
He barely can restrain it

341
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,210
With so much generosity

342
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,050
There is no way to contain it!

343
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,590
To contain it
To contain, to contain, to contain!

344
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,590
Hooray!

345
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,090
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

346
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,100
He's the one that you're about to meet

347
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,850
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

348
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,310
He's the genius who just can't be beat

349
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,230
The magician and the chocolate wiz

350
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,100
The best darn guy who ever lived

351
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:59,900
Willy Wonka, here he is!

352
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,340
The amazing chocolatier

353
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,560
Wasn't that just magnificent?

354
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,400
I was worried it was getting dodgy
in the middle part, but then that finale...

355
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,440
Wow!

356
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,570
Who are you?

357
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,280
- He's Willy Wonka.
- Really?

358
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,460
"Good morning, starshine.

359
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,800
The Earth says hello. "

360
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,020
"Dear guests, greetings.

361
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,110
Welcome to the factory.
I shake you warmly by the hand.

362
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,570
My name is Willy Wonka. "

363
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,450
Then shouldn't you be up there?

364
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,950
I couldn't very well watch the show
from up there, now, could I, little girl?

365
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,960
Mr. Wonka, I don't know
if you'll remember me...

366
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,000
...but I used to work
here in the factory.

367
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Were you one of those despicable spies
who tried to steal...

368
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,550
...my life's work and sell it to parasitic,
copycat, candy-making cads?

369
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,050
No, sir.

370
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,300
Then wonderful. Welcome back.

371
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,850
Let's get a move on, kids.

372
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,310
Don't you want to know our names?

373
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,190
Can't imagine how it would matter.
Come quickly. Far too much to see.

374
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,700
Just drop your coats anywhere.

375
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,210
- Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here.
- What?

376
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh, I have to keep it warm. My workers
are used to an extremely hot climate.

377
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,880
They just can't stand the cold.

378
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,260
Who are the workers?

379
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,680
All in good time. Now...

380
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,060
Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.

381
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,810
Oh.

382
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,060
- I don't care.
- Well, you should care.

383
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,690
Because I'm gonna win
the special prize at the end.

384
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,780
Well, you do seem confident,
and confidence is key.

385
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,910
I'm Veruca Salt.
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

386
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,740
I always thought a verruca
was a type of wart you got...

387
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,410
...on the bottom of your foot.

388
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,880
I am Augustus Gloop.
I love your chocolate.

389
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,760
I can see that. So do I.

390
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,050
I never expected to have
so much in common.

391
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,890
You. You're Mike Teavee.

392
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,600
You're the little devil
who cracked the system.

393
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,770
And you. Well, you're just lucky
to be here, aren't you?

394
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,440
And the rest of you must be their...

395
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,330
- Parents.
- Yeah.

396
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Moms and dads.

397
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,710
Dad?

398
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,590
Papa?

399
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,760
Okay, then. Let's move along.

400
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,700
- Would you like some chocolate?
- Sure.

401
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,990
Then you should've brought some.

402
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,040
- Let's be friends.
- Best friends.

403
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,180
An important room, this.

404
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,190
- After all, it is a chocolate factory.
- Then why is the door so small?

405
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,480
That's to keep all the great big
chocolatey flavor inside.

406
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,550
Now, do be careful, my dear children.

407
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,510
Don't lose your heads.

408
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,550
Don't get overexcited.

409
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,600
Just keep very calm.

410
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,570
It's beautiful.

411
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,280
What?

412
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,740
Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.

413
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,920
Every drop of the river...

414
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,590
...is hot, melted chocolate
of the finest quality.

415
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,060
The waterfall is most important.

416
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,940
Mixes the chocolate.

417
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,110
Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.

418
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,940
By the way...

419
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:11,860
...no other factory in the world mixes its
chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.

420
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,910
And you can take that to the bank.

421
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,880
People.

422
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,970
Those pipes...

423
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:35,100
...suck up the chocolate
and carry it away all over the factory.

424
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,470
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.

425
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,810
And do you like my meadow?
Try some of my grass.

426
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,520
Please have a blade. Please do. It's
so delectable and so darn good-looking.

427
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,650
You can eat the grass?

428
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,900
Of course you can.

429
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,320
Everything in this room is eatable.

430
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,820
Even I'm eatable.

431
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,830
But that is called cannibalism,
my dear children...

432
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,830
...and is, in fact, frowned upon
in most societies.

433
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,330
Yeah.

434
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,920
Enjoy.

435
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,840
Go on. Scoot, scoot.

436
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,570
Son.

437
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,200
Please.

438
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,030
Dad, he said, "Enjoy. "

439
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,930
Why hold on to it?
Why not start a new piece?

440
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,220
Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
I'd be a loser, like you.

441
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,880
Daddy, look over there.

442
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,260
What is it?

443
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,970
It's a little person.

444
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,590
Over there, by the waterfall.

445
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,430
- There's two of them.
- There's more than two.

446
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,400
- Where do they come from?
- Who are they?

447
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,940
Are they real people?

448
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,610
Of course they're real people.
They're Oompa-Loompas.

449
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,290
- Oompa-Loompas?
- Imported, direct from Loompaland.

450
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,080
- There's no such place.
- What?

451
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,750
Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school
geography, and I'm here to tell you...

452
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,090
Well, then you'll know all about it,
and, oh, what a terrible country it is.

453
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,440
The whole place is nothing
but thick jungles...

454
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,190
...infested by the most dangerous beasts
in the entire world.

455
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,490
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and
those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.

456
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,550
I went to Loompaland looking for
exotic new flavors for candy.

457
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,940
Instead...

458
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,150
...I found the Oompa-Loompas.

459
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,240
They lived in tree houses to escape from
the fierce creatures who lived below.

460
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:33,040
The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but
green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.

461
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,210
The Oompa-Loompas looked for things...

462
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,340
...to mash up with the caterpillars
to make them taste better:

463
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,010
Red beetles,
the bark of the bong-bong tree.

464
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,430
All of them beastly...

465
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,600
...but not quite so beastly
as the caterpillars.

466
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,150
Mmm.

467
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,970
But the food they longed for the most
was the cocoa bean.

468
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,520
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found
three or four cocoa beans a year.

469
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,100
But, oh, how they craved them.

470
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,440
All they'd ever think about
was cocoa beans.

471
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,470
They are such wonderful workers.

472
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,600
I feel I must warn you, though,
they are rather mischievous.

473
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,560
Always making jokes.

474
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,480
Augustus, my child,
that is not a good thing you do!

475
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,490
Hey, little boy.

476
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,700
My chocolate must be untouched
by human hands.

477
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,950
Ah!

478
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,160
He'll drown.

479
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,130
He can't swim.

480
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,840
Save him!

481
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,840
Augustus! No!

482
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,220
Augustus!

483
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,190
Augustus, watch out!

484
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,200
Ah!

485
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,300
There he goes.

486
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,550
- Ah!
- Call the fire brigade!

487
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,010
It's a wonder how
that pipe is big enough.

488
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,050
It isn't big enough.
He's slowing down.

489
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,510
He's gonna stick.

490
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,390
I think he has.

491
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,440
He's blocked the whole pipe.

492
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,440
Look. The Oompa-Loompas.

493
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,030
What are they doing?

494
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:58,290
They're going to treat us to a little song.
It is quite a special occasion.

495
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,790
They haven't had a fresh audience
in many a moon.

496
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,230
Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop

497
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,150
The great big, greedy nincompoop

498
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,200
Augustus Gloop, so big and vile
So greedy, foul and infantile

499
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,700
"Come on!" we cried
"The time is ripe

500
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,410
To send him shooting up the pipe!"

501
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,870
But don't, dear children, be alarmed

502
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,660
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

503
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,080
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

504
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,580
Although, of course, we must admit

505
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,950
He will be altered quite a bit

506
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,080
Slowly, wheels go round and round

507
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,290
And cogs begin to grind and pound

508
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,010
This greedy brute, this louse's ear

509
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,640
Is loved by people everywhere

510
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,640
For who could hate or bear a grudge

511
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:41,860
Against a luscious bit of fudge?

512
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,660
Ah!

513
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,470
Bravo! Well done!

514
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,850
Aren't they delightful?
Aren't they charming?

515
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,520
- I say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.
- Like they knew it was gonna happen.

516
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,980
Oh, poppycock.

517
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,820
Where is my son?
Where does that pipe go to?

518
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,780
That pipe, it just so happens to lead...

519
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,280
...directly to the room
where I make delicious...

520
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,870
...strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

521
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,580
He will be made into strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

522
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,290
They'll be selling him by the pound
all over the world?

523
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,340
No. I wouldn't allow it.
The taste would be terrible.

524
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,670
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored,
chocolate-coated Gloop? Ew.

525
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,220
No one would buy it.

526
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,310
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop
up to the Fudge Room, okay?

527
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,980
Help her find her son.

528
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:07,740
Take a long stick and start poking around
in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?

529
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,090
- Mr. Wonka?
- Huh?

530
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,970
Why would Augustus' name already
be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?

531
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,760
Improvisation is a parlor trick.
Anyone can do it.

532
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,060
You, little girl. Say something.

533
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,270
- Anything.
- Chewing gum.

534
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,480
Chewing gum is really gross
Chewing gum, I hate the most

535
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,690
See? Exactly the same.

536
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,270
No, it isn't.

537
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,940
Uh, you really shouldn't mumble.

538
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,400
Because I can't understand
a word you're saying.

539
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,410
Now, on with the tour.

540
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,080
- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?
- Of course they're joking.

541
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,790
That boy will be fine.

542
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,970
What's so funny?

543
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,470
I think it's from all those
doggone cocoa beans.

544
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,520
Hey, by the way, did you guys know
that chocolate contains a property...

545
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,480
...that triggers the release of endorphins?
Gives one the feeling of being in love.

546
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,360
You don't say.

547
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,150
All aboard.

548
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,870
Onward!

549
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,400
Here.

550
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,110
Try some of this. It'll do you good.
You look starved to death.

551
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:02,040
- It's great.
- That's because it's mixed by waterfall.

552
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,750
The waterfall is most important.

553
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:08,170
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up,
makes it light and frothy.

554
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,840
- No other factory in the world...
- You already said that.

555
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,060
- You're all quite short, aren't you?
- Well, yeah. We're children.

556
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,850
Well, that's no excuse.
I was never as short as you.

557
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,310
- You were once.
- Was not. Know why?

558
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,190
Because I distinctly remember
putting a hat on top of my head.

559
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,990
Look at your short, little arms.
You could never reach.

560
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,990
Do you even remember
what it was like being a kid?

561
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,240
Oh, boy, do I.

562
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,080
Do I?

563
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,670
In fact, Willy Wonka...

564
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,170
...hadn't thought about his childhood
for years.

565
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,760
Trick or treat!

566
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,670
Trick or treat!

567
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,310
Trick or treat!

568
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,810
Who do we have here?

569
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,690
Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.

570
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,400
And who's that under the sheet?

571
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,660
Little Willy Wonka.

572
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:28,960
Willy Wonka was the son
of the city's most famous dentist...

573
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,080
...Wilbur Wonka.

574
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,630
Now...

575
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,640
...let's see what the damage is
this year, shall we?

576
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,610
Caramels.

577
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,450
They'd get stuck in your braces,
wouldn't they?

578
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,250
Lollipops.

579
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,170
Ought to be called
"cavities on a stick. "

580
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,790
Then we have all this...

581
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,340
All this...

582
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,340
...chocolate.

583
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,350
You know, just last week, I was reading
in a very important medical journal...

584
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,180
...that some children
are allergic to chocolate.

585
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,060
Makes their noses itch.

586
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,690
Maybe I'm not allergic.

587
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,190
- I could try a piece.
- Really?

588
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,490
But why take a chance?

589
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,840
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?

590
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,340
- We're headed for a tunnel.
- Oh, yeah.

591
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,930
Full speed ahead.

592
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,600
- How can they see where they're going?
- They can't.

593
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,100
There's no knowing
where they're going.

594
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,730
Switch on the lights!

595
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,890
People, keep an eye out.

596
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,180
We're passing some
very important rooms here.

597
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,310
What do you use hair cream for?

598
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,150
To lock in moisture.

599
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,820
- Whipped cream.
- Precisely.

600
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,740
That doesn't make sense.

601
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,620
For your information, little girl...

602
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,620
...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at
all unless it's been whipped with whips.

603
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,920
Everybody knows that.

604
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:12,470
Stop the boat.
I wanna show you guys something.

605
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,490
Now, this is the most important room
in the entire factory.

606
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,120
Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves,
but just don't touch anything.

607
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,540
Okay? Go on.

608
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,040
Go on, scoot.

609
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,390
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?

610
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:01,560
Oh. Let me show you.

611
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,650
Thank you.

612
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,980
These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.

613
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,860
They're for children who are given
very little allowance.

614
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,450
You can suck on it all year,
and it'll never get any smaller.

615
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,080
- Isn't that neat?
- It's like gum.

616
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,160
No. Gum is for chewing.

617
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,620
If you tried chewing
one of these Gobstoppers...

618
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,830
...you'd break all your little teeth off.

619
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,340
But they sure do taste terrific.

620
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,010
And this is Hair Toffee.

621
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,510
You suck down one of
these little boogers...

622
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,600
...and in exactly half an hour...

623
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,520
...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out
over the top of your little noggin.

624
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,900
And a mustache. And a beard.

625
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,610
- Who wants a beard?
- Well...

626
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,950
...beatniks, for one.
Folk singers and motorbike riders.

627
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:57,240
You know, all those hip, jazzy,
super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats.

628
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,910
It's in the fridge, daddy-o.
Are you hep to the jive?

629
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,160
Can you dig what I'm laying down?
I knew you could.

630
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,960
Slide me some skin, soul brother.

631
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,170
Unfortunately,
the mixture isn't right yet.

632
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,630
Because an Oompa-Loompa
tried some yesterday, and, well, he...

633
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,640
How are you today?

634
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,850
You look great.

635
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,990
Watch this.

636
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,720
You mean that's it?

637
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:05,140
Do you even know what "it" is?

638
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,520
- It's gum.
- Yeah.

639
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:11,690
It's a stick of the most amazing and
sensational gum in the whole universe.

640
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,030
Know why? Know why?

641
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:17,450
Because this gum is a full
three-course dinner all by itself.

642
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,200
Why would anyone want that?

643
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,090
"It will be the end of all kitchens
and all cooking.

644
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,970
Just a little strip of Wonka's magic
chewing gum and that is all you will...

645
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,260
...ever need at breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

646
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:42,850
This piece of gum happens to be tomato
soup, roast beef and blueberry pie. "

647
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,930
It sounds great.

648
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,560
- It sounds weird.
- It sounds like my kind of gum.

649
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,360
I'd rather you didn't.
There are still some things that are...

650
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,950
I'm the world-record holder in
chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything.

651
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,620
- How is it, honey?
- It's amazing!

652
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,420
Tomato soup.
I can feel it running down my throat.

653
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,040
Yeah. Spit it out.

654
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,750
- Young lady, I think you'd better...
- It's changing.

655
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,760
Roast beef, with baked potato.

656
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,760
- Crispy skin and butter.
- Keep chewing.

657
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:23,260
My little girl's gonna be the first person
to have a chewing-gum meal.

658
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,890
Yeah. I'm just a little concerned
about the...

659
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,730
Blueberry pie and ice cream!

660
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,810
- That part.
- What's happening to her nose?

661
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,780
It's turning blue.

662
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,410
Your whole nose has gone purple.

663
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,990
What do you mean?

664
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,330
Violet, you're turning violet.

665
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,960
- What's happening?
- I told you I hadn't quite got it right.

666
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,170
Because it goes a little funny
when it gets to the dessert.

667
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,050
It's the blueberry pie that does it.

668
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,010
I'm terribly sorry.

669
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,020
Mother? What's happening to me?

670
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,160
She's swelling up.

671
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,540
Like a blueberry.

672
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,320
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas,
and each one ended up as a blueberry.

673
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,280
It's just weird.

674
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,450
But I can't have a blueberry
as a daughter.

675
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,200
How is she supposed to compete?

676
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,790
You could put her in a county fair.

677
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,100
Yeah, yeah

678
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,190
Yeah

679
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,520
Listen close, and listen hard

680
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,570
To the tale of Violet Beauregarde

681
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:42,280
This gentle girl
She sees no wrong

682
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,860
In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

683
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:54,410
Chewing, chewing all day long

684
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,250
Yeah

685
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,800
She goes on chewing till, at last

686
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:11,100
Her chewing muscles grow so vast

687
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,600
And from her face
Her giant chin

688
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,100
Sticks out just like a violin

689
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:18,440
Chewing, chewing all day long

690
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:23,280
Chewing, chewing all day long

691
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:30,120
For years and years she chews away

692
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,620
Her jaws get stronger every day

693
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,950
And with one great, tremendous chew

694
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,330
They bite the poor girl's tongue in two

695
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,670
And that is why we try so hard

696
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,420
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde

697
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,800
Chewing, chewing all day long

698
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,170
Chewing, chewing all day long

699
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,640
Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

700
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:58,480
Chewing, chewing all day long

701
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,810
Mr. Wonka!

702
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,650
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde
into the boat...

703
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,580
...and take her along to
the Juicing Room at once, okay?

704
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,700
Juicing Room?
What are they gonna do to her there?

705
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,000
They're gonna squeeze her.

706
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,120
Like a little pimple.

707
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,750
We gotta squeeze all that juice
out of her immediately.

708
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:28,590
Mother, help me.

709
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,470
Please.

710
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,230
Come on.

711
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:38,810
Let's boogie.

712
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,610
Without the boat, we'll have to move
double-time to keep on schedule.

713
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,070
There's too much to see.

714
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:45,270
- Mr. Wonka?
- Yeah?

715
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:47,280
Why did you decide to let people in?

716
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,490
So they could see the factory,
of course.

717
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,070
But why now? And why only five?

718
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,530
What's the special prize,
and who gets it?

719
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,580
The best kind of prize is a surprise.

720
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,080
Will Violet always be a blueberry?

721
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,330
No. Maybe. I don't know.

722
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,630
That's what you get from chewing gum
all day. It's disgusting.

723
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,170
If you hate gum so much,
why do you make it?

724
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,300
Once again, you shouldn't mumble.
It's starting to bum me out.

725
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:14,390
Can you remember the first candy
you ever ate?

726
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,230
No.

727
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,390
In fact, Willy Wonka did remember...

728
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,560
...the first candy he ever ate.

729
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,840
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.

730
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,210
I see.

731
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,510
These flashbacks happen often?

732
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,630
Increasingly...

733
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,260
...today.

734
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,810
Ah, this is a room I know all about.

735
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,110
For you see, Mr. Wonka,
I, myself, am in the nut business.

736
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,690
Are you using the Havermax 4000
to do your sorting?

737
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,490
No.

738
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,110
You're really weird.

739
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,140
- Squirrels.
- Yeah. Squirrels.

740
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:24,560
These squirrels are specially trained
to get the nuts out of shells.

741
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,450
Why use squirrels?
Why not use Oompa-Loompas?

742
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:48,170
Because only squirrels can get the whole
walnut out almost every single time.

743
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:51,960
See how they tap them with their
knuckles to make sure it's not bad?

744
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,670
Oh, look. Look.

745
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,010
I think that one's got a bad nut.

746
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,100
Daddy, I want a squirrel.

747
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,470
Get me one of those squirrels.
I want one.

748
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,480
Veruca, dear,
you have many marvelous pets.

749
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,650
All I've got at home is one pony and
two dogs and four cats and six rabbits...

750
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:14,360
...and two parakeets and three canaries
and a green parrot and a turtle...

751
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:17,700
...and a silly old hamster.
I want a squirrel!

752
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:19,360
All right, pet.

753
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,240
Daddy will get you a squirrel
as soon as he possibly can.

754
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:25,950
But I don't want any old squirrel,
I want a trained squirrel.

755
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,870
Very well.

756
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:32,380
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want
for one of these squirrels?

757
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,500
Name your price.

758
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,010
Oh, they're not for sale.
She can't have one.

759
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,600
Daddy.

760
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:47,520
I'm sorry, darling.

761
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,140
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.

762
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:56,320
If you won't get me a squirrel,
I'll get one myself.

763
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,620
Veruca.

764
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,620
Little girl?

765
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,250
Veruca, come back here at once.

766
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,510
Veruca.

767
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,810
Little girl?

768
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:35,060
Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

769
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,360
It'll make him crazy.

770
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:55,130
I'll have you.

771
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,800
Veruca.

772
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,430
Veruca.

773
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,190
No!

774
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:18,940
Veruca!

775
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:23,450
Let's find the key.

776
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,240
Nope. Not that one.

777
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,580
- Daddy!
- Veruca!

778
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,830
No. It's not that one.

779
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,140
There it is.

780
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,510
There it isn't.

781
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,430
Daddy, I want them to stop.

782
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,610
What are they doing?

783
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,780
They're testing to see
if she's a bad nut.

784
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,660
Oh, my goodness.
She is a bad nut after all.

785
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,170
Veruca!

786
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,130
Daddy!

787
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:20,840
Where are they taking her?

788
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,800
Where all the other bad nuts go.
To the garbage chute.

789
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,550
- Where does the chute go?
- To the incinerator.

790
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,720
But don't worry.
We only light it on Tuesdays.

791
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,510
Today is Tuesday.

792
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,730
There's always the chance
they decided not to light it today.

793
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,030
- Ah!
- Ah!

794
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,040
Now, she may be stuck in the chute
just below the top.

795
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:02,840
If that's the case, all you have to do
is just reach in and pull her out.

796
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:04,920
Okay?

797
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,090
Veruca Salt, the little brute

798
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,380
Has just gone down the garbage chute

799
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:53,640
And she will meet, as she descends

800
01:17:53,810 --> 01:18:03,980
A rather different set of friends

801
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:07,280
A fish head, for example, cut

802
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,530
This morning from a halibut

803
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,950
An oyster from an oyster stew

804
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,870
A steak that no one else would chew

805
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,370
And lots of other things as well

806
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:27,670
Each with its rather horrid smell

807
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,590
Horrid smell

808
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:35,140
These are Veruca's newfound friends

809
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,850
That she will meet as she descends

810
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:44,270
These are Veruca's newfound friends

811
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:06,920
Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?

812
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:10,510
Who pandered to her every need?

813
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:13,880
Who turned her into such a brat?

814
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,840
Who are the culprits?

815
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:17,510
Who did that?

816
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,970
The guilty ones, now this is sad

817
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:24,850
Are dear old Mum and loving Dad

818
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:26,860
Ah!

819
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,700
Oh, really? Oh, good.

820
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:40,450
I've just been informed
that the incinerator's broken.

821
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:44,210
So there should be about three weeks
of rotten garbage to break their fall.

822
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,870
Well, that's good news.

823
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:47,670
Yeah.

824
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,920
Well, let's keep on trucking.

825
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,800
I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

826
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:59,180
The elevator's by far the most
efficient way to get around the factory.

827
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:01,180
There can't be this many floors.

828
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,180
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?

829
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,100
This isn't an ordinary
up-and-down elevator, by the way.

830
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,770
This elevator can go sideways,
longways, slantways...

831
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,570
...and any other ways
you can think of.

832
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,610
You just press any button
and, whoosh, you're off.

833
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:26,120
Oh, look. Look.

834
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:30,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fudge Mountain.

835
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,400
Oh.

836
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,280
I'd rather not talk about this one.

837
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,800
This is the Puppet Hospital
and Burn Center.

838
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,180
It's relatively new.

839
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,310
Ah, the administration offices.

840
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,900
Hello, Doris.

841
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:12,020
Why is everything here
completely pointless?

842
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,190
Candy doesn't have to have a point.

843
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,690
That's why it's candy.

844
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,360
It's stupid.

845
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,110
Candy is a waste of time.

846
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,990
No son of mine is going to be
a chocolatier.

847
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,080
Then I'll run away.

848
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,370
To Switzerland. Bavaria.

849
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,540
The candy capitals of the world.

850
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,580
Go ahead.

851
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,590
But I won't be here
when you come back.

852
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,450
Sorry, son.

853
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:08,120
We're closing for the night.

854
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,230
I wanna pick a room.

855
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,730
Go ahead.

856
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,880
Here.

857
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:03,260
Put these on quick, and don't
take them off whatever you do.

858
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:06,840
This light could burn your eyeballs
right out of your skulls.

859
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:10,140
And we certainly don't want that,
now, do we?

860
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,690
This is the testing room for my
very latest and greatest invention:

861
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:19,560
Television Chocolate.

862
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:20,980
One day it occurred to me:

863
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,740
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

864
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,950
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces
and send it whizzing through the air...

865
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,030
...then reassemble it
on the other end...

866
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,200
...why can't I do the same
with chocolate?

867
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,500
Why can't I send a real bar
of chocolate...

868
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,040
...through the television,
all ready to be eaten?"

869
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:41,960
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction.

870
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,630
Sounds impossible.

871
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,420
It is impossible.

872
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,050
You don't understand anything
about science.

873
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:55,310
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles. Duh.

874
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,060
Second, the amount of power it
would take to convert energy in matter...

875
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,020
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

876
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:02,690
Mumbler!

877
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:07,530
Seriously, I cannot understand
a single word you're saying.

878
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,580
Okey-dokey.

879
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:16,080
I shall now send a bar of chocolate
from one end of the room...

880
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,330
...to the other by television.

881
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,920
Bring in the chocolate.

882
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:44,360
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

883
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:47,900
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

884
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,490
Same basic principle.

885
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,060
It's gone.

886
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:28,150
Told you. That chocolate is now rushing
through the air above our heads...

887
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,780
...in a million tiny little pieces.

888
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:33,820
Come over here.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

889
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,160
Watch the screen.

890
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,170
Here it comes.

891
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,840
Oh, look.

892
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:55,640
- Take it.
- It's just a picture on a screen.

893
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,850
Scaredy-cat.

894
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,520
You take it.

895
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:02,640
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

896
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,320
Go on.

897
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:22,160
Holy buckets.

898
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:27,290
Eat it. Go on.

899
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,630
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

900
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,090
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

901
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,930
It's great.

902
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,480
It's a miracle.

903
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,110
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

904
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:53,030
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

905
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,280
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

906
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:00,370
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself. "

907
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,960
And you simply reach out and take it.

908
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,170
How about that?

909
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,250
So can you send other things?

910
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,210
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

911
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:14,170
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

912
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,680
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

913
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,970
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

914
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,270
- Of course I could.
- What about people?

915
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,140
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

916
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:29,520
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

917
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:32,690
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

918
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,030
And all you think about is chocolate.

919
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,400
Calm down, Mike.

920
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,370
I think Mr. Wonka knows
what he's talking about.

921
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,950
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

922
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,250
You think he's a genius,
but he's an idiot.

923
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,920
But I'm not.

924
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,130
Hey, little boy.

925
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,130
Don't push my button.

926
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:38,970
He's gone.

927
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,930
Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

928
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,470
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

929
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,890
What do you mean?

930
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:51,770
Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

931
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:56,400
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

932
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:58,610
What kind of a question is that?

933
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,490
No need to snap. Just a question.

934
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:06,290
Try every channel.
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

935
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,710
- There he is.
- Mike.

936
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,090
The most important thing

937
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,510
That we've ever learned

938
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:21,050
The most important thing we've learned
As far as children are concerned

939
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:24,050
Is never, never let them near
The television set

940
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:27,720
Or better still just don't install
The idiotic thing at all

941
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:31,390
Never, never let them
Never, never let them

942
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:47,540
Never, never let them

943
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,500
It rots the senses in the head

944
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,870
It keeps imagination dead

945
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,540
It clogs and clutters up the mind

946
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,330
It makes a child so dull and blind

947
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,880
So dull, so dull

948
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,050
He can no longer understand
A fairy tale, a fairyland

949
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,800
A fairyland, a fairyland

950
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,380
His brain becomes as soft as cheese

951
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:04,050
His thinking powers rust and freeze

952
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,470
He cannot think, he only sees

953
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,230
Regarding little Mike Teavee

954
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,020
We very much regret that we

955
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:20,190
Regret that we

956
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:23,450
Shall simply have to wait and see

957
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:24,910
Wait and see, wait and see

958
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:27,410
Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see

959
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,910
We very much regret that we

960
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,750
Shall simply have to wait and see

961
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:32,750
If we can get him back his height

962
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,500
But if we can't

963
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:36,710
It serves him right

964
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,420
Ew, somebody grab him.

965
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:40,420
Help me.

966
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,720
Help me.

967
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:46,760
Oh, thank heavens.
He's completely unharmed.

968
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:50,470
Unharmed?
What are you talking about?

969
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:55,730
Just put me back in the other way.

970
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,440
There is no other way.

971
01:31:57,610 --> 01:32:00,650
It's television, not telephone.
There's quite a difference.

972
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:03,860
And what exactly do you propose
to do about it?

973
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,110
I don't know.

974
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:09,740
But young men are extremely springy.
They stretch like mad.

975
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:13,450
- Let's go put him in the taffy puller.
- Taffy puller?

976
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:15,460
Hey, that was my idea.

977
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:18,960
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.

978
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,590
Yeah.

979
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,010
Taffy puller.

980
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:27,470
I want you to take Mr. Teavee
and his...

981
01:32:28,850 --> 01:32:31,470
...little boy up to
the taffy puller, okay?

982
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,430
Stretch him out.

983
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,150
On with the tour.

984
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,330
There's still so much left to see.

985
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,040
Now, how many children are left?

986
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,180
Mr. Wonka,
Charlie's the only one left now.

987
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:10,890
You mean, you're the only one?

988
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:13,470
Yes.

989
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,020
What happened to the others?

990
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,190
Oh, my dear boy,
but that means you've won.

991
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,530
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.

992
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,030
I'm absolutely delighted.

993
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,740
I had a hunch right from the beginning.
Well done.

994
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:30,910
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.

995
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:34,120
We have an enormous number
of things to do before the day's out.

996
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:38,250
But luckily for us, we have the great
glass elevator to speed things along...

997
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,010
Speed things along.

998
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,430
Come on.

999
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,940
"Up and Out"?
What kind of room is that?

1000
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,150
Hold on.

1001
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:11,570
Oh, my goodness.

1002
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:15,410
We're gonna need to go much faster,
otherwise we'll just never break through.

1003
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,120
Break through what?

1004
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,790
I've been longing to press
that button for years.

1005
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:23,290
Well, here we go. Up and out.

1006
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:26,050
- But do you really mean...?
- Yeah. I do.

1007
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:27,710
But it's made of glass.

1008
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,880
It'll smash into a million pieces.

1009
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,420
Augustus, please
don't eat your fingers.

1010
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:10,510
But I taste so good.

1011
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:26,110
Look, Mother.
I'm much more flexible now.

1012
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:29,150
Yes, but you're blue.

1013
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:54,340
Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.

1014
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:58,430
Veruca, the only thing you're getting
today is a bath, and that's final.

1015
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,220
But I want it.

1016
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,080
Where do you live?

1017
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:22,080
Right over there. That little house.

1018
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,210
What time do you think
they'll be back?

1019
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,090
Hard to know, dear.

1020
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,350
I think there's someone at the door.

1021
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,310
Hi, Mom.

1022
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,110
Mom. Dad. We're back.

1023
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,940
Charlie.
Charlie.

1024
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,900
Goodness.

1025
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:01,450
This is Willy Wonka.
He gave us a ride home.

1026
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,330
I see that.

1027
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
You must be the boy's...

1028
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:09,330
- Parents?
- Yeah. That.

1029
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,420
He says Charlie's won something.

1030
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,260
Not just some something.

1031
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,550
The most "something" something
of any something that's ever been.

1032
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,890
I'm gonna give this little boy
my entire factory.

1033
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,100
You must be joking.

1034
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:28,560
No, really. It's true.

1035
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:32,190
Because you see, a few months ago,
I was having my semiannual haircut...

1036
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,650
...and I had the strangest revelation.

1037
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,290
In that one silver hair...

1038
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,000
...I saw reflected my life's work...

1039
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:57,590
...my factory,
my beloved Oompa-Loompas.

1040
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,680
Who would watch over them
after I was gone?

1041
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,640
I realized in that moment:

1042
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,310
I must find a heir.

1043
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:08,980
And I did, Charlie.

1044
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:10,520
You.

1045
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:14,820
That's why you sent out
the golden tickets.

1046
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,480
Uh-huh.

1047
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:18,530
What are Oompa-Loompas?

1048
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,700
I invited five children to the factory...

1049
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,700
...and the one who was the least rotten
would be the winner.

1050
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:25,490
That's you, Charlie.

1051
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:27,410
So, what do you say?

1052
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:31,250
Are you ready to leave all this behind
and come live with me at the factory?

1053
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,670
Sure. Of course.

1054
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:35,500
I mean, it's all right
if my family come too?

1055
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,960
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

1056
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,510
You can't run a chocolate factory...

1057
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,010
...with a family hanging over you
like an old, dead goose. No offense.

1058
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,010
None taken, jerk.

1059
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,600
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

1060
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:53,730
He has to follow his dreams.
Gosh darn the consequences.

1061
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:56,480
Look at me.

1062
01:38:56,650 --> 01:38:59,240
I had no family,
and I'm a giant success.

1063
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:04,530
So if I go with you to the factory,
I won't ever see my family again?

1064
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,080
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

1065
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,910
Then I'm not going.

1066
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,250
I wouldn't give up my family
for anything.

1067
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:17,000
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

1068
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,670
Oh, I see.

1069
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:25,470
That's weird.

1070
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,270
There's other candy too
besides chocolate.

1071
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,100
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka.
I'm staying here.

1072
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,610
Wow.

1073
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,780
Well, that's just...

1074
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:46,490
...unexpected...

1075
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,700
...and weird.

1076
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,460
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

1077
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,170
Goodbye, then.

1078
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,800
Sure you won't change your mind?

1079
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,970
I'm sure.

1080
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:23,320
Okay. Bye.

1081
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:47,720
Things are going to get much better.

1082
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,390
And for once, Grandma Georgina...

1083
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,350
...knew exactly what
she was talking about.

1084
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:59,480
The next morning, Charlie helped
his parents fix the hole in the roof.

1085
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:03,980
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day
out of bed.

1086
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,990
He didn't feel tired at all.

1087
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:11,370
Charlie's father got a better job
at the toothpaste factory...

1088
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:15,080
...repairing the machine
that had replaced him.

1089
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:20,210
Things had never been better
for the Bucket family.

1090
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:24,130
The same could not be said
for Willy Wonka.

1091
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,510
I can't put my finger on it.

1092
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:29,220
Candy's the only thing
I was ever certain of...

1093
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:31,850
...and now I'm just not
certain at all.

1094
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:34,810
I don't know which flavors to make
or which ideas to try.

1095
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,640
I'm second-guessing myself,
which is nuts.

1096
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:42,190
I've always made whatever candy
I felt like, and I...

1097
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:50,450
That's just it, isn't it?

1098
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:55,160
I make the candy I feel like, but now
I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

1099
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:58,910
You're very good.

1100
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:12,850
Pity about that chocolate fellow,
Wendell... Walter.

1101
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,600
- Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.

1102
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:20,350
Says here in the paper his new candies
aren't selling very well.

1103
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:24,570
But I suppose maybe he's just
a rotten egg who deserves it.

1104
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:27,610
- Yep.
- Oh, really?

1105
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:30,070
You ever met him?

1106
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,860
I did.

1107
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:36,740
I thought he was great at first,
but then he didn't turn out so nice.

1108
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,370
He also has a funny haircut.

1109
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:40,870
I do not!

1110
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:44,750
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.

1111
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:47,590
What makes you feel better
when you feel terrible?

1112
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,380
My family.

1113
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,880
Ew.

1114
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,970
What do you have against my family?

1115
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,100
It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...

1116
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,440
They tell you what to do,
what not to do...

1117
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:07,070
...and it's not conducive
to a creative atmosphere.

1118
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:11,490
Usually they're just trying to protect you
because they love you.

1119
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:16,030
If you don't believe me,
you should ask.

1120
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,160
Ask who? My father?

1121
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,250
No way.

1122
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,500
At least, not by myself.

1123
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,290
You want me to go with you?

1124
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:32,800
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

1125
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:37,850
And you know what?
I've got transport...

1126
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:45,020
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

1127
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,890
I think we've got the wrong house.

1128
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,900
Do you have an appointment?

1129
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:36,570
No. But he's overdue.

1130
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:41,870
Open.

1131
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:47,790
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

1132
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,880
Heavens.

1133
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:33,210
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

1134
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,130
Since...

1135
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:49,650
Willy?

1136
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,940
Hi, Dad.

1137
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:06,200
All these years...

1138
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,080
...and you haven't flossed.

1139
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:13,000
Not once.

1140
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,610
It was on this day...

1141
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:42,320
...that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...

1142
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:45,240
...who accepted on one condition.

1143
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,700
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.

1144
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,830
Thought I heard thunder.

1145
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,630
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.

1146
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:56,210
I'll shuffle the plates.

1147
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:08,060
You smell like peanuts.

1148
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:11,810
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.

1149
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:13,650
You smell like...

1150
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,650
...old people and soap.

1151
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:20,240
I like it.

1152
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:27,330
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1153
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:29,870
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

1154
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,580
With licorice instead of string.

1155
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:36,170
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.

1156
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,760
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

1157
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,900
In the end Charlie Bucket
won a chocolate factory.

1158
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:01,940
But Willy Wonka got something
even better:

1159
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:05,070
A family.

1160
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:10,580
And one thing was absolutely certain:

1161
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Life had never been sweeter.
