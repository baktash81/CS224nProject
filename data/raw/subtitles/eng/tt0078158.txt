1
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Nice landing, Uncle Bene.

2
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Right on the 50-yard line.

3
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Should've gone for a touchdown. 

4
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,400
Next time, I'll put it
right between the goalposts.

5
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Can't wait to see the museums
and go to all the concerts.

6
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
That's why we arranged
this little vacation.

7
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,800
We've been so busy establishing
our community on Witch Mountain

8
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
that you two haven't had
an opportunity

9
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
to see what life
in the big city is all about.

10
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
I'd rather go to the beach
and learn how to surf.

11
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,200
There'll be
another time for that.

12
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Just remember what I told you,
and have a lot of fun.

13
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
- It's locked.
- Tia?

14
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Tony, come back here.

15
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Now, never energize unless
it's absolutely necessary.

16
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
Tia?

17
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,800
If earth kids can live here
without energizing, you can too.

18
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
You the party
I'm supposed to pick up?

19
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,400
- Just the children.
- All right.

20
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Meter's running, hop in.

21
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,400
I got it.

22
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
I've been waiting here forever.

23
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,600
You know, people wait for taxis,
not taxis wait for people.

24
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
We're exactly on time.

25
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah, well, kind of a
strange time and place
to be making a pick up.

26
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,800
I mean, if you're here for the
next game, it's in three months.

27
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We have seats
on the 50-yard line.

28
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Deliver the children
to this address.

29
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You'll be paid after you arrive.

30
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
This is a big fare here.

31
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,000
If these kids pay me, I hope
they know I get a big tip.

32
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
- OK. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.
- Goodbye.

34
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Have fun, you two.

35
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
Look at that dummy.

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Get off the road, you dummy.

37
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
These civilians
don't know how to drive.

38
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
They ought to be
kept off the streets.

39
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
The streets belong
to us professional drivers.

40
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Taxis, buses, trucks.

41
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
That's all that should
be allowed on the streets.

42
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You see, I happen to know
a great deal about driving.

43
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I have a perfect safety record. 

44
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on, get out
of the way, you bum.

45
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Thank you. Thank you, Sickle.

46
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Well, this is a perfect test site.

47
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Little traffic...

48
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
...and low real estate value.

49
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
It's adequate, I suppose.

50
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Ok, let's get this over with.
This thing on all right?

51
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
It's ready.

52
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,200
What do you want him
to do this time?

53
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
I want you to
climb that fire escape...

54
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
...to the absolute top.

55
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,600
This is as high as I go.

57
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
You want me to
break somebody's leg?

58
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Just tell me how many pieces.

59
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
But up there, I don't go.

60
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
I will get dizzy. I will fall.

62
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
That is true, Victor.
He has acrophobia...

63
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
...among other things.

64
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Find a different test for him. 

65
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Acrophobia is not
a problem with my device.

66
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Start climbing.

67
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I will do anything else you say,

68
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
but I am not going
up that building, understand?

69
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,600
- I...
- Sickle...

70
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
...I command you
to climb up that fire escape.

71
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
You will go to the very top,

72
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
You will turn around,
and you will look down.

73
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And you will not
be frightened of heights.

74
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Off you go.

75
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
It's working.

76
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,400
It's working!

77
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,200
It seems to be.

78
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Victor. Victor,
you are risking his life.

79
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.

80
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,600
He's the only one
I can leave my...

81
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
...my bankruptcy to.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what experimentation
is all about, Letha.

83
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,400
We cannot afford to lose him.

84
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,600
I am the only one
we cannot afford to lose.

85
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Can't you see that I've got
complete control over his mind?

86
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,400
He has no fear,
no memory, no will.

87
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,000
He can only carry out my commands.

88
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,600
What... what's happening?

89
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
We're out of gas.

90
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you, crazy? Look at
the dial, it points to... empty.

91
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Empty?

92
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,000
It was all that waiting
I had to do for youse. 

93
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll run down the street to the
gas station and get some gas.

94
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Boy, oh, boy.

95
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
You guys are costing me
a lot of dough.

96
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,200
I sure hope you
make the tip worth it. 

97
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Something's going to happen
to someone near here.

98
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,600
We've got to help. 

99
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,000
No, I think you'd better stay
here and wait for the driver.

100
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll go.

101
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,400
I think it came from
back that way.

102
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Be careful.

103
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
And remember what Uncle Bene said.

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
That is enough. Bring him down!

105
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Sickle, turn to your right.

106
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Balance yourself

107
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,800
and walk along the ledge.

108
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Victor, no. Stop.

109
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me. 

110
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Look what you've done.

111
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Sickle, stop.

112
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop.

113
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Sickle, this is Dr. Victor
Gannon commanding you to stop! 

114
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,400
- He's out of control.
- Sickle!

115
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
Go back!

116
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
Sickle!

117
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,000
No! 

118
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Letha... look. 

119
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
- I can't look.
- You must.

120
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
It's miraculous.

121
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
There are no miracles, Letha.

122
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Only scientific explanations
for everything.

123
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, then, just explain to me
what we're seeing.

124
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
It... must be...

125
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
...that... boy.

126
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,400
There's a...
There's a force that...

127
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,200
...centers around that boy.

128
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,400
A force capable
of countermanding

129
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,600
the basic physical law of...
gravity.

130
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Victor, I don't know
what you're talking about.

131
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Molecular mobilization.

132
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I need that boy, Letha.

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,200
- I need him desperately.
- Now, just a minute.

134
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
Brilliant, my boy. Brilliant.

135
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,200
Congratulations, young man,
for a fantastic...

136
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, whatever it was
you just did,

137
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,400
It was absolutely heroic.

138
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
It was nothing, I just...

139
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
Get off  the street!

140
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
- Run!
- Hide!

141
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Here come the goon goons!

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Let's get 'em!

143
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
They run like chickens.

144
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
More goons!

145
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
We're trapped!

146
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Hide or they'll get ya.

147
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Over here.

148
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
It ain't no use
hiding behind those trash cans. 

149
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
The earthquakes'
got girls in their gang.

150
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Let's finish 'em.

151
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,400
Now, where
in the world did that come from?

152
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
It was a set up.

153
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,400
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.

154
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
That was an ambush!

155
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Stop banging into me.

156
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
I can't see.

157
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can't get out. 

158
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Get me out. Get it off me.

159
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Yeah! All right!

160
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
Hey, you really saved us
from getting wiped out.

161
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Yeah, thanks a lot.

162
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,800
- What's your name?
- Tia.

163
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,600
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.

164
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.

165
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
We're the earthquake gang.

166
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Does that scare you?

167
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
No.

168
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
Let's change our name again.

169
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
We gotta have a name that scares.

170
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah.

171
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,600
How'd you do what you done?

172
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,600
Well, I really
didn't do anything.

173
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah. You a magician
or something?

174
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
No. 

175
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
You want to join our gang?

176
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.

177
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,600
- Thanks anyway.
- Aw, sure.

178
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
I guess you're like
the rest of them.

179
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
You've heard we're a nothing gang.

180
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Yeah, well we ain't
always gonna be nothing.

181
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Someday we're gonna
be the toughest.

182
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Take over the whole territory. 

183
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Someday they're gonna run when
they see us coming down the block.

184
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,800
All right.

185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's just that
I've got to find my brother.

186
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
What gang does he belong to?

187
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,800
He doesn't belong to any gang.

188
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,400
I never heard of a Guy
that never belonged to a gang. 

189
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,200
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.

190
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
If anybody could find him, we could.

191
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,600
I mean, we know
this town inside out.

192
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Oh, would you?

193
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
Hey, yeah, sure.

194
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Listen, you done us a big favor,
now we'll do it for you.

195
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Thank you. Thank you very much.

196
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, come on, let's go.

197
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
That Tony sure made himself scarce.

198
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,400
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?

199
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,800
I... I was supposed to
stay at a hotel. 

200
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
But I don't know which one.

201
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,200
You could stay in our hideout.

202
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

203
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.

204
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,600
If we aren't busy
beating up goons.

205
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's Yo-Yo.

206
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,600
- Get down.
- Come on, hide.

207
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

208
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,200
- But he's coming this way.
- Who is he?

209
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
- Our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.

210
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
He's Mr. Yokomoto,
the truant officer.

211
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
He's trying to make us
go back to school.

212
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Let's go.

213
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,400
That's our hideout.

214
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
When do the ghosts get here?

215
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Don't say things like that.

216
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
This place could really scare ya.

217
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Come on.

218
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
This is where we're gonna live
when we run away from home.

219
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, you can't be tough

220
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,800
if you take orders from
your mom or older sister.

221
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
That's why we quit school.

222
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
You can't be tough
and educated, too.

223
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
- Tony!
- Where?

224
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
I had a contact with him.

225
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
You...
You calling on the spirits?

226
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,200
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.

227
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,000
I... I ain't too sure
I wanna meet this Tony.

228
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Tony, where are you?

229
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
He's coming in again.

230
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
I can only see a light.
That's all.

231
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Now it's... going black.

232
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,600
Now it's... completely gone.

233
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
He's doing that?

234
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
He's projecting a magnetic field
through his reflexes

235
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
as he struggles
to regain consciousness.

236
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,400
His output is so great,

237
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
that my machines aren't
even capable of measuring it.

238
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,200
But he's dangerous.

239
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
Once I have control
of his brain, Letha,

240
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
he will only
be dangerous to others.

241
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,800
I hope you realize that
kidnapping's a criminal offense.

242
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,000
My experiments are more
important than the law, Letha.

243
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,600
With these receptors
placed on certain people,

244
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,000
combined with this boy's powers,

245
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
I could become one of the most
influential men in the world.

246
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,600
Oh, you are absolutely
brilliant, professor.

247
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Now we can go ahead
with my plans, too.

248
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,800
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.

249
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,400
A comment, perhaps, on you and
the life you've been leading.

250
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Now, you look here,

251
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,400
doctor, professor,
physicist. Whatever you are.

252
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
I built this laboratory
for you at great expense.

253
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,400
I used every penny I had.

254
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Now, we've made a lot of plans
and I won't let you upset them.

255
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,800
I want some money. Fast.

256
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Letha, we are worlds apart.

257
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
My mind is filled
with large concepts.

258
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Mankind, the universe.

259
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,200
You only worry about the horse
that's running in the third race.

260
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
Sure, I gamble...

261
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
...but with my own money.

262
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,200
You're the worst
kind of gambler.

263
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
You use other people's money

264
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,600
and want to keep all
the winnings for yourself. 

265
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,800
Well, you can be sure
of one thing, Victor.

266
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,400
I'll be around to pick up
the chips with you.

267
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,600
We'll be back in the morning
with maps and breakfast.

268
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I'll bring an egg
from my refrigerator.

269
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,800
And I'll bring some
day-old bread.

270
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.

271
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,200
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.

272
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.

273
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Yeah.

274
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,800
Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.
My mom's gonna yell at me.

275
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
See you tomorrow, Tia.

276
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,400
We'll find Tony
tomorrow for sure.

277
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,800
Let's stay close
together on the way out, guys. 

278
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Good.

279
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This is professor Gannon...

280
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,000
...commanding you to awaken.

281
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Tony!

282
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
He's in some kind of a room.

283
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Like a hospital.

284
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
With machines
and instruments and things.

285
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
Oh, that's easy. 

286
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
All we have to do
is check all the hospitals.

287
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
While we going around
looking for a fight.

288
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Come on.

289
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,000
You will now function
exclusively under control.

290
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
You will no longer
think independently.

291
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
All thinking and reasoning
will be done

292
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
by the voice that commands you. 

293
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Do you understand? 

294
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,600
- Yes.
- What is your name?

295
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
- Tony.
- Where are you from?

296
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Witch Mountain.

297
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,000
Sounds like some hick town to me.

298
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,800
How did you suspend
Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 

299
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,200
By energizing matter.

300
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,600
Do you mean to say that
you can control molecular flow? 

301
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,000
Yes, sir.

302
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,800
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.

303
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,400
I wish to see a demonstration
of molecular flow.

304
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
You are strapped to the table.

305
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.

306
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
Power has come into our hands

307
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,200
which is centuries
before its time.

308
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We must use it wisely.

309
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,200
Well, what can you have him do?

310
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,600
Other than go around making
people's belts unbuckle.

311
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
The possibilities are unlimited.

312
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Oh, come on. It's just
some gimmick, that's all.

313
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Tony...

314
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,000
Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved,

315
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,000
doesn't seem to believe in you. 

316
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony.

317
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Hey, come on.

318
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Hey, get back!

319
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Get back! Get back!

320
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't.

321
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,200
Get back!

322
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,600
I can see how that'd be a big
hit at a scientific convention. 

323
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,200
But the bottom line is,
how do we make money with it?

324
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,000
I will demonstrate
an industrial application. 

325
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Come with me, Tony.

326
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Now, Tony, those wine casks...

327
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,800
stack them... neatly.

328
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Two glasses of burgundy, please.

329
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,200
To molecular mobilization.

330
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,000
To molecular capitalization.

331
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Hey, got any more clues?

332
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
No. 

333
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Nothing at all. It's so strange.

334
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,200
We've been to every hospital
and he's in none of them.

335
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
It's like his mind's a blank.

336
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
He probably conked out somewhere.

337
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,400
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.

338
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Yeah, we'll turn
the town upside down.

339
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
Yeah.

340
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,200
- What're you doing?
- Thinking.

341
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Thinking about us in
a different place, such as...

342
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
Las Vegas...

343
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
...with Tony.

344
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Seven or eleven every time, right? 

345
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
A day at the races.

346
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,400
All the long shots
come in.

347
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,000
You do have
an imagination, after all.

348
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,800
The possibilities
with Tony are unlimited.

349
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
For example, he stacked the wine
casks by just looking at them.

350
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,000
If he can stack them,
he can unstack them.

351
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The gold is on display
at the museum.

352
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,400
Protected by an impenetrable
security system.

353
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Just sitting there
waiting for us...

354
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
...to penetrate it.

355
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,200
Wait a minute. Us?

356
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,600
You mean Gannon said it's ok
to use the control on Tony?

357
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Professor Gannon is
extremely busy being a genius. 

358
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
I own half the invention,

359
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Half of Tony, that means
I own half of the profits.

360
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
So far, the return on
my investment has been
half of zero.

361
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,400
What about security. We'd
need an army to pull it off.

362
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,800
We'll have an army with us!

363
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
Tony.

364
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
Tony?

365
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
Tony?

366
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Tony, why can't I
get through to you?

367
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Tony?

368
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,400
I'll pick up the new
transistors, make a few stops.

369
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Be back later on.

370
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Don't worry.

371
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,200
Everything's under control. 

372
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,800
Tony. This is Letha Wedge,

373
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Commanding you to open your eyes. 

374
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
Now, stand up. 

375
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,800
We're going to the museum
for education and profit.

376
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Tony and I will do
a little... sightseeing.

377
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,600
Wait.

378
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Gold! I see gold.

379
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
- Hey it's mine.
- Where is it?

380
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
- Hey, give it to me!
- No!

381
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,600
A stagecoach.

382
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
She must be tuned in on a western.

383
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,600
Yeah.

384
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
I see dummies.

385
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
That's you.

386
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
No. Old things.

387
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Clothing.

388
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Hey, he's at the salvation army.

389
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,400
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches
at the salvation army.

390
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
They don't got gold, neither.

391
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

392
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,400
We had one of them
nothing school trips.

393
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,200
To the museum. 

394
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, they got a pile of gold.

395
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,600
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.

396
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,200
We've got to go there.

397
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Come on, it's over here.

398
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Now, Tony.

399
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,800
We're going to create
a little diversion.

400
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,200
The stagecoach.

401
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,800
I want you to roll it
all around the museum.

402
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
Look out.

403
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,400
Watch it.

404
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Watch out for that thing,
it's coming this way.

405
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Hey, where are the horses?

406
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,000
I... don't know.

407
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,800
Now cause total chaos.

408
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Watch out.

409
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Short circuit the control system.

410
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Oh, no.

411
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Letha!

412
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Letha!

413
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Look out.

414
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,400
Get out of my way.

415
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Can't you put that thing out?

416
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,000
Come on, take a shot. Move it.

417
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,600
Now, Tony,

418
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Make a hole in the plastic shield.

419
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And it doesn't have to be neat. 

420
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Tony, unstack the gold bars
and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 

421
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,000
Move it buddy, move it.
We gotta get out of here!

422
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,200
Las Vegas, here we come.

423
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,400
Look.

424
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Come on, follow me. 

425
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,000
Tony, make them go faster.

426
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,200
Watch out!

427
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,400
Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!

428
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,200
Look out, lady.

429
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Yeah, why don't you watch where
you're going, you big dummy.

430
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,000
Look out, Eddie!

431
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,800
Tony, what's happening? 

432
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Molecular flow reversing.

433
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,400
- Are you doing this?
- No.

434
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
Then who is?

435
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,200
It would have to be
one of my people.

436
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,600
- There are more like you?
- Yes.

437
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,600
- Let's get out of here.
- Tony!

438
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,200
Tony!

439
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,000
Who's that?

440
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,400
It's my sister.

441
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,800
My sister, Tia.

442
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
This is no time
for a family reunion.

443
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Letha!

444
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,600
Tony!

445
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,800
You fool! How could you do this? 

446
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,600
Not now.

447
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,400
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

448
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
I keep it running perfect.

449
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,200
It's Tony's sister, she did it.
She's as weird as he is.

450
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,800
Tony, I command you to
make this car run perfectly

451
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,200
and continuously without
interference from your sister. 

452
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,600
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.

453
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,600
It's like your brother
doesn't even know you. 

454
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,800
- It's yo-yo. Let's go!
- No. Don't run. 

455
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,400
You crazy? You don't want
to go to that school.

456
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Please, trust me.
Now, come on, hurry.

457
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,600
Hey, wait for me.

458
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,000
Come on, you guys.
Get in there.

459
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,600
- Let's go!
- Come on, get in.

460
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,200
I'm dreaming.

461
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,000
You're surrendering
to the board of education?

462
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,200
Sir, you see that car
going down the street?

463
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,800
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.

464
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,200
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him. 

465
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,000
Another truant? Oh, boy,
we're gonna have a load.

466
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,000
- Hey, what happened?
- Good driving, Yo-Yo.

467
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Yeah, that was neat.

468
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,800
This bus can really move.

469
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Tony, look through the window.

470
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,600
The rear window.

471
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
That minibus is following us.

472
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,400
I command you to place
obstacles in its path. 

473
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,200
City property.
I've damaged city property.

474
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,200
They said
these glasses were shatterproof.

475
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Was that a bus or a bridge?

476
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,200
They're still with us. 

477
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Tony, you must stop her.

478
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,800
Man, that man was really buzzing.

479
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,400
Am I still alive?

480
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,200
They're gaining on us. 

481
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,600
She counteracts
everything that Tony does. 

482
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Tony, you've got to stop her.

483
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,800
We flew!

484
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,600
They must've flown.

485
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,200
Don't you dare try it.

486
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,200
Sickle... Sickle, stop...
Stop over that hill.

487
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,800
Tony, cause the reflection
of the sun on the rear window

488
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,000
to magnify and
shine so brightly

489
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,800
that our pursuers'll
be blinded by it.

490
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,200
Come on, open the doors.

491
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,800
I can't see.

492
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,400
- Yeah.
- Come on, let me out.

493
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,800
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, sure.

494
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Oh, look what's happened
to city property.

495
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,200
No... but I'm still
gonna take you to school.

496
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,400
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.

497
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You jeopardized my life's work. 

498
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,800
My accountants' are desperate.

499
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,400
You've proved yourself
incompetent yet again. 

500
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,800
I don't even know if
I can trust you anymore.

501
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,400
You don't trust me?

502
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,600
I trusted you enough

503
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,000
To make my credit rating
look like Swiss cheese.

504
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Don't tell me
you don't trust me.

505
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,800
We have to trust each other.

506
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,200
Right. I trust everybody.

507
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Yes... Well, fortunately, 

508
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,200
I thought of something
very spectacular

509
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,000
which will satisfy both of us
in terms of prestige and money.

510
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,000
Well, you have the prestige,
I'll take the money.

511
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But, before we celebrate
your return to sanity,

512
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,200
we'd better do something
about Tony's sister.

513
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,600
How did she know
we were at the museum?

514
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,200
I... I'm not certain.

515
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,000
Tony.

516
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,800
How did your sister know
that we were at the museum?

517
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,200
Telepathy.

518
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,800
She'll show up again
and ruin everything.

519
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,200
In that case, she will
have to be, as you would say... 

520
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,200
...Scratched?

521
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,200
Tia.

522
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,600
Tia.

523
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,600
What happened to you?

524
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,000
I can't explain now.

525
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
I've lost the power to energize.

526
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,600
Where are you?

527
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,200
Follow my voice path. Please!

528
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,000
OK. Guide me.

529
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,800
Tony, which way?

530
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,800
This way.

531
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,400
Which way, Tony? Which way? 

532
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,800
Keep moving straight ahead. 

533
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,800
This is the house.

534
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,800
Here, look.

535
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,800
Come on.

536
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,000
Down here.

537
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,200
Be quiet, Alfred, you silly thing.

538
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,000
Tia!

539
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,400
Tony!

540
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,600
I've put her into a state
of comatose neutralization.

541
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,200
Hey, Tia.
We got you some cold hotcakes. 

542
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,800
She ain't here.

543
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,200
Hope she didn't go
looking for Tony without us.

544
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, she needs us.

545
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,800
Tony? Crusher?

546
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Muscles? Rocky?

547
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,600
Dazzler?

548
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,200
Alfred.

549
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Alfred, what's the matter with me?

550
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,200
Where am I?

551
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,400
Alfred, find the earthquakes. 

552
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,600
Listen to me.

553
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,000
What kind of place is that?

554
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,200
That is an underground
plutonium processing plant.

555
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,400
Translate that into financial terms.

556
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,000
Plutonium is
more valuable than gold.

557
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,000
That's why I like scientists. 

558
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,400
They're always discovering
new, expensive things.

559
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,200
It is used in the explosive core
of nuclear missile warheads.

560
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,200
I suppose you're
going to have Tony 

561
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,600
split an atom bomb or something.

562
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
In effect...

563
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,200
...Yes

564
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,200
Well, I didn't count on
killing anybody.

565
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,000
Especially not us. 

566
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,800
It will never go that far.

567
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,400
They will pay
anything to prevent it.

568
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,600
This is the first step
towards my becoming

569
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,200
the most powerful man
in the world.

570
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,800
IDs, please.

571
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,200
Take a powder.

572
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,400
Tony.

573
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,800
Those are the
outer security scanners.

574
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,600
Put them out of commission...

575
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,200
...permanently.

576
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,200
The scanning systems
are malfunctioning. 

577
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,800
All right, let's run
a maintenance check.

578
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,400
Three million bucks, you'd think
these things would work right.

579
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,600
- Where to?
- Andy's place, know it?

580
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,400
Yeah, sure. I know where
everything is. Second and third?

581
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,400
- Fourth and market.
- That one.

582
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,400
- Hop in.
- I'm in a hurry. Could you... 

583
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,600
Don't worry.

584
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,200
Have you there
in a couple of minutes.

585
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,400
Listen.

586
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Feel the power in this cab?

587
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,000
It has lots of power.

588
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,400
You know, everybody tells me,
I ought to be a race driver.

589
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,000
What do you think?

590
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,000
Well, I think you're wrong.

591
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Don't worry about nothing, sir.
I'm a very safe driver.

592
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,000
Want me to tell you how safe?

593
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'll tell you anyway.

594
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,800
I've been driving a hack
for 19 years and 11 months.

595
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:55,400
And in all that time, I never
even put one scratch on a cab. 

596
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,600
In fact, next month,

597
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,400
they're gonna give me
a gold safety award.

598
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,400
What do you think of that?

599
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
Boy, you don't like nothing.

600
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,000
I sure hope you're a good tipper.

601
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,800
I knew there was something about
you that didn't look right.

602
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,800
Hey!

603
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,200
You owe me a fare!

604
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,200
- Officer, that goat's a guy.
- The goat?

605
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,600
The guy became a goat
when I'm driving.

606
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,000
The guy?

607
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
This magician
beat me out of this fare.

608
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,000
The magician?

609
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,000
- My perfect record.
- Record? Oh... record.

610
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,400
I ain't gonna get
the gold safety award. 

611
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,400
Hear that? That must be her. 

612
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,200
Come on.

613
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,400
Help me.

614
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,800
Hey. Watch out.

615
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,800
Get him away.

616
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,400
How'd you get in here?

617
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,800
Hey, come on, get out of here.

618
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Watch out!

619
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,600
He's looking at me
like he knows me.

620
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,200
Hey, what do you want from me? 

621
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,800
Get away!

622
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,200
He's got Tia's vest.

623
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,200
Get him!

624
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,400
Quick.

625
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,200
We're going for coffee now. 

626
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,400
Can I bring you a cup?

627
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,800
May I see your IDs, please?

628
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,800
Tony?

629
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,600
Show him our ID. 

630
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,000
What's happening?

631
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,200
Why?

632
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,600
Don't leave me up here.

633
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,400
Open the door, Tony.

634
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,000
You can't go in there
without IDs.

635
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,400
- Now seal it.
- How do I get down?

636
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,200
Tia!

637
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,600
- Quick, let's get her out.
- Yeah.

638
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,800
Phew, it smells.

639
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,200
It's some kind of a gas.

640
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,400
Come on.

641
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,600
You OK now?

642
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Yes, thank you.

643
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,000
This is some kind of...

644
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,000
...science place.

645
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,400
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.

646
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,800
He was here.

647
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,200
I saw something!

648
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,600
What was it?

649
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,600
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!

650
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,000
A big, round shape.

651
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.

652
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
No way!

653
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,000
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?

654
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,800
- Yes.
- I know where he is.

655
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Let's go!

656
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,600
Hurry, let's go.

657
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Oh, thank you.
And thanks for everything. 

658
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,600
Come on, let's go.

659
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,200
We are about
to make scientific history.

660
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,000
And some money, too, I hope.

661
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,800
You will shut down the complete
cooling system of the furnace.

662
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,000
It's a red light
on the cooling system.

663
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,600
It must be a circuit breaker.

664
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,800
Restart the system.

665
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,000
I can't get a restart.

666
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,400
Hit the backup system. 

667
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,000
It's no-go on backup.

668
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,000
Temperature increasing
in the furnace.

669
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,400
Get that coolant flowing.

670
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,000
- Furnace control.
- Control?

671
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,800
You don't really think you're
controlling anything, do you?

672
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,200
Who is this?

673
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,000
This is Dr. Victor Gannon,

674
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,000
And I have just shut down
your cooling system.

675
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
OK, you've shut it down.
Get it back on again!

676
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,600
Tell him how expensive
it is to put it back on.

677
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,800
In exactly one hour, we shall be
serving grilled plutonium,

678
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,800
medium rare, to the atmosphere
unless the following conditions are met.

679
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,600
What conditions?

680
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,000
Five million dollars in cash.

681
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
A jet waiting at the airport.
A safe escort, of course.

682
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,800
And most important of all,

683
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,000
You will announce
that Dr. Victor Gannon

684
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,600
has achieved molecular control
and mind control.

685
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,600
And this is the first of a series
of worldwide demonstrations of his power.

686
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,800
How long does it take
to count five million dollars? 

687
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,800
We'll have to pay them.

688
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,600
Evacuate the immediate area.

689
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,000
Put Los Angeles on alert.

690
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,800
There's the big round ball.

691
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,400
- Is that it?
- No, it was bigger than that. 

692
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,400
Get outta here.

693
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,400
Leave me alone. At least I tried.

694
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,800
Hey, look. 

695
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,800
It's Yo-Yo. Let's get out of here.

696
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,400
Come on.

697
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,800
Hey, Yo-Yo.
Don't you want to catch us?

698
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,000
I don't trust him.

699
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,400
He's probably using
some psychology trick on us.

700
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,000
Come on.

701
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,400
Hey, Mr. Yo-yo,
don't you want to catch us?

702
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,200
It's not my job anymore.

703
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,800
They're coming down to fire me...

704
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
...for destroying city property.

705
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,400
The only thing that works is the
radio. And it won't turn off.

706
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,200
I was only trying to help you, kids.

707
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
Mr. Yokomoto,

708
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,600
I'm sorry about
everything that's happened.

709
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,000
All I ever wanted in life

710
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,800
was all you kids that
I put back in school, someday...

711
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
...visit me and say,

712
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,200
"thanks Mr. Yo-Yo, Yokomoto.

713
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:01,000
If it wasn't for you
forcing us to get an education,

714
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,800
We would've been bums."

715
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,800
That's all I wanted.

716
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You see?
I told you he was gonna...

717
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,200
...hit us with
some of that heavy psychology. 

718
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,600
I mean, I feel guilty.

719
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,200
Bulletin from the plutonium plant.

720
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,600
Unless the demands
of the terrorists are met,

721
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,600
the furnace will explode
with the force of ten megatons.

722
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,000
An official describes
the atomic furnace controls
as frozen in position,

723
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,600
- As if "the molecular flow..."
- That's Tony!

724
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,800
- The plant is being evacuated.
- That's where he is!

725
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,800
- We've got to go there.
- How? Take a bus?

726
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,000
- We'll go in this.
- Tia, the tires are flat.

727
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,600
Come on.

728
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,400
If it doesn't start cooling soon,

729
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,000
the chain reaction will start.

730
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,600
You hear that? In ten minutes,

731
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,800
this place is going to be
a hole in the ground.

732
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,600
Now, let's be reasonable.

733
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,800
We have three and a half million
dollars in the control room.

734
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,200
And the balance is on the way. 

735
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,200
It's a deal.

736
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,000
I do not compromise.

737
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,600
- Hey, what are you guys doing?
- Nothing! Nothing!

738
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,400
We're doing nothing.

739
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,400
Hey, kids!

740
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,000
How did these children
get past security?

741
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,400
Sir, the people destroying the
furnace kidnapped my brother.

742
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
If I could see him,
I might stop them. 

743
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,600
- She can do it!
- She can do it.

744
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,200
- Do what?

745
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Impossible, they're inside the room.

746
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,000
They've sealed the door somehow.

747
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,200
- What part has to be fixed?
- The emergency cooling system. 

748
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,600
- Where is it?
- Five levels down.

749
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,400
But it's too late. We've already
begun to evacuate the plant.

750
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,400
Tony's here, all right.

751
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,600
Get me down.

752
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,800
Thank you, thank you.
Now, where are you going?

753
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,600
In there.

754
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,400
Oh, no. You can't go
beyond this point without IDs.

755
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,000
Tony!

756
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,600
- Tia!
- I knew it.

757
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,800
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.

758
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,200
We cannot let her
take it away from us.

759
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,600
Tony!

760
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,800
Tony, from this moment
you will no longer hear Tia.

761
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,200
She cannot break through
my power of control.

762
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,200
- Acknowledge.
- Tony, what's wrong?

763
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,000
It's me, your sister. 

764
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,400
Try to remember me.

765
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,200
Acknowledge.

766
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
Tony?

767
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,600
- Yes, sir.
- Get those kids.

768
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,200
She'll use some of those
molecules on us.

769
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,600
I'll take care of her before
she gets a chance, you get them.

770
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,800
I can't get through.

771
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,000
I don't know what
they've done to his mind.

772
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,600
We've got to find the emergency
cooling system ourselves.

773
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,600
How do you spell cooling?

774
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,200
Come on.

775
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
Look out.

776
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,800
We've got to find
the emergency switches.

777
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,400
You two go that way,
and you two go that way.

778
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,000
Tony, we must eliminate Tia. 

779
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,600
You will cause that portable
utility panel to run her down. 

780
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,400
Hey, Tia, come here.

781
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,000
Come on.

782
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,200
That ain't it, right?

783
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,000
- You found it!
- I knew it was it!

784
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,200
But, it's spelt wrong.

785
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,000
You guys get
dazzler and muscles.

786
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,800
OK. Come on.

787
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,800
The rest of the money's
just arrived.

788
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,200
All right.

789
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,800
I'd better call Gannon.

790
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
The cooling system's on.

791
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,200
Switch it off.

792
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,600
We lost it!

793
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,000
What's going on down there?

794
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,000
It's coming back.

795
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,400
650, 600...

796
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,000
Gotcha!

797
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,000
Tony, you must stop her.

798
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,000
Tony, why are you
doing these things?

799
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,000
Why are you using
your powers against me?

800
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,400
What's happened?

801
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,600
Tony...

802
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,200
...pretend to remember Tia.

803
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,600
Lure her to the
center of the room and...

804
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,200
...make that crane drop on her.

805
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,400
Tia!

806
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,200
I'm starting to remember.

807
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,600
What was the matter with you?

808
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,400
I don't know, exactly... but... 

809
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,000
I need help.

810
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,600
Don't go any closer.

811
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,600
Why? What is it, Tony?

812
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:43,600
Tony, stop it!
Stop it, Tony, stop it!

813
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,400
Exert a force
greater than hers.

814
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,000
Why are you doing this, Tony?
Stop.

815
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,200
Crush her. Kill her!

816
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,600
Crush her! 

817
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,800
Crush her! Crush her!

818
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,200
Finish her!

819
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,600
Now!

820
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,000
Tia.

821
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Where are we?
What's happened? 

822
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,000
Tony. 

823
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,800
Tony, we can still do it.

824
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,600
We can still make use
of molecular control.

825
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,200
OK, doc, let's do it.

826
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,200
Letha!

827
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,800
Why don't we
all go and have some...

828
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:22,600
some candy and, uh,
sodas and ice cream?

829
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,400
Next time...

830
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,600
- ...next time I'll...
- Forget it.

831
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,200
I've lost my faith in science.

832
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,400
Sickle!

833
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,600
Aunt Letha! Oh, aunt Letha.

834
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,200
Help.

835
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,000
Aunt Letha? Aunt Letha? 

836
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,000
It's absolutely dreadful the way
they bring up children these days.

837
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,000
Come on.

838
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,400
Tony, the bus won't run
without me in it.

839
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,200
It's all my fault.
It's such a mess.

840
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,800
Well, I guess we'll
just have to fix it.

841
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,400
I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind.

842
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,600
I'll do the engine.
You do the body work.

843
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,600
- OK.
- So long, Alfie.

844
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,800
Goodbye, Alfred.

845
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,800
What job will you do now,
Mr. Yo-Yo, uh, Yokomoto?

846
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,600
Oh, I've saved my money.

847
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,600
I'll probably open
a Japanese delicatessen.

848
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,400
Hey, kids, look.

849
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,600
I don't understand this.

850
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,600
- Man!
- Wow, what a family.

851
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,000
The molecules must have
rearranged themselves...

852
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,800
- ...somehow.
- Uh, that's a possibility.

853
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,400
You know what this means?
They never saw the wreck.

854
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,000
I'll tell them that the reports
were exaggerated.

855
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And, if you kids
will go back to school,

856
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,600
I'm sure they won't fire me. 

857
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,200
You will go back to school,
won't you?

858
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,200
Well, if we was
to go back to school,

859
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,400
could we get as smart
as Tia and Tony?

860
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,200
- Maybe even smarter.
- Yeah, sure.

861
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,600
Let's give it a shot.

862
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,000
Great.

863
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,200
I hope the school can take it. 

864
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,200
- Goodbye, Yo-Yo.
- Goodbye.

865
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,200
- See you later, Yo-Yo.
- You promised.

866
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,400
Tia, open the gate.

867
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,800
No, everybody join hands.

868
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,000
Cool!

869
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,600
All right!

870
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,600
Flying saucer!

871
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,400
Will we ever see you again?

872
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,000
Well, it's...

873
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
it's kind of
hard to say.

874
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,800
Thanks for everything.

875
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,000
And especially for
letting me be in your gang.

876
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,000
Take care of Alfred for me, OK?

877
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,600
There you are.

878
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,800
- Where's your luggage?
- Uh, we lost it.

879
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,600
There were a few problems.

880
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,800
- But you did have fun?
- Oh, terrible.

881
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,600
I just knew we
should have gone surfing.

882
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,000
Hey. Let's do it the way
Tia and Tony taught us.

883
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Yeah.

884
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,800
- Ready?
- One, two, three!

885
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,000
- Hey, Yo-Yo!
- Yo-Yo!

886
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,600
Guess what!

887
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Tia and Tony just drove off
in a flying saucer.

888
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,400
Flying saucer?

889
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,200
How about whooshing
yourself into the bus?

890
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,000
But, it's true.

891
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,200
Lookit, I saw those two kids
do miraculous things.

892
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,600
I believe anything and
everything, except that. Get in.

893
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,400
I hope this school teaches
about flying saucers.

894
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,200
Yeah.

895
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:59,000
Flying saucers.
