00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:15,758
IT IS LIKELY THE MUSEUM'S FAMED
VASE FROM THE MING DYNASTY

238
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:17,458
WAS THE TARGET.

TO REPORT.

FORMING A TASK FORCE

STIFF UPPER LIP
AND A SHOT AT NEGOTIATION.

KNOWS THEM INSIDE AND OUT.

437
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,840
KNOWS WHEN TO HIT,
WHERE TO HIT, AND WHAT TO HIT.

438
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,440
- STAKING THE PLACES OUT.

439
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,273
- FOR DAYS, MAYBE WEEKS.

440
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,140
AND HE ONLY HITS
THE BIG TARGETS.

441
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,507
ESTATES FIRST, DIAMONDS
AND SAPPHIRES,

442

LEFT TO HIT.

ON THE TOP OF THE LIST.

452
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,374
FILL ME ON THE DETAILS,
ALL RIGHT?

453
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,108

THE WRONG WAY.

WE'RE WAITING FOR THE CAT
TO STRIKE,

455
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,740
AND THEN WE START LOOKING

WHAT IF WE WERE A STEP AHEAD
RATHER THAN A STEP BEHIND?

457
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:01,541
- WELL, I LIKE IT,
BUT HOW?

458
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,174
- GOING BY WHAT THE CAT
HAS STOLEN,

459
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,475
THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO
MORE PLACES FOR HIM TO HIT.

460
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,641
BASED ON THE INSIDE INFORMATION
HE OBTAINS,

461
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:11,141
WE KNOW THAT HE STAKES OUT HIS
TARGET LONG BEFORE THE ROBBERY.

462
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:16,441
- SO WE STAKE OUT THE TARGETS
AND WE CATCH HIM BEFORE HE ROBS.

463
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:17,842
- YES, LIEUTENANT FOGLE,

464

START WITH THE DA VINCI EXHIBIT
AND THEN WORK FROM THERE.

472
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:33,875
I'M GOING TO GO HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH THE FENCE

473
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,442
AND I'LL PICK UP A PIZZA
ON THE WAY BACK.

474
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,109

THE DESK WORK?

1049
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,163
- DANIEL HARGROVE WOULD.

1050
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:20,629

COMPANY BASED HERE IN IOWA.

1051

1058
01:07:35,863 --> 01:07:39,229
AND IF HE HAS ONE,
WHY DOESN'T HE TELL ANYBODY?

1059
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:41,229
- PRIVACY?
SECURITY?

1061

FUDGESICLES.

1063

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1200
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:04,649
SAM?
- EMMA.

1201
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:06,582
EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

1202
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:08,949
THE CAT IS MY PRISONER.

1203
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:11,216
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU WAKE UP
MY DAD

1204
01:21:11,216 --> 01:21:13,715
AND TELL HIM THAT THE REST
OF HIS CAREER IS WAITING FOR HIM

1205
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:19,183
AT THE DES MOINES
MINI WAREHOUSE COMPLEX.

1206
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:21,183
- WILL DO, SAM STEELE JR.,

1207
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:23,716
PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

1208
01:21:29,716 --> 01:21:33,949
MRS. STEELE!
HE'S ALL RIGHT!

1209
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:38,449
- THANK GOODNESS.
WHERE IS HE?

1210
01:21:38,449 --> 01:21:40,917
- HE'S AT THE DES MOINES
MINI WAREHOUSE COMPLEX,

1211
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:42,783
AND HE'S CAPTURED THE CAT.

1212
01:21:42,783 --> 01:21:44,750
- OH!
OH, MY.

1213
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,650
AND IT'S ALMOST DAWN.
I'M GOING TO CALL HIS FATHER.

1214
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,783
THANK YOU, EMMA.

1215
01:21:49,783 --> 01:21:52,217
- DOUG, WE DID IT.

1216
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:05,917
- HE'S IN HERE.

1217
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:12,883
- I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1218
01:22:12,883 --> 01:22:15,184
YOU ARE GROUNDED FOR A YEAR.

1219
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:16,250
thud!

1220
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,217
- HE'S BEEN COMPLAINING
ALL NIGHT.

1221
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:20,184
WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM OUT?

1222
01:22:20,184 --> 01:22:22,717
- CAT!
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.

1223
01:22:22,717 --> 01:22:24,717
IF YOU HAVE A WEAPON,
PUT IT DOWN.

1224
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:26,517
WE'LL SEE HOW MANY LIVES
YOU HAVE.

1225
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:28,350
- HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!

1226
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:38,185
STEP FORWARD.

1227
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:40,451
- THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL
"SURROUNDED"?

1228
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:43,185
- WE LIED.

1229
01:22:43,185 --> 01:22:44,584
- MUST BE WHERE HE'S KEEPING
ALL THE LOOT.

1230
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,218
KEEP IT TILL ALL THE HEAT
WAS OFF.

1231
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:54,918
AND I SUPPOSE THIS IS
THE PRIVATE EYE

1232
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:56,718
WHO CAPTURED ME, HUH?

1233
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:58,485
- YES, SIR, MR. CAT.

1234
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:00,418
YOU'RE JUST A VICTIM
OF SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED

1235
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:04,451
DETECTIVE WORK.

1236
01:23:04,451 --> 01:23:05,552
- THERE'S A SCOOTER INSIDE.

1237
01:23:05,552 --> 01:23:08,285
CAN I HAVE IT
IF IT'S NOT STOLEN?

1238
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:09,351
- DIBS ON THE SCOOTER.

1239
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:12,852
- DIBS. DIBS.
I HATE DIBS.

1240
01:23:22,852 --> 01:23:26,219
- I NEVER BELIEVED THAT BEING
A GOOD DETECTIVE WAS HEREDITARY,

1241
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,352
BUT WHERE DETECTIVE SAM STEELE
AND HIS SON ARE CONCERNED,

1242
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:32,419
THAT IS THE CASE.

1243
01:23:32,419 --> 01:23:34,186
NOW, DETECTIVE STEELE

1244
01:23:34,186 --> 01:23:38,286
AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT,
DETECTIVE FOGLE

1245
01:23:38,286 --> 01:23:41,319
HAVE MADE US PROUD
BY STAYING ON THE CASE

1246
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:44,619
AND MAKING THE ARREST
OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS THIEF

1247
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:47,219
EVER TO VICTIMIZE
THE GOOD CITIES OF DES MOINES

1248
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:48,853
AND WEST DES MOINES.

1249
01:23:48,853 --> 01:23:50,619
AND FROM THIS DAY ON,

1250
01:23:50,619 --> 01:23:53,286
ANY TIME I HAVE A CASE
THAT NEEDS SOLVING,

1251
01:23:53,286 --> 01:23:58,786
I WON'T HESITATE TO CALL ON
THE JUNIOR DETECTIVE AGENCY.

1252
01:23:58,786 --> 01:24:02,953
NOW, SAM AND EMMA AND DOUG

1253
01:24:02,953 --> 01:24:06,287
HAVE PROVEN THEIR WORTH
TO THIS DEPARTMENT.

1254
01:24:06,287 --> 01:24:09,753
NOW THE MAYOR WILL PRESENT
