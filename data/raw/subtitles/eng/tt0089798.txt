00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,125
Jersey City, N.J.
Home of the Jersey Journal

4
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,122
-Can l help you?
-Well, l called for her last night.

5
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,241
Her husband died last night.

6
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:41,767
His picture was in the paper once,
but you misspelled his name.

7
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:43,760
She wants to be sure you get it right.

8
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:46,966
-You see, it's not one, but two "i"s.
-You want obituaries.

9
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,517
lt's the guy in the back
with the urn on his desk.

10
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,805
What funeral home was she taken to?

11
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:55,718
How old was she?

12
00:00:58,209 --> 00:00:59,403
What did she die of?

13
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:03,481
Well, l have to know what she died of
or l can't write the obit.

14
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,802
l don't make the rules.

15
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,078
Could l call you back? Thank you.

16
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,802
Excuse me, will you?

17
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:19,998
Tom?

18
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,999
Tom, look, l cannot take this anymore.

19
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:26,286
You got to get me off the obit desk.
l can't write another obituary.

20
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,247
Calm down, Adam. Relax.
lt isn't going to last forever.

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,557
Think of it this way:

22
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,722
This is your last chance in journalism
to write anything nice about anybody.

23
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,644
Perfect.

24
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,925
New York City - Five Years Later

25
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,920
So, you can't talk to me about the arrest.

26
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:04,558
Can you talk to me about after the arrest?
You know, his time in prison.

27
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:05,957
lt was terrible.

28
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,918
He was in shock the entire time.

29
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:13,362
He lost a lot of weight
because he couldn't eat the food.

30
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,644
He couldn't sleep.

31
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,440
They had him in the same cell
with a Mafia hit man.

32
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,962
-He was afraid to close his eyes for a week.
-lnteresting.

33
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,842
For a man like him...

34
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,645
...that was cruel and unusual punishment.

35
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:29,563
l'll say.

36
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,606
What do you think, Charlie?
Can you get him to talk to me?

37
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,359
He's not talking to any press, Adam.

38
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,442
He doesn't trust you guys.

39
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,004
l don't blame him.

40
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,565
There's been a lot of bad press lately.

41
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,649
l thought he'd want to tell
his side of the story.

42
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,765
The only way to do that is an interview.

43
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,159
Especially if he feels that the government
is screwing around on him.

44
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:54,043
Now, l didn't exactly say that.

45
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,604
Anyway, not for the record.

46
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,597
l don't want you to twist what l said
out of shape.

47
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:02,244
Right.

48
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,004
The problem is, the only people that
will talk to me are people that hate him.

49
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,649
And l'm doing this story
whether l talk to him or not.

50
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,324
So don't fault me if this is a negative piece.

51
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,285
That sounds vaguely like a threat.

52
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:19,328
No, l think that if he wants a chance,
he's got to turn his press around.

53
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,518
You reporters think
you make the world turn.

54
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,248
l don't know about that.

55
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,323
You know, l used to be a reporter myself...

56
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,164
...until l got tired of starving my family.

57
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,129
That's why l got into public relations.

58
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,364
-To make a living wage. l love it.
-Yeah.

59
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:39,878
l really do.

60
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,282
Excuse me. l have to take a piss.

61
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,718
-Am l interrupting something?
-No. Adam, come on in and look at this.

62
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:39,125
-Frankie strikes again.
-Look at that. They're good.

63
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,928
At last someone has managed
to capture his true essence.

64
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,166
Look at this one.
l can't believe that she got him to do this.

65
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,841
Believe me, it was easy.

66
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,884
l think this will be the one
we use on the cover.

67
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,967
-You like it?
-l like it.

68
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,161
-You want to get some lunch?
-Yeah.

69
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,444
-Frankie, you want to join us?
-Absolutely.

70
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,201
How did it go this morning?

71
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,199
Fascinating.

72
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,804
He insisted we meet at the Atrium Club,
saying it was a safe place to talk.

73
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,677
He implied the government had a reason
for putting McKenzie out of business.

74
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,884
He was so nervous.

75
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,847
-But what about the interview?
-He thought it was doubtful.

76
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,087
-There's no story without an interview.
-Or without pictures.

77
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,888
You don't want to recycle
the same wire service photos.

78
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,245
-l'd love to shoot him.
-You'd make him pose with coke in his lap.

79
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,480
-l can make him do anything.
-Come on, you guys.

80
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:33,845
l have an idea.

81
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,399
McKenzie has a hearing tomorrow,
in Los Angeles, to reduce his bail.

82
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,838
But he needs the $2 million
to pay his lawyers.

83
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:42,602
Why don't l fly out there tonight
and get the interview?

84
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,647
-You hate flying.
-l'm fine, as long as there's no turbulence.

85
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:48,004
When it starts bouncing around,
l get drunk.

86
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:51,445
lf you're going, let's find a story
for you to do at the same time...

87
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,488
...in case it doesn't work out. l don't want
you wasting your time or my money.

88
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:58,726
You cheap fuck.
You want two stories for the price of one?

89
00:06:58,849 --> 00:06:59,759
Fine.

90
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,921
l have an idea for a story
that would take place in California.

91
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:03,759
What?

92
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,158
l got the idea at the Atrium Club,
this morning.

93
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,638
-Who would you be going after?
-Not who, what.

94
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,527
-Excuse me, what will you be going after?
-Health clubs.

95
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,243
-Groan.
-No.

96
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,958
l'll do a story about how they're
turning into the singles bars of the '80s?

97
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,199
Find a couple. Do a non-fiction love story.

98
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,122
-With pictures.
-Lots of them. lt could be hilarious.

99
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,804
Particularly set in Los Angeles.
You know, inflated bodies. Airheads.

100
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,959
-Hot tubs? Alfalfa sprouts?
-Absolutely.

101
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,882
We haven't done L.A. in a long time.
lt would be wonderful.

102
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:32,163
-Sounds great.
-Shit.

103
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,559
-What?
-Carly Simon just walked in.

104
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:35,525
Oh, God.

105
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,523
-She hated the story you did on her.
-l know, l know.

106
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,001
-Hi, Carly.
-Hi, Carly.

107
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,245
Hi, Carly.

108
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,681
-l read that shit you wrote about me.
-Come on, Carly.

109
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,159
The only thing worse than being
written about is not being written about.

110
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,722
There is a motion with respect to the bail
for Mr. McKenzie.

111
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,646
-ls that correct?
-lt is, Your Honour.

112
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,685
-Yes. ls there a written motion?
-No.

113
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,087
l'd like to make an oral presentation.

114
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,125
-You filed the notice?
-Yes, Your Honour.

115
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,558
All right, then, go ahead
and state your reasons.

116
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,287
Then the government may reply.

117
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,486
We are seeking a reduction in bail
based on two major things:

118
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:48,364
One, Mr. McKenzie is simply
not as wealthy as the government...

119
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,639
...and the press, for that matter, imagines.

120
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:54,244
Let's leave the press out of it.
They have nothing to do with setting bail.

121
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,647
Here they come.

122
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,246
-Charlie, what about the interview?
-He's not talking to anybody.

123
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,968
-Period.
-lf he changes his mind, l'll be at--

124
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,882
He's not changing his mind.
He's flying to New York today.

125
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,922
The Sunset Marquis.

126
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,162
The Sunset Marquis!

127
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,039
Hello.

128
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,687
<i>-Adam?</i>
-Yeah.

129
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,084
<i>-How's it going?</i>
-lt's going fine.

130
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,643
He got his bail reduced,
but l couldn't talk to him.

131
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,401
He had to go back to New York.

132
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:47,118
l'm working on some other angles.
l'm trying to locate some friends of his.

133
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,086
l started the piece. lt's real good.

134
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:52,480
-ln other words, no interview?
-Come on, Mark, please.

135
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,208
The story is great,
and the material l have is terrific.

136
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:58,838
-lt should be a cover.
-You get the interview and we'll talk cover.

137
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,126
Simon & Schuster just made an inquiry
for me to do this as a book.

138
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,478
Cover would help.

139
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,685
l'm not in the goddamn book business.

140
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,878
-Have you found a health club yet?
<i>-Yes, I found an ad in the phone book.</i>

141
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,645
The club's name is The Sports Connection.

142
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,808
"Health club, racquetball, and good times.

143
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,244
"We're a totally new concept
in athletic club.

144
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,684
"We're more than a club, we're a lifestyle."

145
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,557
Then it has this illustration of a couple
in sports clothes hugging each other.

146
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:25,998
lt sounds perfect.

147
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,559
<i>What kind of story are you planning to do?</i>

148
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,686
<i>Maybe something about</i>
<i>couples meeting here, falling in love...</i>

149
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,839
<i>-...getting married.</i>
<i>-That sounds good.</i>

150
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,444
<i>Let's go down and get you a membership,</i>
<i>so you can see what's happening.</i>

151
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,042
<i>Now that sounds even better.</i>

152
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,722
Nanette, where did you get this idea
to make this place...

153
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,198
...more than a health club,
like your ad says?

154
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,288
l looked around the city and l saw
that people had had it with singles bars.

155
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:53,441
They even had the supermarkets
staked out. That was getting boring.

156
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,245
Really?

157
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,878
There wasn't anywhere people could
get together in a healthy environment...

158
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,880
...and have some social interaction.

159
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,764
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, hold it.

160
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,919
Michael and l, he's my partner,
thought it'd be great to create a place...

161
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,569
...like the lodge at the bottom of the hill
in Aspen.

162
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,879
Where people could share
a common interest.

163
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,448
-All right.
-Phone, Nanette.

164
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,042
-Take a message, okay?
-Okay.

165
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:19,041
My concept was to get people
out of their potato chip bags...

166
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,519
...into the club by convincing them
it didn't have to be drudgery.

167
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,167
-That it could be fun.
-Right.

168
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,763
-l'll get somebody to show you around.
-Sounds good.

169
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,042
We have nine racquetball courts.
These two courts are our challenge courts.

170
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,524
-The winner stays on, loser gets off.
-Really?

171
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,167
Then, you have a lounge area.

172
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:39,639
lt's a good place to sit and relax,
before and after your workout.

173
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,762
Your entrance and registration area.

174
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,403
And then we have Pete's Pro Shop.
They have the latest in workout apparel...

175
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,241
...and racquetball equipment.

176
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,965
Then you have the snack bar.
They have fruit juices, great smoothies.

177
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,005
-Beer and wine?
-No wine, just beer.

178
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,284
-You can get a beer after your workout.
-Good.

179
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,166
-And great sandwiches.
-Sprouts?

180
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,318
-Definitely.
-Yes.

181
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,684
-Are you into health food?
-No, not really.

182
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,839
Okay, let's look at Body Dynamics.

183
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,489
What they do in here
is personal fitness assessments.

184
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,720
They do cardiovascular testing,
nutritional analysis...

185
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:13,687
...hydrostatic weighing,
or weighing the body underwater.

186
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,999
lt helps determine
your percentage of body fat.

187
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,000
Then, you have
an hour-and-a-half-long consultation.

188
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:22,678
-And here we have the coed gym.
-So this is where all the action takes place.

189
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,044
On the free weights,
the universal equipment...

190
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,165
...the Nautilus, and lcarian equipment.

191
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:30,605
-l feel guilty, all these people working out.
-And the Lifecycle bikes.

192
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,202
-Hi, Bobby.
-Hi, Linda.

193
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:35,804
-l miss you. l never see you anymore.
-Adam, Linda. Linda, Adam.

194
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,844
Hello, Linda.

195
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,761
l mean it. l really miss you.

196
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,485
l worked up here as an instructor
before l was promoted to sales.

197
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,037
-l see.
-He used to work on my body.

198
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,681
-Looking good.
-God knows, l try.

199
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,648
l'm still in the "before" group,
not the "after," but l'm gonna get there.

200
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,167
-Where's Sally?
-She's there, working out with Roger.

201
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,369
-Trying to make her tits even bigger.
-Well, see you.

202
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,881
-Nice meeting you.
-You, too.

203
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,324
-What's her story?
-She was a mess.

204
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,367
-What do you mean?
-No one works as hard to get in shape.

205
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,758
-Really?
-Hi, Sally. Hi, Roger.

206
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,717
-Five.
-He's killing me.

207
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:15,484
-Come on, let's go, back to work.
-How many? Just three more.

208
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,877
-That's a couple you should talk to.
-Who are they?

209
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,688
Sally works with Linda
at the Apparel Mart, downtown.

210
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,078
And Roger,
he's a stripper at Chippendales.

211
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,525
-lnteresting. l do want to talk to them.
-Nice people. They met here.

212
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,086
-You'll have such a good time, l promise.
-Come on, come on!

213
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,125
How big do you want them?

214
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:36,685
Can l get a list of couples that met here,
and their phone numbers?

215
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,079
-lt's against policy to give phone numbers.
-Can't you bend the rules?

216
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,761
l really don't have much time.

217
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,646
-l'll see what l can do.
-Thank you.

218
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:46,243
-Kenny, this is Adam Lawrence.
-How you doing?

219
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:50,368
He's a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
Kenny can answer questions if l'm not in.

220
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:53,043
-Nanette said you're looking for couples.
-Yeah.

221
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,688
l'm a big fan of yours.

222
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,919
-Really?
-Yeah, l subscribe to <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

223
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:00,126
l read your piece on Carly Simon.
l thought it was great.

224
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,403
So did l.

225
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,837
l bet lots of lustful matinees
get started here.

226
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,559
-What? What do you mean?
-Excuse me, l mean, social interaction.

227
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,204
-Let me show you the rest of the club.
-Okay.

228
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,999
By the way,
what kind of story are you writing?

229
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,478
This is aerobics and "slimnastics."

230
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:38,717
That's Jessie Wilson.

231
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,927
She's probably the best female instructor
we got right now.

232
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,998
They call her "the Aerobics Pied Piper."

233
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,923
-A lot of couples met in her class.
-Really?

234
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:55,443
Turn it around.

235
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,407
l'm going back to my workout.

236
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,968
-Enjoy the class.
-Thanks.

237
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,404
-Nice meeting you.
-lt was very nice meeting you.

238
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:14,277
Squeeze. Release. Squeeze. Release.

239
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,323
Toes out!

240
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,282
Shoulders down.

241
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:36,967
Really tighten your thighs!

242
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,038
Touch down!

243
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:57,805
Straight leg, left. Go!

244
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:03,607
Hold it down on two<i>....</i>

245
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,483
Hold it!

246
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,205
Let's go!

247
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,400
-'Night, Kim.
-Goodnight, Jessie.

248
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,921
-Hi, Shirley.
-Hi, Jessie.

249
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:22,965
Jessie.

250
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,365
-Adam Lawrence. Hi.
-Hi.

251
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,202
-l really enjoyed your class. You're great.
-Thanks.

252
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,205
l'm a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
l'm writing on the Sports Connection.

253
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,484
-Really?
-Yeah.

254
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,127
-<i>Rolling Stone</i>?
-Yes.

255
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,248
l'd love to interview you.

256
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,208
-Why?
-Why not?

257
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,359
-l can think of a lot of reasons.
-lt would be good for business.

258
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,043
Business is fine.

259
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,523
You think about it.
l'll be around for a few days.

260
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,443
l will, but l don't change my mind
about anything.

261
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,287
Could you give me a reason why?

262
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,888
l read magazines.

263
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,600
<i>The Star Garden Club is proud to present...</i>

264
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,762
<i>...direct from New York City,</i>
<i>the one and only...</i>

265
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,277
<i>...Shotsy.</i>

266
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,600
-Jessie, hi.
-Hi.

267
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,759
-Did you think about it?
-Very, very hard.

268
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,521
-Did you change your mind?
-No.

269
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:24,041
-Well, l'll get someone else to interview.
-l guess you will.

270
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:27,406
Maybe you don't understand.
l may want you as the focus of my story.

271
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,765
No, you don't understand.
l don't want to be the focus of anything.

272
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:34,405
Okay, you don't have to be the focus.
l just need your viewpoint.

273
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,083
Last time l counted,
there were 90 aerobic instructors.

274
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,162
-But your classes are the biggest, sexiest--
-Are you deaf? No!

275
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:43,638
-What's the problem?
-l was burned once.

276
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,681
l don't intend to get burned again.

277
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,721
-The battery's dead.
-No kidding. lt happens all the time.

278
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,088
Where's your car?

279
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:57,841
l have jumper cables.

280
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,604
-You okay?
-Yeah.

281
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:04,125
l can never remember
which is positive or negative. Try that.

282
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,880
-All right.
-Keep it going.

283
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,045
Okay, l have an idea.

284
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,719
l know you don't want to be interviewed.

285
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,084
-But how about dinner tonight?
-Sorry.

286
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,362
How about lunch tomorrow?

287
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,244
-All off the record?
-Just like regular people.

288
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,362
-Hello.
-Hi.

289
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:37,122
l'm sorry to call so late,
but l just got your message.

290
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,403
What's going on?

291
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,286
<i>-Are you all right?</i>
-Yeah. Why?

292
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,600
Hold on, l'm putting you on speaker.

293
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:47,284
l got a call from a guy l know who's in
the shady end of the record business.

294
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,964
He said you're ringing the wrong doorbells
and might end up in the hospital.

295
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,198
Make sense to you?

296
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:55,083
l don't know.
l've been poking around, but<i>....</i>

297
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:58,881
l made contact
with one of his old girlfriends today.

298
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,039
Maybe somebody's nervous about that.

299
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,405
l called just to say watch yourself.

300
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,766
l want you to promise me
you'll be real careful on this one, okay?

301
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:09,317
Anyway, how's the other one?
Have you found a hook?

302
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:12,521
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
l found this terrific opportunity.

303
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,397
lt's not the kind of story l had in mind
at first, but it's pretty good. Listen.

304
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:21,160
There's a girl at the Sports Connection
who they call "the Aerobics Pied Piper."

305
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,043
She's got this following
of leotards and sweat suits.

306
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,643
She's fun to watch,
so lots of couples meet there.

307
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:28,845
Sounds good. Maybe that will work.

308
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:32,201
lt's great. The only problem is
she doesn't want to cooperate.

309
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,678
-But she will.
-l'm sure she will.

310
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:38,398
Just remember, get close to her
while you research, but when you write--

311
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:42,443
Forget she has a mother. Right.
Don't l always?

312
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:44,685
-Talk to you later.
<i>-'Bye.</i>

313
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,207
So, who's going to get
the Lawrence treatment this time?

314
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,877
Some girl he met.

315
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,167
-That's obvious.
-So what's the hook of your story?

316
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:00,244
lt's not one of those pieces about how
health clubs are the new singles bars?

317
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,205
God forbid.

318
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:05,325
-Do you work out?
-Yes, l do work out, when l have time.

319
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,040
l don't take it as seriously as you guys do,
but l do work out.

320
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:12,280
My dad didn't take it seriously, either.
He died fat at 40.

321
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,040
Sorry.

322
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,244
l was 8. l knew even then...

323
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,401
...if he had worked out and not smoked,
he'd have lived longer.

324
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:20,524
How old are you?

325
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,243
l'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that question.

326
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,964
-Mid to late 20s.
-lnteresting.

327
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,159
What?

328
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,604
Most people l've interviewed
are about that age.

329
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:35,681
l think when you get to our age
you feel the need to keep in shape.

330
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,888
Probably no coincidence
that the baby-boom generation...

331
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,927
...approached 30 at the same time
as the exercise boom started.

332
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,200
-You do have a hook?
-Maybe.

333
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,557
lt's good to talk a story out before writing.
lt's all spitballing at this point.

334
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,241
-What's that?
-A tape recorder.

335
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,968
l thought maybe we'd exchange ideas,
if you don't mind.

336
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,198
-Do you mind?
-Yeah.

337
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,047
-l won't do it.
-Thanks.

338
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,597
l do have some notes
that may interest you.

339
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:00,644
Look at this.

340
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:03,527
"The baby-boomers are leading
a physical great awakening...

341
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:07,682
"...like the spiritual awakenings
that grip America about every 100 years."

342
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,079
Pretty good.

343
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:15,038
l think people want to take responsibility
instead of leaning on institutions.

344
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,439
For instance, does anyone believe
the government will take care of us?

345
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:21,839
-No.
-Not since Vietnam or Watergate, no.

346
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,840
Or big corporations? Or even doctors?
So, you have to take care of yourself.

347
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:30,246
A lot of people are trying to get in shape,
as you well know.

348
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:32,247
l think we've come full circle.

349
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:35,127
Almost back to Emersonian America
of self-reliance.

350
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:37,082
There's something else here.

351
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:41,318
Emerson: "Do that which is assigned thee
and thou canst not hope too much...

352
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:42,762
"...or dare too much."

353
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:48,199
So, what could be more all-American,
more old-fashioned all-American...

354
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:50,757
...than institutions
like the Sports Connection?

355
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,888
Little capitals of Emersonian America
scattered from sea to shining sea.

356
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,438
You are so hot.

357
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:04,925
l'm glad we had this off-the-record lunch.

358
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,160
l was real suspicious of the kind of story
you were going to write.

359
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,758
lf you want to know
about the Sports Connection...

360
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,805
...a real writer would work out. Join.

361
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:14,800
-You ever taken an aerobic class?
-No.

362
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:17,357
l've got one starting soon.
You should take one of mine.

363
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:21,488
l should, but l can't, l don't have the time.
l've another appointment this afternoon.

364
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,528
l have to finish up a story
before l can concentrate on this one.

365
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:28,123
-What's the other story?
-Joseph McKenzie.

366
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,402
You do important stuff, too?

367
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,083
-Will you be here later?
-Nope. l'm on the road.

368
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:35,682
What do you mean, on the road?

369
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:38,806
l teach class at the
Beverly Hills Sports Connection, tonight.

370
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:41,278
-Coming in?
-No, l really don't have the time.

371
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,087
l'll make a deal with you, though.

372
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:47,964
l would gladly take one of your aerobic
classes if you'd let me interview you.

373
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,005
l was really beginning to like you, too.

374
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:17,878
Notes on lunch.

375
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:21,279
We talked about baby-boom generation,
great physical awakening...

376
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:22,927
...Emersonian America.

377
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:25,007
Father dies fat at 40.

378
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,725
lnteresting girl.
She's smart, but l've got to be smarter.

379
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,366
McKenzie and l go way back.

380
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,239
l met him when l was in New York,
and l was stripping, even then.

381
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:38,559
Right, but in a little classier club.

382
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,326
l didn't know who he was
and he walks into the club one night...

383
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,759
...and he puts a $1,000 bill in my G-string.

384
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,363
-Are you kidding? Really?
-We had a lot of fun.

385
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,685
-He's really a great guy.
-Sounds it.

386
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,443
l'll tell you something,
if you promise not to tell.

387
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,043
-Okay.
-He bought this house for me.

388
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:57,448
-Really?
-Yes.

389
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,965
-Well, do you still talk to him?
-Joe and l talk all the time.

390
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:03,884
-Shotsy?
-My God, my husband's home.

391
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:05,762
Eddie?

392
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,327
-Honey, this is Adam Lawrence.
-Hi.

393
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:11,879
He's a reporter for <i>Rolling Stone</i>,
and he's doing a piece on Joe McKenzie.

394
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,325
-Get out of here.
-l wanted to ask your wife a few questions.

395
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:17,798
-You leave her out of this.
-Eddie, l invited him.

396
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,242
l told him he could come.

397
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:22,844
He says that nobody has anything nice
to say about Joe, and l want to help.

398
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,124
You're not saying anything to anybody.

399
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:28,927
l don't want her name mentioned
in any article, understand?

400
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:31,999
Now get out of here.

401
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,119
<i>Knees up!</i>

402
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,278
<i>Jumping jacks!</i>

403
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:58,157
<i>See you next week.</i>

404
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:07,762
-l'll see you guys later. l'm late.
-Great class. Thanks.

405
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:08,679
'Bye.

406
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,404
You did good.

407
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:13,845
-See you later.
-Hi.

408
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,408
-What are you doing here?
-l just thought l'd come by...

409
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,003
...and see if you needed someone
to help charge your battery.

410
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:29,441
-l have a confession to make.
-A confession? Yeah?

411
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:30,848
What kind of confession?

412
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:34,285
On my way to work, l went to the library
and pulled some back issues...

413
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,122
...of <i>Rolling Stone</i> and read
some articles that you wrote.

414
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,043
Really? Which ones?

415
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,006
<i>Abscam</i> and <i>Junk Food.</i>

416
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,643
"And?" he says, fishing for a compliment.

417
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:49,327
You're pretty good.

418
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,039
Must be fun being a reporter nowadays.

419
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:56,198
"Yeah," he says suspiciously.

420
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,998
You get to try to keep the big boys honest.

421
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:03,485
At the same time, you get to figure out
which way the culture's going.

422
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,799
l guess that's true. A friend of mine says...

423
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:09,279
...that popular culture is to society
what dreams are to an individual.

424
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:13,728
lf you want to find out about an individual,
you analyse their dreams.

425
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,404
Same with society.

426
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:19,482
lf you want to find out about a society,
you analyse things like music and film.

427
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:24,242
-Or health clubs, or junk food.
-And in doing so, you can be quite vicious.

428
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,767
l think l try to be objective.

429
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,361
Do you always work on a computer?

430
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,885
Do you know anything about computers?

431
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,407
l took a couple of courses.

432
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,400
-You left it on.
-l always leave it on.

433
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,198
This way, it's already warmed up
if l get an idea in the middle of the night.

434
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:50,723
May l?

435
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:13,488
Everybody writes that.

436
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,208
l was hoping you'd come up
with something more original.

437
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:17,688
How do you erase it?

438
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:38,400
A good reporter would never get in bed
with a subject.

439
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:40,921
You keep forgetting something.

440
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,602
l'm not your subject.

441
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:58,998
-You'd probably be a lousy interview.
-Probably.

442
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,967
-No opinions, no ideas.
-None.

443
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:06,245
-l think l'll take your class anyway.
-l give a very tough class.

444
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,126
You do? Tell me about it.

445
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,284
First, there's the warm-up.

446
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:14,605
The warm-up is designed...

447
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:18,957
...to increase blood to the muscles,
to warm up the muscles.

448
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,082
So as to be able...

449
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,237
...to do the more strenuous exercises.

450
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:27,204
And then, there's the cardiovascular.

451
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:33,481
Let me get rid of this.

452
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,598
Hello. Yes. Who?

453
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:40,087
Mr. McKenzie, yes.

454
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,483
Well, this is he. Well, who told you?

455
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,961
Shotsy did. Good.

456
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:50,087
That's good, l think you should tell
your side of the story.

457
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:54,206
Well, if l left right now,
l could probably catch the redeye.

458
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,688
Great. Sounds good. Thank you.

459
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,208
He'll meet with me. Maybe he'll talk.

460
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:04,404
l got to go.

461
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:07,968
Of course you do.

462
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,002
Wait a minute.

463
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,647
This is to be continued.

464
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:15,928
l certainly hope so.

465
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,641
-Hello?
-Hi, l called the office.

466
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,321
They said you're still home.

467
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:30,967
Rough night.

468
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,443
Mikey Douglas was in town,
and l got the cocktail flu.

469
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,759
-Where are you?
-l'm at JFK. Guess what?

470
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:40,723
l got a meeting today with McKenzie.
We're to meet at 12:00 at the Atrium Club.

471
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,128
<i>-You're shitting me.</i>
-No.

472
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,848
-You got any space in the next issue?
-l'll make space.

473
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:47,124
<i>-Has the cover closed yet?</i>
-Yeah, it's closed.

474
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,284
Screw the cover.

475
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:52,328
You're drunk, aren't you?
Must have been some turbulence.

476
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,479
Listen, l can't talk. l got to go.

477
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:58,198
l'll drop by later, how's that? 'Bye.
Wish me luck.

478
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:00,322
Adam?

479
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:08,888
Kent, it's Mark.

480
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,718
Listen, l've waited all my life to say this:
Hold the presses.

481
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,958
And get me Frankie.

482
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,565
-What is she doing here? Frankie!
-Adam!

483
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:30,567
-What are you doing?
-Mark wants me to photograph McKenzie.

484
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,766
-No, he's nuts. l can't take you with me.
-Come on. You can try.

485
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,885
-Forget about it.
-Adam, come on.

486
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,881
Go, Frankie. l'm not kidding.

487
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,403
Nobody's supposed to be here.
You'll blow it.

488
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:44,448
-My photos are as important as your story.
-There'll be no story without an interview.

489
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,121
-Don't do this to me.
-Bull!

490
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,964
-What?
-lt's Charlie, his flack.

491
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,448
-Stay here.
-Charlie who?

492
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,121
-Give me your camera.
-No.

493
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:53,888
Charlie, hi.

494
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,888
l'm so sorry l'm late.
The traffic was impossible.

495
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,805
-Mind if l use my tape recorder?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

496
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:12,520
Well, you certainly come prepared.

497
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:15,840
-Where to, Mr. McKenzie?
-Just drive around the park.

498
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:25,519
-So, what happened?
-l got it.

499
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:29,119
l never thought l'd get him to talk,
but once he started he wouldn't stop.

500
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:31,882
lt was amazing.
l have three solid hours all on tape.

501
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,118
Adam!

502
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:36,329
Where's my camera?
Give it to me right now.

503
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:38,798
-Don't ever pull that again.
-The film's inside.

504
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:40,607
-My first picture credit.
-What?

505
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:43,999
-Have it developed. See you later, Frankie.
-Screw you.

506
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,682
-So what's the story?
-Okay.

507
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,839
McKenzie was negotiating
to sell his computers to Czechoslovakia...

508
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,282
...to save his company.

509
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,202
He had it all worked out.
He was gonna move computers...

510
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,849
...through dummy corporations,
all over Europe...

511
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:02,159
...until they wound up
behind the lron Curtain.

512
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:05,048
He claims the government found out
what he was up to...

513
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:07,324
...and put him out of business
by busting him.

514
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,843
-How much space do you need?
-Six pages.

515
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:11,926
Four.

516
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,719
Five.

517
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:17,724
Okay, four and a half.
We'll hold the issue. When can l have it?

518
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,959
-How soon do you need it?
-Tomorrow morning.

519
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:21,479
You got it.

520
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,045
What about this aerobics contest
coming up?

521
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:28,085
They want me to make a demonstration.

522
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,564
-Jessie, phone for you.
-Okay.

523
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:32,799
-Okay, killer, l'll see you later.
-Be good.

524
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,045
-How you doing? You through?
-Yeah.

525
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:36,562
-Where were you?
-Hiding.

526
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:37,764
Here you go.

527
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:39,963
Hello.

528
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,246
Adam, hi.

529
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:45,361
l'm fine. How was the interview?

530
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:47,441
lt was real interesting.

531
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:51,488
l really can't tell you the details right now.
l'm afraid this phone is being tapped.

532
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,801
l'll be in tomorrow.
l'll call you when l know what time.

533
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:56,998
l'll be there.

534
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,600
<i>Make sure my tape recorder is on.</i>

535
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:13,166
<i>I understand you suspect the government</i>
<i>of what lawyers politely call "misconduct."</i>

536
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,524
<i>That's right.</i>

537
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,964
<i>Well, could you expand on that?</i>

538
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,726
<i>I have reason to believe...</i>

539
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,404
<i>...that they eavesdropped</i>
<i>on my office computers.</i>

540
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,600
<i>You know, like hackers. But...</i>

541
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:29,403
<i>...these hackers weren't kids.</i>
<i>They were FBI hackers.</i>

542
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,242
Yes, hello.

543
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:07,918
What cuts?

544
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,322
What trouble?

545
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:12,885
Right.

546
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,246
l'll be there. Okay.

547
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:26,884
Frankie.

548
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,887
-How did my pictures turn out?
-Bad, amateurish, snapshotty.

549
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,478
That good?

550
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:38,760
-Mark can see you. The lawyers are here.
-The lawyers?

551
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,926
Come on in.
You know Tod Turner and Martha Young?

552
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:47,843
Only on the phone.

553
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,719
You really are expecting this
to cause trouble.

554
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,039
-l thought you liked causing trouble.
-l do...

555
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,484
...more than anybody you know,
but up to a point.

556
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:57,048
Let me guess what that is.

557
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:59,882
Could that be the point
where trouble costs you money?

558
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,278
Right. You want to split the bills
on this one?

559
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,758
-What's the problem?
-Martha, why don't you start?

560
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,409
Mark says that you have
the entire interview on tape.

561
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,207
Something like three hours?

562
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:11,918
-Who's to retain custody of the tapes?
-l am, why?

563
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,558
The magazine should retain
the original tape, or a copy for its files.

564
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:19,086
-That's not a problem, is it?
-That is a problem.

565
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:21,729
l promised McKenzie
l wouldn't let anyone have a copy.

566
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,562
The prosecutors will demand a copy
once this story is out.

567
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,607
l promised him they would never get it.
l gave him my word.

568
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:30,802
We'll do everything to keep the tapes
from the government.

569
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:34,359
-We'll fight any subpoena in court.
-That's not good enough.

570
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:38,362
l will make sure the tapes don't get out.
The only way to do that is to keep them.

571
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:43,483
What happens if the magazine were fined
$1,000 a day until you turned them over?

572
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:47,203
l won't test the magazine's guts
or its bank account.

573
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:50,087
The government could pressure you, too,
send you to jail.

574
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:53,599
That's a risk l have to take.
Where are the cuts? l want to see them.

575
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,683
Adam, be reasonable.

576
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,727
You could have libelled McKenzie.
He could have libelled others.

577
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,006
Let's not kid around.
Mark could be facing millions in lawsuits.

578
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,961
Without your tapes we have no evidence
to go into court with.

579
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,519
l can't recommend that Mark publish
the article unless you turn them over.

580
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:14,006
l can't recommend these cuts.
Someone's editing with their elbows.

581
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,647
-Where are the tapes?
-ln my bag.

582
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:18,721
Look, you wanted me to do the story,
l did the story. Okay?

583
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:21,448
Take it or leave it. Print it, don't print it.

584
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,522
l got a plane to catch.
Another story to write.

585
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:31,121
You have a big decision to make.

586
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,161
Now, where were we?

587
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:58,725
What comes after the warm-up?

588
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,408
After the warm-up...

589
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:03,518
...is the cardiovascular section.

590
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,244
lt should last for 15 to 20 minutes.

591
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,681
lt should be un-interrupted and steady.

592
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:15,245
This aerobic phase exercises
the most important muscle in the body.

593
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,001
-Which is?
-The heart.

594
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:37,127
-How do you feel?
-l feel great.

595
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,723
-You're gonna be sore tomorrow.
-l don't think so.

596
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:43,087
-Still want to interview me?
-l don't know.

597
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:45,963
-l broke the cardinal rule of journalism.
-What's that?

598
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:49,200
After what we did last night,
l don't think l can be objective.

599
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,928
-l need to take a shower.
-l need to make a phone call.

600
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:54,239
-You want to come out to my house later?
-Yeah.

601
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,361
-You did good today.
-Thanks.

602
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:57,923
For a New Yorker.

603
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,118
-For a New Yorker, too.
-Nice legs.

604
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,363
-Mark, it's Adam!
-l'll take it up here.

605
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:12,637
-Tell him l have to talk to him.
-Hello.

606
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:16,638
Mark? Hi. Just checking up.
The McKenzie story going or what?

607
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,561
-We're closing it tonight.
<i>-Good.</i>

608
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:21,209
-Where are you?
-l'm at the infamous Sports Erection.

609
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:23,883
<i>-How's that going?</i>
-lt's tougher than l thought.

610
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,847
l need some more time.
l haven't really started writing yet.

611
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:28,885
What about that Aerobics Pied Piper?

612
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,004
-Hi, Adam.
-Hi.

613
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:31,238
l'm working on her.

614
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,366
Do me a favour and send an advance copy
of that McKenzie story...

615
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:39,601
...to Simon & Schuster? Dick Schneider.
Tell him why it's not on the cover, okay?

616
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:43,205
Speaking of covers, l got this great idea
for the health issue cover.

617
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,005
Ready?

618
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:46,728
You wanted to use Christie Brinkley,
now you can.

619
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,208
-ln a leotard.
<i>-Not bad.</i>

620
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,962
<i>-Dita needs to talk to you.</i>
-No, l don't want to.

621
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:53,643
l don't have my notes.
l'll just call her later, okay?

622
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,322
All right, l'm going. 'Bye.

623
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:57,722
-Kenny?
-Hey, what's up?

624
00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:00,687
Could you tell me something?
This girl, what's her name?

625
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,521
-Which one?
-The one with Robert.

626
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:04,243
That's Linda Slater.

627
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,519
-She's dying to get in your article.
-Really?

628
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:10,077
-Yeah, but you don't want to talk to her.
-Why not?

629
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:12,558
She's the most used piece of equipment
in the gym.

630
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,764
l don't know.
l don't think you can be objective.

631
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,238
l mean, really objective,
under any circumstances.

632
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,763
-Like the Heisenberg principle of physics.
-Yes.

633
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,522
The theory that we change things
by observing them.

634
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:27,806
The idea is that to see something
you have to shed some light on it.

635
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:31,564
-And light alters what it shines on.
-Yeah, that's good. Very good point.

636
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,440
-Hi, you guys.
-Hi, hon.

637
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:38,760
Jeff, Bobby, this is Adam Lawrence.
Adam, Jeff, Bobby.

638
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:40,999
How you doing?
Your mother's in the kitchen.

639
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,523
-ls she sober?
-She brought the divinity again.

640
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:46,203
-Not a good sign.
-We're going skiing this weekend.

641
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:48,849
-Why don't you guys come?
-Skiing? This time of year?

642
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:51,489
They ski Mammoth until July 4.
Why, you ski?

643
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:53,841
Sometimes, yeah. l like to ski.

644
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:56,682
-Why don't you guys come with us?
-Maybe we will.

645
00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:00,762
We'll see how he feels. You see,
he just took his first aerobics class. Mine.

646
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,004
Nothing to it.

647
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:06,119
-This place is great.
-Yeah, we like it.

648
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:09,440
Jeff and l are just roommates.
He teaches at the Sports Connection.

649
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:12,248
That's where he met the girls.
You should interview them.

650
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:15,639
They have this interesting relationship.
Mom!

651
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:20,484
l'm not staying, l'm leaving. Don't worry.

652
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,528
l was lunching at The Muse and l wanted
to drop by some divinity l made last night.

653
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,166
-Hi, Jess.
-Hi, Billy.

654
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,805
As l said, they have an odd relationship.

655
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:30,878
Yeah.

656
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:34,245
-This is the best divinity l've ever made.
-Mom, Adam Lawrence.

657
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:35,842
-Adam, my mom, Melody.
-How do you do?

658
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:39,444
Adam works for <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
He's doing an article on Sports Connection.

659
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:41,884
-He looks too nice to be a reporter.
-Mother.

660
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,800
A piece of divinity, Mr. Lawrence?

661
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:45,607
She makes the best divinity in the world.

662
00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:48,283
You're thinking of interviewing Jessie
for this story?

663
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:50,803
We're talking about it.
We haven't quite decided.

664
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:53,722
Well, l hope you treat her better
than the last reporter.

665
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:56,164
That was one of the worst experiences
of my life.

666
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:58,803
l thought we weren't going to talk about it.

667
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,641
All right, l'm going.

668
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,203
Goodbye, darling. Come visit.
'Bye, Mr. Lawrence. Enjoy the divinity.

669
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,644
Jessica, you're too skinny.

670
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,203
-This stuff will kill you.
-What was she talking about?

671
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:14,928
Who is this reporter
and why was he interviewing you?

672
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:18,164
lf l told you,
you might be tempted to use it.

673
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,523
l couldn't stand that.

674
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,566
Wait a minute, l want to know
what she was talking about.

675
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:28,080
ln high school, l was a swimmer.
l was a very good swimmer.

676
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:30,399
l broke world records.
l made the Olympic team.

677
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:33,721
That was the year Carter decided
to boycott the games in Moscow.

678
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:36,639
l didn't agree with him
and was vocal about it.

679
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,005
There was this reporter who said
he wanted to write about how l felt.

680
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:43,684
But what he ended up writing about,
after a series of interviews...

681
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,438
...was my alleged love affair
with my coach.

682
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:52,360
-l'll show you where the phone is.
-Wait a minute.

683
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:55,406
-Where's the phone?
-On the roof.

684
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,964
-Jessie, hold on.
-l don't want to talk about it.

685
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,607
-Jessie.
-l don't want to!

686
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,806
-Just tell me about the L.A. games.
-l was never that fast again.

687
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:05,679
Here's the phone. Make your call.

688
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:08,207
l'm going to go check on the mail.

689
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:17,319
Hello.

690
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:20,287
Dita. What's up? You need me?

691
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,361
l'm having trouble checking this.

692
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:25,600
Everyone's afraid, nobody will talk to me.
l really need your help.

693
00:48:25,689 --> 00:48:27,008
-You ready?
<i>-Shoot.</i>

694
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:31,398
-Are you sure about the spelling of Shotsy?
-S-H-O-T-S-Y.

695
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:33,605
-How did you like the piece?
-Not bad.

696
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,808
We should do more of this sort of thing.
Man does not live by rock 'n' roll alone.

697
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:39,124
Woman either.

698
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:41,843
l got to put you on hold.
Somebody's buzzing me.

699
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:43,682
-Okay.
-Adam!

700
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,847
Believe it or not,
l've changed my mind about something.

701
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,124
Let's go skiing. l want to go to Mammoth.

702
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:53,607
You can interview me all you want.

703
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:24,364
What's the matter?

704
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,162
l can't move.

705
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:30,559
God, l can't move.

706
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:32,928
l got polio.

707
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:36,248
l got polio! God!

708
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:43,959
-How many articles do you write in a year?
-l don't know. Ten, sometimes more.

709
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:46,519
Do you always follow
your subjects around?

710
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,887
You're interviewing me.
l'm supposed to be interviewing you.

711
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,842
-Any pointers on how to improve my style?
-Yes.

712
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:57,849
Always treat a famous person
as if they're not.

713
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:00,444
And a person who's not famous
as if they were.

714
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:02,959
And think of your interview as a seduction.

715
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:05,201
-A seduction?
-Yes.

716
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:08,118
How many times a year
do you fall in love, Adam?

717
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:09,968
lt depends on the subject.

718
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:13,005
l think anything worthwhile takes longer.

719
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:15,001
Working out, a relationship.

720
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:18,766
Maybe you're right.
l wrote six articles a day for a newspaper.

721
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:21,927
-At least l'm going in the right direction.
-Which is?

722
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:25,000
Take some time off, write a book.

723
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,079
About what?

724
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:31,284
McKenzie, maybe.
lf this article is as good as l think it will be.

725
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,566
Maybe even the press.
They have gotten a lot of bum raps lately.

726
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:36,919
Yeah. And you?
What would you like to do?

727
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,442
Right now? Or for the rest of my life?

728
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:43,324
You don't want to teach aerobics forever,
do you?

729
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:48,520
No, there's a point
when you're not the best, so you get out.

730
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:50,645
ls it important for you to be the best?

731
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:54,488
Yeah. Ever since l was a kid.

732
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,644
l'm trying to find something that means
the same as going for the gold medal.

733
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:02,767
l always expected to win it.

734
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,720
l like breaking records.
l like setting records and breaking them.

735
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:09,642
l like winning trophies.

736
00:51:10,729 --> 00:51:12,003
l like being the best.

737
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:14,003
You are the best.

738
00:51:16,169 --> 00:51:18,046
You want to go break another record?

739
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:20,719
-Sure you're not too sore?
-Yes.

740
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,484
Let's go.

741
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,245
-Good luck, right?
-Yeah, right.

742
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:38,244
Come on.

743
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:43,207
-l've just the remedy for you.
-You do?

744
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:48,245
l really got turned on in that class.

745
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,843
lt's sexy to watch people work out,
don't you think?

746
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:53,318
Sure, because the sexuality is so free.

747
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:56,885
-Everything seems to be so legal.
-lt's definitely a meat market.

748
00:51:57,169 --> 00:52:00,479
Which is probably why you don't see
many couples working out together.

749
00:52:00,569 --> 00:52:04,118
l mean, if they pair off they fall out
and you never see them again.

750
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:07,087
-They never come back.
-lt's 'cause it makes sex much better.

751
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:10,525
The better your body looks,
the more you want to take off your clothes.

752
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:11,962
lt's true.

753
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:14,241
That's good.

754
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:18,365
Well, do you think that people
that are in better shape have better sex?

755
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:19,758
Yeah.

756
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:21,441
-Definitely.
-Without a doubt.

757
00:52:22,249 --> 00:52:24,240
All right, how can we expand on that?

758
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:25,799
l did.

759
00:52:26,049 --> 00:52:28,768
-l mean, two heads are better than one.
-Jeffrey.

760
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:30,877
Yeah?

761
00:52:31,169 --> 00:52:33,399
-Hi, Jess.
-Better than one, huh?

762
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:56,238
"What are you thinking about?"
he says, hopefully.

763
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:00,162
l'm thinking about George Hathaway,
to tell you the truth.

764
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:01,477
Who's that?

765
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,599
He's the reporter who wrote that piece
in <i>Inside Sports</i> magazine.

766
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:07,926
What made you think of him?

767
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:12,159
l think about the press a lot nowadays.

768
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,408
Anything specific?

769
00:53:17,649 --> 00:53:21,039
l was wondering if he has any idea
what his article did to all of us?

770
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,647
What do you mean, exactly?

771
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,563
lt's very hard for me
to trust anybody, anymore.

772
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:32,082
On any level.

773
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:36,925
My mom and l didn't talk for a year.

774
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,842
See, she was the one who gave him
most of his information.

775
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:42,842
Although, she says she didn't say
what he printed.

776
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,798
lt didn't matter
because my coach lost his job.

777
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:50,280
His wife left him, took their kids.

778
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:54,967
And he and l<i>....</i>
l don't know, it was just never the same.

779
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:56,960
We went to one meet afterwards.

780
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:00,007
lt was just too painful.

781
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:02,966
lt was actually humiliating.

782
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:07,639
But was it true?
Did you have an affair with your coach?

783
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:17,848
What's that, Adam?

784
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:21,478
A tape recorder.

785
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:24,320
-ls it on?
-Yes.

786
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:30,479
Get out!

787
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,607
-Get the fuck out of my car, Adam!
-Jesus Christ.

788
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:35,520
-You fucking liar!
-Jessie.

789
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:37,605
You're a sphincter muscle, Adam!

790
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,922
She's mad.
She always swims when she's mad.

791
00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:07,959
Hi.

792
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:10,678
-Hi, Mr. Lawrence.
-What's going on out there?

793
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:14,728
The kids think Boy George is staying here,
and l'm trying to convince them he's not.

794
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,846
Your editor called and said it's urgent
that you get back to him.

795
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,282
-Really? Thanks.
-Yeah.

796
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:23,682
We want Boy! We want Boy!

797
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:45,767
-Hello?
-Adam, it's Mark. Hold on.

798
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:48,686
Where were you these last three days?

799
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:52,325
Skiing, Mark.
l've been skiing the beautiful High Sierras.

800
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,125
Skiing.

801
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,004
-What's that got to do with the story?
-Very little, l suspect. What's up?

802
00:56:57,089 --> 00:56:59,444
The whole world wants to get
that McKenzie piece.

803
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:01,884
-Like who?
-New York Times<i>,</i> Washington Post...

804
00:57:01,969 --> 00:57:04,358
...Wall Street Journal<i>,</i> Time<i>,</i>
Newsweek<i>, the wires.</i>

805
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:07,009
<i>As you weren't in, all I could say was,</i>
<i>"Eat shit and die."</i>

806
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,967
-You're a real phrasemaker.
-And McKenzie's lawyers called.

807
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:13,007
They want the story bad.
They offered me money not to run it.

808
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:14,124
Did you take it?

809
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:17,565
Adam, eat shit and die.

810
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:23,801
We want Boy!

811
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:29,084
-Yes, Mark?
-Then some guy calls and says...

812
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:32,320
...no health club will keep you healthy
if McKenzie's story runs.

813
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:36,284
Sounds like l'm being followed.
God, wait a minute.

814
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,087
l think my room has been searched.

815
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,208
-What? Where are the tapes?
-ln my bag.

816
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:42,848
Maybe you better get home.

817
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:44,885
l don't have anyone to hang a story on.

818
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,961
What happened to Miss Pied Piper
in leotards? She was perfect.

819
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:50,848
-She's not. There's no story there.
-You sure?

820
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:54,080
l said there's no fucking story there,
but l'll find one, okay?

821
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,842
Hold on.
What's the matter with you, Adam?

822
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:01,128
Hey, do you think l like it out here?
l can't stand it here. l hate California.

823
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:03,006
Nothing ever goes right for me here.

824
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,008
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

825
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,169
Sounds like you're in love
with a California airhead.

826
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:11,319
Eat shit and die, will you?

827
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:41,439
Hello? No, this is Sally. Who's this?

828
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:44,762
Yeah, just a minute.

829
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:48,000
Linda, it's for you.
lt's that guy from <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

830
00:58:49,249 --> 00:58:49,999
You're kidding.

831
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:57,639
<i>-What do you want him to do?</i>
-Take it off!

832
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:42,199
lsn't he wonderful?
Sally is so proud of him.

833
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:46,641
-How long has he been doing this?
-Ever since she met him.

834
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:50,642
-They met at the Sports Connection, right?
-Right. The first day we joined.

835
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:52,845
-She's so lucky.
-Yeah.

836
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:55,238
She had no idea he was a male stripper.

837
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:08,326
That's my lover who's out there.

838
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:22,724
<i>Ladies in the back,</i>
<i>move down to the front steps!</i>

839
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:26,358
<i>Move to the front with your tips for Roger!</i>

840
01:00:36,209 --> 01:00:38,165
-Can you see all right?
-What?

841
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:41,286
Can you see all right?
l'm sorry you have to watch from there...

842
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:44,441
...but Roger had to do some fast talking
to get you in at all.

843
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:46,042
lt's fine. l can see.

844
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:20,521
Now, watch this.

845
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,322
-Nobody knows they go together.
-That's great.

846
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:54,362
-Hi, Linda.
-Hi, Matt.

847
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,677
-How you doing?
-Good.

848
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:57,088
-How are you?
-Great.

849
01:01:57,169 --> 01:01:59,558
-Can l get you another drink?
-Sure, yeah.

850
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,640
-Adam, you want a drink?
-No, thank you.

851
01:02:01,729 --> 01:02:02,878
l'll be right back.

852
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:06,167
-God, you know everybody.
-He works out at the gym, too.

853
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:10,037
l know everybody at the gym.
lt's like my home away from home.

854
01:02:11,049 --> 01:02:12,118
He's real nice.

855
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:15,519
-He's been on <i>Merv Griffin.</i>
-You know, it doesn't surprise me.

856
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:17,804
-What?
-l say, it doesn't surprise me...

857
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:22,405
...that you know all the handsome men.
l bet a pretty girl like you gets hit on a lot.

858
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,599
Yeah, l do okay.

859
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:29,318
Excuse me...

860
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:32,724
...l'll be right back. l have to talk to Sally.

861
01:02:35,649 --> 01:02:38,117
Sally. Sally, come here.

862
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:41,204
-lt's going great, isn't it?
-Fantastic.

863
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:44,361
Listen, he is so charming.
l want to invite him to the party.

864
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:45,485
What?

865
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,404
Adam. He's so charming.

866
01:02:48,489 --> 01:02:51,322
-l want to invite him to the party.
-Great.

867
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:54,684
l think he's trying to seduce me.

868
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:15,684
Hey, Sally, happy birthday.

869
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:19,046
No, Robert, not yet.
Not until the stroke of midnight.

870
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,166
-Sally, where's Linda?
-She's around here someplace.

871
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:25,241
She's with that <i>Rolling Stone</i> reporter.
Don't tell anybody...

872
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:28,241
...but he's going to make us
the focus of the article, maybe.

873
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:30,081
So act natural, okay?

874
01:03:31,129 --> 01:03:34,007
And this is Sally's bedroom over here.

875
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,599
-And this is my bedroom.
-Nice.

876
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:40,887
Just don't call me a male stripper.
l'm an exotic dancer. And don't forget it.

877
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:43,838
Are you sure you don't want
to take off your coat?

878
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,328
-lt's hot.
-Not really.

879
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:47,604
Do you mind if l use a tape recorder
or take notes?

880
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:50,840
Not at all. You got to get it right.
l don't want to be misquoted.

881
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:52,248
Next question?

882
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:58,406
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Linda.

883
01:03:58,649 --> 01:03:59,638
Hey, Linda.

884
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,887
Come over here and sit on my face.

885
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:04,879
Shut up. l'm being interviewed.

886
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,119
Tell him about the bachelor party.

887
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:09,928
-l was drunk.
-And the night in the back of a Mustang.

888
01:04:10,009 --> 01:04:12,842
What night? l don't remember you there.
Were you there?

889
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:16,399
That was really good.
Remember that? That was great.

890
01:04:17,969 --> 01:04:21,006
l hope everyone likes vegetarian food,
because l'm a fanatic.

891
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:23,239
l wanted everything to be healthy tonight.

892
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:25,923
Except the birthday cake.
l made that with white sugar.

893
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:28,005
You can't have a healthy birthday cake.

894
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:31,764
Did you girls ever frequent singles bars?
Did you do that scene?

895
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:33,878
Did we ever.

896
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:36,639
For a while l think that's all we did.

897
01:04:36,729 --> 01:04:39,482
Yeah, we had our own bar stools
with notches on them...

898
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:41,525
...in every singles bar in the Marina.

899
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:44,601
Linda, stop talking like a sleaze.
We weren't that bad.

900
01:04:44,689 --> 01:04:47,487
Why did you decide to join a health club?
Any one thing?

901
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:50,242
l got sick of drinks with parasols in them.

902
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:53,446
No, l just got so tired of waking up
feeling crummy every day.

903
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:55,838
l kept meeting one jerk after another.

904
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,726
l wanted to meet a healthy man.

905
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:01,927
Linda, you'll give the wrong impression.
Not everyone joins to meet someone.

906
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:05,319
-Most people join just to work out.
-Now, speak for yourself.

907
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:08,799
A psychic told Sally she'd meet
the man of her dreams at a health club.

908
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:11,608
Right, so that's when we joined
the Sports Connection.

909
01:05:11,689 --> 01:05:14,442
-And you met Roger the very first day.
-Yeah.

910
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:16,442
lt was love at first sight.

911
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:19,282
l took one look at those tits
and my whole body got hard.

912
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:23,287
You're terrible. He's writing that down.

913
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:25,963
Come on, Sally,
you're just as proud of them as l am.

914
01:05:26,049 --> 01:05:27,368
Actually, l am.

915
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:30,089
As a little girl,
l would go to Ann-Margret movies.

916
01:05:30,169 --> 01:05:31,841
l'd come home praying for tits.

917
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,717
Now, l prayed for tits, too, you know.
God just didn't answer my prayers.

918
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:39,439
Yes, He did. God answers all prayers.
He just said no.

919
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:47,526
Do you see similarities
between singles bars and health clubs?

920
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:50,282
Yeah, but l love health clubs a lot better.

921
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:54,567
Singles bars are really humiliating.
You're waiting there to meet somebody.

922
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:57,686
-You have an excuse to be at a health club.
-Right.

923
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:00,124
And it's a lot safer
looking for Mr. Goodbody...

924
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:01,881
...than looking for Mr. Goodbar.

925
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,561
That's good. l'll use that.

926
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:05,526
-Really? You like that?
-Yeah.

927
01:06:05,649 --> 01:06:08,322
This is so much fun.
l feel like l'm on <i>Johnny Carson.</i>

928
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:11,483
-l really like that cleft in your chin.
-Thanks.

929
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:16,878
"Happy birthday to you

930
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:20,401
"Happy birthday to you

931
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:24,598
"Happy birthday, dear Sally"

932
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:25,360
God!

933
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:29,044
"Happy birthday to you

934
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:32,526
"And many more"

935
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:36,841
Make a wish!

936
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:38,838
Okay.

937
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:42,477
Blow. Blow.

938
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,881
Somebody get the lights on.

939
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:47,925
Here, open this one first.

940
01:06:48,169 --> 01:06:51,718
-Roger, not yet. She's got to cut the cake.
-Just this one.

941
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:55,848
What is it?

942
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:59,168
Linda, it's an engagement ring!
Do you believe it?

943
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:03,248
Congratulations.

944
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:05,841
l love you so much.

945
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:09,408
Look, you guys.

946
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,327
l'll go make coffee.

947
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:19,720
l'm dying. Wait, Linda,
l'm going to cut the cake!

948
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:24,398
-Linda.
-Hey, Linda.

949
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:27,640
Sally, you should have told me.
l'm your best friend.

950
01:07:27,729 --> 01:07:30,926
-l didn't know he'd give me a ring.
-Roger, you should have told me.

951
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,125
-You know you can't keep a secret.
-What?

952
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:35,564
-Aren't you happy for me?
-l couldn't be happier.

953
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:39,039
-What's going to happen to me?
-For God's sake, l'm only getting married.

954
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:41,802
-Sally, won't you open your presents?
-Yeah.

955
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:44,449
Please, go now. Open your presents.

956
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:46,883
Linda.

957
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:49,558
God.

958
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:54,120
-God. l'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

959
01:07:55,129 --> 01:07:56,881
-Let's go, let's go!
-All right!

960
01:07:57,009 --> 01:08:00,558
l'm happy for you.
l'm really happy for the both of you.

961
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:02,801
Go out and open your presents.

962
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:05,722
-l'm going to make some coffee, okay?
-All right, okay.

963
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:09,799
-Be sure to make a pot of decaf, too.
-Okay.

964
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,084
Okay, you guys, let's open those presents.

965
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,725
Hi.

966
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:23,038
God.

967
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,599
You know, it's so easy for Sally.

968
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,042
lt's always been so easy for her.

969
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:34,242
-l can't wait until l have plastic surgery.
-You're having plastic surgery?

970
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:35,682
-Didn't l tell you?
-No.

971
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:38,319
Yeah, l'm going to have plastic surgery.

972
01:08:38,609 --> 01:08:40,088
-You're kidding?
-No.

973
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:43,764
l'm going to have a chin implant,
some cheek bones, and a different nose.

974
01:08:43,849 --> 01:08:46,568
-Why? You look terrific. Are you serious?
-Yeah.

975
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:48,446
A doctor friend is going to do it.

976
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:51,168
And he knows the makeup artist
from <i>The Dukes of Hazard.</i>

977
01:08:51,249 --> 01:08:53,160
He's going to redesign my face.

978
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:00,608
Do you think there's a connection between
your plastic surgery and your workouts?

979
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:03,285
-lt's part of the same thing.
-Which is?

980
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,447
l want to be perfect.

981
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:08,202
The most perfect you can be.

982
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:11,486
That's what l want to be,
the most perfect me possible.

983
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:13,366
-And you'll do anything.
-Anything.

984
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:17,719
lf you perfect yourself,
you'll be loved, is that what you're saying?

985
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:19,925
Yeah. Well, you put that really nice.

986
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:23,526
The most important thing as a reward
for perfection is love. Right?

987
01:09:23,889 --> 01:09:26,722
Yeah. Sally thinks l'm mentally unstable.

988
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:33,924
How many spoonfuls of coffee
have l put in there?

989
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:35,204
l don't know.

990
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:39,159
l'm so drunk l can't remember.

991
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:47,962
Adam, are you going to make
a pass at me or not?

992
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:51,238
You know, you can have me. l'm available.

993
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:53,325
Thank you, but it's against the rules.

994
01:09:54,169 --> 01:09:58,082
Well, since when have you been so ethical?
Everybody knows you're seeing Jessie.

995
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:03,718
l'm sorry.

996
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:07,885
l guess l'll go and see
if l can scare up a gang-bang.

997
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,283
These are really nice, Mary. Thank you.

998
01:10:44,889 --> 01:10:47,528
-Mary, see if you can find Adam for me.
-Sure.

999
01:10:55,889 --> 01:10:56,844
Yes?

1000
01:10:56,929 --> 01:10:59,045
<i>-How's it going?</i>
-Well, you got your story.

1001
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,359
<i>-What's the lead?</i>
-lt's just as l promised you.

1002
01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:05,124
Airheads, inflated bodies.
l call it "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."

1003
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:06,927
<i>-That's a good cover head.</i>
-Yeah.

1004
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:10,479
<i>-How soon can we have it?</i>
-When do you need to decide on the cover?

1005
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:14,005
<i>-I have to have it tomorrow.</i>
-Yeah, well, l'm almost through.

1006
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:17,646
Can't wait to get through with this
and move on to something else.

1007
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:21,165
<i>-Got anything in mind?</i>
-How about l go after Bowles in Morocco?

1008
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:22,603
l'll think about it.

1009
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:26,278
By the way, turn on your radio.
The McKenzie story's all over the airwaves.

1010
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:29,487
Somebody gave UPl an advance copy
and they put out a bulletin.

1011
01:11:30,129 --> 01:11:33,166
-You didn't give it to them, did you?
-Of course not. Did you?

1012
01:11:34,049 --> 01:11:37,519
-Hold on, someone's at the door.
<i>-I'm on my way out. I'll call you later.</i>

1013
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:38,564
All right, 'bye.

1014
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:46,837
Can l come in?

1015
01:11:52,369 --> 01:11:53,597
Want a cup of coffee?

1016
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:57,842
lt's not too hot.

1017
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:01,363
This isn't for me.
This is for my friend, the coach.

1018
01:12:02,009 --> 01:12:05,160
He's back with his wife and has a new job.
Avoid using his name.

1019
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:06,568
Hey, listen.

1020
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:11,723
Here, l'm not using it. l didn't copy it.

1021
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:15,247
l didn't use your name.
You're not in my article. Okay?

1022
01:12:15,329 --> 01:12:16,557
l give you my word.

1023
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:23,597
Jessie.

1024
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,641
You called me a sphincter muscle.

1025
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,081
You are one.

1026
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:41,966
-Who is it?
-lt's Frankie. l just checked in.

1027
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:43,761
l'll call you later, Frankie.

1028
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:46,966
-l've got something for you.
-Forget it. l'll call you later.

1029
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:50,838
Come on, Adam. Open the door.
What's going on in there?

1030
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:53,041
You got somebody in there?

1031
01:12:56,369 --> 01:12:57,484
Do you ever.

1032
01:12:57,569 --> 01:13:00,720
Jessie, this is Frankie Smith.
She's one of our best photographers.

1033
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,481
Not one of, the best.

1034
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:04,844
Here's an advance copy
of the McKenzie issue.

1035
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:08,320
They used your horrendous photographs.
Even gave him credit.

1036
01:13:08,729 --> 01:13:11,402
Do l know you?
You look very familiar to me.

1037
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,158
l don't think so.

1038
01:13:14,249 --> 01:13:16,843
Jessie's an instructor
at the Sports Connection.

1039
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,677
l see why you call it the Sports Erection.

1040
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:23,565
l got to go. Thanks for the tape.

1041
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:26,727
You look very familiar to me.

1042
01:13:31,129 --> 01:13:32,448
Great piece.

1043
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:34,884
Referring, of course, to the McKenzie story.

1044
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:38,006
-Frankie, get out of here. l got work to do.
-For sure.

1045
01:13:38,129 --> 01:13:41,485
-What time do you need me?
-l don't know, 1:30 or 2:00. l'll call you.

1046
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:44,568
Good, that will give me enough time
to find an assistant.

1047
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:47,117
And anything else l need
to get me through the day.

1048
01:13:48,809 --> 01:13:51,448
Jesus! l forgot to tell you.

1049
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:54,362
l already shot the cover. lt's amazing.

1050
01:13:54,449 --> 01:13:58,362
Mark had this great idea.
Christie Brinkley in a leotard. Sensational.

1051
01:13:58,689 --> 01:13:59,804
See you.

1052
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:22,208
<i>United Press International reports that</i>
<i>it has an interview with Joseph McKenzie.</i>

1053
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:25,804
<i>It's the only interview McKenzie's given</i>
<i>since his arrest on drug charges.</i>

1054
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:28,483
<i>In it, he claims</i>
<i>the State Department framed him...</i>

1055
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:32,118
<i>...because he was negotiating to sell</i>
<i>computers to an Iron Curtain country.</i>

1056
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:34,962
<i>The interview will be published</i>
<i>in</i> Rolling Stone <i>magazine.</i>

1057
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:38,088
-Sorry they forgot to mention your name.
-Yeah, l'm not.

1058
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:39,397
-So this is it?
-Yes.

1059
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:41,639
-You know what you want?
-Yes. Exactly.

1060
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:42,400
Great.

1061
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:45,243
Okay, guys, l need a little ass.

1062
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:48,361
-Okay, guys.
-Don't be embarrassed, just take them off.

1063
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:50,446
lt's okay, make me suffer. Come on.

1064
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:53,442
-Come on.
-What's my mother gonna say about this?

1065
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,121
l'm in pain. All right, good.

1066
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:57,923
Be in love with yourself and look this way.
All of you.

1067
01:14:58,009 --> 01:15:00,079
Let's go, you just sweat it. Great.

1068
01:16:44,609 --> 01:16:45,678
Four more!

1069
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:48,842
Twos!

1070
01:16:52,129 --> 01:16:53,118
Singles!

1071
01:16:58,849 --> 01:16:59,838
Come on!

1072
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:01,801
What are you doing?
She's not in the story.

1073
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:03,288
-Why not?
-Give me a break.

1074
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,166
-You got enough pictures.
-All right.

1075
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:08,286
l'm flying to New York tonight.
Scott's taking me to the airport.

1076
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:09,358
See you there.

1077
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:12,407
-l want those that you took.
-You got them. Good shoot.

1078
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,002
Five, six, seven, eight!

1079
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:30,118
Over!

1080
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:54,087
Five, six, seven, eight!

1081
01:18:10,369 --> 01:18:13,406
l'm glad l met you.
And l'm sorry l met you.

1082
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:16,605
l'm glad that you're glad you met me.

1083
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:19,804
l'm sorry that you're sorry you met me.

1084
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:26,648
-l thought you put a "don't disturb" on it?
-l did. lt must be important.

1085
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:31,158
Hello.

1086
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:36,285
lt's the Associated Press.
l'd better take it. Yeah, send it through.

1087
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,479
Hello? Yes, hello, Fred.

1088
01:18:39,489 --> 01:18:41,127
Well, of course l remember you.

1089
01:18:42,729 --> 01:18:46,119
l really can't do this now.
lt's not a good time. Can l call you back?

1090
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:48,997
All right.

1091
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:52,162
Just for a few minutes.
Let me ask you something, first.

1092
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:54,638
Do you have an advance copy
of the McKenzie piece?

1093
01:18:56,209 --> 01:18:57,801
Really? Where did you get it?

1094
01:18:59,249 --> 01:19:00,477
l'm just curious.

1095
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:10,318
Who?

1096
01:19:12,769 --> 01:19:15,727
l've never heard of him.
l can't imagine how he got it.

1097
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:26,403
l've been working on the story
for several months now.

1098
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:27,638
What?

1099
01:19:43,489 --> 01:19:46,401
Yes. Persistence and patience, yeah.

1100
01:19:51,049 --> 01:19:52,277
No.

1101
01:19:52,929 --> 01:19:55,159
l don't think he was using me.

1102
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:02,924
What?

1103
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,879
Well, what tapes are you talking about?

1104
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:31,088
No comment.

1105
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:46,684
l can't talk about that right now.

1106
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:02,318
How long?

1107
01:21:16,249 --> 01:21:18,080
l don't know, three, four hours.

1108
01:21:28,569 --> 01:21:30,685
That's right, in a limousine.

1109
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:35,838
We went around the park.

1110
01:21:56,129 --> 01:21:59,883
Listen, really, l've got to go.
l'll talk to you at another time, okay?

1111
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:10,167
Yes, thanks for calling.

1112
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:12,958
Bye-bye.

1113
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:15,598
Sorry.

1114
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:24,487
-What are you doing?
-l read your little story.

1115
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:28,002
You lied to me. l'm erasing it.

1116
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:31,646
-You're not erasing it. Are you erasing it?
-Son of a bitch.

1117
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:33,720
-Jessie, you're overreacting.
-Yeah?

1118
01:22:33,889 --> 01:22:36,767
-That's what the other reporter said.
-Don't compare us.

1119
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:39,966
-l didn't mention your name.
-Do you think l care about my name?

1120
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,604
You spoke of Emerson, baby-boomers,
and physical great awakening.

1121
01:22:43,689 --> 01:22:46,761
All you did was write
about people getting in each other's pants.

1122
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:48,646
Everything l wrote is true!

1123
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:52,517
Everything the other reporter wrote
about me was true too, but it still hurts.

1124
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:56,966
lt's not the truth l'm worried about,
it's the tone, and hurting and using people.

1125
01:22:57,529 --> 01:22:58,644
You're disgusting.

1126
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:02,039
How can you be nice to somebody
like McKenzie and shit on Linda?

1127
01:23:02,129 --> 01:23:04,927
What did she ever do to you
or anybody else?

1128
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:06,044
Nothing.

1129
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,763
What's wrong with wanting to be
the best you can be?

1130
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:11,283
What is so wrong
with wanting to be perfect?

1131
01:23:12,049 --> 01:23:14,005
What's wrong with wanting to be loved?

1132
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,248
Nothing.

1133
01:23:19,849 --> 01:23:21,441
You're going to ruin her life.

1134
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:38,524
Jessie!

1135
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:45,320
Jessie! Jessie!

1136
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:50,360
What are you doing?
Come on, Jessie, talk to me.

1137
01:23:50,889 --> 01:23:54,165
-Open up, Jessie. Don't do this to me.
-Fuck you.

1138
01:24:08,809 --> 01:24:11,164
l warned you not to put her name
in that article.

1139
01:24:13,529 --> 01:24:14,882
Shit!

1140
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:17,923
Okay, start stirring towards the middle.
That's it.

1141
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:20,119
-Stirring.
-Just don't get carried away.

1142
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:24,205
-You need a little more, honey?
-l think you're doing wonderfully.

1143
01:24:24,289 --> 01:24:26,439
Lauren, you've tipped it.

1144
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:31,800
-How often do you do this?
-Pretty often.

1145
01:24:35,289 --> 01:24:36,244
-Honey.
-Yeah?

1146
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:37,557
-lt's Adam.
-Okay.

You sound strange. ls something wrong?

This is going to take longer than l thought.

1153

What? You told me this morning
you were done with the damn thing.

1154

lt's called "deadline."

1155

The best part is to eat it
while it's still smoking.

What's going on there?

1157
01:25:04,929 --> 01:25:08,205
We're making ice cream with
liquid nitrogen. ln the morning, Adam.

1158
01:25:08,289 --> 01:25:10,928
You've got no more time
because there is no more time.

1159
01:25:13,049 --> 01:25:15,040
Right. You got your story.

1160
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:43,883
"The ghost of Emerson haunts
all the clubs in the land...

1161
01:25:43,969 --> 01:25:46,403
"...because they represent
a return to his values.

"l seem to see old Ralph Waldo
on a small stage, a kind of podium...

1163
01:25:50,049 --> 01:25:52,882
"...almost preacher's pulpit.
But, he isn't preaching. No.

1164
01:25:52,969 --> 01:25:56,086
"He's leading an aerobics class
and the whole country is joining in.

"...'and thou canst not hope too much
or dare too much."'

1169
01:26:07,409 --> 01:26:08,683
What is this?

1170
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,882
Has he gone crazy?

1171
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:14,245
lt's not what he promised me.
This is not "Looking for Mr. Goodbody."

1172
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:16,240
Mary. Get me Adam Lawrence.

1173
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:19,202
What does Emerson have to do
with singles bars?

1174
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:21,962
-Has he gone nuts?
-Too many sprouts.

1175
01:26:22,249 --> 01:26:25,002
-That's very funny.
-Too much exercise.

1176
01:26:25,809 --> 01:26:27,765
Out there they call it bed aerobics.

1177
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,121
-Who's she? She looks very familiar.
-Her name is Jessie Wilson.

1178

-She looks familiar to me, too.

You can't kill the story, Mark.
You're already committed.

1183

-You can't change the cover now.
-You re-write it. You make sense of it.

1184

Get his notes, get his research.
Frankie was there, she'll help.

-Adam will be very upset.
-That's his problem, isn't it?

1187
01:26:56,969 --> 01:26:59,563
He'll be out of town.
l'm sending him to Morocco.
