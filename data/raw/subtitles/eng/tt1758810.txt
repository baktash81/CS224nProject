<i>rest of the body never found.</i>

532

saw marks on her neck.

00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,732
Harry, I've got the names and the addresses
of Sylvia Ottersen's boyfriends.

536
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:01,192
Now, she went to the clinic
the second of November,

537
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:04,112
but they won't break patient confidentiality.

538
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,825
They do, however, perform abortions.

539
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:14,789
What is it?

540
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,751
- Magnus, get me the list.
- MAGNUS: What list?

541
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,545
The list of doctors at the Gellion.

542
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:24,424
I'm thinking that he's going after
women that he disapproves of.

543
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:28,678
Here. All the doctors at Gellion
from the last five years.

544
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:33,808
How did he know? How did he know
Sylvia Ottersen was pregnant?

545
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:41,816
"Idar Vetlesen."

546
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:47,363
Birte Becker had an appointment
with the same doctor.

548
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:11,971
Dr. Idar Vetlesen?

549

Yes, that's me.

550
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,391
Step in.

551
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:18,603
Birte Becker and Sylvia Ottersen
were both patients of yours?

552
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:22,232
No, they were both patients at the clinic.

553
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:23,942
I never met Sylvia Ottersen.

554
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:25,944
HARRY: Can you tell me who treated her?

555
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:29,197
No, I'm bound by patient confidentiality.

556
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:31,324
She's dead.

557
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:32,909
Oh...

558
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:34,661
Oh, no.

559
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,581
Right. Well, doctor confidentiality.

560
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:41,417
In theory, would it be possible
for you to access her medical files?

561
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:42,669
Even if you didn't treat her yourself.

562
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:45,046
Well, in theory, yes.

563
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,299
The doctors at the clinic have access
to the files of every patient

564
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:52,011
should they choose to look at them,
which I did not.

565
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:54,347
What did you see Birte Becker about?

566
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,891
Well, that is confidential.

- Hmm.

569
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,650
Well, I've known Arve for years.

570
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,819
I do research in premature birth.

571
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:11,656
We have a small charity, and Arve Stop
is one of our biggest supporters.

572
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:14,659
Huh. I wouldn't have thought that a man
who goes on so much about family values

573
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:17,245
would support a clinic
that specializes in abortion.

574
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:21,332
Well, we specialize in many different areas.

575
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:25,336
And Mr. Stop supports
our research in premature birth.

576

Yes, we mix in the same circles, so...

580

Why are you...

581
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,726
Have you ever practiced in other
parts of the country, Dr. Vetlesen?

Yes, I, uh... I am a reluctant bachelor.

Is there anyone in the house right now?

589
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,624
Because I thought I saw someone
in the window when I passed.

590
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:06,336
Well, if you want to take a look around,

591
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:08,463
I will need to see a search warrant.

592

In fact, if you don't mind,

593
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:13,718
I would like to call my lawyer

594
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,887
before I answer any more of your questions.

595
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,432
That won't be necessary, Dr. Vetlesen.

596
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:22,852
You can bring your lawyer
when we see you next time.

Why'd you ask him about Arve Stop?

604
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,667
I saw a picture of them both together.

605
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:47,710

606
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:49,295
