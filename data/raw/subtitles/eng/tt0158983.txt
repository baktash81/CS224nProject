What is five times two?

174
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,183
Don't be shy.
Just give it your best shot.

175
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,627
- Yes, Clyde.
- 12?

176
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,503
Now let's get an answer from
someone who's not a complete retard.

177
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,984
Anyone? Come on, don't be shy.

178
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,304
I think I know the answer,
Mr. Garrison.

179
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:13,148
- Shut up, fat boy!
- Don't call me fat, you fucking Jew!

180
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:16,192
- Eric! Did you just say the F-word?
- "Jew"?

181
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,863
You can't say "fuck" in school,
you fucking fat ass.

182
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,427
- Kyle!
- Why the fuck not?

183
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:22,067
- Eric!
- You said "fuck" again.

184
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:23,309
- Stanley!
- Fuck!

185
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,707
What's the big deal? It doesn't
hurt anybody. Fuck, fuckitty, fuck.

186
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,024
How would you like to go see
the counselor?

187
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,225
How would you like to suck my balls?

188
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:33,753
What did you say?!

189
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:37,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Actually, what I said was...

190
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:42,385
..."How would you like to suck my balls,
Mr. Garrison?"

191
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,589
Holy shit, dude.

192
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:51,393
I'm disappointed in you boys.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

193
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,272
I've called in your mothers...

194
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:54,913
- You called my mom?
MR. MACKEY: That's right.

195
00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:56,103
Oh, no, dude!

196
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,669
- Mr. Mackey, can I ask a question?
- M'kay, what?

197
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:00,273
What's the big fucking deal?

198
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,704
I want to know where you heard
these horrific obscenities, m'kay?

199
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:08,304
- Nowhere.
- We heard them from Mr. Garrison before.

200
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,103
I seriously doubt
that Mr. Garrison ever said...

201
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,788
..."Eat penguin shit,
you ass-spelunker."

202
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:16,064
Sweet.

203
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,348
Uh-oh!

204
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,631
Thank you for coming on short notice.

205
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,108
This isn't like you, Stanley.

206
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:27,431
What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?
Did he say the S-word?

207
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,153
No, it was worse than that.

208
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,224
The F-word?

209
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,586
Here's a short list of the things
they've been saying.

210
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,268
- Oh, dear God.
- What the heck is a rim job?

211
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:40,666
When you put your legs behind your head
and have someone lick your ass.

212
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:47,029
Tell Mr. Mackey this instant where
you heard all these horrible phrases!

213
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,869
We all swore ourselves to secrecy.

214
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,627
- The Terrance and Phillip movie.
- Dude!

215
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,227
I wanna get out of here.

216
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,345
Terrance and Phillip? Those Canadians?

217
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,425
Excuse me.
What is Terrance and Phillip?

218
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:00,825
Terrance and Phillip are two
very untalented actors from Canada.

219
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,229
Nothing but foul language
and toilet humor!

220
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:07,626
I'll send a warning to parents before
more children see Terrance and Phillip.

221
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:09,353
- Everybody's fucking seen it.
- Eric!

222
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,870
I can't help myself. That movie has
warped my fragile little mind.

223
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,785
STAN SINGS:
There's the girl that I like

224
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:26,114
Over there laughing with that smart...

225
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:28,874
You're holding up
the goddamn lunch line!

226
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,146
Hello, there, children.

227
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,622
- Hey, Chef.
- How's it going?

228
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:33,909
- Bad.
- Why bad?

229
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:37,464
We got busted for swearing.
We can't ever see that movie again.

230
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:38,544
That's too bad.

231
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,308
You should've seen Kyle when
his mom showed up. He was scared.

232
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,432
- Shut up, Cartman!
- I'd be scared. Your mom's a bitch.

233
00:11:44,714 --> 00:11:46,147
Don't call her a bitch,
you fat fuck!

234
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,152
Don't call me fat,
you fucking son of a bitch!

235
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:50,703
Where did you learn to talk like that?

236
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:52,103
CARTMAN:
Pretty fucking sweet, huh?

237
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:54,988
How do you make a woman like you
more than any other guy?

238
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,942
That's easy.
You just gotta find the clitoris.

239
00:11:58,394 --> 00:11:59,509
- Huh?
- Oops!

240
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,067
What does "find the clitoris" mean?

241
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,707
Forget I said anything.

242
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,785
Move along.
You're holding up the line.

243
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,104
Do you know where I can find
the clitoris?

244
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,470
- The what?
- Is that like finding Jesus?

245
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:10,948
MR. MACKEY OVER P. A:
Attention, students.

246
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:14,027
We are now enforcing a new dress code
at South Park Elementary.

247
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,589
Terrance and Phillip shirts are
not allowed in school.

248
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:20,469
Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip
shirt is to be sent home immediately.

249
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,153
KIDS:
Hooray!

250
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:30,710
The Canadian film, Asses of Fire,
is number one at the box office.

251
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,632
Is the film destroying
American youth?

252
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:35,183
Here with a special report is
a midget in a bikini.

253
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:38,870
The effects of the Canadian comedy
are far-reaching indeed.

254
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:43,312
All over America, children seem to be
influenced, like at this spelling bee.

255
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,431
This is for the silver medal.

256
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,506
Spell "forensics."

257
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,990
Why should I fucking
have to spell "forensics"?

258
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:54,272
Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S.

259
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:55,708
Forensics.

260
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:59,867
The devastating impact of the duo
can also be seen with their hit song...

261
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,190
..."Shut Your Fucking Face,
Uncle Fucker."

262
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,430
RAPPING: Shut your fucking face
Uncle Fucker

263
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,105
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle Fucker

264
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,153
I told you that we won 't stop

265
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:11,833
I told you that we won 't stop

266
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,029
Back to you, Tom.

267
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,633
Thanks. Shocking report.

268
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,109
The controversy began
in the town of South Park...

269
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:19,504
...where the PTA is trying
to ban the movie.

270
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:23,303
With us tonight is the head of the PTA,
Sheila Broflovski.

271
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,108
- And the Canadian minister of movies.
- Thanks for having me.

272
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:29,670
Parents are concerned about your
country's entertainment.

273
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,711
The film isn 't intended
for children...

274
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,706
But of course children will see it.

275
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:36,514
Can I finish?
We're surprised by your outrage.

276
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:39,314
- You just don 't care!
- Can I finish? Hello?

277
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,022
The U. S. Has graphic violence
on TV all the time.

278
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:44,509
We can 't believe a movie
with foul language pisses you off.

279
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:46,511
- Because it's evil!
- Can I finish?!

280
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,426
Please can I finish?!

281
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:50,309
Okay, I'm finished.

282
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:53,904
This film isn 't the first
troublesome thing to come out of Canada.

283
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:55,507
Let's not forget Bryan Adams.

284
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,467
Our government's apologized
for Bryan Adams on several occasions.

285
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:02,303
You Canadians are all the same,
with your beady eyes and flapping heads.

286
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,067
I resent that! I find that racist...

287
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:06,464
Our children are now addicted
to your puke!

288
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:07,629
You are a racist!

289
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:12,584
It'll take us weeks to erase the damage
this film has done to our children.

290
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:18,384
Kids, I want to welcome you
to rehabilitation, m'kay?

291
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,023
Your mothers insisted you be taken
from your schoolwork...

292
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:23,703
...and placed into rehab to learn
not to swear.

293
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,467
I don't belong with these rogues.

294
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:28,108
I attended Yardale and had
a 4.0 grade point average.

295
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,663
- You're a fucking faggot.
- M'kay, you see?

296
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:34,793
This is what I'm talking about.
We have to get you off of foul language.

297
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:37,150
- How are we gonna do that?
- Listen here.

298
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,109
RECITING: There are times when you get
Suckered in

299
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:43,830
By drugs and alcohol
And sex with women, m 'kay?

300
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,224
But it's when you
Do these things too much

301
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:51,065
That you've become an addict
And must get back in touch

302
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:54,187
SINGING: You can do it
It's all up to you, m 'kay

303
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:58,424
With a little plan
You can change your life today

304
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:00,870
Don 't spend your life
Addicted to smack

305
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:02,866
Homeless
Giving handjobs for crack

306
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:06,669
Follow my plan
And very soon you will say

307
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,233
It's easy, m 'kay

308
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:10,513
Instead of "ass" say "buns"

309
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:12,909
Like "kiss my buns"
Or "You're a buns-hole"

310
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:14,513
Instead of "shit" say "poo"

311
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,909
As in "bull poo"
And "This poo is cold"

312
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,388
With "bitch" drop the "T"

313
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,943
'Cause "bich" is Latin
For generosity

314
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:22,309
Don 't say "fuck" anymore

315
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,630
'Cause "fuck" is the worst word
That you can say

316
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,870
So just use the word "m 'kay"

317
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,548
We can do it
It's all up to us, m 'kay

318
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:32,745
With a little plan
We can change our lives today

319
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,393
You can change it today

320
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,704
Don 't spend your life
Shooting up in the trash

321
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,706
Homeless
Giving handjobs for cash

322
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,593
Follow this plan
And very soon you will say

323
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,825
It's easy, m 'kay

324
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,390
Step one

325
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,272
- Say "buns"
- Like "Kiss my buns"

326
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,629
Or "You're a buns-hole"

327
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,102
- Step two
- Instead of "shit" say "poo"

328
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,703
- As in "bull poo"
- And "This poo is cold"

329
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,228
- Step three
- With "bitch" drop the "T"

330
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,629
'Cause "bich" is Latin for generosity

331
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,227
- Step four
- Don 't say "fuck" anymore

332
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:00,311
It's the worst word
You can say

333
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:02,226
"Fuck" is the worst word
You can say

334
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:04,743
We shouldn 't say "fuck"
Fuck no!

335
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,143
You're cured
You can go

336
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:08,390
Don 't spend your life
Shooting up in the trash

337
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,386
Homeless
Giving handjobs for cash

338
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,546
Follow this plan
And very soon you will say

339
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,267
It's easy, m 'kay

340
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:31,270
Now you're cured. Take the rest of the
afternoon off for personal reflection.

341
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:35,228
Find your own constructive way
to better yourself, m'kay?

342
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,309
I hope you've learned
something through this experience.

343
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:42,751
I did. I learned that you are
a boner-biting, dick-fart fuck-face.

344
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,591
Want to see the northern lights?

345
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,827
You burned yourself to death
by lighting your fart.

346
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:53,865
I sure did, Phillip.

347
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,070
Uncle Fucker! Good night.

348
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:01,588
Oh, man. This movie rules.

349
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,387
Man, that movie gets better
every time I see it.

350
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:08,063
That part about lighting farts
is bullshit.

351
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:09,667
- You can't do that.
KENNY: Yes, you can.

352
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,023
No way.

353
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:12,070
(KENNY MUMBLES)

354
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,784
Okay, Kenny. I'll bet you $ 100
you can't light a fart on fire.

355
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:23,990
- Holy shit, dude!
- Look out!

356
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:26,627
Shit! Shit!

357
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,705
Help! Somebody do something!

358
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,228
This stick is on fire!

359
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:37,627
Oh, my God! You killed Kenny!

360
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:38,744
You bastard!

361
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,349
I guess you can light a fart on fire.

362
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,224
DOCTOR: Load that IV with 70cc's
of sodium Pentothal.

363
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:47,384
NURSE:
We called the parents.

364
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:50,547
Our moms will find out
we went to the movie again.

365
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:51,909
DOCTOR:
Vacuum!

366
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:54,190
Try to untangle his trachea
and esophagus.

367
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,032
DOCTOR:
No, that doesn't go there!

368
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,312
- Gross, Stan!
- That's sick!

369
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,073
NURSE: Watch his liver!
ASSISTANT: I'll get it.

370
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:06,469
DOCTOR: We have little time left.
We'll lose him soon.

371
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:07,789
His heart stopped.

372
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,031
Get it out of there.
Zap this, quick!

373
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,828
Who's making a potato?

374
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,543
My bad. I missed lunch.

375
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:18,222
Damn it, I'm not gonna lose this kid!

376
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,470
DOCTOR:
Close him up. We've done all we can.

377
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:23,103
The rest is up to God.

378
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,833
DOCTOR: Kenny, can you hear me?
KENNY: Shit, dude.

379
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:28,104
How are you feeling?

380
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,870
Great. Son, I have some bad news.

381
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:35,783
We replaced your heart with a potato.
You have three seconds to live.

382
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:40,548
- Fucking weak, dude!
- Oh, my God. They killed Kenny!

383
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,783
You bastards!

384
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,103
Damn it!

385
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:46,664
It never gets any easier!

386
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:52,268
I bet him he couldn't do it.
I bet him $ 100.

387
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,745
- It's not your fault.
- No, I'm stoked I don't have to pay.

388
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:59,191
That's real nice! He was your friend,
you fat fuck!

389
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:02,153
So, boys, you saw that movie again?

390
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,709
- Yes.
- Well, Kyle, I have had it!

391
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,104
You are grounded
for the next two weeks!

392
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,024
Grounded?

393
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,713
And you, Stan. Come on.

394
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:12,905
And you're grounded
for three weeks, Eric.

395
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:15,065
Why am I grounded more?
That's bullshit.

396
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:16,224
What, what, what?!

397
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,823
What was that word, young man?

398
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,828
MALE SINGER:
Little boy at peace

399
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:36,110
What is this place

400
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,706
Beyond the stars

401
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,584
Open up your eyes

402
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,433
What are these things

403
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,312
You're moving toward

404
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:47,984
Head so full of wonder

405
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,990
Worries in the past

406
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,663
Could it be
That you are free at last

407
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:56,949
No!

408
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:04,992
Little boy, you're going to hell

409
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,712
You said bad words, threw rocks at birds
Now this is your hotel

410
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,303
This ain 't Disneyland, it's hell

411
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,825
Little boy, it's time for you to pay

412
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,948
For not going to church
And staring at boobs every day

413
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,788
Thought you were in bed
Instead you're in hell

414
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,306
No, hell isn 't good
Hell isn 't good, hell

415
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:29,152
No, hell isn 't good
Hell isn 't good, yeah

416
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,073
Fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?

417
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,624
There is orderliness in the universe.

418
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:51,353
Parents, our children are
out of control!

419
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:55,223
This is what happens when toilet humor
is allowed to run rampant!

420
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,231
That's right.
Kenny set himself on fire...

421
00:20:57,434 --> 00:21:00,187
...because he saw Terrance and Phillip
do it in that dirty movie.

422
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,272
We must stop dirty language from
getting to our children's ears.

423
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,505
We must go fight the source of it!

424
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,113
But what is the source?

425
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:09,066
That's easy.

426
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,908
SINGING: Times have changed
Our kids are getting worse

427
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:14,912
They won 't obey their parents
They just want to fart and curse

428
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:16,433
Should we blame the government

429
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:17,908
Or blame society

430
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:20,423
Or should we blame the images on TV

431
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,226
No, blame Canada!

432
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:23,469
Blame Canada

433
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:26,751
With all their beady little eyes
And flappin ' heads so full of lies

434
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,103
Blame Canada

435
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:29,633
Blame Canada

436
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,223
- We need to form a full assault
- It's Canada 's fault

437
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,909
Don 't blame me for my son Stan

438
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:39,191
He saw the darn cartoon
And now he's off to join the Klan

439
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,862
And my boy Eric once
Had my picture on his shelf

440
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,389
But now when I see him
He tells me to fuck myself

441
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,027
Well, blame Canada

442
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:47,553
Blame Canada

443
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:50,314
It seems that everything's gone wrong
Since Canada came along

444
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:56,912
They're not even a real country anyway

445
00:21:57,114 --> 00:22:00,106
My son could've been a doctor
Or a lawyer rich and true

446
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:03,112
Instead he burned up like a piggy
On a barbecue

447
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,667
Should we blame the matches

448
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:07,991
Should we blame the fire
Or the doctors who allowed him to expire

449
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,105
Heck, no!
Blame Canada

450
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:11,713
Blame Canada

451
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,912
- With all their hockey hullabaloo
- And that bitch Anne Murray too

452
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:21,673
The smut and trash we must bash
The laughs and fun must be undone

453
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,188
We must lament and cause a fuss

454
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:26,352
Before somebody thinks of blaming us

455
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:35,029
SHELLEY:
All right, you turds, listen up!

456
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:38,465
Your moms are at a meeting
and they put me in charge of you.

457
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:41,467
But you're still grounded,
so you're not allowed to have any fun!

458
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:42,749
Any questions?

459
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:44,228
Shelley, where's the clitoris?

460
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,108
You all sit there and keep
your mouths shut...

461
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:52,784
...while I go listen to
my Britney Spears records.

462
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:55,344
Okay, it's clear!

463
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:59,704
Our next guests have
the number one movie in the world.

464
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:02,514
Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!

465
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:07,512
- Hello, Conan.
- Hello, Brooke Shields.

466
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:11,707
Some people claim that your Canadian
humor is just immature fart jokes.

467
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,866
That's not true.
Take this classic Canadian joke.

468
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,991
- Excuse me, Terrance.
- Yes, Phillip?

469
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:21,144
Gosh darn it!

470
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,431
- Good one. Cheers.
- Cheers, fuck-face.

471
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,306
You can't say that on TV.

472
00:23:26,514 --> 00:23:28,550
Now Terrance smells like my ass.

473
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:32,025
I farted once on the set
of Blue Lagoon.

474
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,829
Does it make you nervous to be
in America?

475
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:41,225
Our organizations want you
arrested for destroying children.

476
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:44,073
- They'd have to find us first.
- You're right. Now!

477
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:50,391
Mothers Against Canada is placing you
under citizen's arrest!

478
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,152
- Mom?
- What's going on?

479
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:54,231
We have a court order for your arrest!

480
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,833
Phillip, we've been ambushed!

481
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,433
Here you go, Conan.

482
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,706
This little scrotum-sucker deceived us!
You are a bad man!

483
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:01,824
Don't listen to them.

484
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:04,389
You loved our movie, Conan.
We watched it together.

485
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:05,913
Remember? You laughed.

486
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,065
What have I done?

487
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:13,708
(CAR ALARM)

488

(TURNS ALARM OFF)

489
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,951
Did you see that?
They arrested Terrance and Phillip!

490
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,064
As Canadian ambassador...

491
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:28,511
...I condemn America's actions
in apprehending Terrance and Phillip.

492
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:32,705
The entire economy of Canada relies
on Terrance and Phillip.

493
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:34,506
Without them,
we'd have a recession.

494
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,631
What say you,
Mr. American Ambassador?

495
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:41,549
Fuck Canada!

496
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:42,823
Fuck you, buddy!

497
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:44,626
Terrance and Phillip
will not be released.

498
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,553
They'll be put on trial
for corrupting America's youth.

499
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:49,307
What's all the fuss about?

500
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:53,507
The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!
It's aboot not censoring our art!

501
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:56,069
It's aboot...
What's so goddamn funny?

502
00:24:56,514 --> 00:25:00,587
Nothing. Could you tell us again
what your argument is all about?

503
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:04,264
This is not aboot diplomacy. This is
aboot dignity. It's aboot respect.

504
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:05,913
Aboot realizing that humor...

505
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:10,949
Release them, or we'll
give you something to cry aboot!

506
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,222

We're nearing the target.

507
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:27,827

00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,387
No, this is Billy Baldwin.

510
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:34,467
If you want Daniel Baldwin,
call his extension, stupid!

511
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:37,308
Alec, do you know what sucks
about being a Baldwin?

512
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:39,869
- No. What?
- Nothing!

513
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,073
BILLY:
You missed me!

514
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:56,071
Your mothers are making me throw away
my lesson plan and teach theirs.

515
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:58,384
How come our moms arrested
Terrance and Phillip?

516
00:25:58,634 --> 00:25:59,703
Yeah.

517
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:03,270
Your moms are just upset.
They're probably all on their periods.

518
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,390
Not cool.

519
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:07,592
Wendy and I think
that was a sexist statement.

520
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:11,509
Sorry, but I don't trust anything that
bleeds for five days and doesn't die.

521
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:15,107
Anyway, children, let's start off
with some vocabulary.

522
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,389
MR. MACKEY OVER P. A:
Attention, students.

523
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:17,464
What now?

524
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:22,071
Come to the gymnasium immediately
for a special announcement.

525
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:26,783
- What's going on, Chef?
- Something big, children.

526
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:29,025
I can't find the clitoris.
You have to help.

527

Stan, the clitoris is...

528
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,989
Take your seats.
They're about to announce it.

529
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:35,953
This is a state of emergency.

530
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,584
Now to the White House for
an announcement from the President.

531
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:41,228
My fellow Americans...

532
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,990
...at 5 a.m. Today,
a day which will live in infamy...

533
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:49,146
...the Canadians have bombed
the Baldwins.

534
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:54,030
In response to this, the U. S. Has
declared war on Canada.

535
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:57,712
- Oh, no.
- War?

536
00:26:57,954 --> 00:27:00,752
- No, Gregory, no!
- This is bad. Hold on to me.

537
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,507
All the Baldwins are dead?

538
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,427
It's time for us to send
a message to Canadians.

539
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:08,831
In two days, the war criminals,
Terrance and Phillip...

540
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,672
...will be executed.

541
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:12,583
They're gonna kill them?

542
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:16,224
And now I'd like to bring up my newly
appointed Secretary of Offense...

543
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,231
...Ms. Sheila Broflovski.

544
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:19,623
Holy shit, dude!

My fellow Americans...

546
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:25,022
...our neighbor to the north
has abused us for the last time!

547
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:27,270
- I have a plan...
- Canadians want to fight us...

548
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:30,307
...because we won 't tolerate
their potty-mouths.

549
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,510
If it is war they want...

550
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:35,148
...then war they shall have!

551
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,786
Dude, this is fucking weak.

552
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,229
How could things be any worse?

Would you let me do my job?

00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:35,990
I don't see why you have to belittle me
in front of people like that.

Relax, guy.

any respect for me.

and stand up to your mother.

That she likes another guy

He's political and stuff

into Canada...

Here to present the V-chip
is Dr. Vosknocker.

629
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,785
The machinery of the V-chip
is very simple.

630
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,632
It is placed under the child's skin...

631
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,793
...emitting a small shock of electricity
whenever an obscenity is uttered.

632
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:50,111
Wait a minute. This chip somehow knows
if the child is swearing?

633
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:51,383
It's like a lie detector.

634
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:54,028
Certain things happen to you
when you swear, just like when you lie.

635
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:57,512
The chip picks up on this and gives
the subject a little prick.

step out here, please?

Clinton has called them
to fight the evil Canadians.

658
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:56,463
A full-scale attack was launched
on Toronto...

659
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,667
...after the Canadians ' last bombing,
which devastated the Arquettes.

660
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,428
For security measures,
our great government is rounding up...

661
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,307
...all citizens with Canadian blood
and putting them into camps.

662
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:10,069
Canadian-Americans are to report
to one of these death camps right away.

663
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:11,673
Did I say "death camps"?

664
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,303
I meant happy camps,
where you will eat the finest meals...

665
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,664
...have access to fabulous doctors
and exercise regularly.

666
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:20,669
Meanwhile, war criminals Terrance
and Phillip are prepped for execution.

667
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:22,273
Their execution will take place...

00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:25,830
...during a fabulous USO show,
with guest celebrities, including...

669
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,990
...Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder.

670
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:31,982
Of course, the only way to see the
USO show is to sign up for the Army!

671
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:35,823
So join the Army and kill
some Canadian scum as we continue...

- What's the matter, Cartman?

00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:01,189
It's this V-chip. I hate it.
I can't say any dirty words.

679
00:34:01,514 --> 00:34:02,947
- So you can't say "fuck"?
- No.

680
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:04,667
- And you can't say "shit"?
- No.

681
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,867
You can't say, "I'm Cartman,
the fattest piece of shit in the world"?

682
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:09,866
- Fuck you!
- Dude. Sweet!

683
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:13,271
This has gone far enough.
It's time we talked to our moms.

684
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:14,748
We're supposed to be grounded.

685
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:17,104
Come on, it's time for us
to get political.

686
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:20,192
Canada will no longer corrupt
our children!

687
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,668
Mom, can I talk to you?

688
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:24,513
Kyle, what are you doing here?
You are grounded.

689
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:26,910
Get back to the house
and stay there!

690
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:28,303
You too, Stanley.

691
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:31,512
You're going too far.
You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.

692
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,705
We must fight for
our children's futures!

693
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:37,469
- You started a war. You have to stop it.
- To make them safe again!

694
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:39,904
Our children are precious.

695
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:44,107
We must make a stand now!
Stop at nothing!

696
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:45,829
I told you she wouldn't listen.

697
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,224
We'll have to save
Terrance and Phillip ourselves.

698
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:49,742
- What?
- Think about it.

699
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,023
What would Brian Boitano do?

700
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:53,668
He'd rescue Terrance and Phillip
before they're executed.

701
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:56,474
We can't do anything.
Our moms' organization is too strong.

702
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:59,512
We'll round up all the grounded kids
and start our own organization.

703
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:01,585
An organization to help save
Terrance and Phillip.

704
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:03,750
Yeah, our own secret club.

705
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:06,343
- I guess that could work.
- We have to try.

706
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:09,307
SINGING: What would Brian Boitano do
If he was here right now

707
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,785
He'd make a plan and follow through
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

708
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,952
When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics
Skating for the gold

709
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:19,305
He did two salchows and a triple lutz
While wearing a blindfold

710
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,347
When Brian Boitano was in the Alps
Fighting grizzly bears

711
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,785
He used his magical fire breath
And saved the maidens fair

712
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:28,827
So what would Brian Boitano do
If he were here today

713
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:32,470
I'm sure he'd kick an ass or two
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

714
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,467
I want this V-chip out of me

715
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:38,552
It has stunted my vocabulary

716
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:42,064
And I just want my mom
To stop fighting everyone

717
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:45,192
For Wendy, I'll be an activist
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

718
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,466
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
He'd call the kids in town

719
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:52,030
And tell them to unite for truth
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

720
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,906
Someone say my name?

721
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,304
- Who are you?
- I'm Brian Dennehy.

722
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:58,470
What? No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!

723
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:00,392
Get the fuck out of here.

724
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,753
When Brian Boitano traveled through time
To the year 3010

725
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:08,630
He fought the evil robot king
To save the human race again

726
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,223
When he built the pyramids
He beat up Kublai Khan

727
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:16,350
Because Brian Boitano
Doesn 't take shit from anybody

728
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,713
So let's all stick together
And unite to stop our moms

729
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:23,105
We'll save Terrance and Phillip too
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

730
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:27,506
We'll save Terrance and Phillip too
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

731
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:29,985
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

732
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,745
SADDAM:
Hey, relax, guy.

733

SATAN:
There's nothing on.

734
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:40,511
You get cranky when you're tired.

735
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:41,829
I'm not cranky.

736
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:46,266
What started as a spat between the U. S.
And Canada is turning into WWIII.

737
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,782
World War III?!

738
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:51,031
Terrance and Phillip will be put
to death for crimes...

739
00:36:52,154 --> 00:36:55,908
It has come to be.
The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh.

740
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,622
The time of prophecy is upon us.

741
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:02,110
I love when you get biblical.
You know exactly how to turn my crank.

742
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:05,067
No, I'm being serious.
It is the seventh sign.

743
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:06,104
What?

744
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:07,269
SATAN:
Behold...

745
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:09,982
...the first signs of my reign
have all come true:

746
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,754
The fall of an empire,
the coming of a comet...

747
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:16,663
...and now, when the blood of
these Canadians touches American soil...

748
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:20,152
...it will be our time to rise.

749
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,947
Yeah, man, I'm getting so hot!
Let's fuck!

750
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:27,624
Do you always think about sex?
I'm talking about important stuff here.

751
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:30,872
I'm just excited about taking over
the world! Come on!

752
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:33,304
Is sex the only thing
that matters to you?

753
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:35,073
I love you.

754
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,303
I want to believe that.

755
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:40,312
What do you say we shut off
that light and get close?

756
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:47,471
SATAN: Ow.
SADDAM: You like that, don't you, bitch?

757
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,067
We can use my dad's computer to call
the kids together.

758
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,623
Before we put a message out,
do a search on "clitoris."

759
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:57,108
Okay.

760
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:01,266
"Found: Eight million pages
with the word 'clitoris.'"

761
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:05,553

- Is it Cartman's mom?
- Very funny.

00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,067
It is Cartman's mom!

What's wrong with German people?

776
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,067
Let's do what we came here to do
and put a message out.

777
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:42,583
I've gotta put out
an all-access e-mail.

778
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:45,263
- Goddamn, your mom sucks!
- Get to the message board!

779
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:47,823
Can't find a Canadian server.
I'll break into the mainframe.

780

- We're not.

we have punch and pie!

We would just lie in bed and talk.

get you in bed.

How come you always want to make love

00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:07,593
But what is evil anyway

846
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:10,308
Is there reason to the rhyme

847
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:12,585
Without evil there could be no good

848
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:16,708
So it must be good to be evil sometimes

849
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:20,714
Up there, there is so much room

850
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:23,462
Where babies burp and flowers bloom

851
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:25,984
Everyone dreams, I can dream too

852
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,624
Up there

853
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:31,431
Up where the skies are ocean blue

854
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:35,343
I could be safe and live without a care

855
00:42:36,114 --> 00:42:38,230
Live without a care

856
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:41,871
If only I could live up there

857
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,783
I want to live, I want to live up

858
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:54,342
I want to live up there

859
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:07,106
- You're late!
- I had to ride my bike here.

860
00:43:07,354 --> 00:43:09,390
- My behind is killing me.
- Your "behind"?

861
00:43:09,594 --> 00:43:12,233
I have to say "behind" because
I get shocked if I say "ass."

862
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:13,589
Did you bring the punch and pie?

863
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,830
No. You guys, something happened.

864
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:17,388
I don't think Kenny's dead.

865
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:19,303
I saw him in my room.

866
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,630
I know, Cartman.
I see Kenny every day.

867
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:22,903
- You do?
- Sure, dude.

868
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:26,106
On the face of every child,
on the smile of every baby.

869
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:29,631
This was Kenny! He said that if
Terrance and Phillip die...

870
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:33,031
...Saddam Hussein and Satan will
come up and rule the world!

871
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:34,587
Saddam Hussein?

872
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:35,863
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

873
00:43:39,274 --> 00:43:40,070
KYLE:
Who is it?

874
00:43:40,514 --> 00:43:41,833
GREGORY:
I'm here for La Résistance.

875
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:42,910
KYLE:
What's the password?

876
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:44,229
GREGORY:
I don't know.

877
00:43:44,434 --> 00:43:45,549
KYLE:
Guess.

878
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:47,668
GREGORY:
Bacon.

879
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:48,824
KYLE:
Okay.

880
00:43:50,554 --> 00:43:52,431
Viva La Résistance!

881
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,829
Oh, no! It's that kid!

882
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,387
This is the place.

883
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:58,145
Stan? You started La Résistance?

884
00:43:59,434 --> 00:44:01,231
You're more political than we thought.

885
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,829
GREGORY: Let us get this meeting
underway. Many others are coming.

886
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:07,949
A lot of people showed up.

887
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:15,665
Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be
killed, and we think that sucks ass!

888
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,822
We were to understand there'd be
pie and punch.

889
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:21,864
There isn't any.

890
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:28,144
Terrance and Phillip are
supposed to be killed...

891
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:30,504
...so we should prank call
a bunch of policemen...

892
00:44:30,714 --> 00:44:32,909
...and have pizzas sent to them
that they didn't order.

893
00:44:33,114 --> 00:44:34,991
Viva La Résistance!

894
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:39,193
- May I?
- What?

895
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:43,184
Terrance and Phillip are being held
in a camp two kilometers from town.

896
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:46,033
They are to be executed tomorrow
during a star-studded USO show.

897
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:47,110
Tomorrow?

898
00:44:47,314 --> 00:44:48,713
Once the show begins,
we'll have an hour...

899
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:51,109
...to get them out of their cell
and into this clearing.

900
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,551
There, we will rendezvous
and take them back to Canada.

901
00:44:54,754 --> 00:44:56,665
Dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

902
00:44:56,914 --> 00:44:58,905
Meet me at the rendezvous point
at 10 p.m.

903
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,787
Sneaking in and breaking them out
will be dangerous...

904
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:02,950
...so I'll go myself.

905
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:05,589
No! We're going!

906
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:09,706
We started La Résistance. We'll get
them and meet at the rendezvous point.

907
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:12,303
This will be very dangerous.
Are you quite sure?

908
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:13,344
Fuck that!

909
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:17,672
Do you want that V-chip in you forever?
We'll go. Let's run through the plan.

910
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:32,064
Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!
Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!

911
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:34,310
I think we're fighting Canadians.

912
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:36,431
Canadians, Australians,
what's the difference?

913
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:40,866
This uniform makes me feel like
a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat.

914
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,712
It sure does, Mr. Garrison.

915
00:45:42,954 --> 00:45:44,706
I can't wait
for our first shore leave...

916
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:47,912
...so I can get me
some fucking poon tang.

917
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:52,313
Pay attention! Tomorrow night is
the USO show for all you troops.

918
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:55,711
There will be celebrities, followed by
the execution of Terrance and Phillip.

919
00:45:55,914 --> 00:45:57,313
(CHEERING)

920
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:01,473
After the show, we will finally be
sending ground troops into Canada.

921
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:02,829
So let's strategize.

922
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:04,069
Map!

923
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:06,705
Our sources have told us
that the Canadians...

924
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:09,792
...are preparing for our invasion,
so we must use caution.

925
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:12,064
Each battalion has
a specific code name and mission.

926
00:46:12,274 --> 00:46:13,946
Battalion 5, raise your hands.

927
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,829
You will be the all-important
first attack wave...

928
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:19,229
...which we will call
"Operation Human Shield."

929
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:20,703
Wait a minute!

930
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:23,667
Keep in mind Operation Human Shield
will suffer heavy losses.

931
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,666
Battalion 14?

932
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:28,348
Right. You are
Operation Get-Behind-the-Darkies.

933
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:31,864
You will follow Battalion 5.
Try not to get killed, for God's sake.

934
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:33,473
Are there are any questions?

935
00:46:34,114 --> 00:46:34,910
Yes, soldier.

936
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,070
Have you ever heard
of the Emancipation Proclamation?

937
00:46:37,674 --> 00:46:38,948
I don't listen to hip-hop.

938
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:43,233
After that, we will march into
the heart of Canada, and we will...

939
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,026
I'm gonna get you!

940
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,826
What's wrong with this thing?

941
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,187
It's fucking Windows 98!

942
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:50,543
Get Bill Gates in here!

943
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:57,829
You told us Windows 98 would be faster,
with better access to the Internet!

944
00:46:58,154 --> 00:46:59,951
It is faster. Over five million...

945
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:02,947
All right, men, get lots of rest...

946
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,714
...and prepare to...

947
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:10,869
After you have Terrance and Phillip,
make your way to this ridge.

948
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:12,905
We will wait for you.
But not for long...

949
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:14,906
...so if you're not there at 10,
we'll have to leave.

950
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:18,512
You're brave, but you'll need help
from someone who's done this before.

951
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,222
- Here's the address of "The Mole."
- "The Mole?"

952
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:25,143
He is an expert in covert operations.
Your first task will be obtaining him.

953
00:47:25,354 --> 00:47:29,711
Get lots of sleep. Tomorrow we will
all be risking our lives for freedom.

954
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:33,509
SINGING:
God has smiled upon you this day

955
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:38,752
The fate of a nation in your hands

956
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:41,424
And blessed be the children here

957
00:47:41,714 --> 00:47:44,148
Who fight with all our bravery

958
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:48,586
Till only the righteous stand

959
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:52,226
You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night

960
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:55,551
You fight in all our names
For what we know is right

961
00:47:55,754 --> 00:47:58,473
And when you all get shot
And cannot carry on

962
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,348
Though you die, La Résistance lives on

963
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:04,827
You may get stabbed in the head
With a dagger or a sword

964
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:08,231
You may be burned to death
Or skinned alive or worse

965
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:11,232
But when they torture you
You will not feel the need to run

966
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:14,153
For though you die,
La Résistance lives on

967
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:17,227
Blame Canada
Blame Canada

968
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:20,346
The country's gone awry
Tomorrow night these freaks will fry

969
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:24,148
Tomorrow night
Our lives will change

970
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:27,233
Tomorrow night
We'll be entertained

971
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:31,069
An execution, what a sight
Tomorrow night

972
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:33,908
There's so much room
Babies burp and flowers bloom

973
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:37,026
Tomorrow night up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon

974
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:39,350
Shut your fucking face
Uncle Fucker

975
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,467
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle Fucker

976
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:46,031
- We may be out of luck
- Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked

977
00:48:46,234 --> 00:48:48,589
Why'd our mothers start this war
What are they fighting for

978
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:50,512
When did this song become a marathon

979
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,473
When Canada is dead and gone
There'll be no more Celine Dion

980
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:57,182
They may cut your dick in half
And serve it to a pig

981
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:00,147
And though it hurts, you'll laugh
And dance a dickless jig

982
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:03,104
That's the way it goes
In war you're shat upon

983
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:06,511
Though you die
La Résistance lives on

984
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:22,509
I'm so excited. Just one more day
until we can take over the world.

985
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:25,063
I don't know if I can sleep,
if you know what I mean.

986
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:28,869
This book talks about how people
communicate differently.

987
00:49:29,074 --> 00:49:32,191
I communicate by wanting you
to ask me questions, and you...

988
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:34,544
That is interesting. Let's fuck!

989
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:38,509
Saddam, I'm trying to have
a nice conversation with you!

990
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:41,504
Now that is just not appropriate!

991
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:44,513
Come on, I'm just fucking with you!
It's not real!

992
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:47,866
- Well, that's still not appropriate.
- Hey, daddy.

993
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:50,870
It's not real, either! Come on, guy!

What's wrong?

995

Soon the world will belong to me.

KENNY:
What's the matter, dude?

997
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:05,711
It's Saddam.
He doesn't nurture my emotions.

998
00:50:05,954 --> 00:50:09,105
He just wants sex and can't learn
to communicate.

999
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,072
- Why don't you leave him?
- You're right.

1000
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:13,066
I should leave him.
I'll tell him...

1001
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:15,782
..."Saddam, I'm going to Earth
to rule alone!"

1002
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:18,986
- I'm strong and I don't need him!
- Good for you!

00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,865
I don 't know but I've been told

1006
00:50:29,114 --> 00:50:30,513
Canadian pussy is mighty cold

1007
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:32,670
Stay in the attic,
because if they find you...

1008
00:50:32,954 --> 00:50:34,626
...they'll put you in
a concentration camp.

1009
00:50:36,154 --> 00:50:38,110
Don't worry.
We'll put an end to this.

1010
00:50:38,354 --> 00:50:41,471
Then I'll make Mom come home,
and we'll all be a family again.

- Hi.

1013
00:51:03,154 --> 00:51:04,792
We need to speak with The Mole.

1014
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:08,703
I'm sorry. The Mole is grounded.
He can't come out and play.

1015
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:09,949
- What?!
- He's a kid?

1016
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,190
He said very naughty things about God.

1017
00:51:12,394 --> 00:51:14,669
Can we just talk to him
for five seconds?

1018
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:17,826
Well, all right. Christophe!

1019
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,392
We're gonna rescue Terrance
and Phillip from the USO show...

1020
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:24,030
Who sent you?

1021
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:25,872
Gregory! He said
you could sneak us in.

1022
00:51:26,074 --> 00:51:28,304
Are you telling me you intend
to break into the USO show...

1023
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:31,512
...filled with thousands of soldiers
and break out Terrance and Phillip?

1024
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,346
I thought it was a stupid idea too.

1025
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:36,910
We're La Résistance. We wanna save
Terrance and Phillip and stop the war.

1026
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:39,873
I can't help you.
I'm grounded for the next three days.

1027
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:42,190
So are we. Our parents think
we're home right now.

1028
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:43,713
- Why are you grounded?
- Why?

1029
00:51:43,954 --> 00:51:46,866
Because God hates me.
He has made my life miserable.

1030
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,542
So I call Him a cocksucking asshole,
and I get grounded.

1031
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:51,426
- So will you help us?
- Very well.

1032
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:54,432
Meet me in the backyard
in five minutes. Viva La Résistance.

1033
00:51:54,634 --> 00:51:56,306
We'll show God that we won't fucking...

1034
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:57,913
What? Christophe, get in here!

1035
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,467
Coming, mother.

1036
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:03,433
I must be strong. I must be strong.

1037
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:05,711
Saddam, I need to talk to you.

1038
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,509
Get packing, bitch. We have to go!
We're running out of time!

1039
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:12,826
Saddam, sometimes you can love
a person very much...

1040
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:14,752
...but still know
they aren't right for you.

1041
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:16,467
What are you talking about?

1042
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:18,909
You treat me like shit!
I'm leaving you!

1043
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:20,991
I'm going up to Earth to rule alone.

1044
00:52:21,994 --> 00:52:23,666
No! No, you can't do that!

1045
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:25,950
I'm sorry, but I have to be strong.

1046
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:28,668
Give me another chance!
I have to go to Earth!

1047
00:52:28,914 --> 00:52:30,188
You don't have respect for me!

1048
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,749
Sure I do, guy.
Please just hear me out.

1049
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:39,791
SINGING:
Some people say that I'm a bad guy

1050
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,542
They may be right
They may be right

1051
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:46,705
But it's not as if I don 't try

1052
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,303
I just fuck up, try as I might

1053
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:51,910
But I can change, I can change

1054
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:55,146
I can learn to keep my promises
I swear it

1055
00:52:55,354 --> 00:52:57,026
I'll open up my heart
And I will share it

1056
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:59,225
Any minute now, I will be born again

1057
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:02,591
Yes I can change, I can change

1058
00:53:02,794 --> 00:53:05,183
I know I've been
A dirty little bastard

1059
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:07,824
I like to kill, I like to maim
I'm insane, but it's okay

1060
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,262
'Cause I can change

1061
00:53:10,714 --> 00:53:12,909
It's not my fault that I'm so evil

1062
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:15,503
It's society, society

1063
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:18,630
You see my parents
Were sometimes abusive

1064
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:20,984
And it made a prick of me

1065
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:23,226
But I can change, I can change

1066
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:25,630
What if you remain
A sandy little butthole

1067
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:29,304
Don 't be such a twit
Mother Teresa won 't have shit on me

1068
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:31,943
Just watch me change
Here I go, I'm changing!

1069
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:56,712
You see, I've really matured.

1070
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:58,188
All right.

1071
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:00,747
Come on, we have to hurry.

1072
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,064
SADDAM:
I love you.

1073
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:08,104
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen
of the American Army...

1074
00:54:08,354 --> 00:54:10,868
...welcome to the USO show.

1075
00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:14,308
Get ready for loads of entertainment
and fabulous celebrities...

1076
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:18,308
...followed immediately by
the execution of Terrance and Phillip.

1077
00:54:23,114 --> 00:54:26,629
This is where those military bitches
intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.

1078
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,630
Oh, my God!

1079
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:29,870
God? He is the biggest bitch
of them all.

1080
00:54:30,114 --> 00:54:32,708
Hurry. We rendezvous
with the other kids at 10.

1081
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:37,311
You realize we could be grounded
for two, even three weeks.

1082
00:54:37,514 --> 00:54:39,664
- We're willing to take that risk.
- Let's go.

1083
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:42,508
ANNOUNCER: And now,
here are your hosts for the evening...

1084
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:45,745
...Sheila Broflovski
and Big Gay Al.

1085
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:47,587
(CHEERING)

1086
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:50,593
Al, tonight is a very special night.
Do you know why?

1087
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,466
They're having a sale at Merv's?

1088
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:56,513
No. Because we're going
to abolish Canadian smut.

1089
00:54:57,114 --> 00:54:59,947
That's right, Sheila.
Bring out the condemned.

1090
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,146
SHEILA:
Today is a great day for democracy!

1091
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:13,107
This is worse than when you put your
dick in my mouth and took a picture.

1092
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:14,667
I know, Terrance. I know.

1093
00:55:14,914 --> 00:55:18,907
While you're getting set up over there,
let's bring out our first act:

1094
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:21,509
Yippie, the back-flipping dog!

1095
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:34,993
Be careful not to touch this wire.

1096
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:38,105
Motherfuck...

1097
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:39,787
Fuck.

1098
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:47,508
The show has started.
We're running out of time.

1099
00:55:48,354 --> 00:55:49,423
Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

1100
00:55:49,634 --> 00:55:51,511
Yes, but they are heavily guarded.

1101
00:55:52,154 --> 00:55:53,633
Dig from here,
so as not to be seen.

1102
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,267
Come on, bitches.

1103
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,506
Mole, do you know where
the clitoris is?

1104
00:55:58,754 --> 00:55:59,823
- The what?
- The clitoris.

1105
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:02,309
I have to find it,
so I can get Wendy to like me.

1106
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:04,146
Stop thinking with your dick!

1107
00:56:04,354 --> 00:56:06,629
Be on your toes, because I won't
be grounded again!

1108
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,028
Not for you! Not for anybody!

1109
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:11,587
Men, when you're out there
in the battlefield...

1110
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:13,910
...and you're looking into
the beady eyes of a Canadian...

1111
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:16,833
...as he charges you with
his hockey stick or whatever he has...

1112
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:21,505
...and people are dying all around you,
just remember what the MPAA says:

1113
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:26,629
"Deplorable violence is okay as long as
people don't say any naughty words."

1114
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:29,752
That is what this war is all about.

1115
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:30,909
(CHEERING)

1116
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,303
What?

1117
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,509
Shit!

1118
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:38,469
Move, move.

1119
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:42,910
We will split up here.
Let's synchronize watches.

1120
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,665
- We don't have watches.
- You don't?

1121
00:56:45,914 --> 00:56:47,825
- You didn't say anything about watches.
- What do you think this is?

1122
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:51,265
TV kiddie hour where we sit around
and lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy?

1123
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,271
This is real life, with consequences
you take to the grave.

1124
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:54,987
- We don't have watches.
- Shit!

1125
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,309
- Did you bring the mirror?
- Got it.

1126
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:57,703
- And the rope?
- Check.

1127
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,632
- And the buttfor?
- What's a "buttfor"?

1128
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,745
For pooping, silly.

1129
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,949
I'll dig under the stage, and with
that bedrock, I'll need more time.

1130
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:09,622
Stan and Kyle, stall the show
anyway you can.

1131
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,064
Keep that show going
until I get the prisoners.

1132
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:14,586
MOLE: Cartman, over there is
the electrical box.

1133
00:57:14,794 --> 00:57:17,308
Shut it off before I return
with Terrance and Phillip...

1134
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,948
...or the alarm will sound
and I'll be attacked by dogs.

1135
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:21,024
- Got it?
- Okay.

1136
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:23,668
You must shut off the alarms.
I fucking hate guard dogs!

1137
00:57:23,914 --> 00:57:26,030
I heard you,
you British piece of shit.

1138
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,668
If anything goes wrong, make a sound
like a dying giraffe.

1139
00:57:28,914 --> 00:57:30,267
What's a dying giraffe sound like?

1140
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:32,705
(MAKES ANIMAL NOISES)

1141
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:34,350
Okay.

1142
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:36,152
- Let's go.
- Be careful, dude.

1143
00:57:36,354 --> 00:57:38,914
Was my mother careful when she
stabbed me in the heart...

1144
00:57:39,114 --> 00:57:41,867
...with a clothes hanger,
while I was still in the womb?

1145
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:47,626
Damn, that kid is fucked up.

1146
00:57:47,874 --> 00:57:49,273
AL:
How are those chairs coming?

1147
00:57:49,714 --> 00:57:51,705
Al, we're minutes away.

1148
00:57:51,914 --> 00:57:56,624
Super. Here is pint-sized pixie
and darling of the indie movie scene...

1149
00:57:56,954 --> 00:57:59,024
...Winona Ryder!

1150
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:00,667
Hi, guys.

1151
00:58:01,234 --> 00:58:02,872
I'm super-psyched to be here today.

1152
00:58:03,114 --> 00:58:06,470
What you're doing for our country
is so cool.

1153
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:09,905
I mean war, man. Wow, war.

1154
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:12,264
You know? Wow.

1155
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:17,104
Okay, and now for your enjoyment,
here's my famous Ping-Pong ball trick.

1156
00:58:25,274 --> 00:58:26,104
Oh, my!

1157
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,546
"Shut off the power, Cartman.

1158
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:30,710
This is very important, Cartman."

1159
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:33,627
SOLDIER: Did you hear
what Winona Ryder's doing?

1160
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:42,305
There. I didn't miss one.
That's my Ping-Pong ball trick!

1161
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,910
That's all the acts we have
for tonight...

1162
00:58:48,114 --> 00:58:50,628
...so let's just get on with
the execution!

1163
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:53,824
- No, we have to stall him.
- More! More!

1164
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:55,513
Yeah! More!

1165
00:58:55,714 --> 00:58:58,433
You big sillies.
You want to see more of me?

1166
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,989
Yeah! Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!

1167
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:05,945
Well, I do have a little song I wrote
about the war.

1168
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:07,587
But we haven't rehearsed.

1169
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,227
Sing it!

1170
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:10,829
I can't.

1171
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:12,387
KYLE:
Sing the fucking song!

1172
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,188
All right. If you insist,
I'll sing my song.

1173
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:17,749
I believe it goes
a little bit like this.

1174
00:59:19,914 --> 00:59:21,791
SINGING:
Bombs are flying

1175
00:59:22,074 --> 00:59:23,712
People are dying

1176
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,827

I'm super
Thanks for asking

1181
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:40,952
I couldn 't be better

1182
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:42,382
I must say

I'm so sorry Mr. Cripple

1188
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:57,393
But I just can 't feel too bad
For you right now

1189

Because I'm feeling
So insanely super

Can 't bring me down

Yes, he's super
And he's proud to be gay

1200
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:32,303
Everything is super

We're here to rescue you.
Follow me through the tunnel.

You guys! Seriously.
I saw Kenny again.

1212
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:17,711

1213
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:20,553

Hold me. It's so very cold.

1226
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,672
There is no hope. Get out.

1227
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,825
- We can't leave without you.
- It's okay.

1228
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,224
No, we can't.
We don't know where we are!

This is what we wanted!

1307
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:16,668
We wanted our children to be
brought up in a smut-free environment!

But we didn't want this.

Where are you going?

1310
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:22,592
We're going to find our boys.

1311
01:06:22,794 --> 01:06:26,184
For God's sake, Sheila, we're
going to get them killed!

1312
01:06:31,674 --> 01:06:34,063
All those times I said
you were a big dumb Jew?

1313
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:36,663
I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew.

1314
01:06:37,074 --> 01:06:39,190
Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!

1315
01:06:39,394 --> 01:06:41,146
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1316
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:44,025
Why am I still holding this?

1317
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:46,072

Mr. Hat! No!

1318
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:49,033
KYLE: Fuck this. I'm getting out
before I get in trouble.

1319
01:06:49,274 --> 01:06:50,502
I heard that.

1320
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:54,147
I found the clitoris.
Now I can get Wendy to like me again.

1321
01:06:54,394 --> 01:06:55,270
Swell, Stan.

1322
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:59,023
I guess all's well that ends well.
We can go home now. Dipshit.

1323
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:00,624
What's wrong?

1324
01:07:00,874 --> 01:07:04,708
We can't let Terrance and Phillip die,
or the whole world will end.

1325
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:06,943
Terrance, look!

1326
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:07,984
There they are!

1327
01:07:08,194 --> 01:07:09,673
Phillip, we're done for!

1328
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:11,825
All right, men! Fire!

1329
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,507
Goodbye, Terrance.

1330
01:07:18,194 --> 01:07:19,104
What is this?

1331
01:07:19,314 --> 01:07:20,224
Don't shoot!

1332
01:07:20,434 --> 01:07:24,393
I'll take care of this.
Kids, get out of the way now!

1333
01:07:29,034 --> 01:07:29,830
Kyle!

1334
01:07:30,074 --> 01:07:32,224
I'm not going to let you kill them, Mom!

1335
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:33,389
What, what, what?

1336
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:35,505
I'm not moving!

1337
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:40,551
Stand down. You can still see
fart jokes on Nickelodeon.

1338
01:07:40,754 --> 01:07:42,870
No! This is about
more than fart jokes!

1339
01:07:43,114 --> 01:07:45,469
This is about freedom of speech,
about censorship...

1340
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:47,705
...and stuff.

1341
01:07:47,914 --> 01:07:51,145
What about Ike? Did you forget
your adopted son is Canadian?

1342
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:56,234
I'm doing very important things.

1343
01:07:56,434 --> 01:07:58,629
But you never took the time
to talk to me.

1344
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,832
Whenever I get in trouble,
you blame everybody else.

1345
01:08:02,074 --> 01:08:04,383
But I'm the one to blame.
Deal with me.

1346
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:06,630
You keep fighting all these causes.

1347
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,353
But I don't want a fighter.

1348
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:10,067
I want my mom.

1349
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:15,227
Poor little fella!

1350
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:16,863
No!

1351
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:21,829
Holy shit, dude!

1352
01:08:22,074 --> 01:08:23,507
Young man, you watch your mouth!

1353
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:33,586
My time has come!

1354
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,950
You are really fucked now!

1355
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,304
It's Saddam Hussein! Shoot him!

1356
01:08:39,874 --> 01:08:40,704
What a dumb ass!

1357
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:46,829
You have spilled
the blood of the innocent.

1358
01:08:47,074 --> 01:08:49,827
Now begins two million
years of darkness.

1359
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,264
Good job, Ms. Broflovski.
Thanks a lot.

1360
01:08:52,474 --> 01:08:55,625
I was trying to make the world
a better place for children.

1361
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:59,065
And you brought enough intolerance
to allow my coming.

1362
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:01,993
Now, everyone bow down to me!

1363
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:06,023
SADDAM:
Bend over!

1364
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:07,792
What have we done?

1365
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:10,873
Saddam, I'm the dark ruler, not you.

1366
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:12,587
Relax.
Better seen, not heard.

(KENNY MUMBLES)

1368
01:09:14,194 --> 01:09:15,229
I can't.

1369
01:09:15,474 --> 01:09:17,669
Let's start by building
a big statue of me!

1370
01:09:17,914 --> 01:09:19,870
There, where that fat kid is standing.

1371
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,309
Don't call me fat, buttfucker!

1372
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:29,712
Yeah, Cartman, do it.

1373
01:09:29,954 --> 01:09:32,627
Damn! Shit!
Respect my fucking authority!

1374
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:37,584
You need to watch your mouth, brat!

1375
01:09:38,234 --> 01:09:40,190
Dogshit taco!

1376
01:09:44,394 --> 01:09:45,747
Quick, do something.

1377
01:09:45,994 --> 01:09:47,109
Try this on for size.

1378
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:51,272
Blood-drenched,
frozen tampon popsicle!

1379
01:09:53,474 --> 01:09:57,911
Buddy, I know I was mean before.
But don't worry, I can change.

1380
01:09:59,154 --> 01:09:59,984
Okay.

1381
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:02,903
Not!

1382
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,110
Fuck, shit, cock, ass,
titties, boner...

1383
01:10:06,354 --> 01:10:10,267
...bitch, muff, pussy, cunt,
butthole, Barbra Streisand!

1384
01:10:15,594 --> 01:10:18,028
What are you waiting for, bitch?
Destroy him!

1385
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:20,825
You weak, stupid cum bucket.
Save me!

1386
01:10:21,074 --> 01:10:22,063
That's it!

1387
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:25,787
I have had enough of you!

1388
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:43,066
He spent so much time convincing me
I was weak and stupid...

1389
01:10:43,274 --> 01:10:44,787
...that I believed it myself.

1390
01:10:45,194 --> 01:10:46,832
I have you to thank, little one.

1391
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,743
You showed me that I had
to get away from him.

1392
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:52,872
Just make any wish you want
and I shall grant it.

(KENNY MUMBLES)

1394
01:10:55,914 --> 01:10:57,745
- Are you sure?
- What did he say?

1395
01:10:57,994 --> 01:11:01,987
His wish is for everything to go back
to the way it was before this war.

1396
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:05,426
Kenny, you realize that means
you'd go back too.

1397
01:11:05,674 --> 01:11:06,709

I know.

1399
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:15,869
Very well, then.

1400
01:11:16,114 --> 01:11:17,786
I will pull my minions back.

1401
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:21,709
I guess I'm destined
to live in hell alone.

1402
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:23,590
Hello.

1403
01:11:23,794 --> 01:11:25,022
What's this?

1404
01:11:25,234 --> 01:11:26,633
Hi, there, little guy.

1405
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:29,624
Would you like to go to hell with me?

1406
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:33,469
Sure. I bet we can be
best friends, Mr. Satan.

1407
01:11:33,714 --> 01:11:36,103
Feel free to come back
and visit anytime.

1408
01:11:36,354 --> 01:11:38,231
I just might do that.

1409
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:39,145
Thanks, Kenny.

1410
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:42,187
Thanks for going back to hell for us.
You're a pal.

1411
01:11:46,554 --> 01:11:48,067
Goodbye, you guys.

1412

I'm alive.
Where's Mr. Hat?

1413
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:06,113
Wow. We were all dying
and now we're fine. That's super!

1414
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:07,833
What the fuck's going on?

1415
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:15,913
See, Mom? It was Cartman's filthy
fucking mouth that saved us all.

1416
01:12:16,154 --> 01:12:19,066
I'm sorry I didn't pay attention
to you, Kyle.

1417
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:22,753
But what about Gregory?

1418
01:12:22,994 --> 01:12:25,144
- I never cared for Gregory.
- You didn't?

1419
01:12:25,394 --> 01:12:27,862
No, dude. Fuck Gregory!
Fuck him right in the ear!

Are friends again

And knock oppression down

Are now complete?
