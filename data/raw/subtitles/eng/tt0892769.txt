1
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,919
<i>This is Berk. </i>

2
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:38,067
<i>It's 12 days North of hopeless and
a few degrees South of freezing to death.</i>

3
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,127
<i>It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery.</i>

4
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:46,136
<i>My village.
In a word: sturdy. </i>

5
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:50,891
<i>It's been here for seven generations
but every single building is new. </i>

6
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:55,572
<i> We have fishing, hunting,
and a charming view of the sunsets. </i>

7
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:58,136
<i>The only problems are the pests. </i>

8
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,074
<i> You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. </i>

9
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,048
<i> We have ...</i>

10
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:09,198
... Dragons.

11
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:12,714
<i> Most people would leave,
but not us.</i>

12
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:13,882
<i>We're Vikings. </i>

13
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,214
<i>We stubbornness issues.</i>

14
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,529
<i>My name is Hiccup. </i>

15
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,994
<i> Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst. </i>

16
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,077
<i> Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off Gnomes and Trolls. </i>

17
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,885
<i>Like our charming
Viking demeanor wouldn't do that. </i>

18
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:30,950
' Morning.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,787
- What are you doing here?
- Get inside!

20
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,510
Get back inside!

21
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:44,652
Hiccup! What is he doing out again ...
What are you doing out? Get inside!

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,213
<i>That's Stoick the Vast, Chief of the tribe. </i>

23
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:52,615
<i> They say that when he was a baby he
popped a Dragon's head clean off its shoulders. </i>

24
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,287
<i>Do I believe it?
Yes, I do.</i>

25
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:56,187
What have we got?

26
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,260
Gronckles, Nadders, Zipplebacks ...
Oh, and hordes of Monstruous Nightmares.

27
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:02,557
Any Night Furys?

28
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:04,967
- None so far.
- Good.

29
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,727
<i> Light the torches!</i>

30
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:15,526
Oh, nice of you to join the party.
I thought you'd been carried off.

31
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:20,319
Who? Me? Nah, come on ...
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,030
They wouldn't know
what to do with all ... this.

33
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,686
Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?

34
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,682
<i>The meathead with the attitude
and interchangeable hands, is Gobber. </i>

35
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,048
<i> I  have been his apprentice
ever since I was little. </i>

36
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,049
<i> Well, littler </i>

37
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,403
We move to the moor defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

38
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,016
<i>See? Old village.
Lots and lots of new houses. </i>

39
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:44,985
Fire!

40
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,270
<i> Oh, and that's Fishlegs </i>

41
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,144
<i> Snotlout </i>

42
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,933
<i>The  twins, Ruffnut and Tuffnut ...</i>

43
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,231
<i> And ...</i>

44
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:55,706
<i>Astrid . </i>

45
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,693
<i>Aww, their job is so much cooler.</i>

46
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:12,076
Oh, come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark!

47
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:14,918
Oh, you have made plenty of marks.
All in the wrong places.

48
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,976
Please, 2 minutes. I'll kill a dragon.
My life will get infinitely better.

49
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,491
I might even get a date.

50
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,007
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

51
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,601
You can't even throw one of these.

52
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:29,659
Okay, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

53
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,760
See, now this right here
is what I'm talking about.

54
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:36,098
But it ... it's a mild calibration issue.

55
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:40,030
Hiccup, if you ever want
to get out there to fight dragons

56
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,380
you need to stop all ....

57
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:42,786
... this.

58
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,622
But you just pointed to all of me.

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,376
Yes, that's it.

60
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:47,604
Stop being all of you.

61
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,218
- Oh ...
- Oh, yes.

62
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,267
You sir, are playing a dangerous game ...

63
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:57,324
... keeping this much raw Vikingness contained.

64
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,949
- There will be consequences!
- I take my chances.

65
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,115
Sword, sharpened, now!

66
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,270
<i> One day I'll get out there. </i>

67
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:09,779
<i> Because killing a dragon
is everything around here. </i>

68
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:14,330
<i>A Nadderhead is sure
to get me at least noticed.</i>

69
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,565
<i> Gronckles are tough.</i>

70
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:18,761
<i> Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend. </i>

71
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,293
<i>A Zippleback: ...</i>

72
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,946
<i> exotic, two heads, twice the status. </i>

73
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:26,346
They found the ship!

74
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:28,489
Concentrate fire over the lower bank!

75
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:29,190
Hurry up!

76
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,531
Fire!

77
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,815
<i> And then, there's the Monstruous Nightmare. </i>

78
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,734
<i>Only the best Vikings go after those. </i>

79
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,289
<i>They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire. </i>

80
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,094
<i> Reload!</i>

81
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,172
I'll take care of this.

82
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:50,150
<i>But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.</i>

83
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,411
We call it the ...

84
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,349
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

85
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,354
<i> Jump!</i>

86
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:02,787
<i>This thing never steals food,
never shows itself, and ...</i>

87
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:05,534
<i> ... never misses. </i>

88
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,491
<i> No one has ever killed a Night Fury. </i>

89
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,393
<i> That's why I'm going to be the first. </i>

90
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:13,740
Mind the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

91
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:16,901
Stay! ...
Put!

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,308
There.

93
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,449
You know what I mean.

94
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,100
- Hiccup, what are you doing?
- Come back here!

95
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,339
Yeah, I know,
Be right back!

96
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:34,284
Mind yourself!

97
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,789
The devils still have some juice in them.

98
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:47,754
Come on.

99
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,291
Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.

100
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,125
Oh! I hit it?
Yes, I hit it!

101
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,174
Did anybody see that?

102
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,382
Except for you.

103
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:27,156
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

104
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:46,732
You're all out.

105
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:55,525
<i> Oh, and there's one
more thing you need to know ...</i>

106
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,291
Sorry, Dad.

107
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,138
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

108
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,684
It's not like the last few times, Dad!

109
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,700
I mean, I really actually hit ...

110
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,275
You guys were busy
and I had a very clear shot.

111
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,524
It went down just off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party out there before ...

112
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:29,795
Stop!

113
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:31,715
Just, stop!

114
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,462
Every time you step outside
disaster falls.

115
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,544
Can you not see
that I have bigger problems?

116
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:41,016
Winter is almost here and I
have an entire village to feed!

117
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:45,803
Between you and me, the village could
do with a little less feeding, don't you think?

118
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:48,044
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

119
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,052
Why can't you follow the simplest orders?

120
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:54,831
I, I can't stop myself.
I see a dragon and I have to just ...

121
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,118
... kill it.
You know, it's who I am, Dad.

122
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:03,412
Oh, you are many things, Hiccup,
but a dragon killer is not one of them.

123
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:07,560
Get back to the house.
Make sure he gets there.

124
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,965
I have his mess to clean up.

125
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:12,245
Quite the performance.

126
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,946
I've never seen any one
mess up that badly. That helped!

127
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,839
Thank you. Thank you.
I was trying.

128
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:23,504
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

129
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,510
- He never listens.
- Well, it runs in the family.

130
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,330
And when he does, it's always
with this disappointed scowl

131
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,601
like someone skimped
on the meat in his sandwich.

132
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:34,634
Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid
you brought me the wrong offspring.

133
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,164
I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms.
Extra guts and glory on the side.

134
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:42,109
This here. This is a talking fish bone!

135
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:44,504
Now, you're thinking about this all wrong.

136
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:49,148
It's not so much what you look like.
It's what's inside that he can't stand.

137
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,433
Thank you for summing that up.

138
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:55,391
Look, the point is, stop trying so hard
to be something you're not.

139
00:08:55,822 --> 00:08:58,137
I just want to be one of you guys.

140
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:10,569
<i> Either we face them or they'll finish us. </i>

141
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,238
It's the only way we'll be rid of them.

142
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,630
If we find the nest and destroy it,
the dragons will leave.

143
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,362
They'll find another home.

144
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,124
One more search, before the ice sets in.

145
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,994
Those ships never come back.

146
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,849
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

147
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,384
Now who's with me?

148
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,584
Alright, ...
Those who stay will look after Hiccup.

149
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:37,190
Now, that's more like it.

150
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,492
I'll pack my undies.

151
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,298
No, I need you to stay,
and train some new recruits.

152
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:47,673
Oh, perfect, yeah. And while I'm busy
Hiccup can cover the store.

153
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:50,994
Molten steel, razor sharp blades,
lots of time to himself ...

154
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:52,765
What could possibly go wrong?

155
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,497
Oh, what am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

156
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:57,030
Put him in training with the others.

157
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,081
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

158
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:02,200
He'd be killed before you
let the first dragon out of its cage.

159
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,985
- Oh, you don't know that.
- I do know that.

160
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,686
- No you don't
- No, actually, I do.

161
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,548
- No, you don't.
- Listen, you know what he's like.

162
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,182
From the time he could crawl
he's been ... different.

163
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:16,520
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

164
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:20,519
I take him fishing and
he goes hunting for .. for Trolls!

165
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:23,084
Trolls exist!
They steal your socks.

166
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,793
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

167
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,857
- When I was a boy ...
- Oh, here we go.

168
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,742
My father told me to bang my head
against a rock, ... and I did it.

169
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,336
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

170
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:34,300
And you know what happened?

171
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,357
- You got a headache.
- That rock split in two.

172
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,067
It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber.

173
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:43,568
He could crush mountains,
level forests, ...

174
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:44,970
... tame seas!

175
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:49,470
Even as a boy I knew what I was,
what I had to become ...

176
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,181
Hiccup is not that boy.

177
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:56,998
You can't stop him, Stoick.
You can only prepare him.

178
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:01,528
I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is
you won't always be around to protect him.

179
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,374
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

180
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,005
Oh, the Gods hate me.

181
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,829
Some people lose their knife or their mug.

182
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,831
No, not me!
I managed to lose an entire dragon.

183
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,199
Ow!

184
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,644
Oh, wow? I.. I did it?
Oh, I did it!

185
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,379
This fixes everything. Yes!

186
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,871
I have brought down this mighty beast!

187
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,996
I'm gonna kill you, dragon.

188
00:12:57,517 --> 00:13:00,884
I'm gonna ... I'm gonna cut out
your heart and take it to my father.

189
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:02,826
I'm a Viking.

190
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,038
I'm a Viking!

191
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,973
I did this.

192
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,475
Hiccup.

193
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,415
Dad? Uh ...

194
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:58,947
- I have to talk to you, Dad.
- I need to speak with you too, son.

195
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:02,798
- I think it's time you to learned to fight dragons.
- I don't want to fight dragons.

196
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,312
- What?
- What?

197
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,674
- Uh, you go first.
- No, no, you go first.

198
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,094
All right. You got your wish.

199
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:12,115
Dragon training. You start in the morning.

200
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,843
Oh man, I should have gone first.

201
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:19,436
Uh, cause I was thinking. You know,
we have a surplus of dragon fighting Vikings but, ...

202
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:23,901
do we have enough bread-making Vikings,
or small home repair Vikings ...

203
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:27,353
- You'll need this.
- I don't want to fight dragons.

204
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,845
- Oh come on, yes you do.
- Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

205
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,556
But you will kill dragons.

206
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,318
No, I'm really very extra sure that I won't.

207
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,617
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

208
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:42,120
This is serious, son.

209
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:46,866
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

210
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,610
Which means: You walk like us.
You talk like us. You think like us.

211
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:56,983
- No more of ... this.
- You just gestured to all of me.

212
00:15:57,518 --> 00:16:00,597
- Deal?
- This conversation is feeling very one-sided.

213
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,581
Deal?

214
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,874
Deal.

215
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:07,217
Good.

216
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,612
Train hard.

217
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,924
I'll be back. Probably.

218
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:16,680
And I'll be here, maybe.

219
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,435
Welcome to dragon training.

220
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,668
No turning back.

221
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:41,584
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:45,061
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or lower back.

223
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,477
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.

224
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,964
Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain, love it.

225
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:52,847
Oh, great, who let him in?

226
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,785
Lets get started.
The recruit who does best,

227
00:16:55,786 --> 00:17:00,003
will win the honor of killing his first
dragon in front of the entire village.

228
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,629
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him or ...?

229
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:06,826
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

230
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,911
Don't worry. You're small and you're weak,
That will make you a less of a target.

231
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:16,145
They'll see you as sick or insane
and go after the more Viking-like teens instead.

232
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,780
Behind these doors are just a few of the

233
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,293
many species you will learn to fight.

234
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:23,440
- The Deadly Nadder.
- Speed: 8, Armor: 16.

235
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:26,548
- The Hideous Zippleback.
- 11 Stealth times two.

236
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,762
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Fire Power: 15.

237
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,007
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack: 8, Venom: 12.

238
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,639
Can you stop that!

239
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:36,985
- And the Gronckle.
- Jaw Strength: 8.

240
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,346
Woah, woah, wait, aren't you going to teach us first?

241
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:42,343
I believe in learning on the job.

242
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:48,041
<i> Today is about survival.
If you get blasted, you're dead. </i>

243
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,744
Quick! What's the first thing
you're going to need?

244
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,285
- A doctor?
- + 5 Speed?

245
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,164
- A shield?
- Shield. Go.

246
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,939
Your most important piece
of equipment is your shield.

247
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,898
If you must make a choice
between a sword or a shield.

248
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,110
Take the shield.

249
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,195
- Get your hands off my shield.
- There's like a million shields.

250
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,510
Take that one.
It has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.

251
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,811
Oops, now this one has blood on it.

252
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:11,696
Tuffnut, Ruffnut, your out.

253
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:12,653
- What?
- What?

254
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,473
Those shields are good for another
thing. Noise.

255
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:18,737
Make lots of it and throw off a dragon's aim.

256
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,219
All dragons have a limited number of shots.

257
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,283
How many does a Gronckle have?

258
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:25,962
- Five?
- No, six.

259
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,966
Right, six. Thats one for each of you.

260
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,376
Fishlegs, out.

261
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,739
Hiccup, get in there!

262
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,108
So anyway, I moved into my parent's basement?

263
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:40,298
You should come by sometimes to work out,
You look like you work out.

264
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,174
Snotlout, your done.

265
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:45,501
- So I guess its just you and me.
- Nope, just you.

266
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,316
One shot left.

267
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:50,893
Hiccup!

268
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:03,873
And that's 6.
Go back to bed you overgrown sausage.

269
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,330
You'll get another chance.
Don't you worry.

270
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:11,117
Remember, a dragon will always ...

271
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:15,133
... always go for the kill.

272
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,538
So why didn't you?

273
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,203
Well this was stupid.

274
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:36,151
Why don't you just fly away?

275
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,725
Alright, where did Astrid
go wrong in the ring today?

276
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:17,989
I mistimed my sommersault dive.
It was sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble.

277
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:21,174
- Yeah, we noticed.
- No, no you were great. That was so Astrid.

278
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:25,491
She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

279
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:28,049
- Uh, he showed up?
- He didn't get eaten.

280
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,980
He's never where he should be.

281
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:35,367
Thank you, Astrid.
You need to live and breathe this stuff.

282
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:40,541
The Dragon Manual ...
Everything we know about every dragon we know of.

283
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,880
No attacks tonight.
Hurry up.

284
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,337
- Wait? You mean read?
- While we're still alive?

285
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:52,371
Why read words when you can just
kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?

286
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,066
Oh, I've read it like 7 times.

287
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,625
There's this water dragon
that sprays boiling water at your face

288
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,915
and there's this other one
that buries itself for like a week ...

289
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:01,947
Yeah, sounds great.
There was a chance I was going to read that.

290
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,437
But now ...

291
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,764
You guys read, I'll go kill something.

292
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:07,404
Hey!

293
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,834
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

294
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:16,812
All mine then? Wow. So, okay.
I'll see you uh, ... tomorrow.

295
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:28,694
Dragon Classifications

296
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:32,136
Strike Class, Fear Class, Mystery Class.

297
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:38,090
Thunder Drum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

298
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:42,678
When startled, the Thunder Drum produces a
concussive sound that can kill a man at close range.

299
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,018
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

300
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:51,410
Timberjack: This gigantic creature has razor-sharp
wings that can slice through full-grown trees.

301
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,904
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

302
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:59,767
Skulldren: Sprays scalding water on its victim.
Extremely dangerous ...

303
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:09,006
Changeling: Even newly hatch dragons can spray acid.
Kill on sight.

304
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:12,849
Gronckle, Zippleback, The Skrill,

305
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,418
Boneknapper, Whispering Death.

306
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:20,778
Burns its victims.
Buries its victims. Chokes its victims.

307
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,591
Turns victims inside out.

308
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,270
Extremely dangerous. ...
Extremely dangerous. ...

309
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:28,484
Kill on sight. ... Kill on sight. ...
Kill on sight. ...

310
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:35,526
Night Fury: Speed unknown.
Size unknown.

311
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:40,270
The unholy offspring of
lightning and death itself.

312
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:42,387
Never engage this dragon.

313
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:47,116
Your only chance:
Hide and pray it does not find you.

314
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:04,380
I can almost smell them.  They're close.

315
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:05,881
Steady.

316
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:18,587
- Take us in.
- Hard to port.

317
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:20,443
The Hell Hounds gate.

318
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:23,304
<i> Hard to port.</i>

319
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:43,746
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice,
the book had nothing on Night Furys.

320
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:48,862
Is there like another book? or a sequel?
Maybe a little Night Fury pamphlet?

321
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,907
<i>Focus  Hiccup!
You're not even trying. </i>

322
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:57,399
<i> Today is all about attack!</i>

323
00:24:57,687 --> 00:25:03,046
<i>Nadder's are quick and light on their feet.
You be quicker and lighter. </i>

324
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,647
I'm really beginning
to question your teaching methods.

325
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:09,310
Look for its blind spot.
Every dragon has one.

326
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,698
Find it. Hide in it, and strike.

327
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,702
- Do you ever bathe?
- You don't like it, then just get your own blind spot.

328
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,260
How about I give you one?

329
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:25,137
Blind spot, yes.
Death spot, not-so-much.

330
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:28,707
Hey, hey, so how would one
sneak up on a Night Fury?

331
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:31,549
No one's ever met one, and lived
to tell the tale. Now, get in there!

332
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,737
I know, I know but hypothetically ...

333
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:51,126
Watch out, babe, I'll take care of this.

334
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,606
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

335
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,007
What do you want me to do?
Block out the sun?

336
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,245
I can do that.
I don't have time right now.

337
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:08,768
- Has anyone ever seen one napping?
- Hiccup!

338
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:11,681
Hiccup!

339
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,207
- Love on the battlefield.
- She could do better.

340
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:18,997
L-Let me ... why don't you ..

341
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,414
Ow! Ow! Ow!

342
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:29,951
Well done, Astrid.

343
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:34,267
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

344
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:40,039
Our parent's war is about to become ours.
Figure out which side your on.

345
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,818
Huh? Toothless.

346
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:04,435
I could of sworn you have ...

347
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:07,606
... teeth.

348
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:11,889
Uh, uh, ... no, no, ... no ...

349
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,518
I ... I don't have anymore.

350
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:07,393
And with one twist,
he took my hand and swallowed it whole.

351
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:10,614
And I saw the look in his face.
I was delicious.

352
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,590
He must have passed the word,
because it wasn't a month

353
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,634
before another one of them took my leg.

354
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:19,244
Isn't it weird to think that your
hand was inside a dragon?

355
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:22,895
Like, if your mind was still in control of it,
you could have killed the dragon from the inside

356
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:25,121
by crushing his heart or something.

357
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:27,154
I swear, I'm so angry right now.

358
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:30,062
I'll avenge your beautiful hand
and your beautiful foot.

359
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:33,425
I'll chop of the legs of every dragon
I fight ... with my face!

360
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:37,380
No. Its the wings
and the tails you really want.

361
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:39,910
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

362
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:42,605
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

363
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:44,296
<i> - Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

364
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,678
Alright, I'm off to bed.

365
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,435
You should be too.
Tomorrow we get to the big boys.

366
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:55,229
Slowly but surely, making our way
up to Monstruous Nightmare.

367
00:32:55,514 --> 00:33:01,007
- But who'll win the honor of killing it?
- It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

368
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,113
<i> - Your mom let you get a tattoo?
- It's not a tattoo. It's a birth mark. </i>

369
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:08,723
<i> Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth
and that was never there before. </i>

370
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:11,881
<i> Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me to the left side until now. </i>

371
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:54,776
Hey, Toothless.
I brought breakfast.

372
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,697
I hope ... I hope you're hungry.

373
00:33:58,591 --> 00:34:00,342
Okay, that's disgusting.

374
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,371
I got some salmon, some nice
Icelandic cod, and a whole smoked eel.

375
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:14,203
No, no, no, no, ... no. ... Okay.

376
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:17,304
Yeah, I don't really like eel much either.

377
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,366
That's it. That's the good stuff.
Aah, don't you mind me.

378
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:31,106
I'll just be back here, minding my own business.

379
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:45,225
Its okay ...

380
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,646
Okay, okay ...

381
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:11,328
Okay, that's not too bad.
It works.

382
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:18,697
No, no, no, no, no, no ... !

383
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:30,295
Oh my ... Its working!

384
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,800
Yes, yes, I did it.

385
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,533
<i> Today, is about teamwork. </i>

386
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:59,231
Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire.

387
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:03,116
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.

388
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:07,296
One head breathes gas.
The other head lights it.

389
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:10,042
Your job is to know which is which.

390
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:13,591
Razor-sharp serrated teeth,
and injects venom for predigestion.

391
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,901
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims.

392
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,424
Will you please stop that?!

393
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:25,454
If that dragon shows either
of his faces, I'm gonna ...

394
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:26,455
There!

395
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,634
Hey, its us, idiots!

396
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,845
Your butts are getting bigger
we thought you were a dragon.

397
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:37,058
Not that theres anything wrong
with a dragon-ass fig ...

398
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:41,348
Wait ...

399
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:46,218
Oh! ... Oh, I'm hurt!
I am very much hurt!

400
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:49,348
Chances of survival are
dwindling into single digits now.

401
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,287
Oh! Wrong head.

402
00:36:58,388 --> 00:36:59,202
Fishlegs!

403
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,007
Now Hiccup!

404
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,863
Aww, come on ...

405
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:13,463
Hiccup!

406
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,179
Back, ... back, back!

407
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,858
Now don't you make me tell you again!

408
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:23,924
Yes, thats right.
Back into your cage!

409
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,872
Now think about what you've done.

410
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,050
Okay, sooo, were we done?

411
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:43,562
Cause I have some things I need to uh ...
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow.

412
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,563
Hey!

413
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:36,011
- What was that?
- How did you do that?

414
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,434
I left my axe back in the ring.
You guys go on ahead.

415
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,657
I'll catch up with you.

416
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,075
Meet the Terrible Terror.

417
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,464
Ha! It's like the size of my ...

418
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,057
Oooh! ... Get it off!

419
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,099
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

420
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,068
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

421
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:16,879
What?

422
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,257
Ooh, great.

423
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:22,081
<i>Hiccup. </i>

424
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:39,263
<i> Hiccup? Are you in there? </i>

425
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:44,661
Astrid, hey. Hi, Astrid.
Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid

426
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,979
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

427
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,447
Well, weirder.

428
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,824
Well, I trust you found the nest at least?

429
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,227
Not even close.

430
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,837
Excellent.

431
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,119
I hope you had a little
more success than me.

432
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,339
Well, if by success, you mean that your
parenting troubles are over with, ...

433
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,591
.. then, yes.

434
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,189
Congratulations Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved.

435
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:35,257
Out with the old,
and in with the new, right?

436
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:36,648
No one will miss that old nuisance.

437
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:39,002
The village is throwing a party to celebrate.

438
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:41,611
He's gone?

439
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:45,808
Um, yeah, most afternoons,
but who can blame him?

440
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,843
I mean, the life of
a celebrity is very rough.

441
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:51,292
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

442
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:53,534
- Hiccup?
- Who would have thought it, eh?

443
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:56,929
He has this way with the beasts.

444
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:07,638
Okay there, bud, were gonna take this nice and slow.

445
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,865
Here we go. Here we go.
Position three, no, four.

446
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,744
Alright, it's go time.
It's go time.

447
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,735
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

448
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:50,230
Yes, it works!

449
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:56,171
Sorry!

450
00:42:58,728 --> 00:42:59,862
That's my fault.

451
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,145
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
Position four, uh, three.

452
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:10,266
"Yeah! Go baby!

453
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,908
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my ...

454
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,586
... cheat sheet!

455
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:16,589
Stop!

456
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,765
No!

457
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,558
Oh, Gosh!
Oh, God!

458
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:26,945
Oh no!

459
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:30,125
Alright. Okay.
You gotta kinda angle yourself!

460
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,386
Okay. No, no, no...
Come back down towards me.

461
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:33,687
Come back down ...
Oww!

462
00:43:33,687 --> 00:43:33,688
- subs by majtjk0ng -

463
00:44:13,473 --> 00:44:15,224
Yeah!

464
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,032
Come on ...

465
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:29,050
Uh, no thanks. I'm good.

466
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,357
Not so fire-proof
on the inside, are you?

467
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:08,859
Here you go.

468
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:28,426
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.

469
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,956
Dad, you're back!

470
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,898
Gobber's not here, so ...

471
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:43,119
I know.

472
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,514
I came looking for you.

473
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:49,714
- You did?
- You've been keeping secrets.

474
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,389
I have?

475
00:45:51,508 --> 00:45:53,415
Just how long did you think
you could hide it from me?

476
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,235
I ... I don't know what you ...

477
00:45:56,636 --> 00:46:00,819
Nothing happens on this island,
without me hearing about it.

478
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,820
Oh?

479
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:07,384
So, lets talk ... about that dragon

480
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:08,407
Oh Gods ...

481
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:10,293
Dad, I'm so sorry. I-

482
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:14,659
I was going to tell you, I
just didn't know how to uh ...

483
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:23,699
- Y-you're not upset?
- What? I was hoping for this!

484
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:25,876
- Ah, you were?
- And believe me ...

485
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,179
It only gets better. Just wait till you
spill a Nadder's guts for the first time ...

486
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,738
... and mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear.

487
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:36,671
What feeling!
You really had me going there, son.

488
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:41,753
All those years of the
worst Viking Berk has ever seen.

489
00:46:41,788 --> 00:46:44,364
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

490
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,603
And all the while
you were holding out on me.

491
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:48,326
Oh, Thor almighty!

492
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:53,263
With you doing so well in the ring ...

493
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:55,867
... we finally have something to talk about.

494
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:13,180
I uh, I brought you something ...

495
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,953
... to keep you safe in the ring.

496
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,203
Wow, thanks.

497
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:20,339
Your mother would wanted you to have it.

498
00:47:20,778 --> 00:47:22,588
It's half of her breast plate.

499
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,327
Matching set. Keeps her ...
Keeps her close, you know?

500
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:31,803
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.

501
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:34,012
You've held your end of the deal.

502
00:47:39,282 --> 00:47:41,595
I should really get to bed.

503
00:47:41,713 --> 00:47:44,133
- Yes, good, okay, good talk.
- Yeah ...

504
00:47:44,174 --> 00:47:48,193
I'll see you back at the house.
Great. Thanks for stopping by and ...

505
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:50,287
- ... the uh ... breast hat.
- I hope you like the, umm, ... the hat.

506
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,299
Well, good night.

507
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,168
Stay out of my way.
I'm winning this thing!

508
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,513
Good. Please.
By all means.

509
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,235
This time!
This time for sure!

510
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:40,341
No! No, son-of-a half troll,
rat-eating munch bucket...!

511
00:48:40,638 --> 00:48:41,609
Wait! Wait.

512
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,730
So ... later.

513
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,168
- Oh, oh! Not so fast!
- I'm kinda late for ...

514
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:48,502
What!
Late for what, exactly?

515
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:51,709
Okay, quiet down.
The Elder has decided.

516
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:05,060
Boy, you've done it!
You've done it, Hiccup!

517
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:07,186
You get to kill the dragon!

518
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:11,371
That's my boy!

519
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:14,539
Yeah! Yes, I can't wait.
I am so ...

520
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,199
... leaving. We're Leaving.

521
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,352
Lets pack up.

522
00:49:18,782 --> 00:49:21,255
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.

523
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:22,868
Forever.

524
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:27,383
Awww, man.

525
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:32,464
What the ... ?
Uh, w .. what are you doing here?

526
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:34,547
I want to know what's going on.

527
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,472
No one just get as good as you do.

528
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,493
Especially ... you.

529
00:49:39,682 --> 00:49:41,283
- Start talking.
- I ... I ...

530
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:42,234
Are you training with someone?

531
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:43,406
Training? I didn't ...

532
00:49:43,628 --> 00:49:45,239
It better not involve this.

533
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,453
I know, this looks really bad
but you see, this is ...

534
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:54,656
You're right. You're right. You're right.
I ... I'm through with the lies.

535
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:57,096
I've been making ... outfits!

536
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,924
So, you got me.
It's time everyone knew.

537
00:50:00,027 --> 00:50:02,224
Drag me back. Go ahead. Here we go.

538
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:04,375
Oww. Why would you do that?

539
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:06,031
That's for the lies!

540
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:09,231
And thats ...
for everything else!

541
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:10,946
Oh man.

542
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,022
Get down!

543
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:16,101
Run! Run!

544
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,968
No! No! It's okay. It's okay.
She's a friend.

545
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:25,258
You just scared him.

546
00:50:25,278 --> 00:50:26,593
I scared him?

547
00:50:28,304 --> 00:50:29,940
Who is him?

548
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:34,280
Astrid, Toothless.
Toothless, Astrid.

549
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,313
Dut, da da... We're dead.

550
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,943
Woah, woah woah.
Where do you think your going?

551
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,363
Oh, great Odin! Don't.
Oh, this is ...

552
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,306
Hiccup, get me down from here!

553
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,402
You have to give me a chance to explain.

554
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:11,382
I am not listening to anything you have to say!

555
00:51:11,426 --> 00:51:14,236
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

556
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:17,177
Please, Astrid.

557
00:51:32,535 --> 00:51:34,025
Now get me down!

558
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,769
Toothless, down.
Gently.

559
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,770
See, nothing to be afraid of.

560
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:45,154
Toothless?

561
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,005
What is wrong with you?
Bad dragon!

562
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:52,801
He's uh, he's not usually like this.

563
00:51:53,004 --> 00:51:53,918
Oh, no!

564
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,170
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

565
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,529
And now he's spinning!

566
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,967
Thank you for nothing
you useless reptile!

567
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:15,913
Okay, I am sorry, I'm sorry.
Just get me off of this thing.

568
00:53:59,517 --> 00:54:02,355
Alright, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

569
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:07,286
It's amazing.
He's amazing.

570
00:54:10,091 --> 00:54:11,324
So what now?

571
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:15,041
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow!

572
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,970
You know your gonna have to kill a ...

573
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:18,819
<i> kill a dragon ...</i>

574
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,131
Don't remind me.

575
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,269
Toothless, what happening?

576
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:26,807
Whoa, what is it?

577
00:54:29,754 --> 00:54:30,848
Get down!

578
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,268
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

579
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,927
Toothless, you gotta
get us out of here, bud.

580
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,065
It looks like they're hauling in their kill.

581
00:54:57,943 --> 00:54:59,614
What does that make us?

582
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,849
What my dad wouldn't give to find this.

583
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,079
Oh, it's satisfying to know that all
of our food has been dumped down a hole.

584
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:05,851
They're not eating any of it.

585
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,674
What ... was that?

586
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,353
Alright, bud, we gotta get
out of here. Now!

587
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:44,771
No, no, it totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

588
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:47,200
They're the workers,
and that's their queen.

589
00:56:47,263 --> 00:56:50,047
It controls them.
Let's find your dad.

590
00:56:50,082 --> 00:56:51,166
No, no.

591
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:55,073
No. Not yet.
They'll kill Toothless.

592
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,523
Astrid, we have to think
this through, carefully.

593
00:56:58,441 --> 00:57:01,397
Hiccup, we just
discovered the dragon's nest.

594
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:04,303
The thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here.

595
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:06,090
And you want to keep it secret?

596
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,299
To protect your pet, dragon?
Are you serious?

597
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:12,805
Yes.

598
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:21,981
Okay. Then what do we do?

599
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:25,840
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

600
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:27,793
Okay. ...

601
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,598
That's for kidnapping me.

602
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,869
That's for ...
everything else.

603
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:50,802
What are you looking at?

604
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:00,869
Well, I can show my face in public again.

605
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:06,674
If someone had told me that
in a few short weeks

606
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:10,786
Hiccup will go from,
well being ... uh ... Hiccup,

607
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:14,208
to placing first in dragon training.

608
00:58:14,332 --> 00:58:18,608
Well, I would have tied him to a mast
and shipped him off. For fear he'd gone mad.

609
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,023
And you know it.

610
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,218
But, here we are.

611
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:29,587
And no ones more surprised
or more proud than I am.

612
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:33,568
Today my boy becomes a Viking!

613
00:58:34,435 --> 00:58:37,455
Today he becomes one of us!

614
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,005
Be careful with that dragon.

615
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,755
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.

616
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:46,301
What are you going to do?

617
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:47,826
Put an end to this.

618
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:49,459
I have to try.

619
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:55,793
Astrid, if something goes wrong,
just make sure they don't find Toothless.

620
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:59,813
I will, just promise me
it won't go wrong.

621
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:01,949
It's time, Hiccup.

622
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:03,872
Knock 'em dead.

623
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,393
I'd have gone for the hammer.

624
00:59:32,116 --> 00:59:33,471
I'm ready.

625
00:59:56,985 --> 00:59:59,470
Go on Hiccup, give it to him!

626
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,068
What is he doing?

627
01:00:07,832 --> 01:00:10,049
Its okay, its okay.

628
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:19,288
I'm not one of them.

629
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,430
What's he thinking?

630
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:26,574
Stop the fight!

631
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:29,270
No! I need you all to see this.

632
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:32,830
They're not what we think they are.

633
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:34,863
We don't have to kill them.

634
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:38,484
I said stop the fight!

635
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:46,971
Out of my way!

636
01:00:47,006 --> 01:00:47,950
Hiccup!

637
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:09,269
Hiccup!

638
01:01:16,303 --> 01:01:17,265
This way!

639
01:01:37,157 --> 01:01:38,491
Night Fury!

640
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,919
Alright, Toothless. Go!
Get out of here.

641
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,523
Go, go!

642
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,797
No, dad!
Dad, he won't hurt you!

643
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:09,775
Toothless, stop!

644
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,247
No. No!

645
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,339
Get him!

646
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,040
No, no, please.
Just don't hurt him

647
01:02:24,034 --> 01:02:25,277
Please. Don't hurt him

648
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,559
Put it with the others.

649
01:02:35,906 --> 01:02:37,158
I should have known.

650
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:38,857
I should have seen the signs.

651
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:40,542
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

652
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:44,447
I know! We did, but that was before I ...
Oh, it's all so messed up.

653
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:47,765
So everything in that ring ...
A trick? A lie?

654
01:02:48,088 --> 01:02:50,583
I screwed up.
I should have told you before now.

655
01:02:51,623 --> 01:02:55,760
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

656
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:58,698
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

657
01:02:59,137 --> 01:03:00,693
Not the people you almost killed?

658
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:02,785
He was just protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

659
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:05,216
They've killed hundreds of us!

660
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:09,407
And we've killed thousands of them.
They defend themselves, that's all.

661
01:03:10,374 --> 01:03:12,220
They raid us because they have to.

662
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:16,127
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

663
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,079
There's something else on their island, dad.
It's a dragon-like ...

664
01:03:20,435 --> 01:03:23,520
Their island?
So, you've been to the nest?

665
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,540
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

666
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:30,310
No, no, I didn't. Toothless did.
Only a dragon can find the island.

667
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:34,650
No, no, dad, no please.
Its not what you think.

668
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:37,809
You don't know what your up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

669
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:41,195
Dad, please, I promise you.
You can't win this one!

670
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,956
Dad, no!

671
01:03:44,364 --> 01:03:47,247
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me!

672
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,674
You've thrown your lot in with them.

673
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:54,856
You're not a Viking.

674
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:58,247
You're not my son!

675
01:04:01,802 --> 01:04:03,331
Ready the ships!

676
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:58,072
Set sail!

677
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,420
We head for Hell-hinds Gate.

678
01:05:08,802 --> 01:05:11,193
Lead us home, devil.

679
01:05:31,298 --> 01:05:35,367
It's a mess.
You must feel horrible.

680
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:40,280
You've lost everything.
Your father, your tribe, your best friend.

681
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:42,312
Thank you for summing that up.

682
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,003
Why couldn't I've killed that dragon,
when I found him the woods?

683
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,561
Would've been better for everyone.

684
01:05:49,704 --> 01:05:51,312
Yep, the rest of us would have done it.

685
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:54,253
So, why didn't you?

686
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,371
Why didn't you?

687
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:01,310
I don't know. I couldn't.

688
01:06:01,468 --> 01:06:04,680
- That's not an answer.
- Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?

689
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:08,264
Because I want to remember
what you say, right now.

690
01:06:08,314 --> 01:06:11,548
Ah, for the love of ...
I was coward, I was weak.

691
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,407
I wouldn't kill a dragon!

692
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,664
You said wouldn't that time?

693
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,616
Whatever, I wouldn't!

694
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:20,647
300 years and I'm the first Viking
who wouldn't kill a dragon.

695
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:27,204
First to ride one though.

696
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,605
So?

697
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,437
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

698
01:06:37,463 --> 01:06:40,826
I looked at him and I saw myself.

699
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:44,791
I bet he's really frightened now.

700
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,028
What are you gonna do about it?

701
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:51,091
Probably something stupid.

702
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:53,267
Good, but you've already done that.

703
01:06:54,672 --> 01:06:56,355
Then something crazy!

704
01:06:57,591 --> 01:06:59,283
That's more like it.

705
01:07:07,693 --> 01:07:10,910
Sound your positions!
Stay within earshot.

706
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,956
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men just now and well, you know, ...

707
01:07:17,987 --> 01:07:20,605
... some of them are wondering
what it is we're up to here?

708
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,907
Not me of course. I know you
are always the man with the plan.

709
01:07:24,027 --> 01:07:28,198
But some, not me, are wondering
if there is in fact a plan at all ...

710
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:30,351
... and what it might be?

711
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:32,094
Find the nest and take it.

712
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:36,556
Of course. Send them running.
The old Viking fallback. Nice and simple.

713
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,108
Step aside.

714
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,674
Head to port.

715
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,759
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

716
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:15,080
You were wise to seek help from the
world's most deadly weapon.

717
01:08:15,393 --> 01:08:16,194
It's me.

718
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,758
- I love this plan!
- I didn't ...

719
01:08:18,812 --> 01:08:21,513
You're crazy. I like that.

720
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:24,846
So, what is the plan?

721
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,270
<i> That's not very encouraging.</i>

722
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:39,951
Oh, I was wondering where that went.

723
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,612
Stay low, and ready your weapons.

724
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:11,725
We're here.

725
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,968
Wait, what are you ...?!

726
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:48,531
It's okay. ... It's okay.

727
01:09:59,464 --> 01:10:00,524
Where are you going?

728
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:03,292
You're gonna need
something to help you hold on.

729
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:16,013
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is gonna break loose.

730
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,625
... in my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

731
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:22,022
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

732
01:11:15,415 --> 01:11:17,155
Is that it?

733
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:24,002
We've done it!

734
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:32,699
This isn't over!

735
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,081
Form your ranks.
Pull together!

736
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,586
Get clear!

737
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,718
Beards of Thor, ... !
What is that?

738
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:07,456
Odin, help us!

739
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:14,063
- Catapults!
- Fire!

740
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:24,649
- Get to the ships!
- No, nooo!

741
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:38,990
- Not that one ...
- I was a fool.

742
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:41,120
Lead the men to
the far side of the island.

743
01:12:41,485 --> 01:12:42,440
Gobber, go with the men.

744
01:12:42,499 --> 01:12:45,367
I think I'll stay, just in case
you're thinking of doing something crazy.

745
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:48,511
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing something to hunt for.

746
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:51,209
Then I can double that time.

747
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:56,523
- Here!
- Oh, no. Here!

748
01:13:07,702 --> 01:13:10,596
- Fight me!
- No, me!

749
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:19,197
Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs!

750
01:13:19,923 --> 01:13:20,912
Move, Fishlegs!

751
01:13:22,004 --> 01:13:25,687
Look at us! We're on dragons!
We're on dragons! All of us!

752
01:13:29,932 --> 01:13:34,141
Every bit the bull-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were.

753
01:13:35,837 --> 01:13:37,406
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- Okay.

754
01:13:37,799 --> 01:13:41,355
Heavily armored skull and tail made for
bashing and crushing. Steer clear of both.

755
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,680
Small eyes, large nostrils.
Relies on hearing and smell.

756
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:48,595
Okay, Lout, Legs, hang in it's blind spot.
Make some noise. Keep it confused.

757
01:13:48,622 --> 01:13:51,501
Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has
a shot limit. Make it mad.

758
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,894
- That's my specialty!
- Since when?

759
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:55,696
Everyone knows I'm more irritating, see.

760
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:59,419
Just do what I told you.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

761
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,743
- Don't worry! We got it covered!

762
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:02,944
<i> Yeah!</i>

763
01:14:11,236 --> 01:14:12,480
- Fool!
- Butto!

764
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:13,783
Bye, ya Grendel!

765
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:22,061
Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!

766
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,672
There!

767
01:14:34,232 --> 01:14:35,325
Go help the others!

768
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:37,761
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

769
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:44,482
- Its working!
- Yeah, its working!

770
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:57,567
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

771
01:15:00,426 --> 01:15:01,296
I'm okay!

772
01:15:02,118 --> 01:15:03,504
Less okay.

773
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:09,807
I can't miss! Whats wrong, buddy?
You got something in your eye?

774
01:15:13,564 --> 01:15:15,450
Yeah, you're the Viking!

775
01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:22,033
Woah!

776
01:15:51,624 --> 01:15:52,832
Dad?

777
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:12,266
You got it, bud!

778
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:15,944
Hiccup!

779
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:19,315
I'm sorry ...

780
01:16:20,602 --> 01:16:21,738
... for ... for everything.

781
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:23,599
Yeah ... me too.

782
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:25,157
You don't have to go up there.

783
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:29,101
We're Vikings.
Its an occupational hazard

784
01:16:30,248 --> 01:16:32,703
I'm proud to call you my son.

785
01:16:34,618 --> 01:16:35,937
Thanks, Dad.

786
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:42,412
He's up!

787
01:16:45,995 --> 01:16:47,347
Get Snotlout outta there!

788
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:48,611
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

789
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,742
Hey, let me drive!

790
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:53,648
- Don't push me!
- I'll push your teeth out!

791
01:16:57,183 --> 01:16:58,816
You know, I can't believe that worked.

792
01:17:06,615 --> 01:17:09,077
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

793
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:20,468
Did you get her?

794
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:31,177
Go!

795
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:35,770
This thing has wings.
Okay, lets see if it can use them!

796
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:52,873
You think that did it?

797
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,497
Well, he can fly.

798
01:18:19,815 --> 01:18:23,806
Okay, Toothless, time to disappear!
Come on, bud!

799
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:31,226
Here it comes!

800
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:22,949
Watch out!

801
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:27,591
Okay, times up.
Let's see if this works.

802
01:19:30,455 --> 01:19:32,380
Come on!
Is that the best you can do?

803
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:52,028
Stay with me, buddy. We're good.
Just a little bit longer.

804
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,830
Hold, Toothless.
Now!

805
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,619
No ... No!

806
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,011
Hiccup!
Hiccup!

807
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,771
Son!

808
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:51,157
Hiccup!

809
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:14,043
Oh son!

810
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:17,162
I did this.

811
01:21:46,451 --> 01:21:50,077
I'm s...
I'm so sorry.

812
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:56,664
Hiccup!

813
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:06,388
He's alive!
You brought him back alive!

814
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:25,519
Thank you ...
for saving my son.

815
01:22:26,297 --> 01:22:29,423
Well, you know, most of him.

816
01:22:46,644 --> 01:22:48,083
Hey, Toothless.

817
01:22:49,242 --> 01:22:51,011
Happy to see you too, buddy.

818
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:56,023
Aawww, what ... uh ...
I'm ... in my house

819
01:22:57,737 --> 01:22:59,017
You're in my house.

820
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,388
Does my dad know your here?

821
01:23:01,552 --> 01:23:03,414
Uh, what, oh, okay, ... okay.

822
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:07,972
Toothless, no.
Toothless! Aw, come on.

823
01:23:46,012 --> 01:23:48,218
Okay.
Thanks, bud.

824
01:23:58,846 --> 01:24:00,605
Toothless, stay here.

825
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:03,970
C'mon guys. Get ready!
Hold on tight. Here we go!

826
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:07,612
What?

827
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,123
I knew it. I'm dead.

828
01:24:18,982 --> 01:24:21,000
No, but you give it your best shot.

829
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:22,909
So, what do you think?

830
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:24,497
Hey look, it's Hiccup!

831
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:26,840
<i> Hiccup!</i>

832
01:24:28,973 --> 01:24:32,826
It turns out, all we needed
was a little more of ... this.

833
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:34,977
You just gestured to all of me?

834
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:39,202
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

835
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:42,568
With a little Hiccup flare thrown in.
You think that'll do?

836
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:44,843
I might make a few tweaks.

837
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:48,539
That's ... for scaring me.

838
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:50,939
What ... what, is it always going
to be this way? Because ...

839
01:24:53,909 --> 01:24:55,238
I could get used to it.

840
01:24:58,370 --> 01:24:59,895
Welcome home.

841
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,246
<i> - Night Fury!
- Get down!</i>

842
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,229
You ready?

843
01:25:16,615 --> 01:25:18,349
<i>This is Berk  ...</i>

844
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:22,872
<i>It snows  nine months of the year
and hails the other three. </i>

845
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:27,197
<i> Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless. </i>

846
01:25:29,494 --> 01:25:32,272
<i> The people that grow here
are even more so. </i>

847
01:25:35,902 --> 01:25:38,493
<i> The only upsides
are the pets. </i>

848
01:25:41,153 --> 01:25:44,242
<i> While other places have
ponies or parrots ...</i>

849
01:25:46,086 --> 01:25:47,236
<i>We  have ...</i>

850
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:50,309
