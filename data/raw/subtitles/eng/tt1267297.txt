1
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,891
<i>You think you know
the truth about him?</i>

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>You know nothing.</i>

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,060
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

4
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,145
<i>King of the gods.</i>

5
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,490
<i>His mother, Alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,198
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,161
<i>Half human,</i>

8
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,664
<i>half god.</i>

9
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,589
<i>But Zeus' queen, Hera,
saw this bastard child as an insult,</i>

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,888
<i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i>

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,383
<i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,</i>

12
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,639
<i>which means "glory of Hera,"</i>

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,729
<i>but this failed to appease the goddess.</i>

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,733
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

15
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,672
<i>Luckily, he took after his father.</i>

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,463
<i>Once he reached manhood,</i>

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,546
<i>the gods commanded him
to perform Twelve Labors,</i>

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,261
<i>twelve dangerous missions.</i>

19
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,926
<i>If he completed them all and survived,</i>

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,891
<i>Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,159
<i>He fought the Lernean Hydra!</i>

22
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,266
<i>He battled the Erymanthean Boar!</i>

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,032
<i>But his greatest Labor
was the Nemean Lion.</i>

24
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,536
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

25
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,005
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,684
<i>But even this monster was no match
for the son of Zeus.</i>

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,977
What a load of crap!

28
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,646
Every word is true.

29
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,648
You know what I think?

30
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,528
This friend of yours doesn't even exist.

31
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,035
Laugh all you want.

32
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,997
He's coming. And be warned, Gryza,
he despises pirates.

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,833
Macedonia has been good to us.

34
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,795
Plenty of villages ripe for pillaging.

35
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,209
We are here to stay.

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,547
Finish him.

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,349
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

38
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,387
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

39
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,945
Yet, <i>as</i> I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

40
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,071
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.

41
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,816
Yet, he still destroyed it.

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,746
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

43
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,831
I did it with my bare hands!

44
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,460
Or so they say.

45
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,214
Hercules.

46
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,924
Is this all the men you have?

47
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,966
There's 40 of us. One of you.

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,936
The king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you.

49
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,938
So leave, or die.

50
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,770
I get paid either way.

51
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,061
Make him bleed.

52
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,866
Five men with a single blow.

53
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,824
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,908
Bring me his head!

55
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,001
Seems they need
more convincing, Autolycus.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,423
That's why we're here.

57
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,840
Atalanta.

58
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,506
Amphiaraus.

59
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,768
May Zeus forgive you.

60
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,516
Tydeus?

61
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,794
Die, Hercules!

62
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,928
Ah, good man.

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,431
Hurry!

64
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,354
Hurry! Uncle!

65
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,561
Uncle, hurry!

66
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,321
Hurry! Hurry!

67
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,818
Any longer, Uncle...

68
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,864
And the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions.

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,497
The rest of you may go.

70
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,997
But not you.

71
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,764
Thirteen,

72
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,393
14,15,153,

73
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,310
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,439
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

75
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,569
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,733
Not a bad night.

77
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,530
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

78
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,910
Their resolve must be broken, lolaus.

79
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,746
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

80
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,997
make it bigger, scarier.

81
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,081
The more they believe
Hercules is truly the son of Zeus,

82
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,756
the less likely they are to fight.

83
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,842
Oh!

84
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,545
Aye.

85
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,389
- Amphiaraus?
- Mmm?

86
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,383
Care to join us here on Earth?

87
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,561
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,
fighting across a sea of corpses.

88
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,403
If you're going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

89
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,871
Huh?

90
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,460
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

91
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,875
Fight it!

92
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,760
Keep practicing, boys!

93
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,422
So who's next? You? You?

94
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,594
Ah!

95
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,435
That's a pretty sight.

96
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,891
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

97
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,933
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

98
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,318
Or live simply.

99
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,447
You still dreaming of barbarian lands?

100
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,030
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

101
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,113
That is where I will live out
the rest of my days in solitude.

102
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,372
Boring, if you ask me.

103
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,166
Maybe so, Autolycus.

104
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,578
But I'll never find peace unless
I move <i>as</i> far away as possible.

105
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,214
What of Tydeus?

106
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,168
Without you to temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

107
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,301
Tydeus will go with me.

108
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,130
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

109
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,469
Uncle!

110
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,553
Join us.
The girls are eager to welcome you.

111
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,609
See? I told you I knew Hercules.

112
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,695
Are you his servant?

113
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm his nephew.

114
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,486
Are you, really?

115
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,279
I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

116
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,036
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

117
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,241
the Belt of Hippolyta

118
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,329
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

119
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,006
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

120
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,631
It is a wonder
you share the same blood <i>as</i> Hercules.

121
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,508
Have fun.

122
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,551
- Ladies.
- Oh...

123
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,494
What do you want with Hercules?

124
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,326
My words are for him, not you.

125
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,577
Atalanta, it's all right.

126
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,291
You certainly are a hard man to find.

127
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,380
Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

128
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,261
I'm not just anyone.

129
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,047
My name is Ergenia,
daughter to Lord Cotys.

130
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,388
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

131
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,813
My father is most unfortunate.

132
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,061
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

133
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,481
Our land is torn by civil war.

134
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,443
Every day, villages are destroyed,
crops ruined, innocents slaughtered.

135
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,406
We all have problems.

136
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,371
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

137
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,072
Unfortunately, My Lady,

138
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,288
Hercules is fully committed
till the Feast of Dionysus.

139
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,910
We could, however,

140
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,251
advance you to the front of the line,
for the right price.

141
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,456
Hmm.

142
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,258
I thought heroes fight for glory.

143
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,294
But mercenaries fight for gold.

144
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,133
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

145
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,513
I like him already.

146
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,267
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

147
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,727
Eat up.

148
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,651
"A lion and crow in strange alliance."

149
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,817
Told you.

150
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,248
Where are we going?

151
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,450
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

152
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,528
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

153
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,736
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

154
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,067
Ah.

155
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,362
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

156
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,540
Though not quite <i>as</i> big an honor
as I expected.

157
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,328
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

158
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,630
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

159
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,420
It's meant to be.

160
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,965
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

161
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,385
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

162
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,852
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

163
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,393
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

164
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,856
Mother!

165
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,691
Arius.

166
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,280
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

167
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,741
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

168
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,865
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

169
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,746
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

170
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,875
Hercules is probably tired.

171
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,703
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

172
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,666
That's enough, Arius. Come along.

173
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,297
Stay away from him.

174
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,092
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

175
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,512
But he's Hercules. He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

176
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,434
Lord Cotys will see you now.

177
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,652
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

178
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,655
Once or twice.

179
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,791
- Father!
- Ah!

180
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
Megara.

181
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,926
Welcome home, my love.

182
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,934
Hercules!

183
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,776
Whenever I'm here, I imagine
this is what Elysium must look like.

184
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,701
Well, men like us
have the means

185
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,826
to create our own paradise on Earth.

186
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,327
Look.

187
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,912
Magnificent, aren't they?

188
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,498
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

189
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,339
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

190
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,516
<i>The masks of serpents.</i>

191
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,603
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

192
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,027
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

193
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,026
Let the people have their hero.

194
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,738
All hail King Eurystheus.

195
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,158
And the mighty protector of Athens,

196
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,706
Hercules!

197
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,119
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

198
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,548
A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

199
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,045
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

200
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,266
Lord Cotys awaits.

201
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,708
Hercules.

202
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,586
Welcome.

203
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,590
An honor to host such a legend.

204
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,755
Lord Cotys.

205
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,429
But in legend, you fight alone.

206
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,763
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

207
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,303
Autolycus of Sparta.

208
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,437
Tydeus of Thebes.

209
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,190
Atalanta of Scythia.

210
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,277
Lolaus of Athens.

211
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,488
And Amphiaraus of Argos.

212
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,903
Amphiaraus?

213
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,114
The famed seer of Argos.

214
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,539
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

215
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,293
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

216
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,962
What else can you tell of the future?

217
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,927
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

218
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
A shame.

219
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,341
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

220
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,137
The gods can be frustrating sometimes,
Lord Cotys.

221
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,364
With respect, I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

222
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,567
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

223
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,743
I stand corrected.

224
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,089
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

225
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,343
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

226
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,805
But now Thrace is divided.

227
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,761
This war has depleted our forces.

228
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,561
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

229
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,767
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

230
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,274
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

231
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,398
Only by a god.

232
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,438
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

233
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,067
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

234
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,825
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

235
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,040
Centaurs?

236
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,997
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

237
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,506
Come, Hercules.

238
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,214
Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

239
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,972
Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

240
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,231
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

241
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,485
I feared nothing could ever
be good again, till you arrived.

242
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,317
I'm just a mercenary fighting for gold.

243
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,368
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

244
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,912
How others perceive us is important.

245
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,912
And your name, like it or not,

246
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,293
is a rallying cry.

247
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,128
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

248
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,548
Nobody has any faith anymore.

249
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,762
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

250
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,145
My son believes in you.

251
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,609
Bring us peace,

252
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,780
and I will believe in you, too.

253
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,036
I'm convinced these are good people.

254
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,170
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

255
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,215
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing <i>as</i> a pair of breasts.

256
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,542
Maybe, but gold never ages.

257
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,923
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

258
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,256
Double your weight in gold?
Well done.

259
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,386
Amphiaraus?

260
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,887
If it be the will of Zeus.

261
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,345
Which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

262
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,023
"Hercules: Savior of Thrace"
or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?

263
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,021
Both sound terrifyingly boring.

264
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,820
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

265
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,029
Train them.

266
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,535
Oh, shit.

267
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,500
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

268
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,380
Surviving.

269
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,128
My companions and I will show you
how to stay alive,

270
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,178
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

271
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,968
Autolycus.

272
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,684
Shield wall! Form!

273
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,242
Corpses! Every last one of you!

274
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,086
Because your shield wall was weak.

275
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,583
Dead.

276
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,377
Dead.

277
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,212
Very dead.

278
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,302
Soldier,

279
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,588
many lives depend on you.

280
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,758
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

281
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,808
You understand?

282
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,229
Yes, sir.

283
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,766
When a shield wall is strong,

284
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,895
nothing can ever defeat it!

285
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,615
You must learn to work together,
react together.

286
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,945
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

287
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,371
that will be stronger than iron.

288
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,002
I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

289
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,376
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

290
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,465
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

291
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,767
Ah! There you are!

292
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,263
Hercules, my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

293
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,223
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

294
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,020
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

295
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,649
Demons march with them.

296
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,439
So now we're fighting demons.

297
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,484
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

298
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,366
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

299
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,623
He will be on them within six days.

300
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,331
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

301
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,667
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

302
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,460
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

303
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,636
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

304
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,722
Face Rhesus with an untrained army

305
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,757
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

306
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,975
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

307
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,141
The longer Rhesus lives,

308
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,979
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed.

309
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,699
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

310
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,867
Hercules,
the gods have offered us a gift.

311
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,074
We must not squander it.

312
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,793
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

313
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,411
No.

314
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,247
The son of Zeus will.

315
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,016
I've seen how you watch over Hercules.

316
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,690
Tell me,

317
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,489
how did a woman,

318
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,283
beautiful woman,

319
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,454
fall in with these hardened men?

320
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,700
Killers?

321
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,121
Son of Zeus need
a woman's protection?

322
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,002
I don't protect him.

323
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,550
I protect you from him.

324
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,379
Hmm.

325
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,574
General, from now on, maybe you
should favor the company of your men.

326
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,204
He pulled a knife?

327
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,881
It was only a small prick.

328
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,585
Ah!

329
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,370
Your mother told you to stay away.
You should listen.

330
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,378
What's wrong with him?

331
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,301
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

332
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,265
He was born in war.

333
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,608
When l found him,
he was more animal than human.

334
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,525
He never speaks of what he saw.

335
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,115
He never speaks at all.

336
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,786
But he relives it every night.

337
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,705
Come.

338
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,286
Let's find your mother.

339
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,209
When I grow up,
I want to be a great hero like you.

340
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,171
- Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

341
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,425
I know all your Labors.

342
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,351
Like the Cretan Bull, you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights.

343
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,585
Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

344
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,435
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

345
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,189
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

346
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,353
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt,

347
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,736
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

348
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,615
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.

349
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,498
- Mother.
- Arius.

350
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,837
You're supposed to be in bed.

351
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,841
Why are you in the hospice?

352
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,880
My mother <i>saves</i> people's lives.

353
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,926
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

354
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,182
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

355
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,105
If I could be like you,

356
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,439
I would protect all of Thrace
and no one would ever get hurt.

357
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,411
Here.

358
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,533
I was going to give this
to someone else,

359
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,999
but I never got the chance.

360
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,711
Only a hero may wear this.

361
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,760
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

362
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,095
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

363
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,476
- It is.
- Thank you.

364
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,595
Thank you.

365
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,721
Good night.

366
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,228
Good night, Hercules.

367
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,400
Have no fear.

368
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,202
If you fall in the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to Elysium,

369
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,490
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

370
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,916
like Theseus.

371
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,166
Odysseus!

372
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,328
And the great Achilles.

373
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,336
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

374
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,928
Lolaus.

375
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,264
Your place is beside Lord Cotys,
where it's safe.

376
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,431
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

377
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,037
You're a storyteller, not a warrior.

378
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,183
We share the same blood.

379
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,773
And I will not see it shed. Chariot.

380
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,187
Now.

381
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,705
Thracians,

382
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,497
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

383
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,871
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

384
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,795
When you fight, the wall is your armor.

385
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,628
The shield wall will
never break formation

386
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,554
as long as there is breath in your body.

387
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,258
Remember these words,

388
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,268
and you will taste victory.

389
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,688
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

390
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,791
Halt!

391
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,543
Halt!

392
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,921
- Halt!
- Halt!

393
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,245
We are too late.

394
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,086
Rhesus has already been here.

395
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,839
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

396
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,416
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

397
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,458
I hate being right all the time.

398
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,089
Halt.

399
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,719
- Halt!
- Halt!

400
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,258
This head is rotting.

401
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,740
A week old, at least.

402
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,495
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

403
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,947
Uncle!

404
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,933
And we've walked into a trap.

405
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,531
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! lolaus, go!

406
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,283
Shield wall!

407
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,465
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

408
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,087
This is Rhesus' doing.

409
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,670
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

410
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,464
Turn comrades against each other.

411
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,516
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

412
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,989
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

413
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:53,241
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

414
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,834
That's comforting.

415
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,466
I think he wants a challenge.

416
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,160
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

417
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,571
Lethal to anyone but him!

418
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,454
Watch!

419
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,879
Did you see that?

420
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,389
The gods fight on our side!

421
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,054
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

422
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,973
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

423
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,767
Hercules! Hercules!

424
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,686
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

425
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,414
Battle position!

426
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,844
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

427
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,167
Stand fast!

428
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,399
Hold your position!

429
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,618
Do not yield!

430
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,931
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

431
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,767
Hold the lines!

432
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,519
Do not yield!

433
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,192
Defend Lord Cotys!

434
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,649
The wall has been breached!

435
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,929
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend Lord Cotys!

436
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,398
Whip!

437
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,330
Hercules!

438
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,290
Bring the chariots!

439
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,925
Defend your Lord!

440
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,934
No!

441
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,011
Advance!

442
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,888
Advance!

443
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,528
Make way!

444
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,296
Where is Rhesus?

445
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,698
Lord Cotys.

446
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,702
We came here to save this village,

447
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,621
but, no, they killed half my army.

448
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,953
Rhesus.

449
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,247
This is all his doing.

450
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,582
And yours.

451
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,253
I warned you.

452
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,087
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

453
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,627
Give me time to make warriors.

454
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,843
Very well.

455
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:56,356
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

456
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,575
Phineas.

457
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,652
You plead your life.

458
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,613
And I gladly offer it.

459
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,120
I failed to see this trap.

460
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,497
The fault is mine!
Spare the other scouts.

461
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,954
General Sitacles.

462
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,295
I think we've lost enough men
for the day, don't you?

463
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,010
But just to avoid
future misunderstandings,

464
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,180
I'll be taking charge
of your scouts from now on.

465
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,598
Is that clear?

466
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,686
Thank you.

467
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,393
Another mistake, I'll end you myself.

468
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:17,058
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay to seal the wound.

469
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,016
This is extract of lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

470
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,694
It should rest you after consuming it.
It may have certain side effects.

471
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,816
I don't need it.

472
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,154
Ah, forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

473
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:34,454
And, uh,
your lion's hide is indestructible?

474
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,207
Drink, son of Zeus.

475
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,797
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

476
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,124
Where is he now?

477
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,425
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

478
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,550
I'm sorry.

479
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,799
I never knew my father.

480
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,391
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

481
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,983
Tell me about Arius.

482
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,652
Oh. He's a good boy.

483
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,655
And someday, he will make a fine king.

484
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,315
Do you have any children?

485
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,745
Do they live in Athens?

486
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,331
Thank you for your care.

487
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,114
The sedative will help you rest.

488
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,501
How could you do such a terrible thing?

489
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,378
By law, I should execute you,

490
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,052
but I believe a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live.

491
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,848
So you can walk the earth in torment,
haunted by the knowledge

492
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,894
that you alone are responsible
for the death of your loved ones.

493
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,186
The great Hercules.

494
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,235
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

495
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,814
Get out, you monster.

496
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,898
Get out!

497
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,810
No!

498
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,936
It happened
again, didn't it, hmm?

499
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,270
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

500
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,565
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

501
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,110
There's a word for that. Madness.

502
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,620
When we were driven from Athens,

503
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,198
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi
on your behalf.

504
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,079
Do you remember her prophecy?

505
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,250
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

506
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,961
And what is that, Hercules?

507
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,627
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

508
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,796
I speak from experience.

509
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,557
No matter how far you run, no matter
how fast you go, the beast will follow.

510
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,515
Man cannot escape his fate.

511
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,905
Room for one more in your company?

512
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,542
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change.

513
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,291
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

514
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,873
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

515
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,458
Both can satisfy in different ways.

516
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,720
You're a famed storyteller, lolaus.
Grace me with a story.

517
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,803
Any particular subject, My Lady?

518
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,848
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

519
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,688
Is it true?
Did Hercules slaughter his own family?

520
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,323
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

521
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,576
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

522
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,619
King Eurystheus will have him executed.

523
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,954
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

524
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,755
No myths. I want the truth.

525
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,587
No one knows the truth.

526
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,047
Not for sure.

527
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,474
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, Megara and the children, dead.

528
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,892
He remembers nothing.

529
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,345
Do you believe he is innocent?

530
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:38,602
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

531
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,188
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

532
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:47,243
Hercules' strength set him apart.

533
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,035
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

534
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,114
The Twelve Labors.

535
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,908
And he took me with him.

536
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,501
To fight by his side.

537
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,459
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

538
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:04,051
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

539
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,799
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

540
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,632
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

541
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,592
He became my brother-in-arms.

542
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,225
Thebes, the city of corpses,

543
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,727
where we found a single child,

544
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,725
still alive.

545
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,520
Hercules took Tydeus in when

546
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,277
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

547
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,903
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

548
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,238
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

549
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,495
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal.

550
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,123
So we played along.

551
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:42,586
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus. It's good.

552
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,212
Scares the enemy.

553
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,002
Lolaus helps.

554
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,836
He talks nice.

555
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,304
You're very loyal friends.

556
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,680
You're avoiding my question.

557
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,979
Hercules is a warrior.

558
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,806
And there is something
that haunts warriors.

559
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,391
It can cloud their minds.

560
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,444
We call it the Blood Rage.

561
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,397
This rage afflicted Hercules.

562
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,734
He made me vow
to keep the world away from him.

563
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,570
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

564
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,657
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

565
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,200
The truth,

566
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,666
whatever the truth,

567
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,673
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

568
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,301
Only the gods can help him,

569
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,300
if he listens.

570
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,352
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

571
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,434
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

572
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,861
Zeus' master ironsmith,

573
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,239
using the forges of your own citadel,

574
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,865
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

575
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,121
As steel is hewn into shields,

576
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,665
so, too, will you be hewn into warriors.

577
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,956
You shall carry the shield of Hercules!

578
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,636
It's lighter.

579
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,639
Infused with the souls
of Stymphalian birds

580
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,561
from Hercules' sixth Labor!

581
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,940
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

582
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,777
Well, much as birds take flight,

583
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,482
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air. It's in the fibers. Here.

584
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,568
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

585
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,326
It covers my whole face.

586
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:47,044
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

587
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,626
You sure it wasn't your horseshit
that frightened Geryon to death?

588
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,382
Mmm?

589
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,429
General Sitacles,

590
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,762
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

591
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,407
Leather armor?

592
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,151
Mmm?

593
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,038
We will be skewered like pigs.

594
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,167
Linothorax.

595
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,585
Hewn from the skin of
the Erymanthean Boar.

596
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,545
It's indestructible.

597
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,221
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

598
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,344
He used an indestructible blade.

599
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,161
One, two.

600
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,340
Get up.

601
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,668
Next!

602
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,019
Again!

603
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,813
Both eyes open.

604
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,145
Keep practicing.

605
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,153
Firmer grip.

606
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,321
Elbow up.

607
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,691
Good.

608
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,451
Shield wall! Form!

609
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,755
Stand tall.

610
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,541
Excellent.

611
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,865
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

612
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,236
Again!

613
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,003
Rhesus is here.

614
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,423
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

615
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,753
What did you see?

616
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,045
Centaurs. Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

617
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,756
He saw shadows in the night.

618
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,266
My Lord,
I will go ahead into the Rhesus camp.

619
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,094
I will bring word of his plans.

620
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,442
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall.

621
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,732
You want to stop Rhesus?

622
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,818
We'll go through the forest
and they'll never see us coming.

623
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,946
It'll slow down our chariots. A gamble.

624
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:03,944
I have a plan.

625
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,992
The scouts have returned.

626
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,753
Rhesus has made his camp
in Mount Asticus, 72 leagues away.

627
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,377
Once these men are ready, we march.

628
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,628
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

629
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,424
The gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter.

630
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,384
What they have told me is that

631
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,390
I'm soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

632
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,393
When will you die?

633
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,856
Within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell.

634
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,152
As always,
the gods are generous with hints,

635
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,408
but cheap on specifics.

636
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,370
Cheer up, Hercules.

637
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,499
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

638
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,871
I'm ready for what's next.

639
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,553
Thracians, halt!

640
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,011
Shield wall! Form!

641
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,430
Battle positions!

642
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,317
Tydeus?

643
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,823
There is no enemy camp.

644
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,739
This is the right place.

645
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,762
Centaurs!

646
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,847
They're real.

647
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,372
It seems that we're expected.

648
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,968
Centaurs?

649
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,324
Rhesus!

650
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,867
You have come looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

651
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,586
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

652
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,247
Your legend ends here.

653
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,332
Look at me.

654
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,838
Do I look afraid?

655
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,685
Phineas.

656
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,518
Traitor!

657
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,224
Hades will have you!

658
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,776
After it has you, My Lord.

659
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,945
It is over, Cotys.

660
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,737
Mount Asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

661
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,368
And my troops outman you three to one.

662
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:18,786
Surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful.

663
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,452
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

664
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,551
You've made your choice.

665
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,393
Go!

666
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:01,371
In this moment, on this day,

667
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,915
become the man you were born to be!

668
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,921
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

669
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:14,342
Let it be to death or victory!

670
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,135
Charge!

671
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:29,936
Shield wall!

672
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,897
Flanks out!

673
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,625
Maybe today.

674
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,352
Now!

675
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,919
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

676
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,462
Silence, boy!

677
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,170
Spears forward!

678
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,527
Archers, ready!

679
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,154
Loose!

680
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,828
Advance!

681
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,589
Set them aflame!

682
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,724
Take cover!

683
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,397
Defend Lord Cotys!

684
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,251
Maybe not.

685
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,333
Shield wall! Attack!

686
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,418
Push forward!

687
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,067
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

688
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,037
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

689
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,665
It is not over yet!

690
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,367
Fucking centaurs.

691
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,882
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

692
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,844
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

693
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,383
Hail, Lord Cotys!

694
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,962
Halt!

695
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,262
Get up.

696
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,715
Get up.

697
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,273
- Up.
- Enough!

698
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,782
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

699
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,032
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

700
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,536
I burned no villages.

701
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,543
Then who did?

702
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,874
Ask yourself, if Cotys is beloved,

703
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,194
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

704
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,753
Keep moving, dog.

705
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,882
You've been fighting on the wrong side.

706
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,125
Where are you going?

707
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,206
I'm taking some water to the prisoner.

708
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,676
Sit down.

709
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,759
It's time.

710
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,859
Thrace is finally united.

711
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,693
One land,

712
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,619
one King,

713
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,785
one Thrace.

714
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,283
One land!

715
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,669
One King! One Thrace!

716
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,626
Thrace is not a man, a king, or a god!

717
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,624
Thrace is her people!

718
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:57,555
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

719
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,261
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

720
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:12,653
Don't do anything foolish.

721
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,365
Where are you going?

722
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:25,874
I saw pity in your eyes for Rhesus.

723
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,584
Why?

724
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,381
Look at me.

725
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,842
Cotys is responsible for this war,
isn't he?

726
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:39,677
You lie very well.
Clearly, your father's daughter.

727
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,226
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

728
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:49,485
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted
in any way, Arius would be executed.

729
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:53,031
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

730
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,576
My husband was king.

731
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,116
And Cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

732
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,324
Rhesus fought back. Civil war broke out.

733
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,209
Arius is the legitimate king.

734
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,046
My father is old.

735
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,584
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

736
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,720
my son will be a good king.

737
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,932
And he will heal this land.

738
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,258
That's a dream.

739
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,644
And you can help.

740
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,724
Please, when you leave Thrace,
take Arius with you.

741
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,607
Please keep him safe.

742
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,019
Find another savior.

743
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,603
Hercules?

744
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,737
The King commands your presence.

745
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,539
My Lady.

746
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,920
Ah, champion of Thrace!

747
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,140
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

748
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,891
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

749
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,223
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

750
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,396
You betrayed me, Cotys.

751
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,227
Betrayed?

752
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:17,274
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

753
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,779
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

754
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,195
Let's not quibble about details.

755
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:31,204
We all know your legend, Hercules.
But here is mine.

756
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,044
When I was a general
in the army of Thrace,

757
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,797
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

758
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,175
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

759
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,098
I now crave an empire.

760
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:48,389
My thousands will train more thousands,
and they even more.

761
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,565
The <i>lessons</i> of Hercules will spread.

762
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,397
What you began here
can never be stopped.

763
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,530
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

764
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,150
then lead it.

765
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,331
You want me to serve you?

766
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,876
Spare me the moral outrage.

767
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,205
Child killer.

768
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,835
Getting us all killed, bad idea.

769
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,225
Well, I must take this as a "no."

770
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,553
In that case,

771
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,599
your services are no longer required.

772
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,655
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

773
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:25,072
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

774
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,823
Take mine, too.

775
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,377
What do you think you're doing?
Let's go.

776
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,168
There will be no more innocent blood
on my hands.

777
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,750
I can't leave without setting this right.

778
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,844
Oh, I see.

779
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,220
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

780
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:48,674
Thrace needs our help.

781
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,764
To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

782
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,008
You remember the Black Sea.

783
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,020
That beach you spoke of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

784
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,354
I would never be free.

785
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,446
In this fight, you're alone.

786
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,163
Never saw that one coming.

787
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,402
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

788
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,459
- Why not?
- It's all right.

789
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:19,422
You've sacrificed your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

790
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,628
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

791
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,384
Debt?

792
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,634
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

793
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,141
Look around, Hercules.

794
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,552
We're family.

795
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,971
All we have is each other.

796
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:40,310
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time, we will die for you.

797
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,357
Because you would die for us.

798
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,158
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

799
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,322
This is madness.

800
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,904
You want madness?

801
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:54,287
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

802
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,999
Is that not the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

803
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,258
Crazy. The lot of you.

804
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,018
Autolycus.

805
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,639
Lolaus. Go with Autolycus.

806
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,682
I think I'll stay.

807
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:20,850
Nephew.

808
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:26,072
Uncle, all I've ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others.

809
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:31,991
It's time I stopped telling their stories.
Started living my own.

810
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,040
Well, you may have all
completely lost your minds, but not me.

811
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,876
Not me.

812
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,247
Autolycus?

813
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,882
Live like a king, my friend.

814
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,185
What about Cotys?

815
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,311
He paid us to save Thrace.

816
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,861
Let's not disappoint him.

817
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,976
Lay down your arms.

818
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,438
Lay down your arms!

819
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,108
Or your nephew dies first.

820
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:04,963
I invite you to join me. You refuse.

821
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,295
I order you to leave. You return.

822
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,051
Get your hands off me.

823
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,091
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

824
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:19,302
They were planning to remove
the young Prince from your protection.

825
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:25,975
No.

826
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,982
Let go of him! Don't touch him!

827
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,441
Arius! No!

828
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,661
No! You're hurting him! No!

829
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,162
Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

830
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,169
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

831
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,171
Arius! No!

832
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,589
Magnificent, aren't they?

833
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,810
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

834
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,600
As long as they're fed.

835
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,350
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

836
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,902
They remember you.

837
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,148
Confused, Hercules?

838
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:01,074
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

839
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:06,998
King Eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

840
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,673
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

841
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,256
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

842
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,759
I didn't quite catch that.

843
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,271
The wolves.

844
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,859
They were there that night.

845
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,478
<i>The wolves were there.</i>

846
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,279
<i>You drugged me.</i>

847
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,629
<i>The wolves were there
the night my family was murdered.</i>

848
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,139
My men told me
how your children screamed

849
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,851
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

850
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,311
As their fangs despoiled your daughter's

851
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,188
pure flesh.

852
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:18,197
When the people called out your name
louder than mine,

853
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:21,651
you see, when they saw you <i>as</i> a god,

854
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,953
how long before
they saw you as their king?

855
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,533
I wanted nothing!

856
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:29,246
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

857
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,874
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

858
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,796
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

859
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,585
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

860
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,762
I had to ruin your name.

861
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,267
My Wife!

862
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,016
My children!

863
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,023
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

864
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,358
All of you!
Starting with my faithless daughter!

865
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,105
No! Get off me!

866
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,029
No! No! No!

867
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,661
Unhand me! No!

868
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,663
She's your own flesh and blood!

869
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,199
I will raise Arius to be
my worthy successor!

870
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:14,837
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

871
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,507
- You are a monster! You are a monster!
- No!

872
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,167
You are not a man!

873
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,504
You're a demon!

874
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,338
Who are you?

875
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,347
Are you a murderer?

876
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,010
Damn you! I curse you!

877
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,554
Are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent?

878
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,347
Stay away from my son!

879
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:34,954
Are you only the legend?

880
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:38,732
Or are you the truth behind the legend?

881
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,521
No! Father, please, please, please.

882
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,164
We believe in you.

883
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,487
We have faith in you.

884
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,573
Have faith in yourself.

885
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,952
Save me!

886
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,746
Remember the man
that you are.

887
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,284
Father, the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

888
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,703
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

889
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,189
the Labors you have accomplished!

890
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,130
No! No!

891
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,504
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

892
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,669
Now, tell me!

893
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,753
Please!

894
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,597
Who are you?

895
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,761
I am Hercules!

896
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:24,281
Unleash the wolves!

897
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:29,820
Get away!

898
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,325
Ahh!

899
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,628
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

900
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,922
Ahh!

901
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,345
Hurry!

902
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:53,844
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

903
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,481
No!

904
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:10,994
Ahh!

905
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,256
The gods have revealed your innocence.

906
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,763
The final Labor is complete.

907
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,016
But I'm just getting started.

908
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,248
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

909
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,098
My time.

910
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,737
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

911
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,317
You're welcome.

912
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,503
I'm going after Eurystheus!

913
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,895
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

914
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,481
You see, Cotys poisoned my mind.

915
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,737
Turned me against you.

916
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:13,817
I like you.

917
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,281
No, stop.

918
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,951
I command you to stop! I'm your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

919
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,367
You swore to Zeus!

920
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,451
Wait, wait, wait.

921
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:27,081
You fight for gold. I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

922
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,008
Find it in your heart to forgive.

923
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,341
You want forgiveness?

924
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,818
Ask my family for forgiveness.

925
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,555
I've never killed a god before.

926
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,684
I really think I'm ready to fight now.

927
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,565
Well done, warrior.

928
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,336
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

929
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,543
- We need to find Arius.
- Follow me.

930
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,059
Soldiers of Thrace!

931
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,852
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

932
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,111
Don't be fools!

933
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,319
Hercules is mortal! Not a god!

934
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,695
Anyone who sides with him will die!

935
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,871
And I will show you.

936
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,574
Bring him.

937
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,330
- Arius!
- Mama!

938
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,874
No! He's your grandson!

939
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,169
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

940
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,346
But you may yet save him.

941
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,551
Please, Father! No!

942
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,594
Admit defeat!

943
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,593
Bow to me!

944
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:48,765
You have until the count of three!

945
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,939
One!

946
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:54,978
Two!

947
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,821
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

948
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,112
Protect Lord Cotys!

949
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,453
Arius, run!

950
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:08,621
Mother!

951
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:10,952
Get the boy!

952
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,378
Ahh!

953
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,175
Tydeus!

954
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,479
Attack!

955
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,432
Hold them back!

956
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,577
Spears!

957
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,422
Go through the fire!

958
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:46,139
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

959
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,348
Easy, Tydeus.

960
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,339
Hercules.

961
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:45,824
Lock shields!

962
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,530
March!

963
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,531
Find peace, my brother.

964
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:13,560
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to defeat a shield wall!

965
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,350
There is no way out!

966
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,395
Come out and face me!

967
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:30,201
You're no hero! You're no god!

968
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:33,326
You're nothing but a mercenary!

969
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,207
Your wife and children deserved to die!

970
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,855
What're you doing?

971
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,733
Get back up there!

972
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,519
Hercules must die!

973
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,781
Come on!

974
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,246
Kill that filthy bastard!

975
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,849
Hercules! Hercules!

976
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,937
Hercules! Hercules!

977
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:26,398
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

978
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:30,151
Hercules! Hercules!

979
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:35,313
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

980
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,292
<i>You want to know
the truth about Hercules?</i>

981
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,291
<i>There it is.</i>

982
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:49,625
<i>To be honest, I prefer it to the legend.</i>

983
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,507
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

984
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,344
<i>Is he actually the son of Zeus?</i>

985
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,351
<i>I don't think it really matters.</i>

986
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:04,230
<i>You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.</i>

987
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:07,685
<i>You just need to believe you're a hero.</i>

988
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,520
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

989
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:16,323
<i>But then again, what the hell do I know?</i>

990
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,696
<i>I'm supposed to be dead by now.</i>
