1
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,028
Fire.

2
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:17,976
Aaah.

3
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:39,659
Bugler, sound recall.

4
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,854
It's over.

5
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,914
It's over.

6
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:04,496
Corporal Clemens, sir, from Masters'
Brigade at Dante's Crossroads.

7
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,560
Who gave you permission
to come ridin' across

8
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,493
the face of my command
yellin' like a fool?

9
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:10,320
Have you got a message for
me from General Masters?

10
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:10,859
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:13,135
Deliver it.
That's it, sir.

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,733
The war is over.

13
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,560
Lee surrendered to General
Grant in Virginia--

14
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:18,999
a place called
Appomattox Courthouse.

15
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,644
When?
Three days ago, sir.

16
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,059
Three days, huh?

17
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,928
General Masters just got word
himself, Colonel Thomas.

18
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:40,062
Our wires were down.
With your permission, sir.

19
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,972
Rig up a flag of truce,
Blue Boy.

20
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,839
Short Grub?
Yo.

21
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,316
Let's go.

22
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:19,444
I be a sergeant, sir.
Can I be of any service to y'all?

23
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,417
I'd like to talk
to your commanding officer.

24
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,476
Who be givin' orders today, Jim?

25
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,490
Yes, sir?

26
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,497
Major...

27
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:37,025
I've just received word that Lee
surrendered to Grant three days ago.

28
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:40,798
Yes, sir.
You knew it?

29
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,102
We received the news yesterday.

30
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:47,635
I don't think you understand,
Major. The war is over.

31
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:50,547
No, sir.

32
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:53,485
Are you telling me that
you intend to keep fighting?

33
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:56,819
Haven't we just proven it?
But why?

34
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,452
Because this is our land,
and you're on it.

35
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,498
We're all Americans.

36
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:07,970
Yes, sir. That's always been
the saddest part of it.

37
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,139
Good day, sir.
Colonel.

38
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,233
Thank you for your courtesy.

39
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,432
Damn.

40
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:38,026
Come on.

41
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,335
Captain Anderson.
Here, sir.

42
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:50,184
General Robert E. Lee
surrendered. Am I right?

43
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,276
Yes, sir.

44
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:55,689
That means that officially we
no longer exist as an armed body,

45
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,250
yet everywhere I look here
today I see armed men...

46
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,762
wearing uniforms
and flying the battle flag.

47
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,322
Get it down.
Yes, sir.

48
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:06,267
Jamison.

49
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,269
Yes, sir?

50
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,135
Take down the flag.
Yes, sir.

51
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:16,878
All right, people,
now listen to me, all of you.

52
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,983
We have about 2,000 miles to go.

53
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:24,113
Seven hundred of them are between
here and the Mexican border...

54
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,056
and through a Yankee
occupation army.

55
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:30,528
We are not gonna give the lowliest
blue belly we meet along the way...

56
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:34,034
any reason to suspect we're anything
but a band of homeless pilgrims.

57
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:38,698
Until we cross the Rio Grande, arms and ammunition
will remain in the bottom of the wagons.

58
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,866
You men pack those uniforms away
and wear regular clothing.

59
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,240
The poorer looking, the better.

60
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:48,408
Now, once across the border,
we still have another 500 miles to go...

61
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:51,282
before we reach
a town called Durango.

62
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,789
There we will be met by representatives
of Emperor Maximilian...

63
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,656
who will escort us to Mexico City.

64
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,888
Captain Anderson.
Sir?

65
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:03,057
We leave at midnight.
Yes, sir.

Whoa.

91
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,832
Ah, Mrs. Langdon.
My name is Benedict.

92
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:38,737
Thad Benedict, late of Pittsburgh,
but now of Natchez.

93
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:41,072
This here's my partner,
Jimmy Collins.

94
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,077
Word's goin' around,
Mrs. Langdon,

95
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:46,080
that you people are of a mind
to put your place up for sale.

96
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:46,735
Is that right?

97
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,108
I beg your pardon, sir, but
I'm the sister-in-law.

98
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,746
I believe you want to speak
to Mrs. James Langdon.

99
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:55,315
Ah, Mrs. James Langdon.
Thad Benedict is my name.

100
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:58,692
I was just telling your sister-in-law
here we heard the place is up for sale.

101
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:01,492
Is that right?
No, that is not right, Mr. Benedict.

102
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:05,331
Aw, come on, ladies, we've come
all the way from Natchez...

103
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:08,371
just to make you people
a handsome offer.

104
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:10,771
Mind if I get down?

105
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,940
Yes, she does.
And so do I.

106
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:20,453
My father restin' over there--
he minds too.

107
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,549
Well, well, well, well.
You must be Colonel Langdon.

108
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,095
James Langdon?

109
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:33,528
Well, uh, Colonel,
I'm here to do you a favor.

110
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:37,663
Well, let's see now.
Uh... Langdon Hall Plantation.

111
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,505
Ah, yes, here it is.
Fifteen hundred acres.

112
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,510
Is that right?

113
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:50,042
Six hundred acres bottomland, four hundred
in pasture and five hundred in woods.

114
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,614
Two streams, three ponds with
a two-and-a-half mile riverfront.

115
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,752
Nice place.

116
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,853
Thank you kindly.

117
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,592
I imagine the house could use
a little work, though, huh?

118
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,105
It could stand it.

119
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:09,472
Yeah. Well, I'll just
have a look inside.

120
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,739
We just swept the floor,
Mr. Benedict.

121
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,945
You understand?

122
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,956
I'll give you 50 cents an acre.
That's my top offer.

123
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:27,085
You buzzards, you come down here lookin'
to get fat on the misfortune of others.

124
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:30,358
This house is not for sale.

125
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,400
Not now, not next year,
not ever.

126
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,903
Colonel, we are businessmen.
You're trash.

127
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:40,069
Well, well. You're a right
plain-talkin' gentleman, ain't you?

128
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,976
You hear what the man
said, Jimmy? Trash.

129
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:45,311
All right, who's
gonna pick your cotton,

130
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:48,317
and who's gonna plow up
all that bottomland out there?

131
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,149
And who's gonna chop
the wood when it gets cold?

132
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,418
Now, now, Jimmy. No need
to get uppity with the colonel.

133
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:58,623
Sixty cents an acre.
Take it or leave it.

134
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:01,825
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

135
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,335
If I was you,
I'd grab it.

136
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,702
We're gonna get it
anyway, you know.

137
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,834
We'll get the house and every last acre
of land when they put it up for taxes.

138
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,971
Oh, I see.

139
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:17,108
And, uh, how do you know it will
be put up for taxes, Mr. Benedict?

140
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:22,120
You went busted outfittin'
that rebel regiment of yours.

141
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,316
Now, what do you say?

142
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,259
Sixty cents... or nothin'.

143
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:36,796
Hyah.

144
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:40,274
Hyah. Hyah.

145
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,874
This belonged to
Granddaddy Langdon, Horace.

146
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,941
I think maybe
he'd want you to have it.

147
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:21,782
Thank you, sir.

148
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:38,473
Little George.
Yes, sir?

149
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,882
Bring along that anvil and as
many tools as you can carry.

150
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:41,502
Yes, sir.

151
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:45,447
Colonel, anybody goin' with us
talk that there Mexican?

152
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,965
Why don't you
stop lookin' at me?

153
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,970
I can't, Charlotte.

154
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,974
I just can't
keep my eyes off you.

155
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:12,443
Well, you make me uneasy,
Bubba Wilkes, so stop it.

156
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:18,786
You know, I've asked you a dozen times
to marry me, and you've never answered.

157
00:14:18,854 --> 00:14:21,287
I'm too young to marry.

158
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,926
No girl who looks the way you do
is too young to marry.

159
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:30,261
Well, I am. If you don't
believe me, you can ask my daddy.

160
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,736
Ask your daddy. Your daddy knows there's
no man better suited to marry you--

161
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,739
Charlotte.

162
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,732
Maybe you'd better go on up to
the house and help your mother.

163
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:54,977
You're a good junior officer, Bubba Wilkes.
Thank you, sir.

164
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:58,175
Don't let anybody tell you you're not.
No, sir.

165
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,685
But as a young man...

166
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:04,622
with a desire
for my daughter's hand...

167
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,626
you're pitiful.

168
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,027
It embarrasses me to watch you.

169
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,623
I don't understand, sir.
You sure don't.

170
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,863
You let moonlight and magnolia
blossoms go to your head,

171
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:18,098
and you forget the real
purpose of your mission.

172
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:20,107
Newby.

173
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:35,116
Don't tell me
I can't resign, Joe.

174
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:38,560
I volunteered into this outfit,
and I'll volunteer out.

175
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,122
There's still a lot
of work to be done.

176
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,499
Not for me, there isn't.
I came into this thing...

177
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:47,733
three years ago with
7 5 volunteers, all good riders.

178
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:50,240
Do you know how many
of those men are left?

179
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,709
No, but I imagine
you're going to tell me.

180
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,475
Well, if you'll look out
this window, you'll see ten.

181
00:15:56,548 --> 00:16:00,077
Two of them
won't make Christmas.

182
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:03,784
I still can't understand what those men
have to do with you resigning.

183
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,760
They didn't join the army, Joe.
They joined me.

184
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:09,318
For three years
I've watched them fall,

185
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,297
and not one of 'em quit
and not one of 'em deserted.

186
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:15,303
Those that are left deserve
more than a pat on the back...

187
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:19,604
from some newspaper editor, and
I'm gonna see that they get it.

188
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:23,635
The army needs horses. Well, there's
plenty of horses in the Territory--

189
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:27,810
wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico--
and we're goin' after them.

190
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,264
And sell them to the army?

191
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,313
We're sure as hell not gonna
give 'em to the army.

192
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:36,624
All right. Write out a letter
of resignation, and I'll see that--

193
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,034
You came in mighty handy
a few times.

194
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:47,300
Take care of yourself.
We may need you again, John Henry.

195
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,671
You'll have a hard job
finding me, Joe.

196
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:14,531
Where to, John Henry?

197
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:19,405
Short Grub, I've been tryin' for three
years to get you to call me "Colonel."

198
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,409
Now it's too late.

199
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:24,846
Where to, John Henry?
West.

200
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:55,515
The barn's yours, Newby.
Yes, sir.

201
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,674
Good-bye, old lady.

202
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:13,061
How come you know they're
gonna get in here today?

203
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:16,004
'Cause I told him
to be here today, that's why.

204
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:20,011
Where do you think you're
gonna mail that thing, Solomon?

205
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,414
There's a Pony Express,
ain't there? Somewhere.

206
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:27,783
Still a long ways
to Oklahoma, John Henry.

207
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:31,118
Anything could happen.
Not to Blue Boy, it won't.

208
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,658
Come on, tightwad,
give me a chew.

209
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,057
Wait a minute, Baker.
I've only got one left.

210
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:39,189
Come on, give me that.
Hey, that's too big. Come on.

211
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,360
Give me that.

212
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,665
Give me that.
That's my last one.

213
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,206
Come on now, Frank.
I gave you a chew.

214
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,538
All right, I've had it.
Give me that, Frank.

215
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:52,102
Give me that. Give me that.
Hey. Hey.

216
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:55,549
Well, I'll be damned.
Lookie yonder.

217
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,305
Hello, Two Toes.
How's your wife?

218
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,499
Pregnant.

219
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,374
What, again?
Cold winter.

220
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,812
How are you, McCartney?
Mister McCartney.

221
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:27,649
John Henry, the least you can do
after I come all this way is say hello.

222
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,721
Hello, Mr. McCartney.

223
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,843
I broke my butt to get here.
You can show me some respect.

224
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,659
Your cookin' still as bad as I remember it?
You go to hell.

225
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,028
You still got
that mangy old cat?

226
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,068
High Bred--
finest partner I ever had.

227
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,126
Cleans his paws
and buries his leavings.

228
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:46,502
Lot more than
some folks I know.

229
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:53,080
Any trouble?
No. Lost track of time, though.

230
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:55,378
I reckon I'm a day early
or a day late.

231
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:59,785
You're four days late, but they
don't know it. How are things at home?

232
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:01,825
Bad, like everywhere else,
I guess.

233
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:05,991
Yeah. Well, I guess
we better get organized.

234
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,922
Don't lose
those two over there.

235
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:46,267
Get 'em all.

236
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:17,140
Take your time. I'll have
McCartney send you some grub.

237
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:24,214
That'll be damn nice of you. I hope
I can do the same for you sometime.

238
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:09,290
Tough way to make a few dollars.

239
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:13,668
Fighting the damn war was
a hell of lot easier than this.

240
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:22,610
Not too close, Mudlow.
Might be catchin'.

241
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:24,845
It ain't right, you folks
holdin' anger on me...

242
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,548
just because I wouldn't
join your blamed old army.

243
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:30,717
Go on, get.
Just mean.Just mean folks.

244
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:36,894
Charlotte, I'd like to talk
to you tonight after supper.

245
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:39,797
After it's dark, you mean?

246
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:44,066
All you want to do is hold me
and hug me and kiss my lips.

247
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,234
Is there somethin'
wrong with that?

248
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:48,971
Well, a young lady's lookin'
for a mite more these days...

249
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:51,378
than huggin' and holdin'
and kissin'.

250
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,748
She's lookin' for somethin'
a teensy bit more substantial...

251
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,754
than periphery and trimmings.

252
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:58,915
Like what, Charlotte?

253
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:01,755
I've said all I'm gonna say,
Bubba Wilkes.

254
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:05,662
Well? Will you walk out
with me after supper?

255
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:08,699
Walk out? Walk out in these
dreadful swamps where--

256
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,133
where I could get eaten
by a tiger or somethin'?

257
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:13,763
Oh, you must've lost your
foolish mind, Bubba Wilkes.

258
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,141
And it just goes to prove you don't have
any true regard for me whatsoever.

259
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,147
A tiger?

260
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,723
The first good grass
you come to, give 'em a rest.

261
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,919
All right, John Henry.
We'll be back around sundown.

262
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,930
Hyah.

263
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,018
See'd your dust all day.
What you drivin'? Buffalo?

264
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,455
Stage arrived yet?

265
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,858
It's overdue. I ain't askin'
'cause I don't care.

266
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:35,330
But if your name's Thomas, there's a couple
of popinjays waitin' inside to see you.

267
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,696
They've been here
for two days now.

268
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,961
I give 'em water the first day,
and they tooken root.

269
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:44,202
Government agents?
I ain't asked. They ain't said.

270
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,513
Are you the gentlemen
that were looking for me?

271
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:03,391
You are
Monsieur John Henry Thomas?

272
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,329
You have me at a disadvantage.

273
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,890
I am Monsieur Pierre Petain.

274
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,202
This is my companion,
Señor Luis Escudero.

275
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:16,369
We have the honor to represent
the emperor Maximilian of Mexico.

276
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:17,911
Oh.

277
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,541
Won't you have a chair,
Monsieur Thomas?

278
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:22,983
Well, thank you, no.
We're waiting for the stage--

279
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:25,384
We understand
you have many horses.

280
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,922
Is that correct, Mr. Thomas?
It could be.

281
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,087
We have been authorized by the emperor
to purchase all you can supply.

282
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:36,664
Well, I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a long trip for nothing.

283
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,861
My horses are going
to the United States Army.

284
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:42,531
But, Mr. Thomas, we'll buy
the whole herd, sight unseen.

285
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:45,041
Top dollar, if you
drive them to Mexico.

286
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,477
All expenses paid.
Stagecoach is comin'.

287
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:53,211
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Our army needs them.

288
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,516
Pardon me.

289
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:15,577
Whoa. Pedro Flats.

290
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:37,699
Mr. Thomas?
That's right.

291
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:42,295
My name is D.J. Giles, and this
is my associate, Mr. Ezra Parker.

292
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:43,507
Howdy. This is Short Grub.

293
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,128
We're out of the U.S. Army
purchasing office at Fort Clark,

294
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:48,703
and we understand you have
some horses to show us.

295
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:51,249
No, I have some horses
to sell you.

296
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:55,117
Three thousand, to be exact, and it's
the best herd you'll find anywhere.

297
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:58,384
Fine. Shall we go inside?
Thank you.

298
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,987
We'll cull your herd
tomorrow, Mr. Thomas,

299
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:07,296
as soon as our wranglers
arrive from Brackettville.

300
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:12,303
I suppose that out of 3,000 head, we ought
to able to find 500 or so that we can use.

301
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:15,831
Our usual procedure is this--
Just rein up a minute, Mr. Giles.

302
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,175
You're goin' a little fast for me.
Do you mind trottin' through that again?

303
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:23,943
Not at all. I said
that out of 3,000 head,

304
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,455
we might be able to find
500 or so that we can use.

305
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:29,956
You know, animals
that meet our specifications.

306
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:33,757
Well, I have 3,000 for sale,
not 500.

307
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,225
Well, surely you don't
expect us to purchase...

308
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,600
just any old horse
for the United States Army?

309
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:44,632
Well, now there just ain't
"any old horse" in this whole herd.

310
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,040
You'll take 'em all or none.

311
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,342
Mr. Thomas, I'm sure
you're aware of the fact...

312
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,213
that, uh, times are hard.

313
00:29:53,285 --> 00:29:55,618
Maybe not as hard as you think.

314
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:58,213
The army's not that hungry
for horse flesh.

315
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,989
This country is going through
a period of reconstruction.

316
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:03,153
Money is in short supply.
Hmm?

317
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,028
Who can you sell 'em to
if not to us?

318
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:09,626
Monsieur Petain,
hold up a minute there.

319
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:13,733
Just for the record, what are you payin'?
Twenty-five dollars a head.

320
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,210
Last month it was 35.

321
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,305
But this month it's $25 a head.

322
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:23,181
Well, these gentlemen have offered
to take the whole barrel, sight unseen.

323
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:26,016
Is that correct?
That's correct, Mr. Thomas.

324
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:29,956
And what's your top offer?
Thirty-five dollars a head, of course.

325
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:34,088
You just bought yourself a herd.
And you can tell Maximilian...

326
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,999
he won't find better animals between
Montezuma and the Canadian border.

327
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,004
Just a minute.

328
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,365
You're selling horses
to Maximilian...

329
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,604
in preference to your
own country's army?

330
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:50,173
No, I'm selling horses for $3 5
in preference to 25.

331
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,879
You two figured to make
$1 0 a head.

332
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:56,320
Are you calling us thieves?

333
00:30:56,389 --> 00:31:00,382
Well, Mr. Parker, yes, that's
a pretty accurate description.

334
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,995
Wait a minute.
I didn't do anything.

335
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,001
You should've.

336
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:37,794
Read that message again,
Sergeant.

337
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,839
"Eighteen rolling units
with men, women and children...

338
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:49,439
"passed through Gladesville,
Texas, 1 0:20 p.m. this date.

339
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:52,575
"Suspected Confederates.
Probable destination, Mexico.

340
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:54,847
Detain, search and turn back."

341
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,162
What do you make of that?

342
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,962
It seems I've heard that bird
before, sir, at Missionary Ridge.

343
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:09,732
And if I'm not mistaken,
that's a gray-bellied sapsucker.

344
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,225
The river. Come on.

345
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:04,393
Hyah. Hyah. Hyah.

346
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:54,053
Get your weapons.

347
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,937
Real sorry, Miss Ann.
We didn't plan things this way.

348
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,168
Let 'em go, Sergeant.

349
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,413
McClarty, Gibbs.
Turn 'em loose. Let 'em go.

350
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:24,448
Giddap. Hyah.

351
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:36,824
Sir, I don't mean to--
I know, Sergeant.

352
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:40,531
But if I can't have the whole dog,
I don't want the tail.

353
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,540
Yes, sir.

354
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:14,135
We'll probably cross 'em
at the old monastery, Eagle Pass.

355
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,975
Bon. Well, if we do not
see each other again,

356
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,346
then we will rendezvous
on the plain at Durango.

357
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,351
Bon courage, Monsieur.
Thank you.

358
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:24,150
They are fine-looking
animals, Mr. Thomas.

359
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,886
The emperor will be pleased.
I hope he is.

360
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,691
But whether he is
or whether he isn't,

361
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:33,494
you have the money there
when the horses arrive.

362
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:44,638
What's troubling you?

363
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:46,841
Cavalry's comin' from Fort Clark.

364
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,850
Damn government agents.

365
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,853
Can they stop us?

366
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:53,948
Not if we get across
that river, they can't.

367
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,890
Let's take 'em to Mexico.

368
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,894
Let's go.

369
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:11,708
Well, what are you waitin' for?
Stop 'em.

370
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:14,075
Stop 'em.

371
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,547
We'll be mighty proud to stop 'em,
Mr. Giles-- all 1 2 of us--

372
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:20,552
just as soon as you tell us
how to go about it.

373
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:34,568
Next.

374
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:39,006
Mr. McCartney, when
are we gonna have some meat?

375
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:41,064
Right now, if you want it.

376
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:43,202
Belly cheater.

377
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:48,377
High Bred, you know
what good food is, don't you?

378
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:50,385
You mangy old cat.

379
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:53,548
Hey, McCartney.
Mister McCartney.

380
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,560
There's somethin' crawlin'
in these beans.

381
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,061
Well, you can speak to it,
but don't play with it...

382
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:02,065
or else the others'll want one
in their beans too.

383
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,404
Hold that plate.

384
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:11,910
Yes, sir, I can just feel
that money in my pocket right now.

385
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:16,415
What are you gonna do with it
when you get it?

386
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,076
Well, I had to give that
a lot of good thought,

387
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:23,452
but I somehow ain't come to set
right down on the notion yet.

388
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:27,119
I know what I'm gonna buy me--
some pack animals and traps.

389
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:30,528
Whatever's left over,
I'm gonna get drunk.

390
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,693
And if I ever sober up again,
I'm headin' for the Rockies.

391
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,702
Well, that might be fine
for you, Whitt,

392
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:39,366
but me bein' better bred,
I got higher ambitions.

393
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:41,377
Like what?

394
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:45,040
Like building a small library
under a big elm someplace.

395
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:49,677
Me and High Bred's gonna go to St. Louis
and open up a little cathouse.

396
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:54,519
Everything quiet out there?
Would you believe it, John Henry?

397
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:58,393
I had to wake two of the men.
Let's hope it stays that way.

398
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:01,523
You ain't expectin' trouble,
are you, John Henry?

399
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,399
Trouble? Well, let's see.

400
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,530
We got Maximilian on one hand...

401
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:11,543
and Juarez on the other
and bandits in between.

402
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:15,606
On top of that,
we're Americans in Mexico...

403
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:19,484
taking a cavy of horses
to a very unpopular government.

404
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,148
Why should we expect trouble?

405
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:24,316
How come you didn't
tell us that aforehand?

406
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:26,587
How come you didn't ask me?

407
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:56,653
John Henry, there's a box canyon
about four miles from here.

408
00:41:56,728 --> 00:42:00,026
Enough forage to fill 'em?
No, sir, but there's enough to hold 'em.

409
00:42:00,098 --> 00:42:03,465
There's somethin' else.
I rode across two trails.

410
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:07,231
One was wagons and horses.
The second trail was many riders--

411
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:09,798
at least 40 and maybe 60.

412
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:12,175
The second trail ran
just down the side of the first.

413
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:15,043
Well, if you were to tell me
that a year ago...

414
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:19,076
in Virginia or Tennessee,
I'd suspect ambush.

415
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,179
It looked that way to me.

416
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:25,152
Short Grub.
Yo.

417
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:29,893
There's forage and water about
four miles ahead in a box canyon.

418
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:33,833
Move 'em in there and
hold 'em till we get back.

419
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,003
Where are you going, John Henry?

420
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:08,375
I don't believe it.

421
00:43:17,351 --> 00:43:20,115
Pick up that bucket.

422
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:22,213
Well, howdy, Sergeant Newby.

423
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:24,689
Save your "howdy"
for later, Jamison.

424
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:27,695
Right now let me see you
start currying that horse.

425
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:30,629
Yes, sir.
Just like old times, eh, Newby?

426
00:43:30,698 --> 00:43:32,826
Just like old times,
Colonel.

427
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,337
Riders approachin'

428
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:37,532
Two riders a-comin'.

429
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:39,541
Margaret.

430
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:45,271
We have company.

431
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:02,326
Good afternoon.
My name's Thomas.

432
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:05,427
We're drivin' a herd
of horses south,

433
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:07,439
just over the hill.

434
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:10,568
I'm Colonel James Langdon.
Mr. Thomas, what can I do for you?

435
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:13,614
Well, it isn't
what you can do for us.

436
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:17,447
We came to warn you that you're
probably riding into a bandit ambush.

437
00:44:19,686 --> 00:44:21,985
Well, how do you
happen to know that?

438
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:24,580
Well, Blue Boy here
is a full-blooded Cherokee.

439
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:28,288
When he suspects somethin',
you usually get it.

440
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:31,960
There's 40 to 60 riders
moving parallel to you,

441
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:33,969
just out of sight.

442
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,111
Waitin' until we get
into those hills?

443
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,174
That'd be my guess.

444
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:54,248
What did you say your name was?
John Henry Thomas.

445
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:57,261
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

446
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,491
To my knowledge, Colonel,
we've never met before.

447
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:12,302
Well, we appreciate
the warning, sir.

448
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:18,044
It's late. Will you and your friend
join us for supper, stay the night?

449
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,817
Best offer we've had all day.

450
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:38,303
There's nothin'
like a full stomach...

451
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,810
for facin' the unknown future.

452
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:42,971
Well, I hate to be
persistent, Colonel,

453
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:45,982
but, uh, I think
the future is pretty certain.

454
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,984
I fully agree.

455
00:45:48,052 --> 00:45:52,320
I think they'll give you a couple of days to
get up into the hills before they strike.

456
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:57,159
If this was my outfit, I'd hold
right here and make them come to me.

457
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,461
That's good thinkin'

458
00:45:59,532 --> 00:46:03,593
I've never yet let the enemy choose
the sight of his own destruction.

459
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,832
I like to play in my yard.
What are these bandits after?

460
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:09,602
Gold, horses... women.

461
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:15,413
We had an experience or two
with 'em before the... war.

462
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:19,250
Were you, perchance,
in the war, Mr. Thomas?

463
00:46:19,322 --> 00:46:21,256
Yes, Captain, I was.

464
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:24,885
Would it be brash and
presumptuous of me to ask...

465
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:27,191
which side you were on,
Mr. Thomas?

466
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:31,224
Well, I favor to think that
I was on the right side, Mrs. Langdon.

467
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:35,204
I detect a shadow of animosity
towards my question.

468
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:38,297
Could it be that you
were a Yankee soldier?

469
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,569
What a question to ask a man.

470
00:46:40,643 --> 00:46:43,977
Yes, ma'am,
I was a Yankee soldier.

471
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:46,311
Mr. Thomas...

472
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:49,786
I'm about to make my rounds
before I turn in tonight.

473
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,982
Would you care to accompany me?

474
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:53,991
Thank you, sir.

475
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:07,434
I suspected it when I saw those
Union trousers on that Indian boy.

476
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:13,279
My son was killed by Union cavalry
at Shiloh, Mr. Thomas.

477
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:16,373
We called it
Pittsburgh Landing.

478
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,112
You were there then?
I was.

479
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:21,452
May I ask your rank?

480
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:24,186
I was a colonel
in that cavalry.

481
00:47:26,697 --> 00:47:28,756
John Henry Thomas.
Of course.

482
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:31,595
Well, you were on
George Custer's right flank...

483
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:34,399
when you charged the breastworks
at Madisonville, weren't you?

484
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:37,373
We did a job that day, didn't we?
You were damn cruel.

485
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:41,379
Cruel? Those Johnny Rebs had 40-pounders
looking right down our throats.

486
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:44,746
Did you think you
were comin' to a ball? Sergeant.

487
00:47:44,817 --> 00:47:46,751
Yes, sir.

488
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:55,052
If I can find the time, I'm gonna sit down
and write the social history of bourbon.

489
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:02,934
Tell me somethin',
Mr. Thomas.

490
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:05,939
Were you, by chance,
at Chickamauga?

491
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:09,204
I ask because I lost
my brother there-- Ann's husband.

492
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:12,805
I lost 23 in my command
at Chickamauga--

493
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,818
friends and sons of friends,

494
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:18,479
men that I'd known
all their lives.

495
00:48:18,555 --> 00:48:22,185
Now can I ask you a question, Colonel?
Fire one, Mr. Thomas.

496
00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:27,423
Why did you come clear out here to continue
a war that ended months ago in Virginia?

497
00:48:27,497 --> 00:48:29,931
Because I'm a stubborn man.
Does that satisfy you?

498
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:31,228
No.

499
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:34,067
I got no taste for losin'
to a lot of Yankee rabble.

500
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,630
How about that?
It won't wash.

501
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,336
You can be a very
aggravatin' man, Mr. Thomas.

502
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:41,641
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

503
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,754
Let's just say
we haven't seen the end.

504
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:58,755
You'll see it quick enough
if you keep drinkin' this stuff.

505
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,766
Excuse me, Colonel.

506
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,699
Sergeant.

507
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:09,310
Help yourself.

508
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:05,493
The young 'uns, now.
Come on over here.

509
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:08,331
You get over here
with me right now.

510
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:11,668
Hurry, now.
Get tucked away. Come on.

511
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,873
Come on, now.

512
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:17,432
Mind a suggestion from a
Platte River Indian fighter?

513
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,967
Why don't you arm your women?

514
00:50:18,993 --> 00:50:21,967
That's what we did on the
Bozeman and California trail.

515
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,079
Colonel.

516
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:31,390
All our night pickets come in yet?

517
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:33,661
All but Jamison, sir.

518
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:45,003
Well, go get him.
Carlyle. Little George.

519
00:51:08,003 --> 00:51:11,565
It's Jamison, sir.

520
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:14,372
All right.
Take him down, George.

521
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:35,166
Captain, issue a rifle
to every woman knows how to use it.

522
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:38,135
Yes, sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.

523
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:40,139
Ladies.

524
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:47,511
Colonel.

525
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:07,801
Looks like he wants to talk.
We have nothing to talk about.

526
00:52:07,872 --> 00:52:10,834
Well, he's got you outnumbered.
Let's start from there.

527
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,595
Finding ourselves outnumbered,

528
00:52:12,642 --> 00:52:16,010
Colonel Thomas, is a fact of life
we've gotten used to.

529
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:21,151
With women and children
in the pot?

530
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,882
I'll go, sir.
No.

531
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:30,562
The colonel and I will go.

532
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,507
Let's understand
each other, Thomas.

533
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,572
Your Indian friend rode out of here
last night with no explanation.

534
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:54,681
He hasn't returned. One false move
on your part, and my men won't miss.

535
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:59,587
Friend, your men have been
missin' me for years.

536
00:52:59,663 --> 00:53:04,258
As far as that Indian boy is concerned,
his father was Bold Eagle,

537
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,824
one of the bravest warriors
that ever rode a horse.

538
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:10,738
And on top of that,
he's my adopted son,

539
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:14,370
and I haven't done this much
explaining in years.

540
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:18,110
Don't press me, Captain.
Anderson.

541
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:21,017
Yes, sir.

542
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:37,327
Windage and elevation,
Mrs. Langdon. Windage and elevation.

543
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:55,446
Buenos días, señores.
Yo soy Escalante.

544
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:58,050
Do you speak English?
Ah, sí.

545
00:53:58,127 --> 00:54:00,791
I speak English
most excellently.

546
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:04,552
Then tell us what you want and
be damned quick about it.

547
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,193
We want everything.

548
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:08,968
We're so poor,
and we need so much.

549
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,441
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What do you want?

550
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,972
We want your wagons, your horses,
your guns and your gold.

551
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:23,356
And you also
have some women, señor.

552
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:28,690
Is this fool serious?
You can bet your life on it.

553
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:31,697
But it's preposterous.
Yeah.

554
00:54:31,765 --> 00:54:33,281
I have more "mens" than you.

555
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:36,388
If you wanna lose most of 'em,
you come right on ahead.

556
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:39,066
Otherwise, you'd better hightail
your ass right on out of here.

557
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:41,754
I'll fight a thousand of you
before I give you a penny.

558
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,365
I was hoping you'd say that.

559
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:53,520
Is the flap on your holster snapped
or unsnapped, my Confederate friend?

560
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,295
Snapped, my Yankee friend.

561
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:05,134
Well, I guess I'm his pigeon.

562
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:19,041
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

563
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,379
Colonel.

564
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:28,791
You went out there to talk.
Why did you have to shoot the man?

565
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:31,694
The conversation
kind of dried up, ma'am.

566
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:47,346
Fire.

567
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:02,265
Just like old times,
huh, Colonel?

568
00:56:05,837 --> 00:56:09,535
Margaret.

569
00:56:09,608 --> 00:56:14,239
Margaret.
 I can't.

570
00:56:39,174 --> 00:56:41,904
Colonel, behind you.

571
00:56:56,996 --> 00:57:00,454
Don't tell me they're leavin'.
No, ma'am.

572
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:05,469
They're reforming to charge again.
Leastwise, that's their plan.

573
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:27,492
I'll be damned.

574
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:57,285
They're leavin' now, ma'am.
That's Blue Boy's little surprise.

575
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:01,355
Well, I'll be damned.

576
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:07,674
Mrs. Langdon, the colonel--
your brother-in-law--

577
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:10,302
said you lost your husband
during the war.

578
00:58:10,377 --> 00:58:14,280
Yes, Mrs. Thomas.
I'm sorry.

579
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:19,111
You didn't know him.
Why should you be sorry?

580
00:58:19,187 --> 00:58:22,883
My cavalry was
in that engagement.

581
00:58:33,435 --> 00:58:37,497
Colonel Thomas,
I wanna thank you.

582
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:42,036
No thanks are necessary. They were
our enemies as much as they were yours.

583
00:58:42,113 --> 00:58:47,813
Their own people shoot 'em on sight.
We're in your debt.

584
00:58:47,885 --> 00:58:52,880
Colonel, why don't you take
all these people and go on home?

585
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:56,290
There's no tellin' what you're
gonna run into farther south.

586
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,526
In a day or two, we make contact with a
military escort from Emperor Maximilian.

587
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,129
We are going home.
It's ahead of us.

588
00:59:06,706 --> 00:59:09,106
All right, Colonel.

589
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,925
Who you wavin' at,
Blue Boy?

590
01:00:11,479 --> 01:00:14,177
Hyah, hyah.

591
01:00:25,362 --> 01:00:29,731
Wanna tell me all about it?
I was thinkin' about that girl.

592
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,660
What girl?

593
01:00:30,686 --> 01:00:34,126
The Confederate colonel's
daughter, Charlotte.

594
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,559
She's a pretty girl.
A little young, but pretty.

595
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:38,759
I want her.

596
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:41,778
You want her?
And she wants me.

597
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:45,246
How'd you figure that out?
You raised me to know, John Henry.

598
01:00:45,317 --> 01:00:50,813
I taught you what to do when the snow
comes, how to survive in a blizzard,

599
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:54,951
and I taught you how to deal
with men, but women--

600
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:58,088
Nobody knows
what's on a woman's mind.

601
01:00:58,165 --> 01:01:02,034
Well, she wants me, and when
we go home, she'll be with me.

602
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:11,074
Anything wrong, John Henry?

603
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:13,078
Not yet.

604
01:01:15,016 --> 01:01:17,951
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

605
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:39,945
McCartney,
give me a cup of coffee.

606
01:01:40,013 --> 01:01:42,981
Never mind.
I got his coffee.

607
01:01:45,984 --> 01:01:48,918
This damn cinch is
pretty near cut in half.

608
01:01:51,056 --> 01:01:53,719
Man's coming, John Henry.

609
01:02:04,204 --> 01:02:08,142
From Colonel Langdon, sir.
I'm to wait for an answer.

610
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:12,511
We're in a new camp waiting
for an escort from Maximilian.

611
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,983
There's a map on the other side.
What's the matter?

612
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:20,455
Ain't you Yanks
ever seen a live one before?

613
01:02:20,524 --> 01:02:23,754
Last time I seen a pretty
gray uniform like that,

614
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:26,761
it was all full of holes.

615
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:31,495
Do you know what's in this, Sergeant?
Of course I know.

616
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:36,029
There must've been a few words in that camp
before the colonel sat down and wrote this out.

617
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:41,205
Yes, sir. A lot of words I thought
Captain Anderson was gonna have apoplexy.

618
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,717
And how about you personally,
Sergeant. What do you think about it?

619
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:50,986
Well, it ought
to be right interesting.

620
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,584
Anything wrong, John Henry?
You won't believe it,

621
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:58,325
but we've been invited
to a Fourth of July party.

622
01:03:17,955 --> 01:03:21,050
We'll be on our best manners today.

623
01:03:23,862 --> 01:03:25,272
Glad you could join us.

624
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:28,484
Thank you,
Colonel, for inviting us.

625
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:32,298
First time we've ever been invited
to a Confederate shindig.

626
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:36,237
Well, I'm not surprised,
all things considered. Get down.

627
01:03:36,306 --> 01:03:39,277
Thank you.
Get down, all of ya.

628
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:45,580
Well, we didn't intend
to interrupt the festivities.

629
01:03:45,652 --> 01:03:49,884
Well, what are y'all lookin' at? You
ever seen a Yankee before? Just people.

630
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:54,360
Start playin'. Captain.

631
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,033
Sir.

632
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:57,480
See that Colonel Thomas and
his men are taken care of.

633
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,386
Sir, I--

634
01:03:58,412 --> 01:04:01,825
They're our guests, Captain.
Make sure they enjoy themselves.

635
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,771
Yes, sir. Wilkes.

636
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:09,243
I'm feelin' a little dry, Colonel. Would
you care to join me, or don't you indulge?

637
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,075
Where's the sergeant?
I'll risk it.

638
01:04:12,147 --> 01:04:14,446
Follow me.
Thank you.

639
01:04:26,037 --> 01:04:30,500
You Yankee boys hungry? The captain
appointed me to tend to you.

640
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:34,877
There's a mess of beans and ham up yonder,
and there's some coffee and grits too.

641
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:37,349
Grits?
I wouldn't touch 'em.

642
01:04:37,418 --> 01:04:40,351
Why not?
Might be unclean.

643
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,857
Well, it will be a change in cooking.
I'll drink to that.

644
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:47,081
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right with you.

645
01:04:47,107 --> 01:04:48,114
Thank you.

646
01:04:48,162 --> 01:04:51,599
Mrs. Langdon.
Mr. Thomas.

647
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:55,262
That's a mighty attractive dress.
French, isn't it?

648
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:59,273
Yes. I bought it
in New Orleans before the war.

649
01:04:59,341 --> 01:05:02,903
Seldom had occasion
to wear it since.

650
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:05,541
You surprise me, Mr. Thomas.

651
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:08,609
You have knowledge
of ladies' fashions?

652
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:13,886
Well, I was once married, and I have
knowledge of the cost of such things.

653
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:16,006
Here you are, sir. A
little sippin' liquor.

654
01:05:16,032 --> 01:05:16,543
Ohh.

655
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:17,167
Good.

656
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:19,486
Somewhat finer than what
the sergeant provides.

657
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:25,932
May you be in heaven half an hour
before the devil knows you're dead.

658
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:28,873
To your health.
Jimmy.

659
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,069
Excuse me, Colonel Thomas.
Certainly.

660
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:34,808
Cousin Cora and that Sam-- Well,
they're havin' another go-around.

661
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:37,510
Oh, shoot.
Would you excuse us, please?

662
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:40,521
Of course.
Colonel, here. Help yourself.

663
01:05:49,497 --> 01:05:52,588

But lucky for me,
she left me.

666
01:05:56,571 --> 01:05:59,974
I must say, Mr. Thomas,
that whatever your faults are,

667
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:02,706
you do have a quaint kind
of honesty.

668
01:06:02,781 --> 01:06:06,238

01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:13,718
It was cold in the winter, hot in the
summer and dusty in the dry spells,

671
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:15,819

And I wanted children, and
she didn't like that either.

675

She didn't like much, did she?
She's happy now, I guess.

No. I'm glad you're young.

821
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,115

to be together.

822

Oh, I'll always be young

01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:39,526
I'd like a Kansas City steak, well done.
You go to hell.

833
01:25:39,599 --> 01:25:45,368
John Henry, you ever hear about that gal
in St. Louis? She had the dangedest itch--

834
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:47,374
Shut up.

835
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:52,607
We're comin' down to the end of it now. We've
lost 500 horses between here and the border,

836
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:55,673
and I don't think
that's very funny.

837
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:59,779
We lose any more, and somebody's
gonna be damned uncomfortable.

838
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:12,961
You know what?
I think John Henry's scared.

839
01:26:19,945 --> 01:26:23,541
How 'bout some coffee?

840
01:26:26,552 --> 01:26:30,215
Kind of worried about him, ain't ya?
Who?

841
01:26:30,289 --> 01:26:35,252
Well, you're the worst liar I ever came
across, John Henry. Blue Boy, that's who.

842
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:39,233
Well, he should've caught up
with us three days ago.

843
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:42,361
You don't reckon
he come across bandits, do you?

844
01:26:42,437 --> 01:26:45,701
No, I think
he's too smart for that.

845
01:26:45,772 --> 01:26:48,742
You know what I'd be
thinkin' if I was you?

846
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,835
I'd be thinkin' he made off
with that little Reb gal.

847
01:26:51,912 --> 01:26:55,873
And I'd be thinkin' that he was just
about to the Rio Grande by this time.

848
01:26:55,952 --> 01:26:58,944
Well, that's what
I been thinkin'.

849
01:26:59,022 --> 01:27:02,720
Ah, he wouldn't do that.

850
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:08,862
Nah, he wouldn't do that.
Thanks, Short Grub.

851
01:27:21,513 --> 01:27:24,880
I've changed my mind.
Oh-- Oh.

852
01:27:52,883 --> 01:27:55,645
Good morning.
Good morning.

853
01:27:55,717 --> 01:28:00,451
Well, here they are. You ready for it?
We're all set to make the count.

854
01:28:00,522 --> 01:28:01,248
Good.

855
01:28:01,274 --> 01:28:04,178
Did you encounter any
trouble along the way?

856
01:28:04,228 --> 01:28:06,959
Well, nothing to speak of.

857
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:10,593
Well, we're here, and the horses
are here. How about that money?

858
01:28:10,669 --> 01:28:15,232
Oh, it's coming... by special courier
with a troop of the emperor's cavalry.

859
01:28:15,308 --> 01:28:16,876
He is most appreciative.

860
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:20,169
Well, how soon is that
special courier due?

861
01:28:20,215 --> 01:28:24,275
Any day. Shall we make the count?
Why not?

862
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:52,314
2,505 horses.
I am surprised, Mr. Thomas.

863
01:28:52,382 --> 01:28:53,374
How's that?

864
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,369
Well, I thought you would lose
more on a long trip like that.

865
01:28:57,421 --> 01:29:00,879
Well, I had an understanding
with my men.

866
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:03,540
I asked 'em not to lose
any more, and they didn't.

867
01:29:04,496 --> 01:29:08,226
How long we gonna be here, John Henry?
Till they give us the money.

868
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:12,201
My men haven't been home for four years.
We're a little anxious.

869
01:29:12,271 --> 01:29:16,174
So we won't be hard to find.
We'll be right handy.

870
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:19,310
Company, halt.

871
01:30:19,379 --> 01:30:22,747
Left by twos. Ho.

872
01:30:25,821 --> 01:30:28,619
My compliments, sir.

873
01:30:39,203 --> 01:30:42,503
Colonel James Langdon,
sir, Confederate States Army.

874
01:30:42,573 --> 01:30:44,598
My aide, Captain Anderson.
General.

875
01:30:44,675 --> 01:30:47,905
My name is Lazaro Rojas.

876
01:30:47,977 --> 01:30:52,506
In the name of Emperor Maximilian,
I welcome you to our pueblo.

877
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:56,348
We have prepared a welcome banquet for
you and your people, Colonel Langdon.

878
01:30:56,419 --> 01:30:59,117
Please, do us the honor...

879
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:02,684
of extending our invitation
to those of your party.

880
01:31:02,762 --> 01:31:06,163
Thank you very much, sir. Captain?
Sir.

881
01:31:06,232 --> 01:31:08,793
Lieutenant.
Dismount the troops.

882
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:11,490
Yes, sir.
Sergeant, dismount your troops.

883
01:31:11,516 --> 01:31:13,263
Prepare to dismount.

884
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:18,076
Dismount.
Ladies.

885
01:31:36,433 --> 01:31:38,698
Saludas, uh--
Amigas.

886
01:31:38,769 --> 01:31:40,828
Sí, amigas.

887
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:06,494
Thank you very much, sir.
Salud.

888
01:32:06,566 --> 01:32:09,297
Ah, salud.

889
01:32:39,802 --> 01:32:43,295
It's all right, kids.
It's gonna be all right.

890
01:32:52,384 --> 01:32:55,786
Consider yourselves prisoners
of the Revolution.

891
01:32:55,855 --> 01:32:58,654
I shall protest this
to Emperor Maximilian, sir.

892
01:32:58,726 --> 01:33:02,093
We take no orders from
Maximilian, Colonel Langdon.

893
01:33:02,162 --> 01:33:05,724
Our president
is Don Benito Juarez.

894
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,667
The drums of Mexico beckon us, Colonel.

895
01:33:09,736 --> 01:33:12,034
Please.

896
01:33:12,105 --> 01:33:15,700
James.
Will you excuse us, Mrs. Langdon?

897
01:33:31,066 --> 01:33:35,903
If you think you're gonna scare us with
threats, General, you underestimate us.

898
01:33:35,972 --> 01:33:39,705
No, no, Colonel Langdon,
we have estimated you very well.

899
01:33:39,776 --> 01:33:45,509
Aside from the men in your party,
there are 3 2 women and 1 7 children.

900
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:49,379
You are friends of Maximilian.

901
01:33:49,452 --> 01:33:54,222
He has brought the French into our country,
and they have tried to ride roughshod...

902
01:33:54,293 --> 01:33:56,227
over our people.

903
01:33:56,295 --> 01:34:00,822
Now Maximilian has brought you
Southern Americans into our country...

904
01:34:00,898 --> 01:34:04,892
because he can no longer
get help from Napoleon.

905
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:09,535
These Frenchmen
kill the entire population...

906
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:15,207
of a small village,
every man, woman and child...

907
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:19,342
butchered.

908
01:34:26,028 --> 01:34:30,228
¡Atención!

909
01:34:42,379 --> 01:34:47,750
¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva.

910
01:34:49,307 --> 01:34:52,610
That is what happens, Colonel,
to invaders of my country.

911
01:34:52,657 --> 01:34:54,369
My people are not invaders.

912
01:34:54,395 --> 01:34:57,881
You are here, and you are
friends of Maximilian.

913
01:34:57,929 --> 01:35:01,280
But we're not your enemies. What
do you want of us, General?

914
01:35:01,306 --> 01:35:03,393
Our forces need horses, Colonel.

915
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:08,534
Not far from here,
there is a herd of 3,000.

916
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:11,442
Thomas.
Yes.

917
01:35:11,512 --> 01:35:14,241
Thomas.

918
01:35:14,314 --> 01:35:17,014
I'm afraid I don't
understand you, General.

919
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,370
You will deliver this to Thomas.

920
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:39,406
I'll be damned if I will.
I believe you will, Colonel.

921
01:35:39,477 --> 01:35:43,972
Our Revolution needs those horses.
Benito Juarez needs those horses.

922
01:35:44,049 --> 01:35:46,949
I'm a Confederate officer.

923
01:35:47,018 --> 01:35:50,682
You can't expect me to go beggin'
those Yankees for anything.

924
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:54,091
That's in the first place, and the
second place, they wouldn't do it.

925
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,845
They have no reason to
care what happens to us.

926
01:35:56,871 --> 01:35:59,555
General, that man Thomas
would spit in my face.

927
01:35:59,599 --> 01:36:04,161
You will do as I say,
or you will all be shot.

928
01:36:06,139 --> 01:36:10,236
I'm not askin' any Yankee
for anything.

929
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:12,608
Very well.

930
01:36:48,453 --> 01:36:50,580
General.

931
01:36:58,364 --> 01:37:02,165
I'll go.

932
01:37:10,713 --> 01:37:14,148
You will have the horses
in this place by noon tomorrow...

933
01:37:14,216 --> 01:37:17,082
or you will all be shot.

934
01:39:33,905 --> 01:39:38,170
Don't leave me.
Please. Don't ever leave me.

935
01:39:58,768 --> 01:40:02,829
All right. Get up. Get up.
Two Toes has dug up something.

936
01:40:02,905 --> 01:40:05,271
Come on. Get up.

937
01:40:05,342 --> 01:40:07,434
Mr.John Henry?
Yeah?

938
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:10,707
Uh, we got company.

939
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:14,682
Thank you, Mr. McCartney.

940
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:36,586
What's all this?
We found this man.

941
01:40:36,653 --> 01:40:39,248
Found me?
You trapped me, you--

942
01:40:39,323 --> 01:40:41,256
Here, untie him.

943
01:40:41,324 --> 01:40:43,454
I told you that
uniform'd get you in trouble.

944
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,011
Yeah.

945
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:48,120
Mr. McCartney, you got the coffee ready?
All ready.

946
01:40:50,934 --> 01:40:52,870
Good morning.

947
01:40:52,937 --> 01:40:54,872
Bonjour.
Buenos días.

948
01:40:54,939 --> 01:40:56,874
Wake ya up?
Ah.

949
01:41:01,179 --> 01:41:04,672
Get a little coffee in ya
and settle down,

950
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,185
you can tell us what
it's all about.

951
01:41:09,557 --> 01:41:12,253
I was given no choice.
That's why I'm here.

952
01:41:13,528 --> 01:41:15,620
My family, they're all
gonna be murdered.

953
01:41:15,697 --> 01:41:17,788
All of my people
are in his hands.

954
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:19,956
When we reached Durango,
they--

955
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:22,501
they gave us a party
and then they tricked us.

956
01:41:22,569 --> 01:41:25,232
My people are prisoners
of a Juarista general.

957
01:41:27,342 --> 01:41:30,038
I didn't want to come here.
I didn't want to cause you people any--

958
01:41:30,112 --> 01:41:34,742
Aw, damn it. Here.
Read this.

959
01:41:34,817 --> 01:41:38,982
General Rojas
is more eloquent than I am.

960
01:41:40,957 --> 01:41:43,052
What does it say,
John Henry?

961
01:41:47,566 --> 01:41:52,525
That's good coffee. Thank you.
You really think so?

962
01:41:53,637 --> 01:41:56,835
Well... it's your game.

963
01:41:56,908 --> 01:42:00,309
How do you wanna play it?

964
01:42:00,379 --> 01:42:04,714
John Henry, we been dealt lots of tough
hands since the summer of'61 .

965
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:08,083
Here's one I wish we could pass.

966
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:11,886
This don't leave us nothin'.
We ain't never had nothin' nohow.

967
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:12,949
Wait a minute, Bobby Joe.

968
01:42:12,975 --> 01:42:15,819
You mean you're willin' to give up
them horses to them Johnny Rebs?

969
01:42:15,864 --> 01:42:19,130
Well, I ain't
no Christian, but my mama was.

970
01:42:19,201 --> 01:42:22,602
John Henry, remember
when I lost my horse...

971
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:25,605
up there at Pittsburgh Landing?
Yeah.

972
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:29,905
There I was without a horse, behind
that log and them Rebs was all over me,

973
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:32,709
but there was one
didn't have no gun.

974
01:42:32,782 --> 01:42:35,717
Remember me telling you about that one
come crawlin' up to me behind that log?

975
01:42:35,785 --> 01:42:38,722
Yeah, but what's that
got to do with this?

976
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:42,886
This Reb, he said he was all tuckered
out and he wanted to give himself up.

977
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,753
So I told him to get the hell on
outta there. I didn't want him.

978
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:48,625
You know what he said to me?
No.

979
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,467
"You got me whether you
want me or not."

980
01:42:58,912 --> 01:43:00,845
All right.

981
01:43:06,152 --> 01:43:08,245
Looks like you're
stuck with us.

982
01:43:11,225 --> 01:43:13,160
John Henry, I--

983
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,770
If we have to get there by
noon, we better-- Where's that--

984
01:43:21,436 --> 01:43:23,677
Short Grub, you better throw
a couple of outriders

985
01:43:23,703 --> 01:43:25,592
in front of the point
when we get started.

986
01:43:25,641 --> 01:43:28,110
Yo.
Break camp.

987
01:44:06,922 --> 01:44:09,515
...Durango.

988
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,787
Y Benito Juarez.
Sí.

989
01:44:17,698 --> 01:44:19,633
Muy bien.
Allez.

990
01:44:49,434 --> 01:44:53,097
Crimeny sakes. Those Frenchies
have really found some help.

991
01:44:53,171 --> 01:44:55,538
I thought we'd run away
from all that.

992
01:45:01,548 --> 01:45:03,573
What about it, John Henry?

993
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:07,280
Looks like we got ourselves
mixed up in somebody else's war.

994
01:45:07,355 --> 01:45:09,983
Yeah, it sure does.

995
01:45:10,058 --> 01:45:14,589
What are we gonna do now?
Well, that's already been decided.

996
01:45:14,664 --> 01:45:18,327
Bring the two chuck wagons up
here and fill 'em full of men and rifles.

997
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:20,334
I'll get 'em.

998
01:45:22,572 --> 01:45:26,029
We'll give 'em a taste
of General Sherman's war.

999
01:45:26,108 --> 01:45:28,237
I remember.

1000
01:46:23,941 --> 01:46:27,035
They're gettin' a little close,
ain't they, John Henry?

1001
01:46:27,111 --> 01:46:29,841
Yep.

1002
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:38,818
You ready, Colonel?
Ready.

1003
01:46:38,891 --> 01:46:42,419
Break to the sides.
Turn 'em loose, McCartney.

1004
01:46:42,494 --> 01:46:46,989
Hang on, High Bred. Get out of my way.
Get up there now. Get up there now.

1005
01:47:45,765 --> 01:47:48,666
Short Grub, take care
of High Bred for me.

1006
01:47:51,906 --> 01:47:54,272
I said a lot of mean words
to the boys, ain't I?

1007
01:47:54,342 --> 01:47:58,073
You sure have, McCartney.
Mr. McCartney.

1008
01:47:59,581 --> 01:48:02,415
Well, you tell 'em
I meant every damn word.

1009
01:48:38,125 --> 01:48:40,060
Aah.

1010
01:49:07,424 --> 01:49:10,120
You. Two steps forward. Aquí.

1011
01:49:11,227 --> 01:49:13,163
You.

1012
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:16,258
You. You.

1013
01:49:20,073 --> 01:49:22,007
And you.

1014
01:49:22,075 --> 01:49:24,007
You. Grandote.
Aquí..

1015
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:29,273
Mudlow. My turn.

1016
01:49:31,183 --> 01:49:34,312
Hands back.

1017
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,270
Oh, ho.

1018
01:53:24,613 --> 01:53:27,274
You have completed your mission,
Colonel Langdon.

1019
01:53:27,348 --> 01:53:29,281
Thank you.

1020
01:53:31,051 --> 01:53:33,382
Well, John Henry--
James.

1021
01:53:46,469 --> 01:53:48,960
You must be Rojas.

1022
01:53:49,038 --> 01:53:51,667
General Rojas.

1023
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:54,211
And you must be
John Henry Thomas.

1024
01:53:54,279 --> 01:53:57,305
You drive a hard bargain,
General.

1025
01:53:57,382 --> 01:54:01,183
War is war, Colonel.
You should know that.

1026
01:54:01,253 --> 01:54:03,720
Yeah, ya...

1027
01:54:03,788 --> 01:54:05,722
win one...

1028
01:54:07,992 --> 01:54:09,926
ya lose one.

1029
01:54:12,198 --> 01:54:16,498
It is cognac, the only good thing
the French have brought to my country.

1030
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:19,768
May I propose that we drink
to the health and success...

1031
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,603
of my President Don Benito Juarez,

1032
01:54:22,676 --> 01:54:25,407
the Revolution
and the future of Mexico.

1033
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:27,414
Hear, hear.

1034
01:54:31,854 --> 01:54:37,258
And, General, may I propose a toast
to the United States of America.

1035
01:54:40,463 --> 01:54:42,554
Not even for 3,000 horses?

1036
01:54:46,435 --> 01:54:48,962
To the United States of America...

1037
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:50,973
and the Confederacy.

1038
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,979
John Henry,

1039
01:55:03,055 --> 01:55:05,490
what are that
Indian boy's intentions?

1040
01:55:06,728 --> 01:55:09,286
Probably disgraceful, Colonel.

1041
01:55:09,363 --> 01:55:13,068
But it's not what he'll do to her,
it's what she's done to him.

1042
01:55:36,028 --> 01:55:39,328
It ain't much like
old times, Colonel.

1043
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:43,995
No, it ain't much like
old times, Mr. Newby.

1044
01:55:44,071 --> 01:55:48,098
What do you plan on doin'
once we get back home?

1045
01:55:48,175 --> 01:55:51,633
Well, the only place a man can raise
more hell than he can in a war...

1046
01:55:51,712 --> 01:55:54,579
is on the floor of
the House of Representatives.

1047
01:55:54,647 --> 01:55:57,880
An old friend of mine once told me
people like to vote for heroes.

1048
01:55:57,952 --> 01:56:00,046
So, I guess that's what I'll do.

1049
01:56:00,122 --> 01:56:03,057
That team workin' out all right?

1050
01:56:03,126 --> 01:56:05,787
Sure.

1051
01:56:05,861 --> 01:56:08,592
You goin' back to the
Oklahoma Territory, Mr. Thomas?

1052
01:56:08,665 --> 01:56:11,863
Yes, ma'am, just as fast
as I can get there.

1053
01:56:11,936 --> 01:56:14,167
There many women out there?
Some.

1054
01:56:16,807 --> 01:56:19,436
Good country, I suppose.

1055
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:23,002
From the Missouri
to the Pacific Ocean.

1056
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:25,674
Mostly good land
for farming and...

1057
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:29,584
raising cattle and
raising a family.

1058
01:56:29,653 --> 01:56:32,588
Are you gonna raise a family?

1059
01:56:35,628 --> 01:56:37,755
Well, I, uh--

1060
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:42,426
Solomon, can't you play any other tune?
Sure, boss.

01:57:06,428 --> 01:57:10,833
