[Announcer] Pacific
High's annual talent show

196
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,707
is coming soon.

197
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,957
If you've got talent we want it.

198
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,541
Bring your makeup.

199
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:52,374
Donna, would you move your ass?

200
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,207
We're late.

201
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:54,499
Okay, okay, one sec.

202
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:55,749
He's gonna be here.

203
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,291
And I made up my mind
I'm gonna talk to him.

204
00:09:58,582 --> 00:09:59,874
That's progress.

205
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,957
Brace yourself, here comes Ratso Rizzo.

206
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,041
(locker door bangs)

207
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:11,666
Gotta hand it to you, Donna,
it's a very subtle approach.

208
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:14,249
I wasn't too pushy was I?

209
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,058
- I don't know.
- Good morning, girls.

210
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,207
- Good morning.
- Hiya, Bobby.

211
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,874
Come on, come on, we gotta talk.

212
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,207
Good morning.

213
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,624
You couldn't stand the
competition could you?

214
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,749
Grant Michelson, (laughs)

215
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,749
I hardly consider that competition.

216
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:35,832
He would have beaten you.

217
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:37,124
Sure.

218
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:42,749
Oh, I got news for you,
it ain't over, sweetheart.

219
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,374
Not by a long shot.

220
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,207
'Cause I'm gonna find somebody else,

221
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,874
and I'm gonna beat you.

222
00:10:58,916 --> 00:10:59,916
Good luck.

00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,457
You know something, Chrissy?

225
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,406
I liked you a lot better before

226
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:12,916
you decided to become Alexander the Great.

227
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:17,124
Hey, let's give credit
where credit is due,

228
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,666
I have finally become everything
you ever wanted me to be.

229
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,249
You showed me the ropes, babe.

230
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,749
Just make sure you don't hang yourself.

231
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,207
Hiya, DeVito.

232
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:38,832
Oh, hiya, Duane, uh.

233
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:39,666
You know wait a second,

234
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,475
there was something I wanted to ask you.

235
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,041
What was it?

236
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:45,207
Michelson's out, I bet
Christine, you owe me money.

237
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:47,124
Oh, yeah, you heard Michelson is out,

238
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,416
but the race is still on.

239
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,207
Christine hasn't won yet.

240
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,142
Well, who you gonna get
to beat her in two weeks?

241
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,566
Well, I haven't decided yet, pal,

242
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:55,291
but I'm working on it.

243
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,017
Hey, wait a minute, I
bet against Michelson.

244
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,999
No, no, no, you bet for Alexander.

245
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,291
All bets are still on.

246
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,582

269
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:04,916

00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,124
- Hey, Dean.
- Hey, Kevin.

273

- Kevin.
- Yeah.

289
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,041
I'll take your reservation
right now, my man.

290
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:58,082
Because with my package all night long

291

Hey, think about now.

295
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,416
No wasting your time.

296
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:07,791

Hey, Scottie, hold it down, man.

299
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,041
Hey, I was checking you out last season.

300
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,412
I see you still remember
all the moves I taught you.

301
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:17,957
Who taught me?

302
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,124
Dean, you don't never quit, do you?

303
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,374
No, and I never will.

304
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,946
So listen, man, what do you say?

305
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,791
Hey, man, I already told DeVito no way.

306
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,374
Scottie, do you know what
it would mean to this school

307
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,541
to have a black student
body president, huh?

308
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:33,100
Man, don't give me that brother shit.

309
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,082
You know politics is a bunch of garbage.

310
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,957
Yeah, well, maybe it is.

311
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:38,791
But look what it can do for ya.

312
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,416
Hey, I don't need it, man.

313
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:43,457
I got all the action I
can handle. (Chuckles)

314
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,166
All I have to is score
my little 32 points a game

315
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,249

316

00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,582
We don't serve pie.

365
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:45,291
Ain't nobody talking to you, bones.

366
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,624
Excuse me, I was watching that guy over

367
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,916
there by the light, and uh,
I don't wanna say anything

368
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:55,666
but I saw him messing
around with your bike.

369
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,207
Is that so?

370
00:16:58,499 --> 00:16:59,749
Yeah.

371
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:04,749
Such a nice bike that I just
thought I'd tell you about it.

372
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,207
Keep the change.

373
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,874
I'll get my pie somewhere else.

374
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,957
(drawer bangs)

375
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,249
Thank you.

376
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,541
It's okay.

377
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:28,874
You have a nice smile.

378
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,749
Thank you, so do you.

379
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,957
(rubber band thuds)

380
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:37,249
Oh, oh.

381
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,249
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:46,207
Here you go.

383
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:51,999
Hey, I won't tell your
orthodontist if you don't.

384
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,374
(Donna laughs)

385
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,082
Hey, man, did you get
a date for the prom yet?

386
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:00,541
Wow, Jesus, Dean, I'm
trying to keep our heads

387
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:01,874
from being busted open

388
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,457
and you're worried about corsages.

389
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,666
Uh, what was that?

390
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:11,541
Uh, you know, you didn't
feel that way about it last year.

391
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,666
Dancing together here
at the homecoming ball

392
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:18,916
are Ms. Christine Alexander
and Mr. Robert DeVito.

393
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,082

Okay, Collins, where's your note?

403
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,749
Hey, what are you crazy?

404
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,582
Take care of yourself,
you could have a relapse.

405
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,308
Come on, come on, Dean, think of somebody.

406
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,041
We only got a couple of hours.

407
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,292
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, maybe I just did.

408
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,416
DeVito, Donna J.

409
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:03,787
I mean the only person left

410
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,274
in the junior class is your sister.

411
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:06,041
Are you kidding?

412
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,374
She'd fall apart.

413
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,041
Bobby, what do you want from me?

414
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,207
Dean, I need some help.

415
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,457
All right, man.

416
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,017
Okay, look, I work the halls again.

417
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:16,666
I'll see what I can do, all right?

418
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,082
Do it, please.

419
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,457
[Debbie] Hiya, Bobby.

420
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:22,791
Hiya, Debbie.

421
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,374
It's good having you back.

422
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,082
So long, Bobby.

423
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:29,957
- Thank you.
- Take care, Deb.

424
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,374
(phone ringing)

425
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,666
(door clicks)

426
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,041
Debbie Sullivan.

427
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:36,957
Sullivan.

428
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:38,582
My car wouldn't start.

429
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:39,874
41351.

430
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,582
Name?

431
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,791
Darryl Fitzgerald.

432
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,624
Fitzgerald, Darryl.

433
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,791
Any relation to F. Scott?

434
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:52,082
No, Zelda.

435
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,666
You new here?

436
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:02,416
Huh?

437
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:03,850
[Bobby] I was asking if you were new here

438
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,791
'cause I haven't seen you around before.

439
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:08,874
Uh, I, I keep a low profile.

440
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,006
Darryl Fitzgerald,
where do I know you from?

441
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:14,249
Well, we go to the same school.

442
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,249
Do you know my sister Donna DeVito?

443
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,749
- Cupid?
- Yeah.

444
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,666
Yeah, yeah, she's a nice girl.

445
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:21,225
Matter of fact I got her in my next class

446
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:21,874
if I can get out of here.

447
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,291
You know I am late.

448
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:24,666
Yeah, yeah, right.

449
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,499
(phone ringing)

450
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,916
You're a junior aren't you?

451
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,499
Yeah, a junior.

452
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,874
And the base angles of an
isosceles triangle are, DeVito?

453
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:48,541
Oh, uh, yes, Mr. Albrecht, uh.

454
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,166
(Darryl coughs)

455
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,916
The uh, base angles
of an isosceles triangle

456
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,916
are, uh, uh, uh.

457
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:07,041
(coughs) Equal.

458
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,332
Equal.

459
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:10,124
Good, DeVito, good.

460
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,082
Well, Mr. Fitzgerald,

461
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,183
Principal requests the
pleasure of your company.

462
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,207
(group oohing)

463
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:18,374
- Knock it off!
- Uh-oh.

464
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,624
Save it for music class.

465
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,791
Well, then, Ms. DeVito,
the wondrous mathematician

466
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,999
that you are, you will regale us

467
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,749
with the properties of the parallelogram.

468
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,124
How many sides?

469
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,082
The parallelogram?

470
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,791
[Mr. Albrecht] These
are the toughies, DeVito.

471
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:37,332
I'll take my pass, thank you.

472
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:38,784
So tell me who are you voting

473
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,072
for for student body president?

474
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:40,749
Christine Alexander.

475
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:41,582
What a coincidence.

476
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:45,249
That's just what I wanna talk to you about.

477
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,957
Why would you wanna
vote for Christine Alexander?

478
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:52,457
She happens to be the only one running.

479
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,207
Would you still vote for Christine

480
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,916
if her opposition was a
bright articulate leader?

481
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,967
Someone one who was
sensitive to the issues?

482
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,541
Somebody, somebody who can get this school

483
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:02,832
back on the right track?

484
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:04,124
Who do you got in mind?

485
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:05,332
You.

486
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,976
Speaking for myself as well as a number

487
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,416
of very important people,

488
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:12,249
we want you to run for
student body president.

489
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,082
(laughs) You're crazy, you're crazy.

490
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:17,014
I prefer to think of it as inspiration.

491
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:17,707
Bobby, you better hurry it up,

492
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,559
the election assembly is in 20 minutes.

493
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,207
Come on, Darryl, what do you say?

494
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,624
I, I'd never win.

495
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,933
Why, who doesn't like you?

496
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:24,666
Nobody knows me.

497
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,291
Perfect, you got no enemies.

498
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:28,642
I gotta go to the bathroom!

499
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,142
[Dean] Not now, Stanley, we're closed.

500
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,791
Look, Darryl, somehow, someway

501
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:33,999
I made a candidate out of Grant Michelson.

502
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,582
I can do the same for you.

503
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:37,416
(laughs) Why me?

504
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:38,249
Why me?

505
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,600
You wouldn't even have known I existed

506
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,874
if, if I coulda got my
car to start this morning.

507
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,926
Look, Darryl, I don't
think you understand

508
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:45,850
what being student body
president can do for you.

509
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,749
Besides dressing up
your college application

510
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,683
you'll have every thing
you ever dreamed of.

511
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:50,791
Status, clout.

512
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:52,082
Chicks.

513
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:53,499
Listen,

514
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,541
(Darryl laughs)

515
00:22:55,832 --> 00:23:00,124
You want somebody like
Christine to notice you, right?

516
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:04,249
Well, kiddo, here's your shot.

517
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,416
One of the privileges that I have

518
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,666
as your student body president

519
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,082
is the opportunity to
introduce the candidates

520
00:23:14,374 --> 00:23:16,249
in this semester's election.

521
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:20,166
Uh, right now I would
like to introduce a girl

522
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:24,291
who I know is eminently qualified

523
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,291
to be the president of the student body.

524
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:30,124
(group cheering)

525
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:35,916
Uh, is a girl that I have a
great deal of respect for.

526
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,624
(Student laughing)

527
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:42,707
She is, uh, our one and only
candidate, Christine Alexander.

528
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,999
(group clapping) (group cheering)

529
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,166
[Student] Hey, Chrissy!

530
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,249
I had a friend.

531
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,207
This friend was not
just any ordinary person,

532
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:06,749
she apparently had everything
that a girl could wish for.

533
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,582
A loving family, lots of friends,

534
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,874
and a 3.8 grade average.

535
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,332
Her parents were very proud of her

536
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,166
for she was truly an ideal child.

537
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:24,832
She had lived up to all of
their dreams and expectations.

538
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,416
One day however my
friend started to change.

539
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,416
She suddenly grew bored.

540
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:37,124
She became fed up with the special cliques.

541
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,291
Ashamed of having allowed herself

542
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,541
to be friends with only those

543
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:45,207
who locked good enough for her.

544
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,499
People started to wonder about her.

545
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,874
But they never bothered to find out

546
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,332
what was in her head.

547
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,749
Somehow she didn't mind this alienation.

548
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:04,541
It was if she had found a
kind of wonderful inner peace.

549
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,249
She was always alone,

550
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,332
yet she never appeared to be lonely.

551
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:17,082
Until one day they found
her in the girls' restroom.

552
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,207
(projector clicks)

553
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,041
(group gasps)

554
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:22,749
(group chattering)

555
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,749
She had taken an overdose of pills.

556
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:31,916
I've told this sad account
of a 17-year-old girl

557
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,082
who took her own life

558
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:37,999
so that we could all
learn from her tragedy.

559
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,916
When I'm elected I
guarantee you will not find

560
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:48,832
your best friend lying
dead on the bathroom floor.

561
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:51,832
(group clapping)

562
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:54,874
(group cheering)

563
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,707
Thank you, thank you.

564
00:25:57,749 --> 00:25:59,082
Thank you.

565
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,999
(group whistling)

566
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:05,374
Thank you.

567
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:15,207
Whoa.

568
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:17,916
I have, uh, just been informed

569
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,124
that we have an 11th hour candidate

570
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,457
for student body president.

571
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,791
What do I do about it?

572
00:26:26,082 --> 00:26:27,124
What's the deal?

573
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,416
Bring him in?

574
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:34,082
Uh, well, uh, I'd like to
introduce you to a, uh,

575
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:39,624
a young man that I'm sure
you'll all be pleased to meet.

576
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,499
His name is, uh, Darryl Fitzgerald.

577
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,041
Darryl Fitzgerald.

578
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,874
(group clapping)

579
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,457
Hi.

580
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:54,291
[Student] Hi.

581
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:55,582
(group laughing)

582
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:56,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,874
(group cheering)

584
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:04,999
Uh, for some reason
this situation reminds me

585
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,916
of the time I fell in love with this,

586
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,916
(group chattering)

587
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:13,291
I fell in love,

588
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:15,041
(group laughing)

589
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:18,749
I fell in love with this, I fell in love

590
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,666
with this extremely beautiful girl.

591
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,666
(group chattering)

592
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,916
The problem, the problem was

593
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,166
that she didn't know I was alive.

594
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:32,082
Ugh, DeVito, you got
yourself a winner here, boy.

595
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:36,082
So finally, finally one
day I got the guts up

596
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:40,082
to call her on the telephone.

597
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:42,791
And I decided in my mind at that time

598
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,041
that there was one thing

599
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:49,166
that I absolutely was not
going to say to this girl,

600
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:52,749
and that was hello, you don't know me but.

601
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,124
(group laughing)

602
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:02,207
Hey, you don't know me, you
don't know me, but you will.

603
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:03,850
Yeah, well, forget about that.

604
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:04,874
What about the chick?

605
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:06,457
She wasn't your type.

606
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:07,749
(group laughing)

607
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:10,416
(group clapping)

608
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:20,624
Look, uh, I'm not the most
popular person in this school,

609
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:23,041
but neither are most of you,

610
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,374
so we can relate.

611
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,291
We can relate about the problems

612
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,999
that we've shared throughout high school.

613
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,207
Uh, I'm not gonna make you a lot

614
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:37,082
of off the wall promises right now.

615
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:40,291
(laughs) And that's simply
because I haven't had time

616
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:41,832
to make them up yet.

617
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:44,624
(group laughing)

618
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:46,874
(group clapping)

619
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,957
But one promise, one
promise that I, I will keep

620
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:54,249
if I am elected president

621
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,582
of the student body of Pacific High School,

622
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:01,582
and that is this school
will become our school.

623
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:06,332
Together, (group cheering)

624
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,416
Together, we will fight the problems.

625
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:15,582
And together we will arrive
at solutions to those problems.

626
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:20,666
(group clapping) (group cheering)

627
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:25,707
I can't think of anything
more to say at this moment

628
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,874
except the name is Darryl Fitzgerald.

629
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:30,707
Thank you.

630
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:34,666
(group clapping) (group cheering)

631
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,749
Assembly is dismissed.

632
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:43,374
(upbeat music)

633
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,624
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

634
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,291
Looking good.

635
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:54,582
All right.

636
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,749
[Woman] Hey, give me my bag!

637
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,666
[Skateboarder] Whoo!

638
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,624
[Donna] Oh, wow.

639
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,666
You know they're showing
a lot of that color this year.

640
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,416
Yeah, I just love puce.

641
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:22,332
- Come one.
- Wait a minute,

642
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:25,749
you know maybe I,
uh, oughta just try it on.

643
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:26,582
What for?

644
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:28,249
You're not going anywhere.

645
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,600
Don't you know that whosever

646
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:30,874
elected student body president

647
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,541
is invited to go to the senior prom?

648
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,041
Donna, I hate to be the
one to break your heart

649
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:38,082
but I think Christine's taking Kevin.

650
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:39,582
(Donna laughs)

651
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:42,749
When Darryl wins, I wanna be ready.

652
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,707
He doesn't even know you're alive.

653
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:52,457
You don't, uh, think
he's gonna invite me, huh?

654
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:53,749
Why not?

655
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:54,916
Let's go look at it.

656
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:55,749
Come on.

657
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,457
Thank ya.

658
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:58,749
Thank you.

659
00:30:58,916 --> 00:30:59,916
[Lori] Let's go.

660
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:02,407
All right, now you're
starting to look like a mensch.

661
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:03,291
What are you thinking?

662
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,100
I don't know, Bobby, something's missing.

663
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,707
You know the look is incomplete.

664
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,999
Hey, I'll be right back.

665
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:11,166
Okay, let's go over these names again.

666
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:11,999
Okay.

667
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,666
He's head of the debate club.

668
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,637
He's our link to all the brains on campus.

669
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:16,291
What's his name?

670
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:17,791
Freddy Freeman.

671
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,082
All right.

672
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,541
The chick in the middle.

673
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,225
Right here, the one
with the short blonde hair.

674
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:22,832
That's Debbie Sullivan.

675
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:24,541
She's our link to glee club.

676
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,992
For what it's worth she
also happens to be a nympho.

677
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,166
No kidding.

678
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:29,416
You're solid.

679
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:32,582
- Cheerleader.
- Christine Alexander.

680
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:35,957
Kid's money in the bank.

681
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,791
(birds chirping)

682
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:44,014
Come on, we've got a lot to talk about.

683
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:45,957
[Kevin] Wait, talk about what?

684
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,207
I'm on my way to the tryouts.

685
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:49,499
Tryouts?

686
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,332
My football tryouts.

687
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:54,499
Kevin, I need you today.

688
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,499
What time will they be over?

689
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:56,332
Will it... I don't know.

690
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:57,249
Just slow down here.

691
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,541
Just slow down.

692
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,029
It's just that I need you now.

693
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,291
I need you right now.

694
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:04,499
Well, I could use a
little support myself.

695
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:05,416
Oh, come on, you'll do fine.

696
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:06,707
You always do.

697
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:07,457
You don't even know

698
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:09,142
who's gonna be out there today, do you?

699
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,457
What difference does it make?

700
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,149
Because I'm not competing against

701
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:14,207
some little sawed off twerp that's why.

702
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,207
- Kevin!
- I'm gonna be throwing

703
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,457
against guys from all over.

704
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:20,416
They got quarterbacks
coming in from, from San Diego.

705
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,374
One guy from Bakersfield,
the best in the state, darlin'.

706
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,291
And we're all going for
those last few scholarships.

707
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,957
Kevin, you never lost
a thing in your whole life.

708
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:31,874
I know Bobby DeVito, I
could lose this election.

709
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:32,707
I need you.

710
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,207
I need your help.

711
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,332
I'm sorry.

712
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:54,082
Look I know how important
that scholarship is to you.

713
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,582
Oh, to me, huh.

714
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,374
I thought it was important to both of us.

715
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:00,666
It is.

716
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,692
I want it left full in the back.

717
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:06,416
- Sure.
- I don't wanna

718
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:07,249
lose any length, all right?

719
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,082
Done.

720
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:10,041
Darryl, do you have any talents?

721
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,082
Sure, I play a mean game of dominoes.

722
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:13,082
Oh, dominoes.

723
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:14,933
- The kid's a comedian.
- Hey, you know.

724
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,957
Uh, listen, read this.

725
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:19,499
I want you to know it inside out.

726
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:20,374
What is it?

727
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,666
It's important.

728
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,082
It's about search and seizure.

729
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,082
Now this could be a make or break issue,

730
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,433
'cause everybody's still uptight

731
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,791
about that bust over at San Fernando High.

732
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:30,499
Cops came right on the campus,

733
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,124
broke into a kid's
locker without a warrant,

734
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:36,374
found some stash, and hauled him away.

735
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,582
Yeah, I'll read it.

736
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:41,642
Hey, I'm serious, Darryl.

737
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,707
I want you to know it cold.

738
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:48,332
Okay, Bobby, I'll commit it to memory.

739
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:49,624
Okay.

740
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,332
(group yelling)

741
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:52,624
Hike!

742
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,207
Hit it!

743
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,207
(group grunting)

744
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,041
Hit it!

745
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:59,124
(group grunting)

746
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,791
Hike!

747
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:01,624
Hit it!

748
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,457
(group grunting)

749
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:09,624
Hit it!

750
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,749
(group grunting)

751
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:13,582
(whistle blows)

752
00:34:13,874 --> 00:34:16,624
Okay, quarterbacks with me.

753
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,374
(group yelling)

754
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,957
(Coach yelling)

755
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:25,249
One at a time.

756
00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:27,291
Nice and easy now.

757
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:28,916
You're first.

758
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:31,916
(group chattering)

759
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:36,791
(football thuds)

760
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,916
(football thuds)

761
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,874
(whistle blows)

762
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,666
(football thuds)

763
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,166
(football thuds)

764
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:02,916
(whistle blows)

765
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:07,582
(football thuds)

766
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:11,041
Okay, hotshot, the reason you're clipping.

767
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:13,374
Let's see how good you are.

768
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,642
(group chattering) (whistle blows)

769
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,666
Okay.

770
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,249
(Kevin sighs)

771
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,082
I think your friend Bobby

772
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:28,874
has finally run out of miracles.

773
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,541
Don't be so sure.

774
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:31,457
Well, you better win this time

775
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:34,166
because I bet Bobby $25 on you.

776
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:36,225
Well, just relax, 'cause
I made the same bet

777
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:37,832
for a lot more money.

778
00:35:38,124 --> 00:35:39,124
- Are you kidding?
- No.

779
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:39,999
And what'd he say?

780
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,332
(giggles) He told me,
"I never disappoint him."

781
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:45,374
(Felicia and Susie
laughing) (doorbell ringing)

782
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,666
I get it.

783
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,124
Oh, I can't believe.

784
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,999
Don't you tell anybody.

785
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,499
Who am I gonna tell?

786
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,874
(laughs) Who?

787
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:55,707

what happened?

826
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,491
I'm veer option quarterback,

827
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:08,582
they wanna play a straight
drop back passing game.

828
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:10,166

What did they say?

834
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,374
They don't say anything
to the guys they don't pick.

835
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,291
You just get back in
your car and you leave.

836
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:35,982
Well, why don't you just audition

837
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,874
or whatever you call it
at some other school?

838
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,206
'Cause it's almost June.

839
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:41,457
Like Stanford.

840
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:43,957
Look the selections have
already been made at those-

841
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:44,791
- Washington.
- Schools.

842
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,707
They didn't want me.

843
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,624
They didn't have me on their list.

844
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:57,457
Well, that kind of messes
up some of our plans doesn't it?

845
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,151
I don't know, I thought maybe it

846
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,850
make things a little bit easier for us,

847
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:01,416
"cause I'll probably go

848
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:04,082
to some local junior college like Valley.

849
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,054
That way you won't have to drive 400 miles

850
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:10,082
every time you wanna
see me, I'll be right here.

851
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,082
Right in my backyard.

852
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,207
Oh.

853
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,582
Is it more convenient for
you if I'm 400 miles away?

854
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:20,794
Look, I am not the
one who said all that stuff

855
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:23,100
about coming up for the
weekends, and visiting you,

856
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:25,044
and going out for dinner,
and watching you play,

857
00:38:25,332 --> 00:38:28,249
and having a wonderful, I
am not the one who said that.

858
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,781
I'm just a little disappointed.

859
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:33,916
Couldn't you just allow me
to be be a little disappointed?

860
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,207
Oh, jeez.

861
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:37,832
Sure would be nice if you
were disappointed for me

862
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:39,666
rather than disappointed in me.

863
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:42,457
Kevin, don't act like a hurt little boy.

864
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,666
Hey, I'm not hurt.

865
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:45,499
I'm pissed off.

878
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:31,082

00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:48,124
I wish you had called first.

883

Well, I woulda called except, uh,

884
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,100
there's no way I could show you two tickets

885
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,082
to Vegas over the phone.

886
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:57,791

- Mm-hmm.

and it's gonna be a dreamy style of life.

891
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,041
That's great.

892
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:11,124
[Dean] Uh, that's great?

893
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,874
Well, baby, show me how great, huh.

894
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:16,707

(light clicks) (group whistling)

910
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:08,082
(sultry jazz music)

911
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,916
(group cheering)

912
00:41:22,457 --> 00:41:25,041
(man whistling)

913
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,499
(group cheering)

914
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:46,957
You kidding?

915
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,624
I can't compete with that.

916
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,541
It's gonna be bozo time.

917
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:52,207
[Bobby] Trust me.

918
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:02,332
(man whistling)

919
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,707
(gun bangs)

920
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:12,624
(gun bangs)

921
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:27,041
(group cheering) (group clapping)

922
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:29,666
Ladies and gentlemen, the one

923
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:31,791
and only, Alexander The Great!

924
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:36,874
(group cheering) (group clapping)

925
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:44,832
And now to close our show a man

926
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,749
who also needs no introduction

927
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,124
but could use a new personality. (Laughs)

928
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:52,791
(group groaning)

929
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:55,124
Only kidding, only kidding.

930
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:59,457
Pacific High's answer to Monty Hall,

931
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:02,124
Bobby Let's Make A Deal DeVito!

932
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:07,666
(group cheering) (group clapping)

933
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:09,499
Thank you, Stanley.

934
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:17,582
Ladies and gentlemen, after
weeks of careful negotiations

935
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:22,041
and great personal expense,

936
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:27,041
I am please to announce
that I have arranged

937
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:29,957
to bring to you on this very stage

938
00:43:32,624 --> 00:43:36,791
one of the most stupendous
sights I have ever seen.

939
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,332
Gentlemen, open the curtains please.

940
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:52,041
(group chattering)

941
00:43:55,582 --> 00:44:00,166
Ladies and gentlemen, let's
give a big round of applause

942
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:06,666
to the current world champion
of class triple A dominoes.

943
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:13,582
Let's hear it for Darryl You
Don't Know Me But Fitzgerald!

944
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:19,082
(group clapping) (group cheering)

945
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,416
Maestro, if you please.

946
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,332
(dramatic drum music)

947
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:33,832
(suspenseful drum music)

948
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:41,457
What do I do?

949
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:44,291
Hit the first domino and smile.

950
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,249
(dramatic drum music)

951
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:51,624
(dominoes clicking)

952
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,166
[Student] Whoa.

953
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,166
(group chattering)

954
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,374
(group cheering)

955
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:01,207
(group clapping)

956
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:07,999
(group cheering)

957
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,832
(group clapping)

958
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:23,999
(group cheering) (group clapping)

959
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:34,916
(bell rings)

960
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:36,267
(group cheering) (group clapping)

961
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:38,666
(upbeat music)

962
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:40,791
Ladies and gentlemen,

963
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:45,124
your next student body
president Darryl Fitzgerald!

964
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,499
My partner, Bobby DeVito!

965
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,457
Thank you.

966
00:45:56,749 --> 00:45:57,916
Thank you.

967
00:45:58,207 --> 00:45:59,332
You're too kind.

968
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,666
(upbeat music)

969
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:08,124
Hey, Darryl, how'd you like
to pay that electric bill, huh?

970
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,707
(Darryl laughs)

971
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:11,999
Ready, boy?

972
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:13,249
Take a bite.

973
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:16,624
So what do you think?

974
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,707
Amaretto and cannolis.

975
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:21,291
The good life.

976
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:22,707
To the good life.

977
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:25,207
(cups clang)

978
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:30,749
You don't have a tuxedo do you?

979
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,041
Why?

980
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:32,874
What do you got in mind?

981
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,166
No, no, no, no tricks, no tricks.

982
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,082
Let me ask you something.

983
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:37,916
Oh, shit.

984
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:39,207
No, come on.

985
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,707
What do you think of Donna?

986
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,499
She's nice, cute.

987
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:50,249
She's nice and cute.

988
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:54,832
Does she, uh, turn you on?

989
00:46:55,124 --> 00:46:56,916
Come on, Bobby, she's your sister.

990
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:58,416
I know she's my sister

991
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:01,416
but, but what do you think of her?

992
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:03,767
To tell you the truth, I,
uh, never really thought

993
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,124
about her that much.

994
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:08,957
Well, you should start, she digs you.

995
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:10,374
Come on, will ya please?

996
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:11,749
Hey, what do you think,

997
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,241
she's working on your campaign

998
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:17,582
because of her undying
dedication to the school?

999
00:47:17,874 --> 00:47:19,457
I just don't think it's a good idea

1000
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:24,416
to, uh, go out with somebody
you're working with that's all.

1001
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:26,291
Sure. (Darryl laughs)

1002
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,422
Sure, you'd rather go
out with the opposition.

1003
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:30,957
(Darryl laughs)

1004
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:36,749
She sure is pretty.

1005
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,041
Yeah.

1006
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,999
Worse locking chicks in this world.

1007
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,957
Hey, just the girls I wanted to see.

1008
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:51,249
Step right up.

1009
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:52,892
I've been thinking a lot about this.

1010
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,249
I really think you're, uh,
you've been taken for granted.

1011
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,082
Jesus.

1012
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,517
You make your own uniforms,
you make your own pom-poms.

1013
00:47:58,541 --> 00:47:59,901
You spend Friday nights out there.

1014
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,582
What do you get?

1015
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:02,499
Dates.

1016
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:03,332
(Susie laughs)

1017
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:04,166
Dates.

1018
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:06,332
I think you should get
more than just dates.

1019
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:07,624
Like what?

1020
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,374
Like class credit.

1021
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:13,457
(Felicia laughs)

1022
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,350
Look, uh, it's just a
thought, just a thought.

1023
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:16,999
Think about it, okay.

1024
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:20,249
Hey, we gotta stop meeting like this.

1025
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,166
I was just looking for you.

1026
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:23,457
I think we should talk.

1027
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:24,166
Sure.

1028
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:25,457
What about?

1029
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:27,874
I'd like to debate you, Darryl.

1030
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,416
It's the only fair way
to present the issues.

1031
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,832
[Darryl] I disagree.

1032
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,749
You disagree or Bobby disagrees?

1033
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,916
What's the difference?

1034
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,082
Come on, Darryl, you know full well

1035
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,249
that when Bobby DeVito runs a campaign

1036
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,874
he makes all the decisions.

1037
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:48,207
[Darryl] That's not true.

1038
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:51,249

1065
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:46,749
So you take your
spaghetti, and you twirl it,

1066
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,600
- and you put in your mouth.
- Hey, hey, hey-

1067
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:49,207
- And then chew it.
- Bobby, Bobby,

1068
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:51,142
I mean what are, are we
working here or what, man?

1069
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,767
I mean we're running out of time, you know.

1070
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,332
Relax, we've got a great candidate.

1071
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,166
- Okay, try it.
- Yeah, well in four weeks

1072
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:57,916
time, I've only been
able to sell like four limos.

1073
00:49:58,207 --> 00:49:59,207
So what?

1074
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,749
That's almost half a limo a day.

1075
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,892
Oh, you're just a laugh
a minute, man, you know.

1076
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:05,142
And you're the one that's
plugging up the works.

1077
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:07,058
I mean nobody's got any
money to shell out for a limo

1078
00:50:07,082 --> 00:50:08,475
because they're betting all
their money on the election.

1079
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:10,419
I mean everybody be
betting like crazy with you.

1080
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:13,124
All right, all right, don't
get the big heat on about it.

1081
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,082
Are you okay or what?

1082
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:15,374
Yeah.

1083
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:19,707
It's Nicole, man.

1084
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:23,707
[, I don't know man,
I can't figure her out.

1085
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:27,707
You know it's like,
it's like, I, I don't know.

1086
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:36,666
Maybe you're leaning in too much.

1087
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:39,249
Give her some room to breathe.

1088
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:47,791
All right, I'll take
it into consideration.

1089
00:50:48,082 --> 00:50:49,791
Let's get back to this.

1090
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:58,582
Uh, hey, Big B.

1091
00:50:58,874 --> 00:51:02,457
Uh, I got something interesting
to tell you about Darryl.

1092
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:04,791
Going to the prom, right?

1093
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,291
What?

1094
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:10,624
What are you saying?

1095
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,082
Didn't he ask you?

1096
00:51:12,374 --> 00:51:13,374
No.

1097
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:17,624
Why did he say something to you last night?

1098
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:20,749
Bobby, why should he be asking me?

1099
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,457
I don't know, 'cause you're cute.

1100
00:51:23,749 --> 00:51:24,874
[Donna] Bobby!

1101
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,999
'Cause I told him how much you liked him.

1102
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,374
You did what?

1103
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:33,183
[Bobby] Don't worry about it, I was cool.

1104
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:35,957
I was just laying the
groundwork that's all.

1105
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:38,541
How could you do this to me?

1106
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:41,624
How could you do this to me?

1107
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,874
(plate thuds) (group gasping)

1108
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,957
Hey, Donna, come back!

1109
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:47,624
[Student] Food fight.

1110
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,249
(group yelling)

1111
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,082
(group clapping)

1112
00:51:55,332 --> 00:52:00,249
(group yelling) (group clapping)

1113
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:08,041
(group yelling)

1114
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,416
Why'd you do it?

1115
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:32,664
I did it for the school.

1116
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,166
I think it's a good thing to have a debate.

1117
00:52:35,457 --> 00:52:37,177
You have no idea what that woman is like.

1118
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,374
I know the issues.

1119
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,207
She'll bury you.

1120
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:40,041
Not if I can get her-

1121
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:41,332
- Shh.

1122
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:43,207
You're a novice, a great one,

1123
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:45,457
but you're still a novice.

1124
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,017
Now Christine has won practically

1125
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,707
every goddamn office in this school.

1126
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,749
Believe me she knows what she's doing.

1127
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:51,582
She's a killer.

1128
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:53,034
And I think I can beat her-

1129
00:52:53,124 --> 00:52:53,832
- Bullshit.
- If you give me the chance.

1130
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:55,124
Goddamn.

1131
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:57,249
I'm going ahead with it.

1132
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,832
The hell you are.

1133
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:01,874
I told you not to debate
her and you're not going to.

1134
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,526
[Darryl] I think I can beat her!

1135
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,066
Darryl, you haven't got a chance!

1136
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,499
Maybe you're right,

1137
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:09,499
but it's something I've
gotta find out for myself,

1138
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:10,957
and I'm going ahead with it.

1139
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:13,124
All right, then go
ahead, do it, big shot!

1140
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:14,624
But you do it alone!

1141
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:17,874
Fine, fine, I'll do it alone.

1142
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,332
Get out.

1143
00:53:19,624 --> 00:53:20,166
[Darryl] Sure.

1144
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:21,124
Let me tell you something,

1145
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:25,499
I'm gonna be a hell of a
lot better off without you.

1146
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:26,374
Get out!

1147
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:27,916
(door clicks)

1148
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:30,416
(door bangs)

1149
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,291
You got yourself a real
stunad for a boyfriend,

1150
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:35,582
you know that?

1151
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:46,499
Hey, you can't afford
to pass this up, man.

1152
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,249
The impossible dream can come true.

1153
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:49,933
It's right here at the DeVito Dean The-

1154
00:53:49,957 --> 00:53:50,957
- Dean.

1155
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:57,041
Are you free now or are you
still too busy to talk with me?

1156
00:53:58,249 --> 00:53:59,957
Yeah, sure, come on.

1157
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,041
Okay, the floor is yours.

1158
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,499
Dean, I'm very sorry about
what happened the other night.

1159
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,332
Hey, forget it.

1160
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:14,166
You know, I mean I'm with you.

1161
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:15,737
I see things from your side now.

1162
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:16,624
You do?

1163
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:17,457
Yeah, sure.

1164
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:20,416
Uh, I guess I just used to be confused.

1165
00:54:20,707 --> 00:54:25,249
You know, I, I thought what
was important was you and me,

1166
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,916
but I was wrong.

1167
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,632
What's important are
the real things in life.

1168
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:32,332
You know like Vegas, and the Tropicana,

1169
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:33,725
- and driving Porsches.
- Dean.

1170
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:37,666
And Stingrays and,
hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

1171
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:38,499
I just had to get hip.

1172
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:39,332
Took me a little while

1173
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:43,332
but, uh, I'm starting to
see things real clearly now.

1174
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:45,874
And you don't date people who, uh, you like

1175
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,166
or that care about you.

1176
00:54:47,332 --> 00:54:49,207
Nah, I mean what would that get you?

1177
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:52,041
You date people who can help you.

1178
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:58,582
But it's okay, 'cause you
and I have nothing in common.

1179
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:06,249
(water splashing)

1180
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,021
[Ms. Margulies] Hold it, Alexander.

1181
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:09,808
Ms. Margulies, I have a
debate in a few minutes,

1182
00:55:09,832 --> 00:55:10,374
and I'm running late!

1183
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:11,892
[Ms. Margulies] Unless
it's your time of the month

1184
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,196
you better hustle back in there!

1185
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,832
And this time without your underwear, huh.

1186
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:17,166
- Lesbo.
- What?

1187
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:18,457
Yes, mam.

1188
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:24,166
Vickerson, good, good.

1189
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:27,999
Brad.

1190
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:29,041
(Christine screaming)

1191
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:32,541
Ms. Ms. Margulies, she got me wet!

1192
00:55:32,832 --> 00:55:34,041
No! (Bell ringing)

1193
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:35,332
Oh, my god.

1194
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,082
(Christine panting)

1195
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:43,999
(handle jiggling)

1196
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,582
(Christine yelling)

1197
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:46,916
(fist thuds)

1198
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:49,749
(locker banging)

1199
00:55:58,499 --> 00:55:59,957
(Christine yelling)

1200
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:01,999
(locker banging)

1201
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:03,666
(Christine yelling)

1202
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:05,832
[Darryl] This is ridiculous.

1203
00:56:06,124 --> 00:56:07,558
What's the rules for the default here?

1204
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:08,207
Come on!

1205
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,899
Fitzgerald, would you just relax?

1206
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:13,291
We're gonna wait for her, all right?

1207
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,541
(door clicks)

1208
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:18,249
(door bangs)

1209
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,541
What happened to you?

1210
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:20,332
I'm all right.

1211
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:21,624
I'm sorry I'm late.

1212
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:22,916
Let's get on with it.

1213
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:23,499
You look terrible.

1214
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:24,832
What happened?

1215
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:28,332
Everything, the shower, (panting)

1216
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:32,541
My, my locker, somebody jammed my locker.

1217
00:56:32,832 --> 00:56:35,707
My hair, the water got in the shower.

1218
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:39,267
Fitzgerald, we're gonna postpone this.

1219
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,267
[Darryl] Hey, Kevin, this
people don't care how we look,

1220
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,683
they care about what we've gotta say.

1221
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:44,457
Okay, just look at her she's shook up.

1222
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:47,149
Personally, I think you're
the one that's shook up, buddy.

1223
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:47,957
(group oohing)

1224
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:49,517
Hey, buddy, you got a smart mouth

1225
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,082
for such a little guy... Hey.

1226
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,457
- Don't you?
- It's okay, it's okay.

1227
00:56:52,749 --> 00:56:53,749
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

1228
00:56:53,874 --> 00:56:56,249
Uh-huh, just I wanna go on.

1229
00:56:56,541 --> 00:57:00,249
Just give me two minutes
to get myself together, okay.

1230
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:02,749
All right everybody,
we're gonna give Christine,

1231
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:03,582
this thing on?

1232
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:05,416
Does this thing work?

1233
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,332
Everybody, we're gonna let Christine

1234
00:57:09,624 --> 00:57:10,975
pull herself together
for a couple of minutes,

1235
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:13,541
and then we're gonna
go ahead with the debate.

1236
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:15,332
Oh, my god.

1237
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:16,624
Oh.

1238
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,541
Oh, my god!

1239
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:20,874
I'm on TV!

1240
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,166
Kevin!

1241
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:23,791
Kevin, stop 'em!

1242
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:25,082
Kevin, stop it!

1243
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:26,624
(Christine yelling)

1244
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:27,499
- Shut it off!
- Shut that thing off.

1245
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,791
(Christine yelling)

1246
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:31,582
Shut that goddamn thing off!

1247
00:57:31,874 --> 00:57:33,874
This kind of bullshit doesn't just happen.

1248
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,999
Not when they're somebody
around like you, DeVito.

1249
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,416
(group chattering)

1250
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:40,142
[Bobby] What's that
suppose to mean, Kevin?

1251
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,267
Hey, buddy, I'll tell ya
what that's supposed to mean.

1252
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:42,916
Stay out of this, Bobby.

1253
00:57:43,207 --> 00:57:43,749
Relax, Darryl.

1254
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,433
- Just relax.
- Hey, this is my ballgame.

1255
00:57:45,457 --> 00:57:46,817
I think that you... Take a hike!

1256
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:47,624
- Hold on.
- Now just relax.

1257
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,308
- Look, I think you...
- Hey, this is my ballgame!

1258
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:49,957
- Shut up!
- DeVito!

1259
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:50,791
Hold it!

1260
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:52,558
You don't know when to quit do you, DeVito?

1261
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:53,166
You know something, Kevin?

1262
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:55,057
You're right, I don't know when to quit.

1263
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:55,749
And I'll tell ya something else.

1264
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:56,582
Go ahead tell me, I'll love it.

1265
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:58,225
Come on, I wanna hear this, DeVito.

1266
00:57:58,249 --> 00:57:59,517
I think your jockstrap is cutting off

1267
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,207
the circulation to your brain.

1268
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:03,291
(group yelling)

1269
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:04,207
Cut it out!

1270
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:05,041
Stop it!

1271
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:05,874
Stop it right now!

1272
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:06,749
What are you doing?

1273
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:07,582
Come on!

1274
00:58:07,874 --> 00:58:09,832
Hold on, listen we got some cops on campus.

1275
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:10,666
Did you guys hear me?

1276
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:12,197
We got squatter cops on campus.

1277
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:14,534
They're in the main hall
right now and they got Duane.

1278
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:16,249
[Cop] Go, move it

1279
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:17,082
(group chattering)

1280
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:18,374
Duane.

1281
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:22,499
He was doing anything wrong.

1282
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,082
Come on, it's not right.

1283
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:24,916
There's nothing that they can say.

1284
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:26,666
Right here, open it up.

1285
00:58:26,957 --> 00:58:28,416
Open it up, Jackson.

1286
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:31,832
(lock clicks)

1287
00:58:32,082 --> 00:58:34,207
(feet stomping)

1288
00:58:34,499 --> 00:58:37,207
(group chattering)

1289
00:58:40,624 --> 00:58:41,332
What do we got?

1290
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:42,624
We got sweat sock.

1291
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:44,249
We got a jockstrap.

1292
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:46,374
Look at this.

1293
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:48,582
Huh?

1294
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:49,975
That's not mine, that's not mine.

1295
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:51,183
I don't do that stuff, all right?

1296
00:58:51,207 --> 00:58:53,127
I drink a little bit but
I, that's not my stuff.

1297
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:53,832
That's not mine.

1298
00:58:54,124 --> 00:58:55,183
- Let's go, Jackson.
- It's not mine!

1299
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:57,541
(group yelling)

1300
00:58:57,832 --> 00:58:58,850
- Get out of the way!
- You can't do that to him!

1301
00:58:58,874 --> 00:58:59,416
- Get out of the way!
- You can't just

1302
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:00,975
bust into a person's locker like that.

1303
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:01,582
You don't know what you're talking about.

1304
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:02,582
- Now get out of the way.
- You can't do it!

1305
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,314
No, he's right, you can't do that.

1306
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,416
Let us see a warrant.

1307
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:06,999
Yeah, where's your warrant?

1308
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:08,291
Where's your warrant?

1309
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:09,041
Where's your warrant?

1310
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:10,850
That's not gonna be a damn bit of good

1311
00:59:10,874 --> 00:59:12,142
unless you have a search warrant.

1312
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,475
You can't use that thing as evidence-

1313
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:14,166
- Yeah, come on, let's see it.
- Without a warrant!

1314
00:59:14,457 --> 00:59:17,082
Come on! (Group yelling)

1315
00:59:17,374 --> 00:59:19,624
According to the search
and seizure code section 13,

1316
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,541
article one of the Constitution
of the State of California

1317
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:25,666
which says, "The state
may not invade the property

1318
00:59:25,957 --> 00:59:27,999
and/or privacy of an individual

1319
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,916
unless they have taken the
proper legal procedures to do so.

1320
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:32,582
Which you have failed to do!

1321
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:35,499
(group yelling)

1322
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:36,791
What is this?

1323
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:39,624
This is known as harassment,
which is against the law.

1324
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,249
You can't do this.

1325
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,249
Yeah, right, it's harassment!

1326
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:46,374
Besides, you didn't
even read him his rights!

1327
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,666
Yeah, let him go!

1328
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:48,499
Let him go!

1329
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:49,332
Let him go!

1330
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:50,166
Let him go!

1331
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:53,374
[Group] Let him go, let
him go, let him go, let him go,

1332
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,999
let him go, let him go, let him go,

1333
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,916
- let him go!
- Hey, hey, hey, all right,

1334
00:59:58,207 --> 00:59:59,475
- all right, all right.
- All right!

1335
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:01,019
Let's see what this guy's gotta say.

1336
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:04,332
All right, listen here,
Jackson, you got lucky this time.

1337
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:05,933
We're gonna be watching you, you got it?

1338
01:00:05,957 --> 01:00:06,582
Ooh.

1339
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:07,416
Come on, fellas.

1340
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:10,457
(group cheering)

1341
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:13,291
(group clapping)

1342
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:24,541
(whistle blowing) (upbeat music)

1343
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,749
Looking good, looking great.

1344
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,041
Go vote.

1345
01:00:30,082 --> 01:00:31,082
Hey.

1346
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:35,416
Hi.

1347
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,041
Hi.

1348
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,249
God, you look good.

1349
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,541
Thank you.

1350
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,124
How's it going?

1351
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:47,767
Everyone who said they were gonna vote

1352
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:52,582

this thing in the bag last night.

1353
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:55,666
Did you vote?

1354
01:00:55,957 --> 01:00:57,707
No, I was just on my way over.

1355
01:00:57,999 --> 01:00:58,999
Don't let me stop you.

1356
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:00,374
The polls are closing.

1357
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,957
Look, I gotta get every vote I can get.

1358
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:05,791

You really wanna win don't you?

01:01:21,249 --> 01:01:23,999
More than anything in the world.

1365
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,499
Oh.

1366
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:30,166
(gentle music)

1367
01:01:40,457 --> 01:01:43,124
Someday this will all be yours.

1368
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:47,416
Not today right?

1369
01:01:49,374 --> 01:01:51,166
I don't know.

1370
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,582
I think it's gonna be close.

1371
01:01:58,207 --> 01:02:02,791
Why are you such a pro
at making my life so difficult?

1372
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,374
Always did bring out the best of me.

1373
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:13,207
What I would like from you right now.

1374
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:14,707
[Bobby] A kiss.

1375
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:17,082
A truce.

1376
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:20,291
I'd like that too.

1377
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,291
I like your bracelet.

1378
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:44,957
Thank you.

1379
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,291
Former admirer gave that to me.

1380
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:54,249
Can't remember who.

1381
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,374
Happy sweet 16,

1382
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:07,707

I hope so.

1385
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:41,041
Save me a dance.

1389
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:02,291
All right, quiet down.

Hold it down now.

1391
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:04,832

1443
01:06:56,832 --> 01:06:57,832
Uh, like tomorrow.

1444
01:06:57,874 --> 01:06:59,416
No, it's important.

1445
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:03,082
I'll wait.

1446
01:07:03,374 --> 01:07:04,624
Come on in.

1447
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:07,124
(door bangs)

1448
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:09,999
I'm sorry.

1449
01:07:10,874 --> 01:07:12,082
Yeah.

1450
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:12,916
Hmm, yeah.

1451
01:07:13,207 --> 01:07:14,291
(woman giggles)

1452
01:07:14,582 --> 01:07:15,916
So what do you say?

1453
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:18,707
[Woman] The answer is yes.

1454
01:07:18,999 --> 01:07:19,999
You will.

1455
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:21,916
You will, great.

1456
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:22,582
Terrific.

1457
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:23,582
I love it.

1458
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:25,041
No, I love it.

1459
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,166
Listen, somebody just came in.

1460
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:29,666
So uh, I'll work out all the details,

1461
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:31,416
and I'll call you back later.

1462
01:07:31,707 --> 01:07:32,707
Okay?

1463
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:34,374
Yeah, I will.

1464
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:35,707
- Okay.
- Ciao.

1465
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,666
Ciao.

1466
01:07:39,957 --> 01:07:40,666
Good news?

1467
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:41,957
Yeah.

1468
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:45,916
Uh, Donna's not home is she?

1469
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:46,874
No, do you wanna talk to her?

1470
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:47,791
- No.
- 'Cause she's working.

1471
01:07:48,082 --> 01:07:50,624
No, I came here to talk to you.

1472
01:07:52,499 --> 01:07:53,499
Uh.

1473
01:07:57,249 --> 01:07:58,999
I wanted to apologize.

1474
01:08:00,624 --> 01:08:01,291
What for?

1475
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:02,582
We won.

1476
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:06,249
Yeah, I know but, uh, you
know I made it sound like you

1477
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,058
had nothing to do with the whole thing

1478
01:08:08,082 --> 01:08:10,124
and, uh, that's ridiculous.

1479
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:13,374
You know what we're gonna have to do?

1480
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,707
We're gonna have to celebrate tomorrow.

1481
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:19,909
You gonna answer your door?

1482
01:08:19,957 --> 01:08:21,082
Yeah, I'm gonna answer it.

1483
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:23,499
Listen, Darryl, I'm expecting somebody,

1484
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,100
so I'm gonna have to get rid of you.

1485
01:08:25,124 --> 01:08:26,499
Who, who are you expecting?

1486
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:28,271
What are you doing taking a survey?

1487
01:08:28,499 --> 01:08:29,832
I got this chick coming by.

1488
01:08:30,124 --> 01:08:31,124
A chick?

1489
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,166
Who's the chick?

1490
01:08:32,249 --> 01:08:33,889
What's the difference who the chick is?

1491
01:08:33,999 --> 01:08:35,374
Look, my parents aren't home,

1492
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:37,957
and you could be doing
me a big favor by leaving.

1493
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:39,329
Oh, come on introduce me.

1494
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,457
Some other time, Darryl.

1495
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,791
Ah, DeVito, that's your whole problem

1496
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:45,457
you're never willing to share.

1497
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:48,207
[Bobby] We celebrate tomorrow.

1498
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:51,416
(door clicks)

1499
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:53,041
Ciao.

1500
01:08:53,332 --> 01:08:54,541
Ciao.

1501
01:08:54,832 --> 01:08:55,832
(door bangs)

1502
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,707
(knuckles tapping)

1503
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:05,749
(door clicks)

1504
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,666
Here you go, Bobby.

1505
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:09,157
[Bobby] Thanks a lot, Frank.

1506
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,041
You and your buddies did a great job.

1507
01:09:11,332 --> 01:09:12,666
Thanks, little guy.

1508
01:09:12,957 --> 01:09:13,957
Take care.

1509
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,749
(door bangs)

1510
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:28,207
Darryl, it's only high school.

1511
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:36,166
Those kids think that
you're a hero, let them.

1512
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:45,332
Look, I had to do something,
couldn't let her win.

1513
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:55,276
The main thing is nobody got hurt,

1514
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,916
and nobody has to ever find out.

1515
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:16,791
(door clicks)

1516
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:19,041
You wanted to win, didn't you?

1517
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:21,541
(door bangs)

1518
01:10:23,957 --> 01:10:27,666
I am especially pleased to
be making this introduction.

1519
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:31,916
Uh, 'cause here's a man who at least for me

1520
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:34,707
has redefined the word underdog.

1521
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:36,319
And this the man you have elected

1522
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,579
your student body president

1523
01:10:37,749 --> 01:10:40,041
for next semester, Darryl Fitzgerald.

1524
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:45,124
(group clapping) (group cheering)

1525
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:47,791
Thank you.

1526
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:49,082
Thank you very much.

1527
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:50,832
Thank you very much.

1528
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:52,791
Thank you.

1529
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,666
You don't know me but.

1530
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:57,499
(group laughing)

1531
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:06,207
It's hard to believe that
was less than two weeks ago.

1532
01:11:07,707 --> 01:11:10,832
Now I'm actually standing in front of you

1533
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:13,999
as the president of the student body.

1534
01:11:15,374 --> 01:11:18,416
When I was first asked to run

1535
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,749
I thought of it as a great opportunity.

1536
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:25,082
A chance finally to be known,

1537
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:31,541
maybe accepted.

1538
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:38,041
I thought it was such a good
idea that I stopped thinking

1539
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:42,207
about practically everything
else except winning.

1540
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:46,791
Winning.

1541
01:11:53,624 --> 01:11:55,041
And it changed me.

1542
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,082
Someone tried to warn me
about what was happening

1543
01:12:05,624 --> 01:12:07,207
but I didn't listen.

1544
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,874
Instead I listened to other voices

1545
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:17,166
and uh, I'm not gonna
listen to them anymore,

1546
01:12:21,624 --> 01:12:25,374
'cause I'm sure they
would tell me I was crazy

1547
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,957
to turn down being
president of the student body.

1548
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:32,957
(group chattering)

1549
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:40,999
I was elected, I was
elected because you people

1550
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,624
believed that I fought for your rights

1551
01:12:47,707 --> 01:12:49,457
in a moment of crisis.

1552
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:53,374
But what you and I didn't know

1553
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,416
was that the marijuana bust

1554
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:06,249
was a complete fake.

1555
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:09,374
(group chattering)

1556
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:10,666
Oh.

1557
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:16,416
A setup, a setup to make
me look good, like a winner.

1558
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,499
I really can't be your president.

1559
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:36,416
I never wanted anything
more in my whole life.

1560
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:46,457
But I don't deserve it.

1561
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:54,791
I'm really very, very sorry.

1562
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:06,124
(group chattering)

1563
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:36,291

it's wrong, I don't deserve it.

1606
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:02,332
Darryl, what you did
today took a lot of courage

1607
01:17:02,624 --> 01:17:04,749
and everybody recognized it.
