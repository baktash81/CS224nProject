2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,360
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,760
Wait for them to ask you who you know

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,460
Please don't make any sudden moves

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,520
You don't know the half of the abuse

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,920
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,660
Wait for them to ask you who you know

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,040
Please don't make any sudden moves

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,680
You don't know the half of the abuse

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,720
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,820
Docked away

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,800
Just because we check the guns at the door

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,440
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,260
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,980
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,600
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,940
But after all I've said, please don't forget.

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,860
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,080
Wait for them to ask you who you know

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,440
Please don't make any sudden moves

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,320
You don't know the half of the abuse

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,740
We don't deal with outsiders very well

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,340
They say newcomers have a certain smell

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,400
You have trust issues, not to mention

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,560
They say they can smell your intentions

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,540
You'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,180
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you

28
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,200
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,020
But after all I've said, please don't forget

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,020
(Watch it)

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,120
(Watch it)

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,760
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,380
Wait for them to ask you who you know

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,240
Please don't make any sudden moves

35
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,620
 You don't know the half of the abuse

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,100
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
(Watch it)

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,780
Wait for them to ask you who you know

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,380
(Watch it)

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,000
(Watch it)

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Wait for them to ask you who you know

43
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,140
Why'd you come, you knew you should have stayed

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,100
(It's blasphemy)

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
I tried to warn you just to stay away

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,840
And now they're outside ready to bust

47
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,340
It looks like you might be one of us

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:35,500
