1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:05,967
( overture playing )

2
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,834
We are in sight
of the towers of home

3
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,033
and your father's
palace, Your Highness.

4
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,000
It hardly seems we have
been gone an entire year.

5
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:13,600
I've sent messengers ahead
to tell of your arrival.

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,867
I am dying of thirst.

7
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,166
Let us stop
at that cottage.

8
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,433
( music playing )

9
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,433
What do you suppose
is wrong with yon wench?

10
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,967
Doubtly she's overwhelmed

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,867
at the sight
of Your Royal Highness.

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,834
In my present dusty
and exhausted state,

13
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,967
I doubt that I could
overwhelm anyone.

14
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,567
Aide:
She is peering at us
through the windows.

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,867
Come out, lass.

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,567
Prince:
Come out, lass.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,500
Come out.
We will not harm you.

18
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,000
I dare not.

19
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,400
Why not?

20
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,433
No one is at home

21
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,734
and my stepmother
will beat me

22
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,567
if I speak to anyone
while she's away.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,300
Where has she gone?

24
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,800
She has gone with my
stepsisters into the town

25
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,800
to welcome the prince
who's returning today

26
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:31,033
from fighting dragons
and rescuing princesses and...

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,867
finding his true love.

28
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,567
Ahh. Is that
what he was doing?

29
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,967
Now, would you be
a kind lass

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,734
and fetch me
a dipper of cool water

31
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,200
from your well
before I die of thirst?

32
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh, of course, sir.

33
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,967
And, uh, you need say nothing
of it to your stepmother.

34
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,734
The poor slavey does not
recognize Your Highness

35
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:02,967
and she is terrified
of her stepmother.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,967
But her kindness
has overcome her fear.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,634
Here you are, sir.

38
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,100
Thank you, lass.

39
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,333
More?

40
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:17,066
No. Thank you
most kindly.

41
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,266
You are most
kindly welcome, sir.

42
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,300
What is your name, lass?

43
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,700
I am called Cinderella.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Cinderella.
Why are you called that?

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,634
Because I sit
among the ashes.

46
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:42,133
- And why do you do that?
- To warm my feet.

47
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,066
You see, sir,
I sleep in the attic

48
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,934
where it is always cold.

49
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,266
Then why do you sleep
in the attic?

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,233
The other rooms are
occupied

51
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,500
by my stepmother
and my stepsisters.

52
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,734
Where does
your father sleep?

53
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,934
In Heaven.

54
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,900
Shall we go on,
Your Highness?

55
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,433
Yes.

56
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,500
Good-bye,
Cinderella.

57
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,200
( horse hooves departing )

58
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,400
G-good-bye...

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,634
Your Highness.

60
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,200
( horse hooves fading )

61
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,000
"Fighting dragons,
rescuing princesses

62
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,100
"and finding his true love."

63
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:32,867
But I have not found
my true love.

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,066
That is unfortunate,
Your Highness.

65
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,533
It is not for lack of seeking,
you will grant me that.

66
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,867
Perhaps Your Highness
did not tarry long enough

67
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,967
with any of the princesses
you rescued.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,734
There was no need to tarry.

69
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:49,800
When she appears,
I will know.

70
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:56,467

Your Highness,
we must go on.

91
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:57,066
Yes. Yes.

92
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:02,734
( crowd cheering )

93
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:06,433
( orchestral music

94
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,900
- Cinderella.
- Yes, ma'am.

95
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,033
Why are you sitting
there dreaming?

96
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,934
- Have you made
all the beds?
- Yes, ma'am.

97
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,634
- Washed all the dishes?
- Yes, ma'am.

98
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,900
- Polished all the silver?
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:21,533
- Scrubbed the floors?
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,367
- Finished the washing
and ironing?
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,467
Well, couldn't you find
anything else to do, child?

102
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,400
- No, ma'am.
- Here. Take care
of these things.

103
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, dear.

104
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:37,834
I'm exhausted.

105
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,333
But it has been
a wonderful day.

106
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,166
Simply wonderful.

107
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,300
Oh, yes, it was
so thrilling to see
the prince return.

108
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,033
- He is so handsome.
- And so gallant.

109
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,834
- And so polite.
- How would you know?

110
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,133
Oh, I've heard it said.

111
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,166
Now, my daughters,

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,767
I want to talk to you.

113
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,533
Not you.

114
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,367
My own daughters.

115
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,400
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,266
Now that the prince has
returned from his travels,

117
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,233
it'll be time
for him to marry.

118
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,734
Esmerelda:
I wonder who will be
the lucky girl.

119
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,400
Prunella:
Imagine marrying the prince.

120
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,533
Well, there's no reason why

121
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,300
it cannot be one of you.

122
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, why not?

123
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,066
Did you see the way
he smiled and waved at me?

124
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I was under the impression it
was I he smiled and waved at.

125
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,567
You were always
a little nearsighted.

126
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,867
- But I was never fat.
- I am considered
pleasingly plump!

127
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,233
And I have been told
my eyes are dreamlike!

128
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,500
Now, now,

129
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:48,433
there is room for improvement
in both of you.

130
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:49,967
You, Esmerelda,

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,700
simply must learn
to stop batting your eyes.

132
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,767
It was quite all right
up to the age of six.

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
I keep forgetting.

134
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,734
Watch it!

135
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,834
And you, Prunella--

136
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:08,367
- Yes, Mother?
- Your knee creaks.

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,634
- I cannot help it, Mother.
- Yes, you can.

138
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,166
Rub some unicorn oil
into it.

139
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,166
Whoever hopes
to marry the prince

140
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,667
must be perfect.

141
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,567
So upstairs, both of you,
and work on yourselves.

142
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,400
Perhaps some day,

143
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,667
if you are lucky,
Cinderella,

144
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,767
you too may catch
a glimpse of the prince.

145
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
Oh, I hope so.

146
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,500
Did anyone call
while we were away?

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,266
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who was it?

148
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,767
Only a traveler who stopped
for a dipper of water.

149
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,467
And you gave it to him?

150
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,233
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:56,233
I told you never to open
that door while we were away!

152
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,634
He was so thirsty...

153
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,900
and his smile was so kind.

154
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,300
Go to your corner!

155
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,867
And stay there
till you are called.

156
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,734
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:14,333
( orchestral music
playing )

158
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,634

staying in my corner.

Good morning, Sire.
Ma'am.

199

The Queen and I are happy
to have you home again,
my boy.

200
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,333
But we are disappointed
that you have returned
without a bride.

201
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,166
I am too, Father.

202
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,066
Well, you've had
your fun, my boy.

203
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,433
Now you must do your duty.

204
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,700
Yes, Father.

205
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,100
You must marry, settle down
and produce an heir

206
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,600
so that our royal line
may continue.

207
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:55,000
I am ready to do my duty,
Father, but whom shall I marry?

208
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,533
There's not one maiden
in my kingdom

209
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,433
who wouldn't be happy
to be your bride.

210
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,667
Many of them
are very lovely.

211
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,367
We should give
a ball, my dear,

212
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,066
and invite all
the young ladies of fashion

213
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,300
so that you may make
your choice.

214
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,700
- A splendid idea.

215
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,900
I would really rather wait
until I fall in love.

216
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,033
- Love?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,800
But we cannot
leave a matter

218
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,200
of such importance
to mere chance.

219
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,967
Your father is right,
my dear.

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,634
It is quite possible
that love will follow.

I told you to practice
morning, noon and night.

292
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,700
I did.

293
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,734
Well, at least
I hope you prepared

294
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,266
some fascinating opening
remark for the prince.

295
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,000

attract his attention

00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,667
and make a striking
first impression.

297
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,500
- Yes, ma'am, I have.
- What is it?

298
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,433
Very nice weather
we're having

299
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,533
for this time of year,
Your Highness.

300
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, good heavens.

301
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:53,533
Can you not think of something
more interesting than that?

302
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,467
Something more personal?
Work on it.

303
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,400
- Yes, ma'am.
- And stop batting
your eyes.

304
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,133
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,533

00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,567

309
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,266
What was that noise?

310
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,734
Is your knee
still creaking?

311
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:24,133
I told you to rub some
unicorn oil into it.

312
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,200
I did.

313
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,467
Well, I hope
it will not be heard

314
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,033
above the music
at the ball.

320
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,233
good heavens, no.

321
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:50,433
Of course His Highness
is in tolerable good health.

322
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,066
His Highness
is in perfect health.

323
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,433
Is that the best
you can do?

324
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:56,967
Something personal,
you said.

325
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,667
But not so obvious,
not so banal.

326
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,367
Think of something else.
Please do.

327
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,133
Cinderella...

328
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,900
If you were going
to meet the prince,

329
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,533
what fascinating
opening remark

330
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,867
would you make?

331
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,266
Please, Your Highness,

332
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,600
I would like
to be your bride.

333
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,333
( all scoffing, giggling )

334
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,433
Ridiculous.

336
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,400
The carriage waits.

337
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,233
The carriage waits.

338
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,500
Oh, I wish
I were going, too.

339
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,834
Oh, my. Imagine
Cinderella at the ball.

340
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,934
With her smudged face
and tattered dress.

341
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:50,100
Stepmother:
I must say, it is
an absurd thought.

342
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,634
( all laughing )

343
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,533
Now, girls,
compose your faces.

344
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,400
We must be off.

345
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,433

Oh, Fairy Godmother,

380
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,734
I have only
one wish just now.

381
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,667
- To go to the ball?
- Yes.

382
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,734
And that's
why you were weeping?

383
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,133
Yes.

384
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,934
Because I know
it is impossible.

385
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:42,000
Impossible?

386
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,700
Bah. What's
a fairy godmother for?

387
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,000
To make my wish
come true?

388
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:52,000
If you wish it
hard enough.

389
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,133
Oh, Fairy Godmother,
I am wishing it

390
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,367
so very, very hard
that if all the wishes

391
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,066
of all the girls who ever
wanted to go to a ball

392
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,266
turned into one
big wish,

393
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,333
it would not be any
harder than my wish.

394
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,300
That's hard enough.

395
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,767
Now...

396
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,000
you will need a coach,

397
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:13,667
four horses,
a coachman and a groom.

398
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,400
But is it possible

399
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,934
to get those things
by wishing for them?

400
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:22,767

Dear, dear
Fairy Godmother,

413
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,266
is that you?

414
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,600
What's
a fairy godmother for?

415
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,000
Now, to work.

416
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,500
For a coach...

417
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,934
I believe I noticed
a pumpkin in your garden.

418
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,100
That will do very nicely.

419
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:11,100
A pumpkin?

420
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,567
Ah, I see you have
four pet mice in a cage.

421
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,100
They'll do very nicely
for the horses.

422
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:20,400
Mice?
For horses?

423
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,533
Let's take them out
to the garden, shall we?

424
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,500
Yes, Fairy Godmother.

425
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,000
Come.

426
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,900
Put them
by the pumpkin.

427
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:42,233
Now, we still need
a coachman and a groom.

428
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,300
Let me see...

429
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,467
ooh!

430
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,467

peering at us

00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,734
outwitted a few magicians.

536
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:49,800
Usual thing.

537
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:55,200
( no audible dialogue )

538
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,867
Your Highness.

539
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,600
Have you something
in your eye?

540
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,367
No, Your Highness.

541
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,600
Oh.

542
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,433
( laughs nervously )

543
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,066
- Your Highness.
- Yes?

544
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,967
May I say something personal?

545
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,500
Yes.

546
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:29,967
Your Highness,
I think--

547
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,433
You think.

548
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,000
I think, personally--

549
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,266
Personally, yes?

550
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh...uh...

551
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:41,634
very nice weather we're having
for this time of year.

552
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,166
You really should
not make

553
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,000
such very personal
remarks, you know.

554
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,200
Oh, dear.

555
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,433
Forgive me,
Your Highness.

556
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:52,867
My mother told me to say
something personal to you.

557
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,734
I shall send you
back to your mother
for further instruction.

558
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,166
I'm pleased to see the ball
is such a success, my dear.

559
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,233
It is indeed, my dear,

560
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,667
with everyone,
except the prince.

561
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,533
Except the prince?

562
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,867
He does not seem to be
enjoying himself very much.

563
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,233
Why not?

564
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:26,033
With all the fairest young
maidens of my kingdom here,

565
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:27,600
he has only
to choose among them.

566
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:29,066
Ah, there is the rub.

567
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,533
If only he did
not have to choose.

568
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,300
When I was
his age, my dear--

569
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,433
When you were his age,
you had the remarkably
good taste

570
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,634
to fall in love
with me.

571
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,867
You are right, my dear.

572
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,967
And I trust he will have
equally good sense.

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,367
Thank you, my dear.

574
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,367
Uh--

575
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,667
uh...

576
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,767
Your Highness.

577
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,266
Yes?

578
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,133
Uh-- uh--

579
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,567
Are you preparing
to say something

580
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,100
or are you just
clearing your throat?

581
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,767
I'm preparing to say
something,

582
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,600
Your Highness,
something personal.

583
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,867
I have already been told
about the weather.

584
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,133
That was my sister.

585
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,433
Ah, yes.
And what personal remark
do you wish to make?

586
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:21,867
You look
in tolerable good health,
Your Highness.

587
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,333
That is quite
personal.

588
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:28,800
Oh, forgive me,
Your Highness,
( creaking )

589
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,500
( creaking )
but you see, my mother--

590
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,600
- Do you hear
a strange sound?
- ( creaking )

591
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:34,100
No, Your Highness.

592
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,634
- Something is creaking.
- ( creaking )

593
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,400
( laughs )

594
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,600
Oh, la!
( creaking )

595
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,734
It-it's, uh--
it's only my knee.

596
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,400
Your Highness.

597
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,700
Could you possibly creak
in time to the music?

598
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,400
( creaking )

599
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,400
I have no control
over it.

600
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,967
I shall omit the next four
or five sets. I am fatigued.

601
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,567
Yes, Your Highness.

602
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,266
( creaks )

603
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:14,333
Your Highness.

604
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:16,333
Madam.

605
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:18,333
May I say, Your Highness,

606
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:21,266
that I've never seen
a finer-looking couple

607
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,533
than Your Highness
and that young lady
you were just dancing with.

608
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,333
Which young lady
is that?

609
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,600
My daughter Prunella.

610
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,200
Ah, yes.

611
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,967
May I say, Your Highness,

612
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,667
that she's been brought up
with no expense spared,

613
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,600
having received instruction
in etiquette,

614
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:48,166
lawn croquet, heraldry,

615
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,066
and pomp
and circumstance.

616
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,367
Ah, yes.
I noticed the pomp.

617
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,066
Oh, did you really?

618
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,700
But, madam,
she has a circumstance
that I cannot abide.

619
00:38:57,734 --> 00:38:59,934
What is that,
Your Highness?

620
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,500
She creaks.

621
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,367
Your Highness.

622
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,567
Madam.

623
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,533
My other daughter.

624
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:12,900
Which one is that?

625
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,667
Esmerelda.

626
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:19,600
Ah, yes.

627
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,433
She bats her eyes.

628
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,367
Well!

629
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,900
There's simply
no pleasing that prince.

630
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:40,433
( fanfare )

631
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:52,066
( ballroom music
in distance )

632
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:01,367
Coachman:
Cinderella.

633
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
Remember what your
fairy godmother said.

634
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,467
You must leave before
the stroke of midnight.

635
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,333
I will remember.

636
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,567
Why have you left
the dance, my boy?

637
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,233
I am fatigued.

638
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,400
Fatigued?
At your age?

639
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,934
I am certain it
is not the dance that
has fatigued him, my dear.

640
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,667
That is the truth, Mother.
I am discouraged.

641
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,166
Discouraged?

642
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,300
With all the fairest young
maidens of my kingdom here?

643
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,900
It would not be
so bad if I saw them
as fair young maidens.

644
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:52,567
How else do you see them?

645
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,567
As contenders
for a prize.

646
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,834
And I am the prize.

647
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:01,433
( fanfare )

648
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,967
Who is she?

649
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,433
I do not know.

650
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:17,133
My, she is beautiful.

651
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,667
Carries herself well.

652
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,433
Do you not
think so, dear?

653
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:23,867
Dear!

654
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,433
( music playing )

655
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:05,000
Who on earth is she?

656
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:07,000
I never
saw her before.

657
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:10,500
The prince has
a foolish expression
on his face.

658
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,333
He never looked that way
when he danced with me.

659
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,066
No.

660
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,734
Thank you most kindly
for the dance.

661
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,400
You are most kindly welcome,
Your Highness.

662
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:52,333
I have a strange feeling
that we have met before,

663
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:53,800
That I have heard
your voice before.

664
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,100
Is that possible?

665
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,100
It's possible.

666
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:01,500
Yes, everything
is possible tonight.

667
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:04,433
Everything is different.

668
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:08,200
Everything has changed
since you came.

669
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:12,734
I have never felt
this way before.

670
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,567

There was no other

949
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,367
Perhaps it's just as well.

Father?

953
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,667
seems to lack the first

955
01:04:52,533 --> 01:04:55,333

Oh, I am certain,
once married,

957

she would settle down.

958
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,500
May not be possible.
Perhaps she's bewitched.

959
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:06,333
I know only that
she has bewitched me

960
01:05:06,367 --> 01:05:07,834

The sun is setting,
Your Highness.

983
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:23,934
We have tried
the glass slipper

984
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,500
on the feet
of countless maidens.

985
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:29,967
It is time to rest
for another day.

986
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,066
I cannot rest
until I find her.

987
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,734
There is another cottage
in the distance.

988
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,300
He's approaching! Oh!

989
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:48,734
Oh! Oh, the prince
is coming! Oh!

990
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:54,300
Cinderella, go out
and tend the garden!

991
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,133
- Now?
- At once!

992
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,834
We cannot have you here
dusting when the prince arrives.

993
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:03,000
- I thought I might--
- You thought what?

994
01:09:03,033 --> 01:09:05,000
I thought I might
get a glimpse of him.

995
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:07,667
This is a most
important occasion.

996
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,500
We must make
the best possible impression
on the prince.

997
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:14,600
Now go!
And keep out of sight!

998
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,500
Yes, ma'am.

999
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, I'm so excited!
How do I look?

1000
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:24,333
And I'm so nervous!
What shall I say?
What shall I do?

1001
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:26,834
Just get your foot
in the slipper!
That's all!

1002
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,667

1003
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,734

01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,734

01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,900

Oh!

1012
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,667
Are there any other
young maidens in the house?

1013
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:46,500
No.

1014
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:12,100
- Cinderella?
- Oh, Fairy Godmother.

1015
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:14,033
Why are you weeping now?

1016
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:15,266
The prince is going,

1017
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,934
and I will never
see him again.

1018
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:20,100
But he's traveled far

1019
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:22,600
and he is sad and weary...

1020
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:26,934
- and--
- and thirsty.

1021
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:28,266
At least I can offer him

1022
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,166
a dipper of cool water
from the well.

1023
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,734
That would be
a great kindness.

1024
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:36,600

1025
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:39,834

1029
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:52,066
