1
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,268
All right, mama.

2
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,312
You look well.

3
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,438
- Okay.
- I do?

4
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,190
Yes, you do. You look nice.

5
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,358
- It's a lot.
- It is a lot.

6
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,162
Okay.

7
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,496
You like isolation, huh?

8
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,961
You want a special invitation?
Get your ass in the line. Let's go!

9
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,713
Fuck off! Don't come over here.

10
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,447
Ain't no damn way
you coming back up in here.

11
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,823
-Why not?
-Back up.

12
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,995
I was wondering
why the hell you disappeared.

13
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,666
RAP sheet as long
as a goddamned sidewalk.

14
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,668
I'ma call the cops,
you keep standing there.

15
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,795
All right, well,
then give me my two weeks back.

16
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,714
-From a year and a half ago?
-Then give me my job back.

17
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,842
You know what?

18
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,678
Here. Here-- Here you go.

19
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,930
That good enough for you?

20
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,812
Is that Inez?

21
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,858
- Oh, my God!
- How you doing, mama?

22
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,443
I thought you moved
to another shelter.

23
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,945
No, you know I was in Rikers.

24
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,072
They had me in there
for boosting and shit.

25
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,824
Can't wait for you
to get at this hair, though.

26
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,243
If I go get the dye,
will you please do it for me next week?

27
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,911
I really missed you, girl.

28
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,288
Yeah, and apparently these roots too.

29
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,497
What you been doing?

30
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,957
- What she been doing?
- Nothing.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
Yes, the roots missed you too.

32
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,334
Terry, hurry up!

33
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,419
Hey-hey-hey-hey…

34
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,963
You ain't getting nothing from
the store if you keep acting like that!

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,340
Inez, whatever happened
to that scammer you was fucking with?

36
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,925
You ever hear from him?

37
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,260
We missed you, yo.

38
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,389
Terry.

39
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,560
You don't hear me calling you?

40
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,689
You don't remember me now?

41
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,152
Just let me see your eyes, T,
so I know you're not mad at me.

42
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,654
He not gonna answer.

43
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
I'm back across the street
at the shelter.

44
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,075
And, look,
I'm staying out of trouble this time.

45
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,953
I'ma be around here for good now.
You hear that, T?

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,749
Just want to make sure you're doing okay.

47
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,087
Here. Get you another Icee.

48
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,214
Look, y'all keep this between us, aight?

49
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,716
Don't let nobody know I came by here.

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,843
Okay.

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,472
- You're pretty.
- See y'all around.

52
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,391
Man, stop flirting with people.

53
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,492
Hey! Hey-hey-hey! None of that!

54
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,161
Get up. Get up. Okay, let's go!

55
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:50,123
Everybody, if you don't know how to act,
then we not coming to the park!

56
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,376
Turn around. Let's go!

57
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,721
I got the perms, the hairs, the weaves!

58
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,224
- Fuck off the street!
- Wash and dry.

59
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,394
- I know you want that hair done.
- Next time, I'ma hit you!

60
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,562
Hey-hey-hey, ma-ma-ma-ma!

61
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,896
Excuse me, excuse me.

62
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,273
Hold on. Slow down.

63
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,108
Hey, you know you want me
to do your hair.

64
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,902
Bitch, move!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

65
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,613
Thank you, baby.

66
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,866
Hey, come here.

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,492
How are you?

68
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,370
I want to take this French roll out
and put me some length in.

69
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,455
Yeah, you know, I do braids for 75.

70
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,582
-Call me.
-All right.

71
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,208
My number's right there, right there.

72
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,085
Aight.

73
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,171
I'm about to ask y'all
a serious question.

74
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,423
Who is y'all best player of all time?

75
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,425
Bro, what?

76
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,595
Michael Jordan!

77
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,847
- Shawn.
- Huh? Oh. Oh, hi.

78
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,599
How's your friend doing?
I need to know he's okay.

79
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,392
Terry not here no more.
Stop asking!

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,852
Well, figure out a better answer.

81
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,480
Now, if I tell you, what you gonna gimme?

82
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,610
-Here.
-Thank you.

83
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,694
Now what's up?

84
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,362
He at the hospital.

85
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,990
The hospital? Why?
What happened?

86
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,575
Running from our foster mother.

87
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,328
Fell out the window, hit his head.

88
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,087
Let me see.

89
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,384
It hurt?

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,722
You know, you could've died
doing something like that?

91
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,565
What's wrong with the one I gave you?

92
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,858
It's corny.

93
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,111
All right, well,
then buy your own fucking toy, then.

94
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,787
What you like?

95
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,415
Power Rangers.

96
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,922
Tell me more
about your foster mother.

97
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,048
You like her?

98
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,556
She probably gone anyway.

99
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,601
When I was in foster care,
stuff like this happened all the time.

100
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,772
My sister used to look out for me.

101
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,191
But she ran away.

102
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,776
Where's she at now?

103
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,112
I don't know.

104
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,407
I can't find her.

105
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,952
My family's gone, boo.

106
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,090
You left me on the street corner?

107
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,472
Who would tell you something like that?

108
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,143
Why the fuck would they tell you
some shit like that?

109
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,983
Get that out your head.

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,748
Hey, yo, what's up, ma?
What you doing?

111
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,334
Pushing my way. Where you going?
What's happenin'?

112
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,213
Yo, he got his feelings hurt.
He got his feelings hurt.

113
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,212
Wow, really?

114
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,257
Hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

115
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,634
Want to split this?

116
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,718
Yeah.

117
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,471
Okay.

118
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,319
Um,

119
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,404
T…

120
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,325
I just wanted to come say bye.

121
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,952
Just for a little while.

122
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,495
Um…

123
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,955
I think they gonna move you.

124
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,085
I don't know where yet,

125
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,087
but I'll see you soon.

126
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,099
Save my beeper number,

127
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,977
just in case,

128
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,230
till I find you, okay?

129
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
When?

130
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,115
I don't know yet.

131
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,539
Why you keep leaving me?

132
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:41,475
Well, that means you have bad luck,

133
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:46,563
because I'm about to do a karate kick!

134
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,316
Pow! Pow!

135
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,645
Would it make you feel better
if you came to stay with me?

136
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,190
Just for a couple days?

137
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,276
Yeah.

138
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,364
All right, we gonna go to Harlem
where I grew up at.

139
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,599
Yo, look how big
this man's head is.

140
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,397
You want to see New York
turn into the suburbs?

141
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,240
-How's the pizza?
-Good.

142
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,583
Where's my dad at?

143
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,963
He's gone.

144
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,093
You wouldn't have liked him anyway.
I got somebody else in mind.

145
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,601
You miss your old friends?

146
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,353
They're not my friends.

147
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,482
Yeah. Sometimes
I feel like I ain't got no friends either.

148
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,778
Except you.

149
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,117
Ugh.

150
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,475
How much longer?

151
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,106
How much longer?

152
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,858
<i>We're sorry.</i>

153
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,402
-How much--
-Terry, just gimme a minute, please.

154
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,778
We gonna sleep out here?

155
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,071
-You want to?
-No.

156
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,532
All right, then shut the fuck up
and let me finish!

157
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,950
<i>…and try your call again.</i>

158
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,996
Sorry for cursing.

159
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,582
Damn, Terry! Just go, go.
Go back to Brooklyn.

160
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,750
-Go back to Brooklyn!
-I don't want to go back!

161
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,920
-I'll call your social workers right now!
-I want to stay with you!

162
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,547
Well, then stop crying
and look at me.

163
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,341
All you got is me. Okay?

164
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,803
I'll go to war for you, you know that?

165
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,472
Do you understand that?
Against anybody.

166
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:10,100
Against this whole fucked-up city.

167
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,476
They can try all they want.

168
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,897
They can try all they want,
but they not breaking us up this time.

169
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,524
You want to find a new home?

170
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,276
Hmm?

171
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,069
Yes.

172
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,363
But I need to know
we in this thing together.

173
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,407
Tell me.

174
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,452
-We're in this together.
-Tell me!

175
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,245
We're in this together!

176
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,187
<i>Hello?</i>

177
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,189
Kim? Boo, it's Inez.

178
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,441
Oh, my God,
thank God you got the same number.

179
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,901
Listen, I'm uptown.

180
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,496
Y'all go sit in the living room
while I talk to her real quick.

181
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,414
-Is that Ghetto Inez in my living room?
-Shh!

182
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,916
When did you start hanging
with her again?

183
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,377
She's with her son.
Please don't say anything.

184
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,797
She needs a place to stay.

185
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,175
Want to come say hi?

186
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,761
Girl, I'm tired.

187
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,390
For how long?

188
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,725
I don't know.

189
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,769
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

190
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,274
Good morning, sunshine.

191
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,528
If y'all are hungry,
I'ma make breakfast downstairs.

192
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,113
Come on, dance with me.

193
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,868
Oh.

194
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,787
Look at you. Look at you.

195
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,584
You get your GED?

196
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,336
-Inside.
-Really?

197
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,672
Yo, that's fly.

198
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,800
Bruh, you get, like, excited
about the weirdest things.

199
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,011
I'm proud of you!

200
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,721
So what's your plan?

201
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,765
You up here for good or…

202
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,477
I don't know.
I'm tired of these catty-ass shops.

203
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,398
-Start your own.
-With what money?

204
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,734
What am I supposed to do right now?

205
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,153
Me and my son
need something to eat right now.

206
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,281
Yeah.

207
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:33,243
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you about Terry.

208
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,916
So, you have him with, uh, Lucky?

209
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,922
Me and Lucky were broken up
when I had T.

210
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,340
He still locked up?

211
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,383
Yeah.

212
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,010
I'll introduce them when he gets out.

213
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,521
The city had him.

214
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,689
He's not supposed
to be with me.

215
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,151
Yo, can't you get locked up
for some shit like that?

216
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,069
Not if you keep it to yourself.

217
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,661
Um…

218
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,165
It's safe with me.

219
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,427
Nez, we good.

220
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,266
Look at the cute little dinosaurs.

221
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,644
-They look dumb.
-Okay, no, they don't.

222
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,396
Stop being mean.

223
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,607
She working?

224
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,901
I think she went job hunting today.

225
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,530
You can't go to anybody's place
looking and talking like that.

226
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,990
And all that yakking.

227
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,908
Ma, she can borrow my stuff.

228
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,537
Terry, you like the coloring books, baby?

229
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,292
Good. You know, when I was your age,
my mother taught me how to read.

230
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,918
She spent a lot of time with me.

231
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,504
Well, let me get a loosie, a Big Burst

232
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,923
and some sunflower seeds,
the nacho cheese ones.

233
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,302
<i>…a six-year-old boy snatched.</i>

234
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,304
<i>Brookdale, one of the city's most troubled</i>

235
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,515
<i>and underfunded hospitals,
reports the child was spending</i>

236
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,559
<i>one of his last mornings in patient care.</i>

237
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,395
Um, they talking about that kid
that got snatched in Brooklyn?

238
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,190
I don't know that story.

239
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,400
All right, matter of fact,
let me get a newspaper too.

240
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,195
<i>…information
to please call Crime Stoppers</i>

241
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,907
<i>at 800-577-1212.</i>

242
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,838
- <i>Jones residence.
</i>-Yeah, Kim.

243
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,965
I need you to make sure
you keep Terry in your sight.

244
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,009
-<i>Don't let him out of your sight.
</i>-What?

245
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,678
Just keep him in the house.

246
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:00,057
-Inez, where are you?
-<i>Just do it! Please, Kim!</i>

247
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,892
<i>I don't want nobody asking questions.</i>

248
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,603
-<i>I got to handle some things.
</i>-Of course.

249
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,984
-She say where she was at?
-Uh-uh.

250
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,862
Doesn't make sense. It doesn't
take this long to look for work.

251
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,323
- You like to play games, Terry?
- This is ridiculous.

252
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,160
So quiet.

253
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,748
Who's hiding in there?

254
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,503
Mmm?

255
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,676
I found work.

256
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,768
Come on, boo,
so you can try these on.

257
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,856
You like 'em?

258
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,150
They're too big.

259
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,194
You'll grow into them.

260
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,698
Why don't you take 'em upstairs?

261
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,664
Kim, check the stove for me, please.

262
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,541
Okay.

263
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,842
Can you just at least
act like you see me here?

264
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,180
Exactly what do you expect
and want from me?

265
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,849
Strolling in here
after being God-knows-where…

266
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,058
Doing what I had to.

267
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,060
Like some kind of streetwalker.

268
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,521
What the fuck did you just call me?

269
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,190
Shit.

270
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,608
Run that back again.

271
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,026
Ma, Inez…

272
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,237
You always treated me like I'm not
good enough to be around your daughter.

273
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,782
Whatever you think of me,
just spit it out!

274
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,868
I don't think anything of you.

275
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,997
-Inez, what's up with you?
-What!

276
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,249
-What!
-No! I'm fine.

277
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,752
Glass almost cut my foot.

278
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,588
Turning my house
into damn 125th Street.

279
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,424
-Ma!
-No, no.

280
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,388
The hell are you teaching
that little boy up there?

281
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,685
Twenty-two years old,
acting like a child.

282
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,939
You want them to take you serious,
be from Harlem, not of Harlem.

283
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,443
So that's it?

284
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,196
You don't have nothing else to say?

285
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,117
-I said I was…
-To me!

286
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,665
Was I wrong? Yes.

287
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,377
But what else do you want me to say?
That I'm nothing? A streetwalker?

288
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,588
You can't keep fighting
everyone you disagree with.

289
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,216
We got to grow up.

290
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,885
Okay, look, my mom's gonna be
who she's gonna be, but, like…

291
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,428
But, like, what?

292
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,475
When are you going to realize
that you are enough?

293
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,269
Who cares what she says?

294
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,730
Why even let any of that shit get to you?

295
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,320
She…

296
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,199
She said I was a bad mother.

297
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,498
Come here. Come here.

298
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,925
She forgets you don't have one.

299
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,475
Hey, you.

300
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,812
You better get that chip
off your shoulder.

301
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,523
I know you hear me.

302
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,068
Come on.

303
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,367
All right, promise me
you're gonna be good for Mommy?

304
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,564
T, don't go up.

305
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,485
We don't really know anybody here.

306
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,239
I lied.

307
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,914
Don't look at me like that.

308
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,082
Get off me.

309
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,211
-Why you being mean to me?
-'Cause you keep fucking up!

310
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,838
Ow!

311
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,756
Who said you could talk to me like that?

312
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,509
-I liked them!
-Okay, well, yeah. What about me?

313
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,052
What about me, Terry?

314
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,763
Some shit is more important
than some coloring books.

315
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,982
I didn't mean to hurt you.

316
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,450
Wait right here.

317
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,213
<i>Hey, this is Wanda.</i>

318
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,632
<i>Leave a message after the beep,
and I'll call you back.</i>

319
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,574
- <i>Hello?
</i>-Hi. This Cynthia?

320
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,159
-<i>Who this</i>?
-Listen, I need a favor.

321
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:53,660
-<i>What?
</i>-The building that I'm living in,

322
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,579
it got asbestos,
and they cleared everybody out.

323
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,331
<i>Inez, I'm sorry. You can't stay here.</i>

324
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,293
<i>The number you are calling
is no longer in service.</i>

325
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,046
- <i>Hello.
</i>-It's your old hairdresser, Inez.

326
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,464
-<i>You said who?
</i>-Just give me the address,

327
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,466
-and we'll come by later. Terry!
-<i>I did not say…</i>

328
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,139
Terry, are you crazy?
Where were you going!

329
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,308
-Get off me! Get off me!
-Are you crazy?

330
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,851
Our stuff was in there!

331
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,307
I can't go back to that shelter.

332
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,893
How long you been
on the street?

333
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,020
Long enough.

334
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,024
Where are your people?

335
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,197
Gone.

336
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:13,824
Gone where?

337
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,118
You from up here?

338
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,830
I lost 'em.

339
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,957
Lost them how?

340
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,594
Yeah.

341
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:35,971
You and the rest of us.

342
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,560
My baby girl's still struggling.

343
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,104
Her son's about the same age
as your little boy.

344
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,442
Pea?

345
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,195
Pea?

346
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,572
You can take the little room
on the second floor.

347
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,698
Yes?

348
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,534
Clear your things
from Sadie's old room. Mmm?

349
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,952
-Okay?
-Okay.

350
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,747
And like I tell all my tenants,

351
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,625
try anything, I keep a .44 ready.

352
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,337
Go show him where to go, baby.

353
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,463
Is this your house?

354
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,801
Ooh!

355
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,845
Mmm!

356
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,096
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

357
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,432
Mmm. Girl.

358
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,476
It's nothing.

359
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,311
Does that mean
I don't have to pay you?

360
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,481
Well…

361
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,442
Girl, I feel like something.

362
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,703
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Mm-hmm.

363
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,668
I can't even get it this time.

364
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,378
Where does the rent go?

365
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,712
That-- No.

366
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,674
Just leave it right there.

367
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,926
Got him.

368
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,302
Yeah.

369
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,346
Oh, no, wait.

370
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:03,016
- You ever see her?
- Who? Oh, Crystal?

371
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,351
Yeah, your daughter.

372
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:05,978
She, um…

373
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:10,357
She's cleaned up a few times.

374
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,651
That's a battle I can't fight.

375
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,488
She'll come home for good
when she's ready.

376
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,870
By the way,
if you're still looking for better money,

377
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:27,624
uh, a friend of mine
might have a job for you.

378
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,543
Really? Where at?

379
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,129
Cleaning staff for a nursing home
on Jamaica Avenue.

380
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,881
-In Queens?
-Yes, Queens.

381
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,340
That's, like, a two-hour train ride.

382
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,427
Well…
…do what you want.

383
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,096
Just don't waste anymore time
feeling sorry for yourself.

384
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,479
Your generation don't know
just how good you have it.

385
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,782
<i>Jaywalking is a fact of life here.</i>

386
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,784
<i>"No more," says Mayor Giuliani.</i>

387
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,828
<i>He plans to crack down on pedestrians</i>

388
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,039
<i>who cross where and when
they're not supposed to.</i>

389
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,916
I'll walk where I want to walk!
Motherfucker…

390
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,459
<i>Plan with me</i>

391
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,711
<i>to make the realistic changes</i>

392
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,839
{\an8}<i>that will actually make people's lives</i>

393
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,799
<i>better than they are right now,</i>

394
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,260
<i>and work hard with me</i>

395
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:24,097
<i>to apply these plans to improve our city.</i>

396
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,851
<i>Dream, believe,</i>

397
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,187
<i>plan and work.</i>

398
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,066
<i>This is the foundation
for the process of change.</i>

399
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,581
Say, "Hi, Mommy."

400
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,959
-Hey.
-Hi.

401
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,087
Tell Mommy what books we read today.

402
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,506
Hey, girl.

403
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,229
The dash is missing.

404
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:13,897
Huh?

405
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,734
Never mind.

406
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,410
Yo, how much they charge you?

407
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,580
-350.
-Okay.

408
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,123
You did good, babe.

409
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,169
How you like the job?

410
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:40,174
I miss doing hair.

411
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:45,971
He back in school yet?

412
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,223
Hand me a screw.

413
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,317
Got to get a copy
of his birth certificate and all that.

414
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,197
I, um, started applying too.

415
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,909
I'm going to Clark Atlanta in the fall.

416
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,787
-You leaving us?
-I wouldn't say it like that.

417
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:19,922
I'm happy for you.

418
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,340
You could go back too.

419
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:25,135
Even if it's part-time
or something like that.

420
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,680
Yeah, someday.

421
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:34,978
All right, baby.

422
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:38,607
You got cereal and milk.
Leftovers is in the fridge.

423
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,109
And don't heat it up
for over 60 seconds,

424
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,986
'cause if you do,
your mouth will get burnt.

425
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,906
And do not answer the door for anybody.

426
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:47,741
If the phone rings,

427
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:50,244
wait for the answering machine
to come on to see if it's me.

428
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,455
Okay?

429
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,417
I'll be back from work around 6:00.

430
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:07,970
Okay?

431
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,513
Be good, boo.

432
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:35,914
<i>Today the streets
are even more dangerous than you think.</i>

433
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,374
<i>You like flying?</i>

434
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,377
<i>I got something
that'll really make you fly.</i>

435
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,379
<i>So talk to your kids
about drugs, or…</i>

436
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,402
<i>Quincy Jones has made his mark in music</i>

437
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:08,405
<i>as a composer, conductor
and arranger</i>

438
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,699
<i>during a time
when it was almost unheard of</i>

439
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,327
<i>for a Black composer
to do a Hollywood movie.</i>

440
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:18,040
<i>The imagination's always been
a comfort zone, safety zone, really,</i>

441
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,418
<i>because it's something you can run to</i>

442
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,004
<i>and make it anything you want, really.</i>

443
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,318
This house look--

444
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,324
Everything okay?

445
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,374
Why nobody looking for me?

446
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,796
Because we made it too hard for them.

447
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,716
That was the whole point, remember?

448
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,056
Come here.

449
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:25,899
Hey.

450
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,531
Look.

451
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,534
I don't know what the fuck to tell you, T.

452
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,121
But there's more to life
than fucked-up beginnings.

453
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,085
You're not holding it right!

454
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,589
Hey, talk to me nice. I got this.

455
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,007
You ready?

456
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,717
You ready-ready?

457
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,848
Yeah!

458
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:00,017
You did it! You did it! You did it!

459
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,272
You gonna throw it all the way over--

460
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,236
Throw that thing better than that.

461
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,287
Now you just being lazy.

462
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,290
You ready?

463
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,709
Yeah.

464
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:27,711
Mmm.

465
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,549
Ooh!

466
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,259
Okay, yeah, you did it.

467
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,931
I never had my own room growing up.

468
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,099
You wanna try?

469
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,727
Who lived here before us?

470
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,563
I don't know. A bunch of immigrants.

471
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,899
-And before them?
-I don't know, baby.

472
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,984
We can go to the library
and look it up.

473
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,405
Down and up. Down--

474
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:06,834
Who's that?

475
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,881
This is me.

476
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:16,134
When I was first coming out
of the group home.

477
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,095
Cute little thing.

478
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,811
My body was a playground for
a thousand niggas before you came along.

479
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,229
That's nasty.

480
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,772
Hey, I got more of us,

481
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,233
but things get lost
when we moving around so much.

482
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,193
- Yo. Open up.
- Hold on, hold on.

483
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:35,445
It's Rudy.

484
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,866
-Hello.
-Hey.

485
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,665
My bad I'm late.
Some of the papers took longer to get.

486
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,625
What if he needs to go
to the doctor?

487
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,961
Just show up and say he's sick.

488
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,088
And I got one for the city
so it looks legit.

489
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:54,173
Okay.

490
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,384
Hotbox, numbers.

491
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,304
-Whatever you need, hit me up.
-Okay.

492
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,680
-Okay?
-Okay.

493
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,856
Okay, I went with Daryl,
last name Raymond.

494
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,233
We just moved in from Jersey.

495
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:15,527
Your middle name is Terry.

496
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,029
I don't like it.

497
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:21,867
Hi, Kim.

498
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:26,872
Daryl Raymond.

499
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,167
<i>…three, two, one. Now!</i>

500
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,600
That's him?

501
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,233
Why you standing there
looking scared?

502
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,281
Neighbor down the hall
walks him home for me after school.

503
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,661
Terry, I want you to meet Lucky.

504
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,126
Hey, Lucky.

505
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,129
What's up, little man?

506
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,799
Lucky's gonna be moving in with us.

507
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,802
For how long?

508
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:24,930
Damn.

509
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,061
Little nigga trying
to kick me out already.

510
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,312
Come here.

511
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,487
What's this cut on your face?

512
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,498
Let me get one for good luck, babe.
Let me get one for good luck.

513
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:52,749
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

514
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,878
You can get a shot. You want a shot?
You can get a shot. Go ahead. Take a shot.

515
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,839
Terry! Terry!

516
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,007
Yeah, get it, Pea!

517
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,592
- Pea, out! Pea, out!
- Out of my kitchen!

518
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:04,052
- Out of my kitchen!
- Look at the D! Look at the D!

519
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,846
Good job, Pea.

520
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,642
Shoot! Pass it. Pass it.

521
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,102
-Let me get another.
-No.

522
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,187
Pass it.

523
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,607
Want to go again?

524
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,527
What's wrong?

525
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,294
Where was he before?

526
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,839
How many times
you gonna ask me that?

527
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,007
Till I get an answer.

528
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,221
He belongs with his mother.

529
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,348
Nobody's even looking for him.

530
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,476
Course they're not looking for him
because they're looking for me.

531
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,229
And every other nigga round here
with a target on they back.

532
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,106
Hey, how many times
I been locked up for you, Lucky?

533
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,733
I just got out, man!

534
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,153
Trying to move on from all that shit.

535
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:06,240
Do you remember what it felt like
to grow up without a father?

536
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:12,412
Just want us to be a family. That's all.

537
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:15,958
That's not my fucking kid.

538
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,087
I just wanted you.

539
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,510
But you fucked up in the head.

540
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,263
Yeah, nuts for thinking
you would fucking understand.

541
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,139
I didn't sign up for this shit.

542
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,732
{\an8}"You are not a cow."

543
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,862
{\an8}"You are not a boat
or a plane or a snore."

544
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,530
{\an8}-"Snort."
-"Snort."

545
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,534
{\an8}-Stop.
-<i>"You are not a boat."</i>

546
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,703
{\an8}-"Or…"
-"Or a plane

547
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,538
{\an8}-or a snort."
-"Snort."

548
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,625
"You are my mother."

549
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:01,211
"You are a bird,

550
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,880
{\an8}and you are my mother."

551
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,298
{\an8}Yeah.

552
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:08,010
"And you are my mother.

553
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,596
And you are my mother.
And you are…"

554
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,013
I literally saw you look at her
with my own eyes.

555
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,975
Is it 'cause she lighter than me?

556
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,103
-'Cause her hair's nicer?
-You're too sensitive.

557
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,314
Well, then just be sensitive
to my sensitivity.

558
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,696
Where'd you stay this whole time?

559
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,075
Was posted up with Mike.

560
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,994
-That bike not hot, is it?
-No.

561
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,707
One.

562
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,754
All right,
I need another can of broth.

563
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,633
Come on, let me do that after the game.

564
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,552
No. Can you go now?

565
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,221
And why don't you take Terry with you?

566
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,080
How you doing, Lucky?

567
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,291
I'm good, 'Licia.
How you doing, shorty?

568
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,500
You should call me.

569
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:10,674
Do me a favor.

570
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:12,467
Walk on this side of me.

571
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,970
It's for your protection.

572
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,437
You always this quiet?

573
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:28,734
Sometimes.

574
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,069
And what you thinking about?

575
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,781
Well, it sounds like a lot.

576
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,620
How did you get that name Lucky?

577
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:43,624
Made a few mistakes, that's all.

578
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,251
That's a story for another time.

579
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:50,506
-And I'm a mistake too?
-Who told you that?

580
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,549
It's why you don't want me around.

581
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,634
That's not true.

582
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:56,970
You're a blessing.

583
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,264
For your mom especially.

584
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,017
Everything is just…

585
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,605
just complicated.

586
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:09,900
Aight? Come on.

587
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,580
How'd you get that one?

588
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,922
Guy cut me with a knife.

589
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,006
Why?

590
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,391
He wanted something I took.

591
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:00,617
You see this one right here?

592
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:02,870
See it?

593
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,623
On the East Side,

594
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,209
everybody hide they box cutters
right here.

595
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,128
It hurt?

596
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,090
Yeah, a little bit.

597
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,558
<i>HOT 97.</i>

598
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,319
Everything's changing.

599
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,654
A couple of years from now,

600
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:40,032
we're not gonna have to worry
about this at all.

601
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:59,009
What do two crooks know
about raising a family?

602
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:10,270
<i>Yeah!</i>

603
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,231
<i>Yes!</i>

604
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:13,774
Let me get a picture.

605
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,817
Girl,
he holding you like he love you, okay?

606
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,110
Terry, now!

607
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:20,322
And we on the block
right now celebrating.

608
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,950
Shout-out to the newlyweds,
Lucky and Inez.

609
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,577
- Yes, girl, show me the ring!
- Okay! All right!

610
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,456
What the ring like?

611
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,042
That's exactly
what we bringing here to the block.

612
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,418
Right here, right now.

613
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,879
Come get a plate. Come get a cup.

614
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,007
Come get whatever you need,
and come rock out with your boy.

615
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,175
Come here.

616
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:43,470
You look good, ma.
You look good!

617
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,098
T…

618
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:51,061
your mother's my wife now.

619
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,940
But I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart

620
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,608
that I'm here for the both of you.

621
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:00,737
We blood now.

622
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,659
You scared
I'ma take her away from you?

623
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,869
No.

624
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,622
Nobody's going anywhere,
from this point on.

625
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,626
I promise
to protect you and your mother.

626
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:16,837
You understand?

627
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:18,881
Yes.

628
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,092
We're gonna give you
the life that we never had.

629
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,638
Aight? You hear me?

630
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,307
Mmm?

631
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:31,768
Come here.

632
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,443
Up-up-up. There we go. There we go.

633
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,695
Girl, you got you a family now.

634
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:44,239
Whoo!

635
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:46,533
King of the world!

636
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:47,576
Aw.

637
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,578
We got to get this.
Hold on, hold on. Here we go.

638
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:50,871
- Wait.
- Look at the camera, T.

639
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,748
-Look at the camera.
-Ready?

640
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,874
Ah!

641
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:55,959
Say, "Family!"

642
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,169
Family.

643
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,177
I'm so happy for y'all.

644
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,069
Let me see.

645
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:41,672
What you want to hear?

646
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:44,758
That one.

647
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:48,428
<i>If Federal Court
lets new zoning laws take effect,</i>

648
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:49,513
<i>starting today,</i>

649
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,558
<i>42nd Street will have
to take on a different look, or else.</i>

650
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:54,977
<i>According to the mayor,
the crackdown on low-level offenses</i>

651
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,186
<i>is a quality-of-life issue.</i>

652
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,564
<i>If you change, in fact,</i>

653
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,607
<i>the true nature of the establishment,</i>

654
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:02,442
<i>then you probably have a defense
under the law.</i>

655
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:04,319
- Turn it up!
<i>- Today, at 11:00,</i>

656
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:06,154
<i>the police officer said
he sodomized Abner Louima</i>

657
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,447
<i>in the presence of another officer,</i>

658
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:09,658
<i>although, he did not implicate
any of the four other officers.</i>

659
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,244
<i>…there are serious questions
about police practice and race.</i>

660
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,162
- <i>A young African immigrant died…
</i>-Shit's fucked up!

661
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:16,790
<i>…when four plainclothes cops
shot him 19 times,</i>

662
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,542
<i>firing 41 bullets.</i>

663
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,336
<i>The shock waves are still
being felt in New York City tonight</i>

664
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,922
<i>following the acquittals
in the controversial trial.</i>

665
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:26,884
<i>An officer
is allowed to stop, question you,</i>

666
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,678
<i>if he develops any more suspicions,
he can frisk you.</i>

667
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,722
<i>So really, it should be described as</i>

668
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:35,100
<i>stop-question-frisk.</i>

669
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,356
Yer.

670
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,482
What up, T?

671
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,276
Yer.

672
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:47,571
How you been?

673
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,573
I'm not starting freshman year
without no pussy, B.

674
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,242
Light skin, fatty, exotic,

675
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,578
hair down to the ass,
no medium to hot breath…

676
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,704
Them shorties
don't want you.

677
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,707
No, nigga, that's standards.
Don't fault me for caring about my heart.

678
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:01,627
Go get that!

679
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,756
Nah. Nah.

680
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,424
-I'm good.
-"Nah." Keep not listening.

681
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,592
I am listening!

682
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,469
See how they respond
to that nice shit, man?

683
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:13,305
-What's good with that?
-I just got my own style.

684
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,516
Since when is "bum nigga" a style?

685
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,851
Hey, hey! You, you. Now.
Up against the wall, right now.

686
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,603
Yeah, just put your hands
where I can see 'em.

687
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,813
- Don't make any sudden move.
- Damn, bro.

688
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,065
Thought you looked older.

689
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:25,442
<i>Daryl can be a little aloof sometimes.</i>

690
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,277
He daydreams a lot.

691
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,197
But, overall, he's a very bright kid.

692
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,699
I was surprised to see
that you were his mother.

693
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:36,662
Most of our students here
aren't as articulate.

694
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,291
Oh, is that so?

695
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,628
To be honest, Mrs. Raymond, um,

696
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,881
I don't think Daryl belongs here.

697
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:52,928
Have you thought about applying
to the specialized high schools?

698
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:55,180
No.

699
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,683
I'd like you to meet Ms. Tucker.

700
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,017
Hi.

701
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,728
She's a counselor
at Tech, Science and Leadership.

702
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:04,648
I also run an outreach program
on the side

703
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,401
to get more students like Daryl
to take the test.

704
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,904
Would you be open to that, Daryl?

705
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,950
If they got girls.

706
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:20,497
A lot of the kids
go on to MIT, Harvard.

707
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,624
It might take some getting used to.

708
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,377
There wouldn't be as many minorities.

709
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,004
Ma, you know
the laundromat shut down?

710
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,006
Yeah. They sold the building.

711
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,591
So, where we supposed to go?

712
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:34,219
Go down to Ramirez.
What's a couple of blocks?

713
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,430
I don't like going over there.

714
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,390
Well…

715
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,810
We got stopped by the cops again.

716
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,315
Um, were they looking for someone?

717
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:47,399
I don't know.

718
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,401
Did they take your name?

719
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:51,278
No.

720
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,114
I'm just calling it out
so you know it ain't me.

721
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,952
Girl, and then
he talk about he want to move in.

722
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,621
I'm like, "Are you paying half the rent?"

723
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:03,040
-Hey, girl. How you doing?
-Hey, girl, what's up?

724
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:04,666
Hello.

725
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,543
Girl, so you know,
like, I'm a woman.

726
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,046
I shouldn't be paying rent
if a man stay here.

727
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,340
-You know what I'm saying?
-What's going on over there?

728
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:12,799
Girl, you know
they bought the building.

729
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:17,054
But anyway, girl,
what you think I should do, though?

730
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:19,890
You think I should,
like, split the rent?

731
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,183
Girl, I don't know.

732
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,435
Right, 'cause I ain't doing that.

733
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,985
- Ah!
- Scared me half to death!

734
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:33,987
-Here, let me get that.
-Anything else?

735
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:36,823
Mom, I'm hungry.

736
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,244
Well then, go to the store.

737
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,328
With what money?

738
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:43,455
I gave you money earlier this week, Terry.

739
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,165
Come on.

740
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:50,337
Look, I only got ten dollars to my name.
I'm giving you five.

741
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,464
Here.

742
00:52:57,469 --> 00:52:59,596
You thought any more about what she said?

743
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,140
-Who said?
-Your teacher.

744
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,393
Why does everything good mean
I got to go somewhere else?

745
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,562
Well…

746
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:10,941
You'll probably fit right in.

747
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:14,194
As soft as you are, I'd rather that
than you chasing after Pea.

748
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,697
Speaking of him,
I'm switching to the night shift

749
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,490
so I can be here after school.

750
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,159
Make sure you're not just running around.

751
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:22,661
What's up with you and Luck?

752
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:25,497
Excuse me?

753
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,249
Y'all not talking or something?

754
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,381
Stop trying to change the subject.

755
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,135
Listen.

756
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:41,013
I'm not saying you gotta go.

757
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,265
But at least think about it.

758
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,935
I'll buy you a new pair of Jordans.

759
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,481
In each portion,

760
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:54,234
you will have approximately ten minutes
per section…

761
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:25,098
You want me to pull up there
with you or something?

762
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,683
'Cause you acting mad-pussy right now.

763
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,237
Anything else?

764
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,072
Yeah, where can I call you?

765
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,991
Simone, quit playing!

766
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:46,411
-Aight, give me your name on AOL.
-"Unavailable222."

767
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:47,871
Wow.
So I can't even get to know you?

768
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:48,956
Yeah, get her, T.

769
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,000
Listen, there's nothing else
I need to know about you

770
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,878
or your little dirty-ass,
smelly-ass friend.

771
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,589
Stop acting like
we ain't doing you a favor, Midnight.

772
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,676
- Nappy-head ass.
- Next customer.

773
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:08,183
Knew you wasn't getting that.

774
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,227
I ain't tripping on her.

775
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,145
'Cause I already tried four times.

776
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,690
-Got to be a dyke!
-Shut the hell up, Pea.

777
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:17,025
That's why I want one
of them Indian-looking girls.

778
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,402
Shoot, they fire.

779
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,488
Let me see. Let me see it.

780
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:24,324
Oh, my…

781
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,827
You got into Tech?

782
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:28,912
I don't see the big deal.

783
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,665
Thought all I had to do
was prove that I can get in.

784
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:33,876
I changed my mind.

785
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:35,752
Well, I didn't! I ain't going!

786
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:39,715
Boy, you know how hard I'm busting my ass
to get you chances I never had?

787
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,843
You make me feel like a damn fool.

788
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:45,512
-Be a fool, then.
-Boy!

789
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:52,728
I need you to talk some sense
into him. Please.

790
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,443
Saying what, exactly?

791
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,528
That he should go
to a better school.

792
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:05,115
He doesn't want to be controlled.

793
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,409
Who gives a fuck
about what he wants?

794
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:08,869
What does he need?

795
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:11,288
I don't know.

796
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:22,299
Matter of fact, I do.

797
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:26,094
It's you.

798
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,514
Like how?

799
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,558
You're too tough.

800
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,314
Okay. What else?

801
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:38,774
I'm listening.

802
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,530
Maybe if you quiet down some…

803
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,076
he would actually hear
what you have to say.

804
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,498
Okay.

805
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,584
I don't even remember
the last time I raised my voice.

806
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,921
He'd do good at any school.

807
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:12,558
You used to like when I got spicy.

808
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,188
"Try and be quiet."

809
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:22,985
"You should try and be quiet."

810
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:24,236
Right?

811
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:27,698
Quiet like when
you went missing for weeks,

812
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,491
and I sat here and said nothing?

813
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,703
-And never mind who you was with.
-See, there it go.

814
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,914
If I get any more quieter,
I won't even have a fucking voice at all.

815
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,666
I'm not about to sit here
and argue with you.

816
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,794
That's real easy for you to say,
'cause you get to be the saint, right?

817
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:42,045
You get to be the saint,

818
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,089
while I'm stuck here
fighting these wars all by myself.

819
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:46,175
- See how loud you're getting?
- What…

820
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:48,802
-Well, then fucking show up for me, Lucky.
-Fuck this shit.

821
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,305
Show up for me!

822
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:02,774
I wonder what'd happen if I leave too.

823
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:19,750
You scared.

824
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,505
Something's gonna happen.

825
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,718
I can feel it.

826
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:33,013
I can feel it.

827
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:35,807
Did he tell you
he got stopped by the cops again?

828
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:38,227
A few times.

829
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,688
Then let him use his other name.

830
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,692
-He doesn't have an--
-That's not the fucking point, Lucky!

831
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:49,613
Shit. I don't know, aight?

832
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:52,199
They's bound to come any-fucking-where.

833
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,556
Take care of your moms, T!

834
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:18,267
Where Luck going?

835
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,769
And you-- I'ma say this one time.

836
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:22,729
You look at me when I'm fucking talking.

837
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:27,985
It's either you go to that school,
or you find somewhere else to live.

838
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,069
You hear me?

839
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:08,525
<i>…where to push
and where not to push.</i>

840
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:11,153
<i>But I'ma take but so much,
and she gon' take but so much,</i>

841
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:12,988
<i>so we compromise.</i>

842
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:16,783
<i>It works out for you guys.
So, you gonna get married or…</i>

843
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,870
- <i>Uh--
</i>-<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

844
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,038
<i>That's a whole 'nother show.</i>

845
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,789
<i>I'm sorry. You had a comment. Yes?</i>

846
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:24,750
<i>You say you do it for the attention.</i>

847
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,210
<i>There are other ways of getting attention.</i>

848
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:29,046
<i>Doesn't it cost you a lot of friendships
and relationships, being a bitch?</i>

849
01:00:29,129 --> 01:00:32,883
<i>Well, it has cost me a lot
of friendships and a lot of relationships,</i>

850
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:35,511
<i>but I find in life that sometimes,</i>

851
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,347
<i>having a friend in yourself
is better than having--</i>

852
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,890
<i>worrying about having people
as your friends,</i>

853
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:41,642
<i>'cause no one's
gonna look out for you but you,</i>

854
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,393
- <i>and I've learned that in life.

855
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,979
<i>I've looked out for people,
you know, but--</i>

856
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:48,899
<i>You seem to make some sense.</i>

857
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:52,027
<i>I mean, I'm saying,
I have friends now.</i>

858
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,905
- <i>They're bitchy like me, so we get along.

859
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,366
<i>We-- I'm serious.
We understand each other.</i>

860
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,701
- <i>And, like, I'm generous…
</i>-<i>They got a little dog pound.</i>

861
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:02,746
<i>Right. And I help--
I help out some of my family members,</i>

862
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,206
<i>as well as they help me.</i>

863
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,292
<i>But they also know
where to push my buttons</i>

864
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:09,753
<i>and where to go also, as Paul said.</i>

865
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:10,838
<i>Okay, yes?</i>

866
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,756
<i>I know I like to get what I want,</i>

867
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,424
<i>but I think there are other ways
to do that--</i>

868
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,093
<i>That only makes people…</i>

869
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,489
Come shoot some hoops with me.

870
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:38,949
I'm about to go to the store.

871
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,868
Come here.

872
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:48,625
You need some money?

873
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:50,419
-Ma gave me some.
-Here.

874
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:53,714
Take it anyway.

875
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:57,342
A man should always have some money
in his pocket.

876
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,681
So, um, where you been at?

877
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,694
I needed some time to clear my head.

878
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,871
Feels like it's been a lot longer
than that this time.

879
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,415
Y'all breaking up or something?

880
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:33,462
Want to shoot?

881
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,018
Your mother ever tell you how we met?

882
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,982
No.

883
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,778
She used to work at this coffee shop
that closed down a few years ago.

884
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,864
I used to get my hair cut
right across the street.

885
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:03,158
I'd go in,
I'd order me a bagel or whatever.

886
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,911
But I'm still not sure
how I'ma kick it to her.

887
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,622
And ended up telling her the truth.

888
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,627
That she was the most beautiful woman…

889
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,589
that I ever seen.

890
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,428
Were you nervous?

891
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,476
I just felt like she should know.

892
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,981
But something told me to go back, right?

893
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,609
This is when I had my other bike.

894
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:42,155
A few days later,
I said, "Let me take you for a ride."

895
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:44,992
We been rocking ever since.

896
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,004
T…

897
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:03,218
don't get caught up in none of this shit
that you see around here.

898
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:04,428
Have I ever?

899
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:08,807
Took me too long to learn that.

900
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:13,020
I don't want to see you fall into
the same traps as me and your mother.

901
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,026
I want you
to make better choices than me.

902
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,653
When it comes to her.

903
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:23,739
When it comes to everything.

904
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,121
I, uh…

905
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:35,334
I got into the specialized high school.

906
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:38,045
Oh, yeah?

907
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:41,465
-So what you gon' do?
-I don't know.

908
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:43,967
What you think?

909
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:45,385
It's not up to me, T.

910
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:49,515
You getting older now.

911
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:53,477
Time for you
to start thinking for yourself.

912
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:21,547
What?

913
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,637
I love you.

914
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:32,140
You hear me?

915
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,225
Yeah.

916
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,437
Check up.

917
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,946
Oh, got it.

918
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:51,118
Psst, psst.

919
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,744
Ayo, ma!

920
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,248
What are you doing here?

921
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,333
I can't walk with my lady?

922
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,143
-How was work?
-Good.

923
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:19,188
Good morning.

924
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:21,440
Yo, you remember what it's like
when we were coming up?

925
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:22,524
I remember.

926
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,694
You should be proud of yourself, Inez.

927
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:27,988
We made it.

928
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:36,955
You don't seem happy.

929
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:43,337
Think Terry resents me?

930
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,091
Teenagers hate everybody.

931
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,260
But I do sense a little void in him.

932
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:53,931
First couple years of his life,
he ain't had nobody.

933
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,808
Kid's still walking around here
with a broken heart.

934
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:01,939
Maybe it's time for y'all
to have that conversation.

935
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,984
Give him some of the answers
that he been looking for.

936
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,364
Yeah, I'll know when the time's right.

937
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:15,869
Um…

938
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:19,122
I was thinking,
when Terry goes off to school,

939
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:22,125
maybe I'll get to doing hair again.

940
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,961
Maybe open up a shop.

941
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:29,216
Can't wait.

942
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,228
<i>Thank you.</i>

943
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:46,191
<i>Citizens, I am honored
and humbled to serve</i>

944
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,403
<i>as the 108th mayor
of the city of New York.</i>

945
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,989
<i>As Toni Morrison has said,</i>

946
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,950
<i>"New York is the last true city."</i>

947
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:59,997
<i>And it is the vitality
of our neighborhoods that define us.</i>

948
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,623
<i>In the next four years,</i>

949
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:05,169
<i>I will devote myself
to building a better New York--</i>

950
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:06,420
<i>safe, strong</i>

951
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,840
<i>and ready to lead the world
in the 21st century.</i>

952
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:11,341
<i>Thank you.</i>

953
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:19,640
<i>I, Michael R. Bloomberg,
mayor of the city of New York…</i>

954
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:22,352
- <i>Do solemnly swear…
</i>-<i>Do solemnly swear…</i>

955
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:23,687
<i>That I will…</i>

956
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,904
So, um, which one you, uh…

957
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,240
which one you want to hear?

958
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,705
Let me hear that one.

959
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:44,041
It's mad old, though.

960
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,376
Old?

961
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,212
The fuck is The Delfonics, B?

962
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:50,046
Why don't you pass me
that one right there.

963
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,965
-Yeah, who?
-Yeah.

964
01:08:58,305 --> 01:08:59,389
What does it say?

965
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:04,353
The sample.

966
01:09:04,435 --> 01:09:07,731
Wasn't too old for the Fugees.

967
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:12,694
Yo, come on.

968
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,404
You don't even know your own taste.

969
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:17,407
Yo, these shits is, like,
mad random, though, like…

970
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:21,245
Yo, you deadass a old head.
Like, what are you talking about?

971
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:24,413
Cassettes in here. What's going on?

972
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:26,375
Come on.

973
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:29,837
T.

974
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:33,340
Hey, I want you to hang on to that.

975
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,971
That way, you can take your time
flipping through everything.

976
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:47,354
So, which college you decided on?

977
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:50,816
I don't know yet.

978
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,776
You should be more excited.

979
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,988
Nah.

980
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,950
-I am.
-Aight.

981
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:01,201
Well, go somewhere far.

982
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:03,537
You know, my era,

983
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,207
we ain't get those kind of shots.

984
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,209
Yeah.

985
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:11,170
Maybe.

986
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,548
Go on and show off
that legacy of Harlem.

987
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:25,392
Hi. I'm Jerry.

988
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:28,395
Uh, I'm your new landlord.

989
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:34,151
The lady across the hall said
that your husband has cancer.

990
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,402
Really sorry to hear that.

991
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,779
It's all right.

992
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:40,324
So you own those buildings
across the street too?

993
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:41,909
Yeah. Yeah.

994
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:45,329
Everything working okay?

995
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:48,790
Heat coming up?
Hot water? All that?

996
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:50,751
I actually just realized that, um,

997
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,504
I got a few loose tiles
around my shower area.

998
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,881
Oh! Yeah. Let's go look at it.

999
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,758
Uh-oh.

1000
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,928
Something happen here?

1001
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,347
Yeah.

1002
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:07,059
We tried to fix it a few times,
but it keeps falling off.

1003
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:10,896
-I can fix this for you.
-Really?

1004
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,232
Yeah.
This is no problem at all.

1005
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,859
Um…

1006
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,110
Wow.

1007
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,446
Maybe some new cabinets, too,

1008
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,449
because these have to be
at least 20 years old.

1009
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:25,494
-Have you met Javier?
-Who?

1010
01:11:25,577 --> 01:11:28,038
-Uh, the new super.
-No.

1011
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:31,208
Okay, let me see
when I can get my guys in here

1012
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,544
to take care of all of this,

1013
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:36,713
and then also your tiles, okay?

1014
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:39,299
-Thank you.
-Yeah. You got it. No problem.

1015
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:42,594
Hey.

1016
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,104
Anybody else come by?

1017
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:57,651
How you feeling?

1018
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,705
We talked about his schools.

1019
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:23,260
Simone,
can you wipe down 84 and 83?

1020
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:29,558
Try not to look so pitiful.

1021
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,828
We're here for the repairs.

1022
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,497
Thank you.

1023
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:59,213
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1024
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,054
- Uh, where at?
- Over there, to the right.

1025
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:08,639
I see.

1026
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:10,641
-See that one right there?
-There.

1027
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:08,574
Manna's. Simone speaking.

1028
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:10,200
Oh, uh…

1029
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,035
Si-- Simone?

1030
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,120
<i>Yes?</i>

1031
01:14:14,246 --> 01:14:15,497
Oh, um…

1032
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:17,457
Yeah, I just, um--

1033
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:22,629
Yeah, I-- I just wanted to let you know
I think you're the most, uh…

1034
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:29,553
well, you're the most, uh, beautiful girl,
you know, or whatever, you know.

1035
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:31,054
I was just trying to see if you…

1036
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:33,640
Would you please
stop fucking calling here? I'm working.

1037
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:39,188
Well, call me tonight, then.

1038
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:43,775
Fine.

1039
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:52,659
To stay or to go?

1040
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:56,663
Look. The whole sink is gone.
Look at the hole by the shower.

1041
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,666
It wasn't so big at first,

1042
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,753
but more fell down this morning.

1043
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,421
All we got left is the kitchen sink.

1044
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:08,217
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

1045
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:12,221
-Let me show you the kitchen.
-No, no, I already saw it.

1046
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:13,639
Um…

1047
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:19,019
Inez, this--
this is my… this is my mistake.

1048
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:22,189
The guys,
they thought this was a full flip,

1049
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:23,440
like some of the other units,

1050
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:26,401
so I'm happy to have them
come back in and finish up,

1051
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,362
and I won't charge you anything or…

1052
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:30,447
Okay, yeah, just let me know the day.

1053
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:33,450
I can stay home from work or Terry
could be here, if it's after school.

1054
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:37,162
Well, we'd actually need you to--
uh, to clear out of the apartment.

1055
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,122
'Cause there's--
there's just too much damage.

1056
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,291
I mean, everything's got to get lifted--

1057
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,376
Like how long?

1058
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,045
I mean, as long as it--
you know, until it's done.

1059
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:46,296
A couple months.

1060
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,131
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

1061
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:49,883
-Calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

1062
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,552
Like two adults, okay?

1063
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:54,137
There's no reason here to get loud.

1064
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,477
We have no bathroom,
no shower, Jerry.

1065
01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:04,857
We have no stove, Jerry.

1066
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:08,443
Is-- There's not, like, a family member
or a friend you could stay with?

1067
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,488
Look, this building is too old.

1068
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:13,156
I come in and fix something,

1069
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,118
I got to come back a couple months later
and do it again.

1070
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:19,162
You know, this way, we come in here,

1071
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:21,331
we replace everything all at once.

1072
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,709
There's got to be another option.

1073
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,419
Or you could leave.

1074
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:32,467
My hands are tied.

1075
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,887
Give me a call.
Let me know what you decide.

1076
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:43,145
Yo, why you ain't fight him on that?

1077
01:17:15,928 --> 01:17:17,054
Hey, yo, home.

1078
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:20,766
Can you walk
on the other side of me?

1079
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:22,726
Hmm?

1080
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,811
It's for your protection.

1081
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:28,982
Come on.

1082
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,166
Think you put enough?

1083
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,001
You know you want one.

1084
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:49,586
Mmm.

1085
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,214
Why you always acting all stank
whenever we come around?

1086
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:56,218
That's not a act. Your friends
are dumb as fuck, especially Pea.

1087
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,637
"What you gonna do about that kitchen?"

1088
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,181
"Damn, when you gonna eat
some more meals?"

1089
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:04,393
"Wow! What up, Midnight?"

1090
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:06,186
Aight, aight. I get it. I get it.

1091
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:09,773
I'm sorry. I know those are your friends.

1092
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,024
Is that how you act too?

1093
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:17,531
You see me here, right?

1094
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,326
I'm not here for anybody
trying to make me hate myself.

1095
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:28,000
So how'd you miss a year of school
and still end up at Tech?

1096
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,084
You like it?

1097
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,421
It's okay.

1098
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:35,382
Okay? And? What else?
What don't you like about it?

1099
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:40,429
I don't know. Just don't.

1100
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:44,057
There's nothing wrong
with being smart, you know.

1101
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,560
We could use a few more engineers
around here.

1102
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,395
I just don't care
about none of that, though.

1103
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:50,397
Okay. So, what you want to do?

1104
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:52,566
Oh.

1105
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:56,028
I mean, I like a lot of things, you know.
Uh…

1106
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,990
Right now, I'm-- I'm into music.

1107
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:01,909
You want to rap?

1108
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,535
Nah. Like…

1109
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,371
Like, uh…

1110
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:10,000
You ever seen <i>The Wiz</i>?

1111
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:11,502
Yeah.

1112
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,545
Yeah, like, stuff like that.

1113
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,508
This Black dude, uh, Quincy Jones,

1114
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:21,512
he, uh, did the whole score
for the movie, you know.

1115
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:23,347
Did some other movies too.

1116
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:26,850
Like a composer.

1117
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:29,186
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,023
PS, I know who Quincy Jones is.

1119
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,776
You should be in some art school.

1120
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:38,195
You could go to Juilliard.

1121
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:40,072
I can help you figure out what it takes.

1122
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,282
No.

1123
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:45,118
Kids trying to get in there
have been training for years.

1124
01:19:45,202 --> 01:19:46,703
Well, where'd Quincy Jones go?

1125
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:51,792
He didn't go to school.

1126
01:20:12,145 --> 01:20:13,480
I want to see you again.

1127
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:18,652
I should be honest with you. Um…

1128
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,030
I'm moving in a couple weeks.

1129
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:24,157
To my uncle's in Florida.

1130
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,328
This white guy
was trying to help us save the house,

1131
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,080
but took the deed or something.

1132
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,084
But we can keep in touch, though.

1133
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:37,171
I'm gonna miss Harlem.

1134
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,050
<i>What's her name?</i>

1135
01:20:42,134 --> 01:20:43,844
I don't know what you talking 'bout.

1136
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,181
So who's the girl
I saw you hanging out with?

1137
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:48,682
Just a girl, Ma.

1138
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:50,309
Well, is she your girlfriend?

1139
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:55,022
Come on.
You know I like Spanish girls, Ma.

1140
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:57,232
Pardon me?

1141
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:00,986
What, she look too much like you
for you to take seriously?

1142
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:04,281
You know what, little boy?

1143
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:07,534
I love you. I really do.

1144
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:10,454
But I'm starting not to like you anymore.

1145
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:29,765
Now, what's this all about?

1146
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:32,476
Showing up late, not handing in your work.

1147
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:33,936
Something's on your mind.

1148
01:21:36,522 --> 01:21:38,315
I said I'm fine.

1149
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:40,859
What's going on with college?
You make a decision yet?

1150
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:45,405
Daryl?

1151
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:51,787
-Not yet.
-And why's that?

1152
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,580
You discuss it with your mother?

1153
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:56,500
Yeah.

1154
01:21:57,543 --> 01:21:58,544
A little.

1155
01:22:03,257 --> 01:22:05,509
You know this is a safe place.

1156
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:14,101
How have things been at home
since your father got worse?

1157
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:22,234
They, uh… They don't think
he's gonna come home.

1158
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,447
I'm sorry to hear that.

1159
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:36,290
I think the landlord's trying
to push us out or something.

1160
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:44,798
Do you wanna come work
with me at CCA?

1161
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:48,135
I run the after-school program.

1162
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:51,471
Part-time, a few hours.

1163
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:55,100
How much it pay?

1164
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:56,685
Enough to help.

1165
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:01,231
You do good, we'll work
on something better this summer.

1166
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:05,027
I don't need working papers from you
since you're turning 18 soon.

1167
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:08,197
Just ask your mother for
your birth certificate and Social, okay?

1168
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,374
Um…

1169
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:22,169
Thank you, Ms. Tucker.

1170
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:23,921
I'm happy to help.

1171
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:30,177
Yo, Ma!

1172
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,277
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1173
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:30,153
Okay, breathe.

1174
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:34,867
Okay, okay. Okay.

1175
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:39,079
Maybe you should try
and eat some food.

1176
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:41,832
Yeah?

1177
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:43,625
-I'm not hungry.
-Okay.

1178
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,097
Why do you love me?

1179
01:24:59,057 --> 01:25:01,143
The same reason everybody does.

1180
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:05,898
That's not an answer.

1181
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:11,195
I wanna know why.

1182
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:14,114
You should, um…

1183
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:18,035
You should probably stop talking
and get some rest, okay?

1184
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,629
I never really knew where it came from.

1185
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:35,052
Or whether or not…

1186
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:43,101
whether or not I deserved it.

1187
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,483
Maybe that's why I never…

1188
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:54,780
I never fully gave it back.

1189
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:58,951
Now I wonder…

1190
01:26:01,537 --> 01:26:03,330
I wonder if it's too late.

1191
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:09,086
Damaged people
don't know how to love each other.

1192
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:11,755
That's all.

1193
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:54,298
T, sit down.

1194
01:26:55,716 --> 01:26:57,926
I need to talk to you
about a few things.

1195
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:13,859
Um…

1196
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:18,197
Before Lucky got sick, we wanted to
have a conversation with you about…

1197
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,823
I don't wanna talk to you about Lucky.

1198
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:20,949
It's not about him.

1199
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:23,368
Yo, I don't wanna talk to you
about anything!

1200
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,871
Yeah?

1201
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:30,751
Only thing I ever wanted more
than a mother was a fucking father!

1202
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,300
Maybe…

1203
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:43,180
Maybe if you--
if you weren't so hard on him,

1204
01:27:43,263 --> 01:27:44,848
walking around here
so miserable all the time,

1205
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,600
he'd still fucking be here!

1206
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,646
Hmm.

1207
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:00,572
You don't mean that.

1208
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:47,953
Yo, Ma.

1209
01:28:49,246 --> 01:28:51,456
-Ma.
-What?

1210
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:55,252
This lady over there,
she keep looking over here.

1211
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:56,420
Who is that?

1212
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:01,967
That's Lucky's daughter
and her mother.

1213
01:29:04,803 --> 01:29:06,346
Make 'em a plate.

1214
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:08,682
She's what?

1215
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:11,351
We'll talk about it later.

1216
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,181
Fuck!

1217
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:54,436
-Terry!
-Ma, what happened?

1218
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,812
Come move this stuff!

1219
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:59,024
One of the pipes!

1220
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:00,108
I-- I got it!

1221
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:02,945
Ma! Yo.

1222
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:04,238
Come on, come on.

1223
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:21,755
Sweetheart.

1224
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:25,926
You seen Javier?

1225
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:28,136
-Who?
-The super.

1226
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,347
Oh, um, not since yesterday.

1227
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:32,099
Sorry.

1228
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:44,987
Daryl, we need to talk.

1229
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,613
Your paperwork was denied.

1230
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:49,199
What?

1231
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:52,202
The Social Security number
you gave me isn't valid.

1232
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,371
I'm glad I caught it
before somebody else did.

1233
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:57,583
Yeah-- I-- I forgot. It-- It expired.

1234
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,960
That's not how it works.

1235
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:05,048
So, then wh--
That mean, like, I don't get the job or…

1236
01:31:05,132 --> 01:31:07,217
Well, before I can even look
into any of that,

1237
01:31:07,301 --> 01:31:10,512
we need to sort out
how you ended up with phony papers.

1238
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:12,723
Did you really ask your mom?

1239
01:31:16,143 --> 01:31:18,228
She don't-- She don't have 'em.

1240
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:20,772
You're from here, right?

1241
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:24,651
-What you mean?
-Born in the States.

1242
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:28,864
Yea-- Yeah. Nah, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:33,035
Well…
…this could mean a lot of hell for you.

1244
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:35,204
To get a job, to do anything.

1245
01:31:35,287 --> 01:31:38,373
I mean, it's still probably, you know,
like, with the city.

1246
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,502
From when I was in foster care.

1247
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:45,005
Huh.

1248
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:51,887
Oh, I have a friend
down in Social Services who can help.

1249
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:53,931
No, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

1250
01:31:54,014 --> 01:31:55,933
It's all good. It's all good.
We just-- It's all good.

1251
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:57,768
Hey, Janice.

1252
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:01,230
Listen, I need a favor.
I have a student here whose paperwork is…

1253
01:32:01,313 --> 01:32:03,857
Hey, no, no.
Hey, yo, yo, Ms. Tucker, come on!

1254
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,320
It's all-- It's all good.

1255
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:12,366
Um…

1256
01:32:14,326 --> 01:32:17,120
They-- They don't--
They don't know I'm with my mother.

1257
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:18,413
-You know?
-And why is that?

1258
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:20,082
Who are you supposed to be with?

1259
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,961
-Um…
-Have you told anyone else about this?

1260
01:32:26,046 --> 01:32:28,715
-Nah.
-Is Daryl your real name?

1261
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:33,554
If you lied on your college applications,
it's a felony.

1262
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:34,805
It's Terry!

1263
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:44,690
It's-- It's Terry Wallace.

1264
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:51,446
How long ago did this happen?

1265
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:57,035
When-- When I was little.

1266
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:00,873
I was a social worker for years.

1267
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:05,294
If the city didn't want to give you back,
it's likely because something happened.

1268
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:08,463
Regardless of what,
you are still a ward of the state.

1269
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:10,340
By law, I have to report this.

1270
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:13,177
No. Do any of that even matter, though?

1271
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,804
You know, I'm finna be 18
in a few weeks, you know, so…

1272
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:17,055
I can't keep this to myself.

1273
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:19,641
I have to speak with your mother.

1274
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:35,282
-Can I talk to you?
-It'd be nicer if you could help.

1275
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:38,785
-What happened?
-What does it look like, Terry?

1276
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:41,914
Called the super ten times
since yesterday.

1277
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,833
It's about the job with Ms. Tucker.

1278
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:48,670
She, um-- She want
my birth certificate and my Social.

1279
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,506
The real ones.

1280
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:51,965
What do you mean, the real one?

1281
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:54,176
The papers I found in your room,
they didn't work--

1282
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:56,470
What do you mean, the papers you found
in my room? You went through my stuff?

1283
01:33:56,553 --> 01:33:58,805
-Why wouldn't you ask me?
-I didn't know I had to!

1284
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:03,936
She want to come by tomorrow evening
and talk to you.

1285
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:05,020
For what?

1286
01:34:05,103 --> 01:34:07,856
Well, I mean, I don't know.
What was I supposed to say?

1287
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:17,324
I don't know how the hell
we gonna get ahold of those.

1288
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:24,790
Come with me outside. I…

1289
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:27,417
I need to smoke.

1290
01:34:28,502 --> 01:34:30,420
Starting to smell in here.

1291
01:34:43,684 --> 01:34:45,060
You wanted to leave me.

1292
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,981
No.

1293
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:51,692
No, Ma.

1294
01:34:52,609 --> 01:34:54,361
Why would you say something like that?

1295
01:34:56,822 --> 01:34:57,823
Forget it.

1296
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:04,872
What time
your teacher coming tomorrow?

1297
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:07,875
Around 6:00 or something. I think.

1298
01:35:16,049 --> 01:35:17,092
T, you should probably see

1299
01:35:17,176 --> 01:35:20,679
if you can stay with Pea
and Miss Annie a little while,

1300
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:22,973
till they finish working on the apartment.

1301
01:35:28,228 --> 01:35:29,438
Where you gonna go?

1302
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,233
I'll figure it out.

1303
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:37,905
I'll go to your school tomorrow

1304
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:42,242
and get everything straightened out
with Ms. What's-Her-Face.

1305
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:02,471
Yo, Ma.

1306
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:15,943
Yo, hey, Titi. What's up?

1307
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:18,320
Um…

1308
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:20,864
Yeah, you-- you heard from my mother yet?

1309
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:28,622
Nah, I been--
I been trying to call her all morning.

1310
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:30,165
No, she, um…

1311
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,417
Yeah, just, um…

1312
01:36:34,586 --> 01:36:37,297
Yeah, just give me a call back
when you-- when you do.

1313
01:36:44,972 --> 01:36:46,849
Hey, y-yeah.

1314
01:36:46,932 --> 01:36:49,101
Yeah, Aunt Kim. Hold on. Let me…

1315
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:52,062
Hey, no, let, uh--
let me give you a call back.

1316
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:59,528
Hi, Terrance. Is your mother home?

1317
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,446
Um…

1318
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:03,490
N-- No.

1319
01:37:04,408 --> 01:37:05,784
She left for work already?

1320
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,330
Yeah, um, I think so.

1321
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:16,128
Do you mind if we come in
and talk for a bit?

1322
01:37:17,045 --> 01:37:18,088
Uh…

1323
01:37:19,006 --> 01:37:21,508
Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1324
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:23,468
Thank you.

1325
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:26,555
-This is Anne.
-Hey.

1326
01:37:26,638 --> 01:37:29,975
And this is Officer Philips.
Officer Russo.

1327
01:37:30,851 --> 01:37:32,102
May we have a seat?

1328
01:37:33,562 --> 01:37:35,480
How long ago did she leave?

1329
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:38,692
Yesterday evening.

1330
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:41,778
What was the last thing
she said to you?

1331
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:44,114
Did she say anything
out of the ordinary?

1332
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:46,033
Anything unusual?

1333
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:50,204
Well… not that I remember.

1334
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:52,789
Everything seemed fine.

1335
01:37:52,873 --> 01:37:54,249
Excuse me, sir, could you--
could you--

1336
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,127
could y'all, you know,
not go through all our stuff?

1337
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:59,796
Terrance, we really need
your cooperation on this.

1338
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,132
Uh, she, like, gonna get in trouble
or something?

1339
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:05,135
You know, 'cause, I mean,
you know, why does it even matter?

1340
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:07,721
I mean, you know,
I'm almost 18, you know, so.

1341
01:38:09,473 --> 01:38:10,599
Um…

1342
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:12,518
Well, about that.

1343
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:17,731
It's difficult for me to say
what I have to say right now.

1344
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:21,902
Inez…

1345
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:25,072
is not your biological mother.

1346
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,702
N--

1347
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,413
Like some joke or something?

1348
01:38:33,497 --> 01:38:34,748
No, it's not.

1349
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:43,966
This is the woman who abducted you.

1350
01:38:46,844 --> 01:38:49,930
Whatever story she told you
was just a lie that she cooked up.

1351
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:54,810
I am so sorry
you have to find out like this.

1352
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:57,020
Are you sure
you don't know where she is?

1353
01:38:57,104 --> 01:38:58,272
Any ideas at all?

1354
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:01,817
Give him some room, please.

1355
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:08,031
For now, we need to focus on
what's best for Terry moving forward.

1356
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:09,700
What's best for me?

1357
01:39:09,783 --> 01:39:12,244
He doesn't have any known relatives
that we can trust.

1358
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:13,871
That's all right.

1359
01:39:13,954 --> 01:39:16,415
We can place him at Sheltering Arms
for the time being.

1360
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,710
It's a family services program. It's…

1361
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:21,003
I know what it is.

1362
01:39:21,086 --> 01:39:24,840
Just for a couple of weeks,
until we can navigate next steps.

1363
01:39:28,594 --> 01:39:30,345
If that's all right with you.

1364
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:34,892
I don't know if your parents
are still on the street,

1365
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:36,643
but we can work on that.

1366
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:40,522
Everything was such a mess back then.

1367
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:45,319
In my office, the only record
you had on some kids was…

1368
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:48,655
just an index card.

1369
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:57,289
Hello?

1370
01:39:58,165 --> 01:39:59,875
Terry, is that you?

1371
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:02,544
<i>Yeah. Y-- Titi--</i>

1372
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:07,216
I stopped by the group home, but
nobody seems to know where you are.

1373
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:08,800
<i>I'm at-- I'm at a pay phone.</i>

1374
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:11,261
<i>I can't stay there.</i>

1375
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,846
You want to meet me back here?

1376
01:40:13,931 --> 01:40:16,266
<i>I want you to come stay with me.</i>

1377
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,435
-Yeah.
-<i>Okay.</i>

1378
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:21,063
<i>I think you should
stop by the house first,</i>

1379
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:23,815
pick up any last things
you might want to take with you.

1380
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:27,611
Yeah.

1381
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:30,155
-<i>I'll see you soon, baby.
</i>-Okay.

1382
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:33,659
Okay.

1383
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:10,904
-Ma?
-Hey, Terry.

1384
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:17,786
What you-- What you doing?

1385
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:20,247
I left some things.

1386
01:41:21,081 --> 01:41:23,125
Look, don't stand over there
looking over me.

1387
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:26,378
I'm sure they already got to you,
so feel free to run along.

1388
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,675
Can we talk, though?

1389
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:33,594
Talk about what?

1390
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,013
You serious right now?

1391
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:41,602
Fine. You want to talk, let's talk.

1392
01:41:50,944 --> 01:41:52,446
Fetch me my Newports.

1393
01:41:54,406 --> 01:41:56,742
-You was just over there…
-Over on the stand.

1394
01:42:10,756 --> 01:42:12,090
What you want me to say?

1395
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:14,551
That I fucked up?

1396
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:16,386
Yeah, T, I fucked up.

1397
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:17,721
But life goes on. So what?

1398
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:19,306
Well, as long as it's your call, right?

1399
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:21,433
Who was the one who made the choice,
standing in that hospital?

1400
01:42:21,517 --> 01:42:23,185
-Was it you or me?
-Thinking you was my fucking mother!

1401
01:42:23,268 --> 01:42:24,603
Lower your fucking tone!

1402
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:27,981
You better watch
how the fuck you talking to me.

1403
01:42:30,317 --> 01:42:31,318
Did Lucky know?

1404
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:38,408
Yes, he knew.

1405
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:42,579
He didn't agree with it, but he knew.

1406
01:42:43,747 --> 01:42:45,832
Why? Why you do it?

1407
01:42:51,672 --> 01:42:53,382
I don't know why I did it, T.

1408
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:56,093
It was something small
that turned into something else.

1409
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:58,011
And that's supposed
to make it right or something?

1410
01:42:58,095 --> 01:43:00,013
Who made you the chief
of right or wrong?

1411
01:43:01,223 --> 01:43:03,141
You don't think I have feelings too?

1412
01:43:03,225 --> 01:43:06,687
After all those years I took care of you,
who the fuck was there to take care of me?

1413
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:09,606
I stood up for everybody else!
What the fuck was it for?

1414
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:12,276
Every chance you had,

1415
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:14,903
every chance you had,
you turned your back on me!

1416
01:43:14,987 --> 01:43:16,864
-That's not true.
-Oh, please.

1417
01:43:16,947 --> 01:43:19,366
Nobody else give a shit about Black women
except for other Black women,

1418
01:43:19,449 --> 01:43:21,368
and even that shit get messy.

1419
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:30,210
Who heard me when I was hurt?

1420
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,047
It wasn't you.

1421
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:36,466
And it damn sure wasn't Lucky.

1422
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:38,135
But you were my mother!

1423
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:43,056
Mmm? Now, how am I supposed to feel?

1424
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:04,244
I need to know what was real.

1425
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:21,595
I never left you on that corner.

1426
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:26,642
I was the one that found you.

1427
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:35,275
Little two-year-old
running around outside the shelter.

1428
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:42,699
I waited outside on that block
for hours with you.

1429
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:47,538
Waiting for anybody to show up.

1430
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:52,334
I saw so much of myself.

1431
01:44:55,295 --> 01:44:58,465
I just… I just wanted
to look out for you.

1432
01:45:00,884 --> 01:45:03,220
I didn't want you getting chewed out
like I was.

1433
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:08,058
I seen somebody who needed me.

1434
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:09,226
But…

1435
01:45:10,269 --> 01:45:12,813
But maybe I'm the one who needed you.

1436
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:15,774
And, T, for that, I'm sorry.

1437
01:45:17,651 --> 01:45:19,611
I'm… I'm sorry.

1438
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:25,993
I tried to change.

1439
01:45:28,912 --> 01:45:32,165
But I don't-- I don't want it.
I don't want this.

1440
01:45:33,834 --> 01:45:37,296
Not if… Not if it's built on a lie.

1441
01:45:39,006 --> 01:45:43,343
Not if being loved by you or anybody else
means not loving myself.

1442
01:45:46,054 --> 01:45:48,390
They not gonna let you get away with it.

1443
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:49,683
I ain't going to jail.

1444
01:45:50,392 --> 01:45:52,978
I already know what the fuck
they gonna say anyway.

1445
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:54,605
Already know. And guess what?

1446
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,648
I don't give a fuck.

1447
01:45:56,732 --> 01:45:58,233
Because I still won.

1448
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:00,944
I won.

1449
01:46:01,987 --> 01:46:04,698
Because I know you gonna grow up
to be somebody.

1450
01:46:09,328 --> 01:46:11,997
I wish I didn't know.

1451
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:18,629
I wish-- I wish you could've did a better
job of keeping that lie to yourself.

1452
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:22,925
I wish it could've continued
so that we could've continued, and I…

1453
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:28,472
I wish I knew how to be better to you

1454
01:46:28,555 --> 01:46:31,141
so you didn't feel like
you had to leave me alone.

1455
01:46:34,978 --> 01:46:36,396
'Cause I'm scared.

1456
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:42,653
I'm scared
that I won't have no home no more.

1457
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:45,489
And one day I'm gonna show up,

1458
01:46:45,572 --> 01:46:48,158
and it's gonna feel like
we ain't never happened.

1459
01:46:49,993 --> 01:46:51,411
Ma!

1460
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:54,373
Like this wasn't our living room?

1461
01:46:55,999 --> 01:46:57,167
Our home?

1462
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:03,590
I miss my bed, Ma.

1463
01:47:08,595 --> 01:47:10,597
The one that you made for me.

1464
01:47:20,107 --> 01:47:21,817
Where's home for me now?

1465
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,745
This isn't goodbye.

1466
01:49:40,831 --> 01:49:44,084
I promise. This isn't goodbye, T.

1467
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:47,087
I promise.

1468
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,012
I love you, Ma.

1469
01:49:58,932 --> 01:50:00,142
I love you.

1470
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:06,648
I think you should go.

1471
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:09,628
Okay, miss. Where to?
