1
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,242
I'm right here, please!

2
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:33,743
I need your help, I'm in here!

3
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:39,342
-My God, what happened?
-I don't know.

4
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,277
He came in.

5
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,343
He sat down,

6
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,610
and he shot himself.

7
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,141
Serial killers.

8
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:50,842
No, it won't sell.

9
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,342
All I'm saying is that
why can't the Titanic

10
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:56,342
rise from the depths
and sail again?

11
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,909
Okay, we've made up some
real shit stories before,

12
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,775
but this one takes
the fucking cake.

13
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:02,875
I have to put my foot
down Mark, no way.

14
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,041
Oh come on, Jen.

15
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:05,910
Okay, fine.

16
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:08,509
Reptile Boy!

17
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,209
I can't believe I'm still
writing about this fucking shit.

18
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,175
Well, it's better
than the Titanic gargle.

19
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,377
Are you serious?

20
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:20,676
Okay, I have this.

21
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,610
I know okay but,

22
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:26,008
I'd really think
it would be cool

23
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,875
if we did an expose
on serial killers.

24
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,376
-Okay, I have all this stuff.
-No.

25
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,909
I have things on the
Coney Island Slayer,

26
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,842
and I'm not talking about
just the Teardrop Killer.

27
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:36,643
Okay, I've compiled
all this info

28
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,708
with the help of my sister on,

29
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,008
I have things about
the Slaughter sisters,

30
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,041
okay the Kentucky
cannibal family.

31
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,510
I mean, look at this
guy, look at his picture.

32
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,109
When you read the article
this is really good stuff.

33
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,509
This is what pays the bills.

34
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,309
Mark, just go with me on this.

35
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,209
Okay, we've been doing this
tabloid crap for five years.

36
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,141
I mean, really don't you
think it's about time

37
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,443
that our work count
for something more than

38
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,277
supermarket checkout lines
and bathroom reading?

39
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:10,443
Okay,
I'll tell you what.

40
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,142
I'll go with you on this
but we have one week

41
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,675
to get a cover story
to the "Midnight Star".

42
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,009
Okay, what do we got.

43
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:23,176
-Titanic.
-Reptile Boy.

44
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,376
Come on.

45
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,809
It's a little hokey,
heart-throbbing,

46
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,444
people will think of Leonardo
DiCaprio, Kate Winslet,

47
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:33,444
-steamy car sex.
-Crazy car sex.

48
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:35,310
Fine.

49
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,876
I can't remember the last
time I had crazy car sex.

50
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:42,443
Okay anyway,
you know there's been

51
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:46,008
this huge rise in the last
year of unsolved homicides.

52
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,810
I really think this is our time.

53
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,209
It's a sign.

54
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,009
Is this what you do late
at night when I'm sleeping?

55
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,509
Yeah, this and masturbate.

56
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,176
Okay anyway, I've got
all this information.

57
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,443
If we can just help
me organize it, like,

58
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:03,177
into sections and liner notes,
that would be so fantastic.

59
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,008
You know, if you were ugly,

60
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,543
I'd say no fucking way.

61
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:13,008
Well, good thing I
have the looks then, huh?

62
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,041
And the brains.

63
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:14,876
Well, I don't know about that.

64
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,876
Are you gonna eat that?

65
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,543
I just want two of these here.

66
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,876
No, help yourself.

67
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:22,210
Looks good.

68
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,242
-What's up, Legs?
-What's going on?

69
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,575
Nothing much.

70
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:36,544
I got two weeks
left in this place,

71
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,008
-and I'm out.
-Really?

72
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,343
I got six months.

73
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,509
I can't wait to get outta here.

74
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,343
Jack.

75
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,842
No, has Jimmy got the stuff?

76
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,875
Alright, cool. Can be
here in 15 minutes.

77
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,343
Alright, love you, too, bye.

78
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,409
Yeah, if you
want me to be happy

79
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,809
-to see me?
-Awesome.

80
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,075
-Have you seen Chino?
-No, why?

81
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,042
It's time for my shot
and he has my insulin.

82
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,842
Why in the hell did you give
that crackhead your insulin?

83
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,543
He's not a crackhead,
he's just misunderstood.

84
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,008
-Come on, let's go find him.
-Alright.

85
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,609
Girl, I swear to god.

86
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,842
I'm telling you, Clarence,

87
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:16,276
you're gonna get
hooked up today, man.

88
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:17,177
I'm making this Puerto
Rican thing called sancocho.

89
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,675
Mwah, my mama, man.

90
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:20,876
I can.

91
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,410
Right.

92
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,708
Ooh, check this out.

93
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,010
Some of these homicides
are pretty close to home.

94
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,009
Six months ago,
there was a slaying

95
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,675
just outside the
State Fairgrounds.

96
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,243
Three girls were
butchered limb from limb.

97
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,075
Oddly enough, when they put
the bodies back together,

98
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,443
some of the parts didn't match,

99
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:56,409
which means there
was a fourth victim.

100
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,176
However, there were
only enough bits

101
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,210
to put three girls
back together.

102
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:04,875
Where the fourth victim
went, no one knows.

103
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,276
Fuck!

104
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,043
Yeah, Spaulding had mentioned
something about that.

105
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:13,742
Fuck you, come on
mother, fucker!

106
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,775
Maybe some people are born
like, bad apples, you know?

107
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,143
Too many long hugs
from Uncle Johnny?

108
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:24,110
Don't worry, little
boy, it'll be alright.

109
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,842
But what makes them tick?

110
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,177
What causes them to do it?

111
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:41,043
Are you even listening to me?

112
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,075
Yes, I'm listening.

113
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:45,276
I don't get much time

114
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,476
-to do this, you know.
-Shut up.

115
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,608
Oh shit.

116
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:25,443
Hey man.

117
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:27,643
Dang.

118
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:54,442
So nasty.

119
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,876
You should come
look at this stuff.

120
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:59,276
Fuck, fuck.

121
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,942
What's up, cracker?

122
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,176
Cracker?

123
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,276
Who you callin'
cracker, cracker?

124
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:04,110
You.

125
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,375
Hey so Sarah, how
is it in the clean?

126
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,775
Usual bullshit, man.

127
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:13,242
They're trying to pin a B&E.

128
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,442
Remember the last time,

129
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,309
Dave broke into the
liquor store last week?

130
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,142
Shit girl that was shady.

131
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,910
I saw all the
liquor in his room.

132
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,176
Motherfucker.

133
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,042
No wonder they knew
that stuff was here.

134
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,475
They caught me on the scene
of the crime, fuckin' cops.

135
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:30,708
Whoa ho, nice man!

136
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,843
Hey, kid's park is across
the street, alright man?

137
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:34,975
What, pissed off 'cause
the kids didn't leave you

138
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,243
a piece of cake or something?

139
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,810
Hey shitheads, remember me?

140
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:55,276
Girl who needs a shot?

141
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:56,076
Fork it over?

142
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:09,009
Hey, you two stay right here.

143
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,642
-Good idea.
-Don't you go

144
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:11,643
running away on me now.

145
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,243
Ugh, shit, fuck!

146
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,043
Fuck!

147
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,009
Oh my god, they
even have a picture

148
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,176
of that bloody teardrop
that he drew on the wall.

149
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,910
Since then, 168 cases
have been related

150
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,776
to the Teardrop Killings.

151
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,110
No other evidence
has ever been found.

152
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,877
The fuck?

153
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:20,476
Fuck.

154
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,643
Oh fuck, fuck!

155
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,844
Go!

156
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,341
Come on, come on!

157
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,375
Come on, you fucker!

158
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,443
Fast, fucker!

159
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,010
Fuck.

160
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:42,575
Shit.

161
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:43,476
Shit, shit!

162
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,110
Fuck, oh.

163
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,176
Fuck.

164
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:29,475
The local investigators
did find trace evidence

165
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,844
of a grease paint.

166
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,542
That was the only thing
out of the ordinary.

167
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,110
I don't get it, grease paint?

168
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:58,142
God, no.

169
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:05,043
Please, don't, leave me...

170
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,142
Please don't.

171
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:12,176
Please!

172
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:14,375
Please don't!

173
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:17,176
Please, please!

174
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:56,242
Holy shit, I just mopped here!

175
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:00,443
Shit, what happened here?

176
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:03,709
You crazy clown bastard!

177
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,877
I just mopped these floors!

178
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,910
If you're gonna rub one
out, can I at least watch?

179
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,208
If you
did a few of these,

180
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,544
you might get a girlfriend.

181
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:24,476
Well let's see, there's a
sexy girl doing Jazzercise

182
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,476
in her panties in
my living room,

183
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:28,175
so I'd say the only
thing we have to do

184
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:31,308
to solidify this relationship
is have some crazy monkey sex

185
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:32,509
and we call it good.

186
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,543
If you
did a hundred of these,

187
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,811
I'd do you in the shower.

188
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:40,476
If I did a hundred of those,

189
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:41,811
you'd have to do
me in the hospital.

190
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,643
By the way, should
I get you a bib?

191
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,576
You love my saliva.

192
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:56,576
Hey, I did some
researching last night.

193
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:57,544
Oh, you're kidding.

194
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:59,709
No, I did some,

195
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,576
I found, I found this--

196
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:07,341
It's that right there.

197
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,308
Oh my god.

198
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,643
Ah, you're a bastard.

199
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,209
Don't worry, I'll get you back.

200
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,843
I swear to God, if
you do that again,

201
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,342
I'm gonna shit on your pillow.

202
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:26,910
Nice.

203
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:35,009
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

204
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,443
It's your big sis.

205
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:42,009
FBI is calling.

206
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,609
Oh wow, there was
a brutal slaying

207
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,009
at a local halfway
house right up the road.

208
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,242
We need to go check it out.

209
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:54,109
So, put your pants
on and let's go.

210
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,208
Duncan!

211
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,544
What's up buddy?

212
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,242
How are you doing?

213
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,443
Mark, you know I
can't let you in.

214
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:12,644
-Duncan!
-Jennifer, on the other hand,

215
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,142
well that's a different story.

216
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,909
How's my favorite
reporter doing?

217
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,141
You know we're not
gonna touch anything.

218
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,141
The bodies are already gone.

219
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,509
Nothing left to see.

220
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,175
Come on, crime scene's
not even here yet.

221
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,075
There's gotta be
something to look at.

222
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,643
You guys know I
can't let you in.

223
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:31,777
What do you got?

224
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,409
-Jackson.
-Franklin.

225
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,643
-Garfield.
-The cat?

226
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,476
Ha ha, funny.

227
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,342
-Just give him the 50.
-No!

228
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:45,643
-It's for the video game.
-Video game or crime scene?

229
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:46,477
Come on!

230
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:52,009
Hold my camera.

231
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,709
-Hope you're happy.
-Ecstatic.

232
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,008
She's gonna take your report.

233
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,577
I'm gonna go look around.

234
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,141
-Hey!
-What?

235
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:10,242
I'm just going inside.

236
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,609
Not a word of this Spaulding.

237
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,544
Oh never.

238
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:21,276
Hey, maybe we should get
a cup of coffee sometime.

239
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:24,041
Yeah sure.

240
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:24,876
Mmhmm.

241
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:42,974
Hey.

242
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,543
Jesus Christ!

243
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,242
Don't you knock before
you come to a place?

244
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:48,743
-Scared, little baby?
-No.

245
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,342
-Hmm.
-A little bit, yes.

246
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:52,875
Maybe a little.

247
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,141
Let's get outta here.

248
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:58,410
-Did you get enough?
-Yeah.

249
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:05,309
So did, uh, Duncan
have anything to say?

250
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,008
Besides asking me out
on a date, not much.

251
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,008
Although he did say there were

252
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,610
two more people unaccounted for.

253
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,142
Huh.

254
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,276
Jack?

255
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,875
Jack!

256
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:21,709
Jack, wake up!

257
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,176
We have to get out
of here!

258
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:28,842
-Jill?
-Jack!

259
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:31,443
What, what, what is it?

260
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:32,675
What's happening?

261
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:35,109
Jack, I'm so cold.

262
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:41,477
My legs, my legs are
so cold.

263
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:43,509
Don't worry, baby.

264
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,243
It'll, it'll be
okay, don't worry.

265
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,109
Jack, Jack, what is it?

266
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,544
I love you, I love you!

267
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:01,008
You mean, if we can get
free, we can make a run for it!

268
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,009
-We--
-Sure!

269
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:07,109
Don't, don't worry baby,
we'll get outta here.

270
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,243
We're gonna be okay.

271
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,409
-No!
-Don't you touch her!

272
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,909
Don't you touch her!

273
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,910
Jack!

274
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,074
Well, maybe they
spent the night somewhere else,

275
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,209
got a hotel.

276
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,376
Well if they did, lucky them.

277
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,543
I just don't see how
they could afford it

278
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:32,842
by the look of the
clientele here.

279
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,109
You're just saying that

280
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,042
'cause there's blood
and guts everywhere.

281
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,809
I'm telling you, if you slapped

282
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,709
a fresh new coat of
paint on this place,

283
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,609
it's good as new.

284
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,009
Should we continue, smart ass?

285
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,009
-Yes.
-Which way?

286
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,277
That way.

287
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:00,643
Oh, my god, Mark!

288
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,277
Fuck is going on?

289
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,041
You guys doing a sweep?

290
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,142
I'm sorry, sweetie.

291
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,642
What the fuck is going on?

292
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:11,909
What the hell?

293
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,242
I didn't know there was
a little girl in there!

294
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,309
It was a clown, he
was killing everybody!

295
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,543
I'm sorry baby,
I'll keep you safe.

296
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:19,675
You guys need to be a
little more thorough, man.

297
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,109
Man, I'll call dispatch

298
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,642
and get someone over
here right away, alright?

299
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:26,008
-He was killing everybody!
-Don't worry, sweetie.

300
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,009
You'll be safe now.

301
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:37,410
No, not Jack!

302
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:45,910
Jack!

303
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,543
-Fuck you, fuck you!
-Jack!

304
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:56,177
No!

305
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,842
Please!

306
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,110
Please, please.

307
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:04,075
I'll do whatever
you want, please.

308
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,076
I'll do anything you want.

309
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:15,876
No, no!

310
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:24,843
No!

311
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:35,708
No!

312
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:38,209
Mom, I'm going out
for a little bit.

313
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,342
You look like a clown.

314
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:45,142
-I like clowns.
-Where are you going?

315
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:46,642
Just going out with
girls for a little bit,

316
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:49,276
get some drinks and who knows?

317
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:50,875
Well, you be careful
out there honey.

318
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,542
There's a lot of
lunatics out there today.

319
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,642
Mom, it's not the
lunatics I'm worried about.

320
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,142
It's the sane people.

321
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:59,010
They're the ones who
need the ax to the head.

322
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:55,643
Take a look at this.

323
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:59,009
So, I've been doing
cross references

324
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,475
on circus and carnival runs

325
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:03,742
against times and locations.

326
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:06,542
-Okay, did you make this?
-Yes.

327
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,376
It's pretty awesome.

328
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:11,708
-Okay.
-Well,

329
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,042
how come the police
haven't figured this out?

330
00:28:14,043 --> 00:28:15,010
I have no idea.

331
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,877
Have you seen the police work?

332
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,442
They're fucking idiots.

333
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:21,642
-Duncan is a retard.
-I'm serious.

334
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,209
I don't know, any
of those related?

335
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,508
-They connected in any?
-Yeah but only two,

336
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,308
Roxanna Dugan and
Tracy Greaston.

337
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,341
-Okay.
-Roxanna was murdered.

338
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,009
Tracy identified her body.

339
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,110
They were like best
friends in 1985.

340
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,643
I don't know, here read this.

341
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:42,276
They joined some
traveling circus.

342
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,443
The police found the body
of Roxana Dugan in the woods.

343
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:55,009
According to the reports,

344
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,042
she's the first real victim
of the Teardrop killings.

345
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:57,877
Huh.

346
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,375
Interesting.

347
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:03,308
You should call your
sister, she's a fed.

348
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,608
She might be able
to help us out.

349
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,042
Yeah.

350
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:06,877
Oh fuck!

351
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:10,844
-I got this.
-What?

352
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,810
I stole it off
the registration desk

353
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:15,042
-at the halfway house.
-What is it?

354
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:17,109
It's a list of
all the residents.

355
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,743
Maybe we can cross-reference
it to any of the murders

356
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,542
that have happened in the past.

357
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:23,076
Maybe someone is connected
to some of these people.

358
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,342
See, this is why I love you.

359
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:29,710
I know.

360
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,110
Oh and by the way,

361
00:29:33,543 --> 00:29:35,776
I looked up the circus boat
that was listed on the report.

362
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,241
-Mmhmm?
-And some of them

363
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,009
live in Gibsontown.

364
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,910
He's got
unfinished business.

365
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,709
And I bet you this Tracy chick,

366
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,542
I bet you she's in Gibtown.

367
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:46,910
You know, that explains
why the murders happened

368
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,542
every few months up
and down the coast.

369
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:53,575
Yeah well, the circus
does go from town to town.

370
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,010
Wait, Faye is a carny.

371
00:29:56,276 --> 00:30:00,043
Well, a little girl
did say she saw a clown.

372
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:06,341
The circus does
start in three days.

373
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,075
You know what, in the morning,

374
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,342
let's go out to Gibsonton,
see what's what.

375
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,877
In the meantime, I'm
gonna take it dump.

376
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,844
Sounds hot.

377
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,075
Damn.

378
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,476
Hey, hey wake up!

379
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,810
Wake the fuck up,
wake the fuck up.

380
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:42,142
Oh shit, oh shit.

381
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,644
So, let me get this straight.

382
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:47,175
This guy's been
killing for 20 years,

383
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:49,911
lays waste to an
entire halfway house

384
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,577
and nobody knows anything.

385
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,209
I don't get it, what's the deal?

386
00:31:57,677 --> 00:32:00,577
You know, Tracy Greaston
has been missing since 1985.

387
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,876
There's like a million
people missing in America.

388
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:05,108
He could have killed
here years ago

389
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:06,376
and put her under a rock.

390
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,442
Okay, that was my sis.

391
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:22,643
Not like you speak
Greek to everybody.

392
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,341
Okay, my sis said
she and the FBI

393
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,008
have little to
nothing on the guy.

394
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,643
They haven't heard anything
about any kinda clown,

395
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:31,241
so I guess we have
the upper hand,

396
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,008
but she did say we
should go check it out.

397
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:34,877
You know, just in case.

398
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,009
Well, this place looks like fun.

399
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,477
Can't be too bad,
it's carny folk.

400
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:34,042
-What can I do you for?
-Hey.

401
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,175
Where would one go
to find the locals?

402
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,444
What do you mean?

403
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,141
Well, we're looking for
some information on a clown.

404
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:48,376
Just because we're a circus,

405
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:50,208
do you think we
know every clown?

406
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,609
Fuck you pal.

407
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,141
No, I'm sorry,
you're mistaken.

408
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:56,343
We're trying to put
a connection together

409
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,109
-with the Teardrop Killer.
-What are you, FBI?

410
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,309
Oh, no sir, we're
just reporters.

411
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,041
-What paper?
-A local one.

412
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,008
All papers are local.

413
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:13,509
-What's the name, darling?
-"Midnight Star".

414
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,376
-Isn't that a tabloid paper?
-Yes, yes it is.

415
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:19,543
Well hell darlin',
why didn't you say so?

416
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,008
I can't take a good shit

417
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:23,075
without having one of
them on the crapper.

418
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,309
Well, that's a good thing.

419
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,743
Tell you what, you see
that park over there?

420
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:32,576
-Uh-huh.
-You need to talk to Drago.

421
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:34,443
He can set you in
the right direction.

422
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,277
-Number two.
-Number two.

423
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:38,875
Okay great.

424
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,141
Alright excellent,
thanks, appreciate it.

425
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:44,041
Alright, if you get
lost, come on back.

426
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:46,643
We end up with all
the strikers here.

427
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,476
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay, great.

428
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:50,776
P.S., sucker's knee
is every New Year's Eve.

429
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:55,310
Well.

430
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:58,242
You wanna hoof it?

431
00:36:58,243 --> 00:36:59,610
Yeah, I could use a walk.

432
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:10,008
-So, he say number two?
-Number two,

433
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:12,108
not that I see any
numbers on any of these.

434
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:15,009
-Yeah, I don't see anything.
-I see names.

435
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,009
Excuse me, I'm
looking for a Drago.

436
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,243
-Are you Mr. Drago?
-Wait a damn minute.

437
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,708
Can I help you?

438
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:46,141
Yeah, I'm
looking for a Drago.

439
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:48,609
-What do you want?
-Well really,

440
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,074
we just wanna ask
him some questions.

441
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,243
I don't know a Drago.

442
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,909
Come on, man, it
will only take a minute.

443
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,009
I'm not going
to jail for this.

444
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,377
Jump on back, go!

445
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,141
We're
going the wrong way!

446
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:11,310
What in the hell
is Frodo's problem?

447
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:15,577
Come on, Mark!

448
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:20,243
-Mark, look out!
-Come on!

449
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:26,810
Arghh!

450
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:31,210
Fucking cheating as
hell, mother fucker!

451
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:33,910
Oh, shit!

452
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:44,743
Ugh, ugh, ugh!

453
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:48,577
That little fuckin'
bastard can run.

454
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:53,342
-Tell me about it.
-My stomach hurts.

455
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:55,109
I think I'm gonna shit my pants.

456
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:00,143
Come on, let's find him.

457
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:10,676
-Ugh, ah!
-Shit!

458
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:16,743
Damn it!

459
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:21,543
-Damn!
-Fuck!

460
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:23,708
-Yeah man.
-Drago!

461
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,642
We're reporters, not the police,

462
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,008
if that's what
you're worried about.

463
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:27,810
Drago!

464
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:32,343
Fuck, alright I've got to shit.

465
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,510
-Drago!
-I don't see him.

466
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,775
Fuck!

467
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,109
Drago!

468
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,675
-We just wanna talk.
-Yeah, man.

469
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,143
I was right on his ass.

470
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,041
Not the police, huh?

471
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,875
Sure look like the
fucking police to me!

472
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:55,509
-We're reporters.
-Yeah, right!

473
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,876
We work for
the "Midnight Star".

474
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,975
Oh, so why didn't you say so?

475
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,642
What the fuck you
doing up there?

476
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,042
I'm looking for your ass.

477
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,443
Well, in case you
haven't noticed, I'm short.

478
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:18,810
Next time you're looking
for a dwarf, stay low.

479
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,576
How can I help you?

480
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:24,242
Well, we've come
to the understanding

481
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:25,809
that you might have
some information

482
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,109
-on the Teardrop Killer.
-Teardrop Killer?

483
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,242
I don't know nothing about
a Teardrop Killer, lady.

484
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:34,443
Well, we've heard that
there's some kind of connection

485
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,176
-with him in this area.
-Sorry, lady, I have no idea.

486
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:38,742
Hey, man, you made me
come all the way out here

487
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:41,675
chase your ass for a fucking
mile not to get any answers.

488
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:42,974
So you got two choices.

489
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,708
One, you give us something,

490
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,409
or two, I'm gonna shove
your ass into a coal truck.

491
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,542
Coal truck?

492
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:50,443
What is this, 1933?

493
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:52,043
Engines run on gasoline now.

494
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:57,942
-Whatever, give us something.
-Yeah, come on man.

495
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,775
I'll tell you what.

496
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:03,409
Give me some time,
I'll go ask around,

497
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,142
and if you guys
come back tomorrow,

498
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:06,809
and then we'll do lunch.

499
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,142
You can't help us out?

500
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,708
He wants us to
come back tomorrow.

501
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:12,875
What, fine.

502
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,642
Come back tomorrow,
and then we'll do lunch.

503
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:17,575
-Fine.
-Fine, fine!

504
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,142
Whatever.

505
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,809
Hey, can you
guys find your way back?

506
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,643
Fuck you.

507
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:33,009
-Your coffee.
-Thank you.

508
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,410
You're welcome.

509
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,376
-Coffee, there you go.
-Thanks.

510
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:40,142
-No problem.
-Damn it!

511
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:43,143
I don't wanna wait an entire
day to check this out.

512
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,643
We need to find some
more evidence, something.

513
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:50,143
Well, we can contact
that Tracy woman.

514
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,642
Yeah,
that's not a bad idea.

515
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,343
She might be able
to help us out.

516
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,142
Good to see you
again, how you doing?

517
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,075
-Good, how are you.
-Good.

518
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:04,708
-Good to see you.
-Alright.

519
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:07,242
-There it is, guys, huh?
-Yeah.

520
00:42:07,243 --> 00:42:09,075
As you can see this
place has been vacant

521
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,309
for quite some time.

522
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,009
That's why we came down
so much on the price.

523
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,376
When's the last time
you were out here?

524
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:17,242
Honestly it's gotta be
probably but a year ago,

525
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,142
but as you can see the
place is well used,

526
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:22,376
so you guys should be able
to get comfortable on it.

527
00:42:22,377 --> 00:42:23,809
-Is the power still on?
-Yeah.

528
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,542
Yeah we keep it on for people
that wanna look around.

529
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,009
When was this
place built, you know?

530
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,408
The early
1900s, actually.

531
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:30,708
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

532
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,276
It's been around for a while.

533
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:35,109
-It's got character.
-Character?

534
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,176
-What do you think, William?
-Don't really care.

535
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:39,575
So, as you guys
can see this place

536
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:41,575
is absolutely sound, you know,

537
00:42:41,576 --> 00:42:43,910
-structurally at least.
-Yep.

538
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,242
But, I gotta go
make a phone call,

539
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,209
so if you guys wanna
just take a look around,

540
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,742
-I'll meet you out front.
-Sounds good.

541
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,775
-Alright, thanks, guys.
-See you in a bit.

542
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,642
Oh yeah, Michael, where's
this door lead over here?

543
00:42:53,643 --> 00:42:56,209
That's the water works, just
pipes and stuff like that.

544
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,508
I don't usually go down
there, it kinda freaks me out.

545
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:01,010
-Have a look see.
-Alright.

546
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,143
Whoo.

547
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:11,509
Oh!

548
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:18,009
Fuck, it smells like piss,
piss and dead animals.

549
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,843
Yeah, these assholes wanna
go look in the basement,

550
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:22,176
so probably gonna be here
about another half hour.

551
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:24,176
Then I have that
lunch then with Lucy,

552
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:26,643
so probably not gonna be
back in the office today, so,

553
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,642
but their file is in a
blue folder on my desk,

554
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:33,109
so if you can take it--

555
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,709
What the fuck!

556
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:04,643
-That's probably Mike.
-Yeah.

557
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,177
-I'll find you, okay?
-Okay.

558
00:44:17,743 --> 00:44:18,576
Mike?

559
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,010
Mike?

560
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:35,342
What the fuck are
you supposed to be?

561
00:45:57,744 --> 00:46:00,308
I think we have
some issues to deal with.

562
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,575
Yeah, like those
fucking nosy FBI guys.

563
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:05,142
Those weren't FBI, trust me.

564
00:46:05,143 --> 00:46:06,076
How do you know?

565
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:08,341
Because when the FBI walks in,

566
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:10,676
they flash their
badges at everything,

567
00:46:10,677 --> 00:46:14,009
you, me, Fido,
your potted plant,

568
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,009
even the fucking fridge.

569
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,375
Well, all I know

570
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:18,876
is they were asking about
the Teardrop Killer.

571
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,443
Well, we don't know any
Teardrop Killer, do us?

572
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:25,009
Look, we ain't got
nothing to give them.

573
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,275
I'm sorry but they're
gonna have to write about

574
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:31,642
fish boy or the
truckstop girl this week.

575
00:46:31,643 --> 00:46:33,009
And what if he comes for us?

576
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,876
Gurdy's not coming back to us.

577
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,109
Easy for you to say.

578
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,208
You wasn't dragged in
the middle of all this.

579
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,676
But then Gurdy, we took
care of that long ago.

580
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:43,743
Well, it's someone who knows
an awful lot about Gurdy,

581
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:44,876
'cause he's sure
doing the things

582
00:46:44,877 --> 00:46:46,475
that Gurdy would have done.

583
00:46:46,476 --> 00:46:48,443
Gurdy's
been dead 20 years.

584
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:51,009
Okay, you know what, fuck it.

585
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,009
If you're so sure
that he's dead,

586
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,475
then why don't you just tell me

587
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,175
everything that needs to
know about Luther Baxter.

588
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:56,910
What do you
mean, "If I'm sure?"

589
00:46:56,911 --> 00:47:00,009
-Forget it.
-God damn it, Drago.

590
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,876
20 years we've kept Johnny
Law out of our business.

591
00:47:03,877 --> 00:47:08,141
Justice was done, eye
for an eye, carny law.

592
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:10,042
Well, if Luther
Baxter is dead,

593
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:11,643
then who is wanting him back?

594
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:13,042
The murders have never stopped.

595
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:15,709
Maybe, but they
ain't never come home.

596
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,009
Well right now,
too close to home,

597
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,109
too close to Tracy's home.

598
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:26,275
Okay, I think I found her.

599
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,810
There's like six Tracy Greastons,
but all unlisted numbers.

600
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:31,876
Well, if you were almost
killed by a crazy serial killer,

601
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:33,542
wouldn't you wanna not be found?

602
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:36,743
-Yeah, good point.
-Yes, thank you.

603
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:38,341
Well, let's get started.

604
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:40,509
I wanna get out to Hell's
Hideaway before it gets too late.

605
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,577
What the fuck?

606
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:23,409
Luther!

607
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,543
Hey there, lady, looks
like you need a ride.

608
00:48:36,544 --> 00:48:39,743
Maybe, where you headed?

609
00:48:39,744 --> 00:48:41,375
Wherever you wanna go.

610
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,009
Wherever you're
driving, honey.

611
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,242
Well, hop in.

612
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,844
What's wrong?

613
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:11,743
Never seen a pretty girl before?

614
00:49:11,744 --> 00:49:14,409
What, no, I mean yes.

615
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:16,677
Don't worry.

616
00:49:17,844 --> 00:49:18,677
I don't bite.

617
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,309
You seem nervous.

618
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:25,309
I can help.

619
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:28,544
So are you a working girl?

620
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:33,509
Just drive, loverboy.

621
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,176
I know a place we can go,
it's up ahead on that road.

622
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:37,844
Alright.

623
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:45,242
I guess that's a no.

624
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,844
I guess so.

625
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:09,709
Luther, wait, wait, Luther.

626
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,910
Before you kill me, I
got something for you.

627
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:15,477
Don't kill me, I got something.

628
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,009
She's still alive.

629
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:37,209
Go on, take it.

630
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,042
Well, why don't you
tell me what you want?

631
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:15,142
-Do you like what you see?
-Oh yeah.

632
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:21,876
Hey!

633
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:25,811
All good things come
to those who wait.

634
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,042
Oh come on, baby.

635
00:51:33,544 --> 00:51:35,108
There's no one here.

636
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:37,074
She obviously doesn't live here.

637
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:39,910
It's a T-shirt shop.

638
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,842
-Where to now?
-Three down, two to go.

639
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:45,644
Awesome.

640
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:48,743
-Alright.
-One more stop.

641
00:51:48,744 --> 00:51:50,009
Let's go.

642
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:01,142
-Cross that off the list.
-Yeah.

643
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,509
Hurry, come quick,
you missed him.

644
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,444
Who, Drago?

645
00:52:11,445 --> 00:52:12,509
Did he take off running again.

646
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,776
-No no no, he was here.
-Fuck!

647
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:18,343
It's a mess, man, it's a mess.

648
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,009
Mark, the keys.

649
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:30,141
Hey, fucker!

650
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:32,743
Can you kill the
bright lights in here?

651
00:52:32,744 --> 00:52:34,576
I have one hell of a headache.

652
00:52:34,577 --> 00:52:37,709
Jesus, Drago, are you okay?

653
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,677
No, I'm not okay.

654
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:44,008
-Wait, he didn't kill you?
-No, but he should have.

655
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:47,008
-Well, why didn't he?
-Hey, hey, hey!

656
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:48,609
-Thanks a lot, lady.
-Well, that's not

657
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,610
-what I meant.
-Don't push it.

658
00:52:52,142 --> 00:52:54,142
I gave her up so that
he wouldn't kill me,

659
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:56,809
not that he would have anyways.

660
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,108
Gave who up, Tracy Greaston?

661
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,509
What, how do you know her?

662
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,875
Well, we didn't
know, but now we do.

663
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:06,743
We just cross-referenced
our asses for about a day.

664
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:09,008
You two, y'all
should be detectives.

665
00:53:09,009 --> 00:53:10,276
-I told you.
-Okay, wait.

666
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:12,443
What do you mean
you gave her up?

667
00:53:12,444 --> 00:53:13,909
Y'all two don't
get it, do y'all?

668
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,241
-Get what?
-The Teardrop Killer

669
00:53:16,242 --> 00:53:18,709
is Luther Edward Baxter,

670
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,409
also known as Gurdy the Clown.

671
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,809
That little girl said
she saw a clown that night.

672
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,610
Yeah he's a clown.

673
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:26,742
She changed her
name to Samantha.

674
00:53:26,743 --> 00:53:29,342
We meant Tracy
about 20 years ago.

675
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:31,309
They said that they
wanted to go into circus.

676
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,074
Tracy she, she liked the Gurdy,

677
00:53:33,075 --> 00:53:34,610
and Roxy,

678
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:37,041
she liked Ralphio.

679
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:39,276
You know Ralphio, he
was our strong guy.

680
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:43,208
He was charming and the
ladies really loved him.

681
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:44,042
They really did.

682
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:46,709
And I think that's
one of the reasons

683
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,108
why Tracy and Roxanne, that's
why he joined the circus.

684
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:51,609
You know if you ask me,

685
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,708
they were just wanting to bang
their way up the East Coast,

686
00:53:55,709 --> 00:54:00,276
but anyway Tracy
took a liking to Gurdy.

687
00:54:00,277 --> 00:54:01,543
That's when the
shit hit the fan.

688
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:03,677
You see, Tracy and Gurdy,

689
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:06,377
they hooked up one night.

690
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:10,843
And Roxanna that bitch, she
hated Gurdy from the beginning.

691
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,643
She got jealous and
came screeching,

692
00:54:14,644 --> 00:54:16,842
yelling something
about a rape something.

693
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:20,409
And of course the first one
she ran into was Raphael.

694
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,875
-Gurdy is raping Tracy!
-What?

695
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:24,309
He's over this way, come on!

696
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:27,008
Of course Ralphio, the
big strong macho guy,

697
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:30,141
and the both of them they
steamrolled over to the tent.

698
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,509
Ralphio, he went all monkey nuts

699
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,309
and started beating up on Gurdy

700
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,409
without giving him
a chance to explain.

701
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,074
Well later that night,

702
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,543
Gurdy, he got he
got even-Steven.

703
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:43,342
The first one to bite
the big one was Roxanne.

704
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:45,008
That bitch had it coming.

705
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:50,009
She had it coming.

706
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:53,743
And then, Ralphio,
yeah he got it,

707
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:58,342
stabbed right to the
back of the head.

708
00:54:58,343 --> 00:55:00,708
At that point, Gurdy and I,

709
00:55:00,709 --> 00:55:03,108
we both knew that he
had to leave the circus.

710
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:04,543
He had to get out of town.

711
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:05,709
Ralphio was very liked.

712
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,342
The circus was not
gonna be the same

713
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:09,477
without the strongman.

714
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,443
So later on that night, we
got him out of here alright.

715
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,409
Haven't seen him since.

716
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,342
You know, he can never really
stay away from the circus.

717
00:55:18,343 --> 00:55:22,342
Every time that we
traveled, he's there.

718
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:24,742
We may never see
him, he's there.

719
00:55:24,743 --> 00:55:26,342
Is he on her way to
her house right now?

720
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:27,709
I have something for you.

721
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,544
-It may not be too late.
-What is it?

722
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:47,008
-When did he leave?
-About 30 minutes ago.

723
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,176
Fuck, call Spaulding.

724
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:50,543
Tell him to meet us at
Tracy Greaston's house.

725
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,074
There still may be time.

726
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:54,476
Well, we could be too late
for the whole fucking thing.

727
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:57,042
Drago, you might wanna
think about hiring a maid.

728
00:55:58,009 --> 00:55:59,577
This fucking place is atrocious.

729
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:05,642
Hey, if you
guys find out anything,

730
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:08,376
I got a midnight
show at the circus.

731
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:09,909
Great, thanks.

732
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,410
-Ugh.
-Take care of yourself.

733
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:19,210
Give me back the--

734
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,009
Put me down, let me go!

735
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:22,776
Let me go!

736
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:26,009
Get off of me!

737
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,776
Get off!

738
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:44,476
What the hell is this?

739
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:10,277
It looks like the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

740
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,310
Does it, Daddy?

741
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,142
Hey buddy, no sleeping.

742
00:58:31,143 --> 00:58:34,709
Aw fuck, there
goes my lunch hour.

743
00:58:38,509 --> 00:58:39,343
Tracy?

744
00:58:41,343 --> 00:58:42,143
Which door?

745
00:58:51,843 --> 00:58:54,076
-It's locked.
-This one too.

746
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:01,743
Ms. Greaston!

747
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:07,210
Nothing.

748
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:16,276
I don't get it.

749
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:17,609
There's a TV on.

750
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,543
Look, door is open.

751
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,609
Should we go in?

752
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,010
You go.

753
00:59:49,143 --> 00:59:50,010
Now we go in.

754
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:59,076
-Nice move.
-Thanks.

755
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:08,676
-Shit, why'd you do that?
-I'm sorry!

756
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:11,476
Wait, is she dead?

757
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:15,042
She's not doing the cha-cha!

758
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:16,675
Well, you don't know, check!

759
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:18,243
Well do I look like an EMT?

760
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,742
Okay.

761
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:37,743
-Call Spaulding.
-Right.

762
01:00:58,943 --> 01:01:00,675
Hey guys, you have
a nice night tonight.

763
01:01:00,676 --> 01:01:03,341
Drink that shit,
man, chug that shit!

764
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:05,276
That's what's up, dude.

765
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:31,843
Well, looks like we got
some catching up to do,

766
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:33,576
doesn't it, Daddy?

767
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,542
Listen guys, I really
appreciate all the help,

768
01:01:38,543 --> 01:01:40,009
but if any of the
higher-ups find out

769
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,142
that you two snooped around
at the halfway house,

770
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:45,009
we're all gonna be
in trouble, okay?

771
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,576
This just means there's a
serial killer on the loose.

772
01:01:48,643 --> 01:01:49,910
Really?

773
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:51,308
Yeah, this is the
seventh case we've had

774
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:52,608
just like this one.

775
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,475
We had one other day
and now two tonight.

776
01:01:55,476 --> 01:01:58,209
-Oh, well that's interesting.
-Mmhmm.

777
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,777
Excuse me, I've
gotta get inside.

778
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:03,608
-Fuckin' Duncan!
-Well, what do you expect?

779
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:04,509
My $50 back!

780
01:02:05,777 --> 01:02:10,777
So you're saying seven
more just like this.

781
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:15,643
Yeah, with the smiley
faces cut from ear to ear.

782
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,275
When was the last one?

783
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:22,576
I'm not sure, sometime
between nine and 10.

784
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:26,209
-Where?
-Over in the port.

785
01:02:33,177 --> 01:02:34,542
There's a second
person living here.

786
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:36,408
Mrs. Greaston had a
21 year old daughter.

787
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:38,743
-Her name is Christine.
-Hey.

788
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:41,110
Get this, she does
seem to be missing.

789
01:02:42,443 --> 01:02:44,575
Well that explains
why the door was open.

790
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:47,341
-Well she's as good as dead.
-That's awfully negative.

791
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:50,042
Well, I'd say there isn't
a sweeping merit badge

792
01:02:50,043 --> 01:02:51,877
on that belt there, brownie.

793
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:00,276
Well, he was here alright.

794
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:04,876
We need to find the daughter.

795
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:06,876
Uh, I don't see you
two wearing badges.

796
01:03:06,877 --> 01:03:08,341
Oh, I'm sorry.

797
01:03:08,342 --> 01:03:09,608
I must have missed that
shopping trip to Toys R Us.

798
01:03:09,609 --> 01:03:11,175
-I was busy that day.
-You want some of this?

799
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:13,109
-Are you serious?
-Neither you want

800
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,608
any of this, okay?

801
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:15,443
Back off!

802
01:03:16,844 --> 01:03:19,009
Listen you know what, I
want my, oh fuck is my wallet?

803
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:20,743
How about I give
you $50 to blow me?

804
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:24,543
Still owe me 50,
asshole.

805
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:39,009
Duncan is a dick!

806
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,376
You were kinda tough tonight.

807
01:03:42,543 --> 01:03:44,442
You know, I've never
seen that before.

808
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:46,142
Well, fuck shit pissed me off.

809
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,141
Wait, what do you mean?

810
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:51,876
I can be tough.

811
01:03:51,877 --> 01:03:52,710
I'm tough.

812
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:56,610
I'm just saying,
it was different.

813
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,676
So what are we supposed to do,

814
01:04:01,677 --> 01:04:03,609
wait until he kills again?

815
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:07,009
God, this sucks so bad.

816
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,776
Well alright, Jennifer.

817
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:13,108
Let's just take showers,
call it a night,

818
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:15,843
and do some more research
into the morning?

819
01:04:15,844 --> 01:04:17,275
Research what?

820
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:19,009
Missing children who
have been kidnapped

821
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:20,609
by crazy-ass psycho clowns?

822
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,575
Okay, I don't think they
have a website for that.

823
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:25,610
God, now I'm pissed.

824
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:33,844
Well then, forget it, because
homicide is all over it now,

825
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,910
and the FBI and your sister

826
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:38,074
will be all over
everything tomorrow,

827
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:41,610
so we're out of the picture.

828
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,810
-Wait, are you giving up?
-Yeah, you know what?

829
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:47,010
You know what?

830
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:49,743
I'd rather write
about mutant moon men

831
01:04:49,744 --> 01:04:51,208
who have disco parties on Mars

832
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:53,042
than to have to put up
with this shit any longer.

833
01:04:53,043 --> 01:04:56,175
Well I don't fucking want to
write about that shit, Mark!

834
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:57,542
I'm sick of it.

835
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:59,644
God I want something
real, you know?

836
01:05:04,209 --> 01:05:05,309
I'm taking a shower.

837
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:08,743
Wait!

838
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:12,341
Mark, let's just go back
out to Hell's Hideaway

839
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:13,643
and talk to Drago.

840
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:16,275
Jen, forget it!

841
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:17,475
It's ridiculous!

842
01:05:17,476 --> 01:05:19,676
He's a killer, he's
killing people!

843
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:21,409
Just give me another chance.

844
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:26,242
-I gave you a chance.
-Where's it gonna lead?

845
01:05:27,777 --> 01:05:28,744
I don't know,

846
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:32,141
but it's time we
take that chance.

847
01:05:32,142 --> 01:05:34,142
God, we've waited so long, Mark.

848
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:40,475
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up,

849
01:05:40,476 --> 01:05:42,609
and I'll introduce to you
the final show tonight.

850
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:47,041
The most amazing and
fantastic show on Earth,

851
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,375
but wait no more for a sight

852
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:50,008
which the likes have
never been seen before.

853
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:53,743
You will never find another
scene like this ever!

854
01:05:53,744 --> 01:05:57,276
I give you--

855
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,676
So, what do you guys think?

856
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:34,942
I'll take an order
of the twins to-go.

857
01:10:36,377 --> 01:10:38,742
-Tracy Greaston is dead.
-What the fuck you mean,

858
01:10:38,743 --> 01:10:42,074
-"She's dead"?
-Your clown killed her.

859
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:44,476
Nah, I don't believe it.

860
01:10:44,477 --> 01:10:47,074
-What, why not?
-'Cause he wouldn't.

861
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:49,041
You mean he never
got around to it.

862
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:51,041
No, I mean he wouldn't.

863
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,543
He loved her.

864
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:55,476
Yeah okay, so a serial killer
with the deductive reasoning

865
01:10:55,477 --> 01:10:58,175
not to kill the woman he loves,

866
01:10:58,176 --> 01:11:00,309
that sounds like a crackpot
story to me, buddy.

867
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,543
Yeah, like you should know.

868
01:11:02,544 --> 01:11:04,309
Animal rights, vampire babies,

869
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,775
killing aliens to
save livestock?

870
01:11:06,776 --> 01:11:08,276
Touche.

871
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,510
So he loved her so much
he slit her from ear to ear.

872
01:11:11,843 --> 01:11:14,775
What, uh no ma'am,
that's not his MO.

873
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:17,074
So why was she
slit from ear to ear?

874
01:11:17,075 --> 01:11:18,775
Who the fuck knows.

875
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:20,409
Maybe somebody else killed her.

876
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,875
Yeah, okay.

877
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:24,342
Luther has been the Teardrop
Killer for over 20 years,

878
01:11:24,343 --> 01:11:28,177
not some smiley guy killer,
or Slappy the Carver.

879
01:11:29,343 --> 01:11:32,041
So, why didn't you
call the fucking cops?

880
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:35,642
Well, one thing you learn
is when you work on the road,

881
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:37,409
that we take care of our own,

882
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:39,609
no interference from outside

883
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:41,041
for any reason.

884
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:42,476
Why are you helping us?

885
01:11:42,477 --> 01:11:45,377
Times change and conscience
weighs heavy, my friend.

886
01:11:46,577 --> 01:11:47,842
Now if you guys don't mind,

887
01:11:47,843 --> 01:11:49,510
I like to go drink
myself into a coma.

888
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,243
-I've had a rough night.
-So, that's it?

889
01:11:55,009 --> 01:11:57,242
That's all I
got for you, lady.

890
01:11:57,243 --> 01:11:58,509
Why don't you guys just
let the cops handle it?

891
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,342
Don't even try
that route, buddy.

892
01:12:00,343 --> 01:12:01,477
That'll get you nowhere.

893
01:12:03,243 --> 01:12:04,075
Thanks, Drago.

894
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,543
You take care, man.

895
01:12:06,544 --> 01:12:08,142
Maybe we'll see
you again sometime.

896
01:12:08,143 --> 01:12:09,708
Maybe on
better terms next time.

897
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:14,074
Yeah, yeah maybe.

898
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:15,809
Take care, man.

899
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,343
Goodbye.

900
01:12:43,477 --> 01:12:45,843
-Hey.
-What's that?

901
01:12:47,676 --> 01:12:49,643
Oh, when was that reported?

902
01:12:50,843 --> 01:12:53,075
What, so you seriously
think it's a connection?

903
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:55,076
No, well we can go
out and take a look.

904
01:12:56,609 --> 01:12:58,177
Yeah no, give me the address.

905
01:13:02,243 --> 01:13:04,477
If anything happens
I'll call you, bye.

906
01:13:06,009 --> 01:13:08,575
There's also two
businessmen missing,

907
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:10,008
and the last-known whereabouts

908
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:11,810
are at this address
that she gave me.

909
01:13:38,143 --> 01:13:39,009
Mmm.

910
01:13:43,243 --> 01:13:46,310
-Is that going to be necessary?
-Fucking A right.

911
01:13:47,444 --> 01:13:48,843
Well, don't wear
the blindfold.

912
01:13:52,143 --> 01:13:53,310
Wait.

913
01:13:56,076 --> 01:13:57,143
I'm just saying,

914
01:13:58,509 --> 01:14:00,010
I'd do things to that girl

915
01:14:01,243 --> 01:14:02,909
she could write essays about.

916
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,310
-Let it go, man, let it go.
-What?

917
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,842
Hold on.

918
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,009
My phone is ringing.

919
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:11,276
Hello?

920
01:14:11,277 --> 01:14:12,842
Oh, hey, Jennifer.

921
01:14:12,843 --> 01:14:15,575
-What, listen.
-Ask her if she likes me.

922
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,009
Shh, you two need to back
off this thing for awhile.

923
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,409
You can really get hurt, okay?

924
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:20,842
Let us take care of this.

925
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:22,276
We can't.

926
01:14:22,277 --> 01:14:25,009
-we're so close now.
-What, what's he saying?

927
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,309
-He wants us to back off.
-Fuck that, no way.

928
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:32,009
-Spaulding man, just--
-Where is it, exit 34?

929
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,142
We'll be there in 30, do not
go inside, let us handle this.

930
01:14:35,143 --> 01:14:37,876
Yeah, would you just please
meet us at the warehouse.

931
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:41,909
I guess you're gonna get
to save the day after all.

932
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,343
Cool, let's go.

933
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:53,809
Are you sure

934
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,543
-this is the place?
-Yeah.

935
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:21,776
Daddy,
you scared me.

936
01:15:33,177 --> 01:15:34,911
Hey, stop.

937
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,143
For me?

938
01:15:51,576 --> 01:15:52,409
Oh.

939
01:15:54,776 --> 01:15:56,243
Daddy, I want to kill.

940
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:00,775
You know what your problem is?

941
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:02,342
You're thinking
with little Duncan.

942
01:16:02,343 --> 01:16:04,209
Yeah, well little
Duncan needs a dip.

943
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,177
-A dip in what?
-Hot Jennifer coffee to go.

944
01:16:09,476 --> 01:16:11,243
You're a fool, man.

945
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:16,543
Hello!

946
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,608
I thought you were
gonna go down there.

947
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:24,443
I am.

948
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,310
I'm coming.

949
01:16:39,509 --> 01:16:43,409
I mean, what's the
worst that's gonna happen?

950
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:52,843
How are you gonna be in there?

951
01:16:52,844 --> 01:16:54,176
That's what I wanna know.

952
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:57,010
I told you, I'm
a fucking ninja.

953
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,408
Holy fuck, it's him.

954
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:13,743
Run!

955
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:22,709
Ugh, come on.

956
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:27,608
Ugh, ah fuck!

957
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,443
Come on!

958
01:17:32,376 --> 01:17:33,844
Mark,
there's a door!

959
01:17:41,643 --> 01:17:43,009
Shit!

960
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:48,010
Run!

961
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:49,543
Get off him!

962
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:55,811
Get off him!

963
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:57,609
-Alright.
-Shit!

964
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:07,443
Fuck, ugh!

965
01:18:08,443 --> 01:18:10,509
Oh, shit, fucking Christ.

966
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:13,676
Ugh, fucker!

967
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:25,744
Jen.

968
01:18:44,242 --> 01:18:45,076
Jen.

969
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:50,208
-Help!
-Well that can't be good.

970
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:52,308
-Coo, let's go!
-Help me!

971
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:53,476
-Help me!
-Jen!

972
01:19:54,643 --> 01:19:57,009
Can
you hear me, help?

973
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:58,408
-Jennifer?
-Help!

974
01:19:58,409 --> 01:20:02,076
Fuck.

975
01:20:03,976 --> 01:20:05,043
Help, help!

976
01:20:08,777 --> 01:20:09,677
Help, help!

977
01:20:12,443 --> 01:20:13,844
Help please help!

978
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,075
I'll go around back.

979
01:20:18,076 --> 01:20:20,076
-Stay in front.
-Alright.

980
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:27,408
Are you okay, where's Mark?

981
01:20:27,409 --> 01:20:29,709
I don't know, but the
killer clown is here

982
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,910
-and he's trying to kill us.
-What killer clown?

983
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,341
Gurdy, Gurdy the Clown.

984
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:34,776
What the
hell are you talking about?

985
01:20:34,777 --> 01:20:37,141
-Okay, the Teardrop Killer.
-He's a circus clown.

986
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:40,141
Yes, yes, okay you
know we don't have time.

987
01:20:40,142 --> 01:20:42,408
I know this sounds crazy but
we need to get out of here.

988
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:44,542
-I'm telling the fucking truth.
-Come on, come on.

989
01:20:44,543 --> 01:20:45,776
-Okay.
-I'm gonna get you outta here

990
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:48,543
-and then I'm gonna find him.
-Okay.

991
01:20:55,076 --> 01:21:00,109
Jen.

992
01:21:00,576 --> 01:21:01,109
Jen.

993
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:12,109
Help me please come here!

994
01:21:16,644 --> 01:21:18,508
-Are you Christine Greaston?
-Yes!

995
01:21:18,509 --> 01:21:19,910
Please help me, he's after me!

996
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:22,009
-Who?
-The clown.

997
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,609
What, what, stay calm.

998
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:28,010
Alright, stay calm, calm down.

999
01:21:28,811 --> 01:21:31,844
I'm as calm as a bomb.

1000
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,041
Come on, get inside.

1001
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:50,844
Sit down.

1002
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:58,275
Dispatch, this is Detective
Spaulding, badge number 4375.

1003
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:03,242
I have a 232 at 33804
West Winnipeg Road.

1004
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:05,676
We have multiple 450s.

1005
01:22:05,677 --> 01:22:08,375
I need a backup team and
emergency team immediately.

1006
01:22:08,376 --> 01:22:10,609
Now, Detective Duncan is
in there on the other side.

1007
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:12,108
Proceed with caution.

1008
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:14,844
You stay here, do not get out
this car, I'm going back in.

1009
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:34,810
Oh my God, are you Christine?

1010
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:36,241
Are you okay?

1011
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,341
Did he do anything to you?

1012
01:22:38,342 --> 01:22:41,543
Okay, I'm gonna go get,
I'm gonna go get help.

1013
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:43,376
Be right back.

1014
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:52,341
-Nobody hits my Daddy!
-What?

1015
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:56,811
Fucking get off!

1016
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:06,811
Go, Daddy, go!

1017
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:14,009
No, oh no!

1018
01:23:28,644 --> 01:23:29,477
Mark.

1019
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:37,476
I'm talking about
fucking family reunion.

1020
01:23:37,477 --> 01:23:38,776
Take that!

1021
01:23:38,777 --> 01:23:40,008
What did you do
to me, you whore!

1022
01:23:40,009 --> 01:23:43,477
You'll be blind today
if you live that long.

1023
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:51,409
What do you think
of that, punk bitch?

1024
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:09,710
Fuck!

1025
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,009
Holy God damn!

1026
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:07,709
So the great Teardrop
Killer is a pussy after all?

1027
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,009
Good move, Daddy.

1028
01:25:10,142 --> 01:25:11,409
But, you should have
done that to tubby

1029
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,343
before he smashed my
face into the wall.

1030
01:25:20,477 --> 01:25:21,309
What?

1031
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:29,008
You're gonna shoot me?

1032
01:25:29,009 --> 01:25:31,042
You'd be better off
shooting yourself!

1033
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,843
You're gonna kill me, Dad?

1034
01:25:37,843 --> 01:25:39,409
Some father-figure you are.

1035
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:42,241
You might as well
kill yourself, Daddy.

1036
01:25:42,242 --> 01:25:46,209
Alright, fuck this.

1037
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,142
Mark.

1038
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,209
Somebody
please help me!

1039
01:26:18,377 --> 01:26:20,041
Hold
on, I'm coming.

1040
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:23,743
Please hurry, please find me!

1041
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,709
Okay, keep yelling,
I'm following your voice.

1042
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,276
Come please, I'm right here!

1043
01:26:28,277 --> 01:26:30,544
Come quick, please help me.

1044
01:26:34,009 --> 01:26:36,610
-I'm coming!
-I'm here, please!

1045
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:40,041
My God!

1046
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:42,009
What the hell happened?

1047
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:44,910
He, he came in,

1048
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,410
he sat down,

1049
01:26:49,142 --> 01:26:50,810
and he shot himself.

1050
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:54,342
-Have you seen Mark?
-Yeah.

1051
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:55,909
-You have?
-Yeah.

1052
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,276
-Okay, when?
-He was here.

1053
01:26:58,277 --> 01:27:02,576
He was, okay, where?

1054
01:27:02,577 --> 01:27:04,743
What do you wanna do now, Daddy?

1055
01:27:10,843 --> 01:27:12,008
Do it, Daddy!

1056
01:27:12,009 --> 01:27:14,709
Do it, come on, Daddy, kill him!

1057
01:27:21,009 --> 01:27:22,742
Daddy, you go get the cop!

1058
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:26,410
I'm gonna kill
this slut!

1059
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:39,109
I'm gonna cut your
pretty little face!

1060
01:28:15,477 --> 01:28:18,544
Hey, bitch!

1061
01:28:20,577 --> 01:28:22,410
Does that turn you on?

1062
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:28,775
Daddy!

1063
01:30:28,776 --> 01:30:32,876
You forgot something.

1064
01:34:57,309 --> 01:34:59,143
Oh, thank you for
all your support.

1065
01:35:00,911 --> 01:35:03,210
Bye, there you go, Gene,
