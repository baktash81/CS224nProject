00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,653
Without our eyes, there's no nature.

353
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,860
And none of us sees the world
around us the same way.

354
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,411
We sit, you and I,
in front of the same landscape,

355
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,115
we don't see the same
mountains, the same trees.

356
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,021
[Vincent] Well, that's what I'm saying.
The trees that I paint are mine.

357
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,083
Even the faces you paint are yours.

358
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,165
And they'll stay because of you.

359
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,375
People will be known
because you painted them,

360
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,052
and how you painted them,
not because of who they are.

361
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,970
- That's good.
- And people will go to museums

362
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,891
to see paintings of people,
not to see people who were painted.

363
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,185
You know, people don't always like
the way they look in my paintings.

364
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,185
We have to start a revolution.
Do you understand?

365
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,814
Yes, we do. Us, our generation.

366
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,816
We have to change entirely

367
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,240
the relation between painting
and what you call nature.

368
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,826
Between painting and reality,

369
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,121
because painted reality
is its own reality.

370
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,228
[Vincent] You're right about that.

371
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,835
- [both urinating]
- [Gauguin] The impressionists,

372
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,958
they're out of it, do you agree?

373
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,335
- [clicking tongue] Uh...
- Come on.

374
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,153
They only paint their babies
in their gardens.

375
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,463
They'll never go any further.

376
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,593
Seurat confounds painting with science.

377
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,300
He's lost himself in optical experiments.

378
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:11,977
There's nothing more to expect
from Renoir, Degas, Monet...

379
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,419
They repeat themselves.
They've given everything they could give.

380
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,186
[Vincent] You don't mean that.
You like Degas.

381
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,528
You have to say thank you
for the paintings you like.

382
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,743
- Monet's pretty good.
- [Gauguin] It's our turn.

383
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,159
We have a huge responsibility.

384
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,115
[Vincent] I still think
Monet's pretty good.

385
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,462
You want to go to Martinique?

386
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,668
[breathing heavily]

387
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,303
[Vincent] It's good to have you here.

388
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,425
[flapping]

389
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,778
[door shuts]

390
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,525
[footsteps approaching]

391
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,693
[door opens]

392
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,363
Could you put your hand
back how it was?

393
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,693
Thank you.

394
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,359
- Can I go?
- You can go.

395
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,375
You have to plan your paintings slowly.

396
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,173
What's the rush?

397
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,971
Work calmly, slowly.

398
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:36,473
You're indoors, you're not outside
in the wind and the noise.

399
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,055
Paintings have to be done
in one clear gesture.

400
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,914
Think about the surface
that you're painting on

401
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,483
and how the paint will sit on it.

402
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:55,287
You're changing things so fast,
you can't even see what you've done.

403
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,577
Paintings have to be painted fast.

404
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,630
[up-tempo piano music playing]

405
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,483
[Vincent] <i>The painters I look at...</i>

406
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,708
<i>Frans Hals,</i>

407
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,347
<i>Goya,</i>

408
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,562
<i>Velazquez,</i>

409
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,520
<i>Veronese,</i>

410
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,995
<i>Delacroix.</i>

411
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:31,876
<i>The painters I like all paint fast
in one clear gesture, each stroke.</i>

412
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,051
You've heard of "a stroke of genius"?
Well, that's what it means.

413
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,894
You don't even paint that way.
You paint fast and you overpaint.

414
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,973
Your surface looks
like it's made out of clay.

415
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,228
It's more like sculpture than painting.

416
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,914
[Gauguin] <i>You don't even paint like that.</i>

417
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,037
<i>You paint fast and then you overpaint.</i>

418
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,164
<i>Your surface looks
like it's made out of clay.</i>

419
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,414
<i>It's more like sculpture than painting.</i>

420
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,249
[insects chirping]

421
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,245
[insects chirping]

422
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,159
I'm telling you,
you have to look inside.

423
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,375
You keep saying "look inside."
I get it, I do.

424
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,582
You keep repeating yourself.

425
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,592
What do you think I'm doing?

426
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,592
I don't invent the picture.

427
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,140
I don't need to invent the picture.

428
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,470
I find it already in nature.
I just have to free it.

429
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,181
All right, I'm just saying,
first think about your surface

430
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,358
and how the paint will sit on it.

431
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,277
Get control over what you're doing.

432
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,025
Maybe you should work inside more.

433
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:21,243
I've spent all my life alone, in a room.

434
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:25,993
I need to go out and work
to forget myself.

435
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,333
I want to be out of control.

436
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,082
- I need to be in a feverish state.
- [wings flapping]

437
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,163
It's called the act
of painting for a reason.

438
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,001
- All right, calm down.
- I don't want to calm down.

439
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,211
The faster I paint, the better I feel.

440
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:43,549
- I can't stay here, Vincent.
- What are you saying?

441
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,220
I can't stay in Arles.

442
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:50,851
I'll go soon.

443
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,862
What?

444
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,814
I've sold some paintings lately.
Maybe your brother told you?

445
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,239
And I have to get back to Paris.

446
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,996
Where are you going?

447
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,295
Vincent!

448
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,754
[panting]

449
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,212
[groaning]

450
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:24,256
[Vincent] <i>I've spent
all my life alone, in a room.</i>

451
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,718
<i>- I need to go out and work...</i>
- [Gauguin] What are you doing?

452
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,928
[Vincent]<i>...to forget myself.</i>

453
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,291
<i>- I want to be out of control.</i>
- [Gauguin] What?

454
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,103
<i>I need to be in a feverish state.</i>

455
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,105
<i>It's called the act of painting
for a reason.</i>

456
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,278
[Gauguin] <i>All right, calm down.</i>

457
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:42,028
<i>I don't want to calm down.
The faster I paint, the better I feel.</i>

458
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,653
[crying]

459
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,532
Why are you crying?

460
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,663
What did I do?
Where did I go wrong?

461
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:56,246
Nothing. You have nothing to do
with this decision.

462
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,175
Vincent, we can't live side by side.

463
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,878
Our temperaments are incompatible,
you must admit that.

464
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,717
And you have to understand,

465
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,599
my reputation is established now.

466
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,022
I can't live in a country town anymore.

467
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,109
I have to be around people, for now.

468
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,936
[Vincent panting]

469
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,944
Besides, I don't like it here.

470
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:28,404
You're surrounded by stupid,
wicked, ignorant people.

471
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,579
Come on, why are you
being so dramatic?

472
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,205
[Vincent breathing heavily]

473
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,732
Please don't go.

474
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,484
It's great having you here.

475
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,220
[Gauguin] <i>I've sold some paintings lately.</i>

476
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,610
<i>Maybe your brother told you?</i>

477
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,742
Don't do it to me! I beg you.

478
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,869
- No!
- [Gauguin] <i>Nothing.</i>

479
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,747
<i>You have nothing to do with this decision.</i>

480
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,749
<i>- Where are you going?</i>
- [door opens]

481
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,422
<i>- Vincent, we can't live side by side.</i>
- Vincent!

482
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,546
<i>Our temperaments are incompatible,
you must admit that.</i>

483
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,423
[Vincent groaning]

484
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:31,725
<i>And you have to understand,
my reputation is established now.</i>

485
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,052
<i>I can't live in a country town anymore.</i>

486
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,523
<i>I have to be around people, for now.</i>

487
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,313
<i>What?</i>

488
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,066
<i>Besides, I don't like it here.</i>

489
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:48,400
<i>You're surrounded by stupid,
wicked, ignorant people.</i>

490
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,744
[Vincent crying]

491
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,366
<i>Come on,
why are you being so dramatic?</i>

492
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,910
[cries]

493
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,707
[Vincent] <i>What are you saying?</i>

494
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,551
[Gauguin] <i>I can't stay in Arles.</i>

495
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,721
[Vincent exhales deeply]

496
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,637
[Vincent] <i>There's something
strange about me.</i>

497
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:19,561
<i>Sometimes I don't know
what I've done or what I've said.</i>

498
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:25,692
<i>About Gauguin, for instance,
what happened right before he left.</i>

499
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,652
<i>We had some fights...</i>

500
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,693
<i>I...</i>

501
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:35,656
<i>Maybe I hurt him. I don't know how.</i>

502
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,949
<i>I do know...</i>

503
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,287
<i>that I took a razor...</i>

504
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:45,249
<i>and I cut off one of my ears, yes.</i>

505
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,631
<i>I cut it off, one of my ears.
Blood all over the place.</i>

506
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,507
<i>No one else did it, I did it.</i>

507
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:56,392
I wanted to give it to Gauguin
with my apologies.

508
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:58,727
Why?

509
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,768
God knows.

510
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,611
And I thought
she would know where Paul was,

511
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,861
so I gave my ear to the girl
at the bar, to Gaby.

512
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,657
She was scared, all the blood...

513
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,577
I think she thought
I was going to kill her.

514
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:18,703
So, she called the police
and they put me here.

515
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,828
And what would you have done,
as a police officer?

516
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,502
You can leave. It's all right.

517
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,220
[door closes]

518
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,640
I...

519
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,552
This is a small town, Vincent.

520
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,730
Everybody's watching what you're doing,
even more in a small town.

521
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,100
You're a stranger here.

Much too much.

one of your ears.

526

He was about to leave.

528
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,002

was a way to keep him next to you?

529

or a sacrifice or what?

- I don't know.

I don't know what it is.

537

and sometimes it frightens me.

538

I think I'm losing my mind.

539
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,841

to my human brothers who can't see it."

Yes, but why?

549
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:39,306
Because my vision is closer
to the reality of the world.

550
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:44,056

- Do you feel like they don't feel alive?
- Yes, I do.

552
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,815

feel that through painting?

553
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,276
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

554
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,741

555

was wrapped in this,

556
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,459
and she was supposed to give it to Paul.

557
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,922

but that was something you couldn't see.

561
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:36,109
I didn't want him to leave.
It was a way to get him back.

562
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,612
Jesus said, "If thy hand offend thee,
cut it off."

563
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,280
So you cut off your ear

564
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,113
because you couldn't bear
to hear what Paul was saying?

565

568

He speaks to me and threatens me.

569
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,349
And all he wants to do
is plunge a knife into my heart.

570
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,053
I saw him and I tried to cut him
out of myself.

571
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,934

why you cut off your ear.

01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,855
<i>I offer you my sincere compliments.</i>

694
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,564
<i>And for many artists, you are
the most remarkable in the exhibition.</i>

695
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,401
<i>With things from nature,
you're the only one there who thinks.</i>

696
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,908
<i>I've talked about it with your brother,</i>

697
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,893
<i>and there's one that I would like
to exchange with you</i>

698
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,328
<i>for one thing of your choice.</i>

699
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,085
<i>I hesitated greatly to write to you,</i>

700
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,505
<i>knowing that you had just had
a rather long crisis.</i>

701
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,842
<i>So, please don't reply to me
until you feel completely strong.</i>

702
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,216
<i>Let's hope that, with the warm weather
that will return,</i>

703
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,218
<i>you're going to get well at last.</i>

704
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,140
"The winter
is always dangerous to you.

705
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,054
Cordially, ever yours, Paul Gauguin."

706
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:09,142
[melancholy classical music playing]

707
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,376
[no audio]

708
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,205
[guard] Van Gogh!

709
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,329
Van Gogh!

710
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:13,965
Not here, there.

711
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:16,752
There. There.

712
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,741
Follow me.

713
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,065
- Here he is.
- Thank you.

714
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,076
Please help me take it off.

715
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,755
Thank you.

716
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,047
- Better?
- Yes.

717
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,133
Come, sit with me. Talk to me.

718
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,931
Please.

719
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,445
I suppose you know why you're here.

720
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,610
[sighs] Talking to you now?

721
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,243
To get better.

722
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,041
Or because I walked out of the asylum.

723
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:15,912
What happened on the road to Arles?

724
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,590
I don't remember.

725
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,505
You did walk out of the asylum.

726
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,263
I wanted to go out.

727
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:33,138
The townspeople of Arles have signed
a petition against you.

728
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,600
- They don't want you to come back there.
- Yes, I know.

729
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,866
- Did you ever molest a child?
- No. Never.

730
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:54,622
Did you cut off one of your ears
to give it to a prostitute? Is that true?

731
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:57,546
Yes, I did. But Gaby's not a prostitute.

732
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,673
Why did you do that?

733
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,218
[sighs] I wanted her to give it
to a friend of mine.

734
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,638
And she did?

735
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,303
I don't know.

736
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,137
And that was a strange offer, wasn't it?

737
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,642
Do you feel angry sometimes?

738
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,238
Yes.

739
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,151
And what do you do then?

740
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:35,042
I go out and look at a blade of grass
or a branch of a fig tree

741
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,618
in order to calm down.

742
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,460
- And it works?
- Yes.

743
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,715
I feel God is nature
and nature is beauty.

744
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,969
I've seen you in the garden, painting.

745
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:58,690
And I've heard from others
that you say you were a painter.

746
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,314
Yes, that's what I am.

747
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,984
Why do you say that?

748
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,568
- Do you have a gift for painting?
- Yes.

749
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,488
Where does this gift come from?

750
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,376
Would you say that God gave you
the gift of painting?

751
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,954
Yes, He did. It's the only gift
He gave me.

752
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:36,595
- Did you paint this?
- Yes, I did.

753
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,975
- And you call it a painting?
- Yes, of course.

754
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,731
Tell me frankly,
because I'd like to understand.

755
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,187
Why do you say you're a painter?

756
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:50,112
Because I paint.
I love painting. I have to paint.

757
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,286
I've always been a painter.
That, I know.

758
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,954
- A born painter?
- Yes.

759
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,080
How do you know?

760
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,007
Because I can't do anything else.
And believe me, I've tried.

761
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,851
So, God gave you a gift
so you could paint this?

762
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,808
Yes.

763
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,568
But don't you see... [swallows]

764
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,026
Now look, carefully. Please.

765
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:35,078
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but don't you see that this painting is...

766
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,199
How can I say... [clears throat]

767
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,458
Unpleasant. It's ugly.

768
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:50,465
Why would God give me a gift to paint
ugly and disturbing things?

769
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,266
Sometimes I...

770
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,645
feel so far away from everything.

771
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:09,396
- Does anybody buy your paintings?
- No.

772
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,107
- So, you're poor?
- Yes, rather poor.

773
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:15,910
How do you live?

774
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:21,749
Well, my brother, Theo,
pays for me to be here.

775
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,997
But he's not a rich man either.

776
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,001
So, you believe
that God gave you this gift

777
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,382
because He wants to keep you in misery?

778
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,597
Huh.

779
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,633
I never thought about it that way.

780
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:41,644
And which way do you think?

781
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,774
Sometimes I think...

782
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,773
- Yes?
- Maybe, maybe...

783
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,699
- Go on.
- Maybe He chose the wrong time.

784
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,556
What do you mean the wrong time?

785
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,164
Maybe God made me a painter for people
who aren't born yet.

786
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,374
Possibly.

787
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:11,174
It is said, "Life is for sowing.
The harvest is not here."

788
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:18,173
I paint with my qualities and faults.

789
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,109
So, you think
God could've been mistaken?

790
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:38,448
I think of myself as an exile,
a pilgrim on this earth.

791
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,906
Jesus said, "Turn your heart away
from things visible

792
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,289
and turn yourself to things invisible."

793
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,623
- Indeed. But...
- And Jesus also

794
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,881
was totally unknown
when He was alive.

795
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,382
- How do you know that?
- My father was a pastor.

796
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,388
I've been around religion all my life.

797
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,103
Really? A pastor?

798
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,309
Yes, and before I realized
I was a painter...

799
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:16,902
I tried myself to be a man of God,
so I learned quite a bit about the topic.

800
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,776
So you know the Gospels?

801
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,702
Not only the Gospels,

802
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:25,077
I can tell you that Jesus
wasn't discovered

803
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,126
until 30 or 40 years after he died.

804
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:31,080
When he was alive,
nobody talked about him.

805
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:36,544
There's not even a letter from a Roman
centurion to his wife in Rome

806
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,675
saying that a man named Jeshua

807
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,348
was crucified in Jerusalem
with some other criminals.

808
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,050
Not a word, nothing.

809
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,818
You know, this is my job to decide
if you're well enough to leave this place.

810
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,329
This reminds me of Jesus on the terrace.

811
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:10,952
Which terrace?

812
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,379
Speaking to Pilate,

813
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,004
who definitively, if you
believe what was written,

814
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,054
didn't want to crucify him.
It was the people.

815
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:25,725
Yes. We could have a real discussion
about this theory some other time.

816
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,269
Pilate didn't want to crucify Jesus,

817
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:32,474
but everything Christ said
incriminated him, so...

818
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:36,982
I, too...

819
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:42,450
have to be careful
with what I say to you.

820
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,496
I can understand that.

821
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,380
Listen, come see me again
if you feel like.

822
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,499
And share some other ideas with me.

823
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,972
In the meantime, Dr. Rey
is here waiting for you.

824
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:08,096
- He came to take you home.
- I'm free to go?

825
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,102
I think we've done
all we can for you here.

826
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,321
I hope I'm ready.

827
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:23,862
I hope so, too.

828
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,643
[Vincent]
Please return these things

829
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,524
to <i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur</i> Ginoux.

830
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:04,365
- They've been real friends.
- Sure, I will.

831
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,363
And give them that book.
Tell them thank you.

832
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,024
[knock on door, door opens]

833
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,565
- Hello.
- [Dr. Rey] <i>Bonjour.</i>

834
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,576
This is very important.

835
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,620
Make sure <i>Madame</i> Ginoux receives it.

836
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,950
It is from the painter Vincent van Gogh.
He apologizes for the delay.

837
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,672
A bundle of towels,

838
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,475
a ledger,
and two empty olive boxes.

839
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,466
[Vincent] My work's all here.
You didn't sell anything.

840
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,091
Not yet, but Aurier's review
was excellent, really wonderful.

841
01:28:31,181 --> 01:28:34,765
That review was absurd. I don't deserve
anything that man said.

842
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,808
- Far from it.
- Yes, you do.

843
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,636
[Theo] The review will help.

844
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,357
[Vincent] I think...

845
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,657
I'm beyond caring
what anyone thinks, but...

846
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,197
I care what you think, Theo.

847
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:57,245
Tell me, I want to know the truth.

848
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,786
Am I a good painter?

849
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,521
[Theo, overlapping]
You're not a good painter,

850
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:02,877
Vincent. You're a great painter.

851
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,124
[Vincent] Are you sure?

852
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,001
Of course, I'm sure.
Why would I lie to you?

853
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:09,255
I mean, you're my brother.
You're my brother.

854
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,210
Just to please me.

855
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:16,140
- [Theo] I wouldn't do that.
- [Jo] No, Theo would never do that.

856
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:23,098
People say that I don't know how to draw,
how to paint.

857
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:28,607
They say my paintings are clumsy, ugly.

858
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:31,656
I used to care what people thought.

859
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,733
But not anymore.

860
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,194
[voices continue overlapping]
I have no choice.

861
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:39,872
If I couldn't paint,
I would murder someone.

862
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,075
[Theo] That's why I send you
money for your paintings

Why do you paint?

895
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:19,223
I paint...

896
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:26,429
as a matter of fact, to stop thinking.

897
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,392
A sort of meditation.

898
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:38,032
- When I paint, I stop thinking.
- About what?

899
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,035
I stop thinking...

900
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,371
and I feel...

901
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:51,121
that I'm a part of everything
outside and inside of me.

902
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,383

had to teach how to look at the world.
But I don't think that anymore.

908
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,906
Now I just think
about my relationship to eternity.

909
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,952
What do you call eternity?

910
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,836
- Time to come.
- Hmm.

911
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:41,963

that your gift to the world is painting.

You're happy
when you're painting?

915

Most of the time, except when I fail.

916

can sometimes heal us.
