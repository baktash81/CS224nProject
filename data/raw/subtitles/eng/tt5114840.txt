<i>I can't go back,</i>

3
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:09,951
<i>Calm down man.</i>

00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:11,284
<i>Don't you</i>
<i>understand, they've taken it!</i>

5
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:12,617
<i>It's your duty.</i>

6
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,418
They know, they know
they're being watched.

7
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,318
<i>You must go back.</i>

8
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:16,151
I can't.

9
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,251
<i>Go in there now!</i>

10
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:18,084
Hello?

11
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:43,550
Germany
defiant, Poland in crisis!

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,650
Britain prepares for war!

21

Is this your first visit
to Bexhill zum Meer?

22
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,017
Yes.

23
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:16,984
Yes it is.

24
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,418
Let's hope you last longer
than the other bloke.

25
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,284
Auf wiedersehen.

26
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,750
<i>And one, and two.</i>

27
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:50,318
<i>And up.</i>

28
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,450
<i>Bend.</i>

29
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:03,318
<i>Keep those arms straight.</i>

30
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,750
<i>And one, and two, and
stretch, very good.</i>

31
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,583
Nice girls.

32
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,184
Take over Astrid.

33
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:26,884
Astrid!

34
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,850
English, thank you.

35
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,384
Five, six, seven, eight.

36
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,517
How may I help?

37
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,483
I'm here about the teaching
post, I'm Thomas Miller.

38
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:40,151
Ilse Keller, welcome
to Augusta Victoria.

39
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:40,984
Thank you.

40
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,051
This way please.

41
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:44,617
Mr. Miller?

42
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:54,750
And up, shoulders,
arms out, and down.

43
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,550
One, and two, and up.

44
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,351
There's been an
alliance between England

45
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,217
and Germany here for many years.

46
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,583
Our name sake.

47
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,418
She was the last German Empress.

48
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,418
Should you obtain your position,

49
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,251
your room will be
on the top floor.

50
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,984
Modest but south facing.

51
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,483
Sounds perfect.

52
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,217
Mr. Wheatley found it
agreeable.

53
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:28,917
Please take a seat.

54
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:31,984
Not a lot of competition.

55
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,917
Faith and perseverance.

56
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,084
The school motto.

57
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,151
She may ask you, good luck.

58
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,184
Thank you.

59
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,151
One and two.

60
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,284
Thank you Astrid, I'll
take over from here.

61
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,251
<i>Magnificent aren't they?</i>

62
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:51,784
Ellen Rocholl.

63
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:52,650
Thomas Miller.

64
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,784
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

65
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:56,750
Not at all.

66
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,351
Please.

67
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,684
You come recommended
by an agency.

68
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:11,151
A lot of different
schools I see.

69
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,884
Thank you.

70
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,284
That wasn't a complement.

71
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,750
It says here your musical.

72
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,184
I play the piano a little.

73
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:23,717
That's useful.

74
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,284
You married?

75
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:28,650
I was.

76
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,583
Spanish flu.

77
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,450
I would not normally employ
a journeyman teacher.

78
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:41,418
But your predecessor turned
out to be unreliable.

79
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,984
My girls need order.

80
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:48,717
Next week we present them to
the Anglo-German Fellowship.

81
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,650
They must be looking
forward to it.

82
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,151
They speak of nothing else.

83
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,450
Their last days of summer.

84
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,450
Hopefully not.

85
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,251
So what brings you
here Mr. Miller?

86
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,684
What sort of English
man would accept

87
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:09,284
a post teaching Herr Hitlers
league of German girls?

88
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,625
My father is German.

89
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,784
I do not like surprises.

90
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:21,051
I will place you
on a trial period.

91
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,850
Thank you, when do I start?

92
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,583
Good morning.

93
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:46,717
My name is Mr. Miller

94
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,151
and I will be your
new English teacher.

95
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,717
Mr. Miller.

96
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,483
Good morning, Mr. Miller.

97
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:17,483
Good morning?

98
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,517
Astrid.

99
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,384
Astrid.

100
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,517
We welcome you.

101
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,517
Thank you.

102
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:29,084
So what have you been
studying this summer?

103
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,051
Oh please, sit down.

104
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,784
Is there an English book
that you like the best?

105
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:47,850
Mr. Wheatley
did not need books.

106
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,251
No, he told us
stories out loud.

107
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:51,117
Did he now?

108
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:02,117
Well I'm not very good
at public speaking.

109
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,984
It doesn't have to be
Shakespeare, Mr. Miller.

110
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,517
Please, tell us a story.

111
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:10,617
Very well.

112
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,084
What about a story, what about
a story, a romantic story?

113
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,384
About a young man who
misses his sweet heart.

114
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,717
Is that you Mr. Miller?

115
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,583
No.

116
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,936
The Führer would say he isn't man enough.

117
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,125
The Führer would say what?

118
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:46,583
Please, tell the story.

119
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,917
The young man who
misses his sweetheart.

120
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:54,817

<i>Keep time.</i>

133
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:38,750
Not too fast.

134
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,650
Grace, poise, confidence.

135
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:54,251
Remember girls you will be
representing Augusta Victoria.

136
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:57,051
Straighten your
shoulders Sigrid.

137
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:02,984
Appropriate attention makes
the appropriate impression.

138
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,084
Gretel.

139
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:15,951
Play on Mr. Miller.

140
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,251
It's a morgen schwimmen.

141
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:49,617
Rain or shine, Ilsa insists.

142
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,684
Why don't you join us?

143
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,284
<i>Ilsa
was on the reserve team</i>

144
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,884
<i>for the Berlin
Olympics you know.</i>

145
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:19,750
Impressive.

146
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,084
We're lucky to have her back.

147
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,418
Their morgan schwimmen
is about

148
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,084
as much of England
as they'll ever see.

149
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:35,051
I like to protect the girls
from the world outside.

150
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:36,884
They never venture
out these days?

151
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:41,184
England can be in
unforgiving place

152
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,583
if you happen to be German.

153
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,550
As I'm sure you know,
Mr. Miller.

154
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,250
I almost caught you today.

155
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,500
In your dreams little girl.

156
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:56,375
It's freezing. Hurry up, Paula.

157
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,083
You are last.

158
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,459
No I'm not.

159
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:01,124
Gretel is always last.

160
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,060
That toad didn't even get wet today.

161
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,717
Who are you talking about?

162
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,984
Gretel didn't swim.

163
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,517
He's dead, he's dead!

164
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:25,784
Miss.

165
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,951
<i>Come on,
I know you're out there,</i>

166
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,284
<i>I can hear you breathing.</i>

167
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,550
Oh, she's off, you liked
that one, didn't you my dear?

168
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:19,384
You're very good, you
carry on like this,

169
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:21,284
oh you carry on like this.

170
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,251
Or dinner will go cold,

171
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,318
which would be an improvement.

172
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,351
Not as cold as the
manage though, eh sir?

173
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,151
Sorry madam.

174
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,117
You're very kind.

175
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:31,750
Now listen, now listen,
here's one for you.

176
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,617
You'll like this one,
well you better that,

177
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,984
or they won't have me back.

178
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,684
Well?

179
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:43,517
Officially, it
was a suicide.

180
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,550
Wheatley wasn't brave
enough to commit suicide,

181
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,351
he was terrified
when he called me.

182
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,951
Someone's got to him first.

183
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,951
Everything he said was right.

184
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,550
20 girls, the governess,
the maid, part time cook.

185
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,784
I need more than this.

186
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,517
Are you getting on with the
governess, an Ilse Keller?

187
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,483
My German helps.

188
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,017
At least it's good
for something.

189
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,117
<i>Keep searching the house.</i>

190
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,217
We're running out of time.

191
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:17,951
Hitler's in bed with Stalin,
and has a free hand in Poland.

192
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:24,550
The war office believes
the Germans will extract

193
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,483
the girls before
the end of summer.

194
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,284
And the early exit can
only signal one thing.

195
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,917
We will detain the
girls before that.

196
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:39,051
But if we jump too soon, we'd
start the whole bloody thing.

197
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,483
What kind of plan is this?

198
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:43,251
Strange times, Miller.

199
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,450
And every game of
chess needs it pawns.

200
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:50,017
They're just girls sir.

201
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,284
They are the daughters
and goddaughters

202
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,483
of the Nazi high command,

203
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:58,984
so you remember
who's side you're on.

204
00:20:59,017 --> 00:20:59,817
As soon as there's movement

205
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,384
we'll take the
school lock stock.

206
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:04,217
Hold the lot.

207
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,251
As prisoners.

208
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:08,284
Will you wake up, Miller?

209
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:12,951
This next war will be like
nothing we've ever seen.

210
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,418
And I'm over there,
if I come over there,

211
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,617
I'll be over there
and then neither

212
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,450
of us will be over there,
you need to come over here.

213
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,151
And she said, over
there, over there,

214
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:21,650
it's all over everywhere.

215
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,450
I said did you say
it's all over her?

216
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,117
Those are the words I've been
waiting to hear for 25 years.

217
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:34,951
♪ Walk upon England's
mountains green ♪

218
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:40,483
♪ And was the holy Lamb of God ♪

219
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:44,984
♪ On England's pleasant
pastures seen ♪

220
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:16,542
...because you are flesh from our flesh
and blood from our blood.

221
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:22,208
The same spirit that dominates us,
burns in your young minds.

222
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,917
As the columns of our movement

223
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:39,250
sweep through Germany today...

224
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:46,166
I know you will join with them.

225
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,125
We know around us is Germany.
Within us Germany marches...

226
00:23:55,291 --> 00:24:00,125
and behind us Germany follows!

227
00:24:02,684 --> 00:24:06,583
Seig Heil!

228
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,517
Come in.

229
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:51,450
Ms. Rocholl.

230
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:02,318
It means "hail victory"
Mr. Miller, that's all.

231
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,051
We shouldn't apologize
for passion, for pride.

232
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,517
Why should we criticize a
country that strives to be great?

233
00:25:22,351 --> 00:25:24,750
Bexhill was a wonderful
town to grow up in.

234
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:29,117
The seaside, the
Downs, the community.

235
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,884
As a little girl
I felt very safe,

236
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:35,418
my father doted on me

237
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,351
and he instilled in
me a sense of pride.

238
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:45,750
My teaching and my school
is dedicated to that.

239
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:52,517
These girls are my life.

240
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:58,984
They give me hope,
that's why I join in

241
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,418
when they say hail victory.

242
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,483
Seig Heil, Mr. Miller.

243
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,483
I don't expect
you to understand.

244
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:18,817
<i>Wish the wish</i>

245
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,550
But if you wish the wish
the wish the witch wishes,

246
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,917
I do not wish the
wish you wish to wish.

247
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,318
Good.

248
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,717
Peter piper.

249
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,984
Peter piper picked a
pack of pickled peppers.

250
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:46,951
There you are.

251
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,117
Checking up
on me Mr. Miller?

252
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:04,583
I was worried about you.

253
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,318
The girls were
worried about you.

254
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:10,418
You're not a very
good liar, Mr. Miller.

255
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:14,750
The girls don't like me.

256
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:19,717
I'm happy with it, I
understand more than them.

257
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:24,217
Yes, I think perhaps you do.

258
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:39,583
But you don't look very happy.

259
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:44,284
Gretel, what happened
with Mr. Wheatley...

260
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:47,384
Fräulein Keller says
I must over come

261
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:49,051
my fears if I am to be strong.

262
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:51,951
Gretel.

263
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:53,917
Do you think she is right?

264
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,184
Gretel it is all right
to be frightened.

265
00:27:58,784 --> 00:27:59,617
Really?

266
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:04,951
Yes.

267
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:09,550
What frightens you Mr. Miller?

268
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:13,984
Astrid.

269
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:21,217
<i>Time to come in girls.</i>

270
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:24,318
<i>It's choir practice
in ten minutes!</i>

271
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,318
I'm still not sure about this.

272
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:44,750
After what happened, maybe
it's what the girls need.

273
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:45,750
A change of scene.

274
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,384
We mustn't stray too far.

275
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,418
It might do us all some
good to be out and about,

276
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,850
and Fräulein Keller
tells me the views

277
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:54,951
from Pevensey castle
are magnificent.

278
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:58,450
I wish I could say the same
for the choice of transport.

279
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:07,817
Oh Ronnie,
what do you get by?

280
00:29:09,418 --> 00:29:10,917
Guten morgen.

281
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,051
To you as well.

282
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:12,884
What's going on here then?

283
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,784
First line of defense isn't it?

284
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:17,884
We're here to pull
our finger out.

285
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,550
This port's got
a look out post.

286
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,684
This port?

287
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,084
What do you think
Hitlers gonna do,

288
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:23,650
steal the fish and chips?

289
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:25,517
We need to be prepared.

290
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,750
Right oh Ronnie lad, tada.

291
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:35,384
Dirty krauts.

292
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,084
Come on lads, pick it up.

293
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,884
They needed, we needed this.

294
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,208
I can almost see Germany!

295
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:57,589
Be careful girls.

296
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,916
Mama, save me from all this terrible food...

297
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,333
and swimming caps!

298
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,250
And the rain too!

299
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:08,917
Girls, quieten down.

300
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:10,784
Mr. Miller's quite right.

301
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:12,917
You'll wake up the
sleeping giant.

302
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:15,017
Are there giants here?

303
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:17,483
Ask Ms. Rocholl.

304
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:20,450
They walked the land and
lived on the top of hill tops

305
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,351
where they could see
the whole of England.

306
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:23,318
What did they do?

307
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,617
Made a nuisance I expect.

308
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:27,850
Like Sigrid.

309
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:31,284
A giant was employed
to protect the castle.

310
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:35,384
They fed him in bread, and
mustard, and a hogs head of beer.

311
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:40,318
He slept on the
shore down there.

312
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:42,418
Why else do you think
the land is so flat?

313
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:45,117
He must have been heavy.

314
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:47,384
Heavier than a steam ship.

315
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:50,084
They say he could walk
from Dover to France

316
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:52,284
without getting his head wet.

317
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,217
Look at you, Mr. Miller.

318
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,483
Quite the gentleman.

319
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:31,817
And you are looking very
elegant tonight Fräulein Keller.

320
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,684
Thank you.

321
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,084
Shall we?

322
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:36,951
Yes.

323
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:51,617
I just would like
to say, thank you.

324
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:56,351
Thank you.

325
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,717
<i>The girls will be</i>
<i>delighted to know you're here.</i>

326
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:09,951
<i>Through here, we
shouldn't really</i>

327
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:12,117
do this without first
asking Frau Rocholl

328
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,351
but I know how much
you love Royter.

329
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,117
Yes, she's very
proud of this piece.

330
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:19,951
It's delightful.

331
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:20,817
Isn't it?

332
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:25,184
The fire dance, he made
only seven of these.

333
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,833
Tomorrow night.

334
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,833
Tomorrow?

335
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,167
I need more time.

336
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:34,957
I have orders.

337
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,750
The girls must leave before the war starts.

338
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,124
You have a location?

339
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,125
- Yes.
- Safe?

340
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,875
Safe for the plane to land?

341
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,625
Yes.

342
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:50,541
What is this?

343
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:52,084
A microfilm.

344
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,875
A list of British operatives
working in Germany.

345
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:57,666
Everyone. Everything.

346
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:04,000
You think the Führer would allow this trip
if there wasn't something in it for him?

347
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:08,416
He wants them back. All of us.

348
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,500
He wants you to do your duty.

349
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:13,375
The girls cannot be captured.

350
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,042
Where is the location?

351
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:20,151
Ilse, is everything all right?

352
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:25,750
I was just showing the
minister your Royter.

353
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:28,351
Forgive me, I'm a
private collector.

354
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,984
I just had to see it for myself.

355
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,483
Of course.

356
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:34,684
Please, come and
meet Lord Brocket.

357
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,650
He's a close friend
of Astrid's father.

358
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,583
Certainly.

359
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:04,650
<i>Ilse,
have you seen Mr. Miller?</i>

360
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:05,850
<i>Oh Astrid, there you are,</i>

361
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:08,717
<i>will you assemble
the girls upstairs?</i>

362
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,084
They say the making of
a great relationship

363
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,483
is based on two things.

364
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:17,151
Firstly, appreciate
the similarities.

365
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:22,318
And secondly, respect
the differences.

366
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,284
Tonight we link arms across

367
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:29,550
the sea to celebrate a
very special relationship.

368
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:33,684
On behalf of the Anglo
German Fellowship,

369
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:38,717
may I present the Augusta
Victoria College for Girls.

370
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:52,850
Concentrate Sigrid.

371
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,917
Before grace, there's strength,

372
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:56,380
and before strength, there's...

373
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,514
Pain!

374
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,051
Training.

375
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,291
You think you're better than us?

376
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:53,151
I'll arrange our meetings,
stay in your lane, Miller.

377
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,418
I'm not a fan of initiative.

378
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,517
The girls are leaving.

379
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,384
When?

380
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,251
Tomorrow.

381
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,117
How do you know?

382
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:02,318
Ilse Keller, tonight's
Anglo-German soiree,

383
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:04,650
over heard her talking
to her contact.

384
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:05,984
How is she getting
the girls out?

385
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:06,850
By airplane.

386
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:07,817
Where?

387
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:18,717
I call the war
office with this,

388
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,084
can you assure me you
haven't been compromised?

389
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:22,284
Yes!

390
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,318
Are you sure?

391
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,450
Damn!

392
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,318
Gun.

393
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,151
Call Whitehall 1154.

394
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:00,384
Raise the alarm.

395
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:02,517
Colonel.

396
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,418
Colonel!

397
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:06,884
Colonel!

398
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,917
Hey, stay where you are!

399
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,784
Don't move!

400
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:42,884
What have you done?

401
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:43,750
I did not do this.

402
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,217
Jole's, get over here!

403
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,084
He's off, stop him!

404
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,750
Stop, police!

405
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,384
<i>Spread out boys!</i>

406
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:50,384
<i>The other lads will meet
us up there with the dogs.</i>

407
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:51,717
<i>Christ, it's him!</i>

408
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,951
There he is.

409
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:21,583
The police are
saying he's dangerous. A murderer.

410
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,375
Why would he do such a thing?

411
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,292
Did we really know him?

412
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,000
He was our teacher... we liked him.

413
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:34,984
Here comes Ilse.

414
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:45,017
It can often be hard to
tell who someone really is.

415
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,750
Who's good, and who is bad.

416
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:52,917
Can you tell the difference?

417
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:54,517
Well it's not always easy.

418
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:00,951
How can you tell a difference
between the wasp and the bee?

419
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:04,151
Wasps can't make honey.

420
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,017
Good.

421
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,650
Who can give
me another example?

422
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,384
Gretel.

423
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:13,884
Alligators and crocodiles.

424
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,550
And how do we tell
the difference?

425
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:19,884
Their teeth.

426
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:20,750
And?

427
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:27,750
The shape of their skull.

428
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,750
The jew and the gentile.

429
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,817
Just as we were
fooled by Herr Miller.

430
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:04,351
It may not appear easy at
first to identify the jew.

431
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:08,884
But there are ways we can tell.

432
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,418
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

433
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,418
I just wondered, with
everything that's happened,

434
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,284
whether the girls
might like a break.

435
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:23,184
Tea, perhaps?

436
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:26,984
Maybe after the class.

437
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,117
You must forget about her,
forget about this place.

438
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:55,017
Germany's your home.

439
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,550
<i>What do you think this
is, Shangri-la?</i>

440
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:32,917
We're on at the winter
gardens in an hour!

441
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:35,418
Look lively, and Bill, watch

442
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,217
you don't get sand
in your flugelhorn.

443
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,750
Come on Jackie, chop, chop.

444
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:42,650
But sir, come on,
we just got here.

445
00:45:42,684 --> 00:45:44,351
Now, if you please.

446
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:45,450
Smarten yourself up.

447
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:47,583
And if you lot get on the bus

448
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:50,550
before Hitler invades Poland,
I'll buy you all an ice cream.

449
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,550
Very funny.

450
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:56,984
Very funny.

451
00:45:58,084 --> 00:46:00,051
Which one of you fellas
nicked me clothes then?

452
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,151
<i>His
name is Thomas Miller,</i>

453
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:19,684
<i>beware of this man, he
is accused of murder.</i>

454
00:46:19,717 --> 00:46:24,717
<i>If you see him report him
to the nearest constable.</i>

455
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:30,684
<i>Gas masks in Warwick,
I mean what is the world coming to?</i>

456
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:32,550
Well you better get used
to it, she says to me

457
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:35,583
because when the balloon goes
up, it's gonna be pandemonium.

458
00:46:37,684 --> 00:46:39,418
Gotta be here somewhere.

459
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,984
No, it's this school
teacher Chappy

460
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:44,650
who's giving me
the heebie-jeebies.

461
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:46,450
Well haven't you heard?

462
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:47,917
Killed a colonel.

463
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:50,750
They say he is a Nazi spy.

464
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:53,184
I have to make a phone call.

465
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:54,817
Wait your turn.

466
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,351
Anyway, as I was saying...

467
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:59,318
It's really urgent, I
have to make it now.

468
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:01,850
Stan, Stan, he's jumping in.

469
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:03,717
What's your game then?

470
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,217
I really need to
make this call now.

471
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,051
Wait your turn now.

472
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,517
It's government business...

473
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,717
Yeah, and I'm Charlie
Chapman, now keel off.

474
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,384
- You don't understand.
- Is everything all right here?

475
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:13,384
Do you want some of this?
I'm warning you.

476
00:47:13,418 --> 00:47:15,284
- Yeah, all right, all right.
- Go on, peel off!

477
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:16,784
This chap he just barged in.

478
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:17,884
Right foot!

479
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:18,717
Are you all right...

480
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,550
Down there.

481
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,450
Are you all right darling?

482
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,917
You've not paid.

483
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:12,750
Hey, hey you.

484
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:16,583
Hey.

485
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:18,351
Is that my uniform?

486
00:48:18,384 --> 00:48:20,217
You blind, look at me.

487
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:23,817
That's my uniform,
that's me uniform.

488
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,850
Hey you, hey, you think!

489
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:39,917
Jackie lads!

490
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,084
Where do you
think you're going?

491
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:43,318
Hey, it's me uniform!

492
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:44,251
Come on!

493
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:42,450
Boiled eggs and vinegar.

494
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,418
It's good for the
bruises old boy.

495
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,917
That's what my mother told me.

496
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:00,784
Sargent.

497
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:02,483
Sir.

498
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,750
Captain Drey, cabinet office.

499
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:14,984
Love the get up old boy.

500
00:50:15,017 --> 00:50:15,917
It's not mine.

501
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:19,550
Which makes you a
thief and a murderer.

502
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,850
And a spy.

503
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,884
That's Corporal Willis,

504
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:25,583
and as you can see,
he's very thorough.

505
00:50:25,617 --> 00:50:28,517
Yes, let's not forget spy.

506
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,450
German spy.

507
00:50:30,483 --> 00:50:31,784
See what I mean.

508
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:38,517
I trust you know
why you're here.

509
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,617
You're accused of
killing Colonel Smith.

510
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:46,151
Late of this parish and
hero of the great war.

511
00:50:46,184 --> 00:50:47,817
Telephone my superiors
in Whitehall,

512
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,684
they'll tell you I
was working for Smith.

513
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:50,684
I didn't kill him.

514
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:55,517
Call them.

515
00:50:56,517 --> 00:50:57,717
Number?

516
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,318
1154.

517
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:02,850
Six minutes to midnight.

518
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:08,084
They haven't used that
number since Cable street.

519
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,650
Whitehall, 1154.

520
00:51:29,884 --> 00:51:32,051
I don't have much time.

521
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:33,850
<i>Can you put me through or not?</i>

522
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:35,750
We're on the same side.

523
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:36,984
<i>Whitehall 1154.</i>

524
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,217
Well?

525
00:51:58,251 --> 00:51:59,151
Yes, it's as I thought,

526
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:00,550
that number went out
with Uncle Stanley.

527
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:02,351
Nice try Miller.

528
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:03,217
Call it again.

529
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:06,084
But there's no one there.

530
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:08,550
Shall I start the car sir?

531
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,384
Thank you, Willis.

532
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,418
Call it again.

533
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,483
If you want answers,
call that number again.

534
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:16,151
<i>Sing a different song Miller.</i>

535
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:17,884
Slippery little sod, isn't he?

536
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,351
Give me the key
to the handcuffs.

537
00:52:19,384 --> 00:52:20,784
Ticktok.

538
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:25,184
I know who killed Smith, I
discovered their exit plans,

539
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:28,051
I am not a German spy,
I am a British agent.

540
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:33,184
I have evidence.

541
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:36,450
A list of Nazi conspirators,
English traitors.

542
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:39,784
Get me out of here
and I can prove it.

543
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:45,184
Show me.

544
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:07,017
Get out.

545
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,450
Ms. Rocholl, I believe?

546
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:21,318
Yes.

547
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:24,550
What is this, why are
you bringing him here?

548
00:53:26,684 --> 00:53:28,784
Gathering evidence ma'am.

549
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:30,650
I don't want
my girls disturbed.

550
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:34,017
They're German, aren't they?

551
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:36,318
My girls are not the enemy.

552
00:53:36,351 --> 00:53:37,951
They'll hardly know we're here.

553
00:53:46,384 --> 00:53:47,684
Fräulein Keller?

554
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:54,318
Is there anything I
can help you with?

555
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:56,384
Most certainly,
don't go anywhere.

556
00:53:58,284 --> 00:53:59,850
Nobody leaves.

557
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,750
I don't like your tone.

558
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:03,617
Ilse.

559
00:54:05,017 --> 00:54:07,984
It's quite all right,
I get that a lot.

560
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:09,917
Where's your room?

561
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:12,351
Lead on.

562
00:54:51,351 --> 00:54:54,351
Have the girls step into the
garden until this is over.

563
00:54:54,384 --> 00:54:55,284
Yes.

564
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,984
Well?

565
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:24,884
The fireplace, reach up inside.

566
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:35,717
Anything?

567
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,617
Give us a moment,
will you Willis?

568
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,051
That's an order corporal.

569
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,051
Ah.

570
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:10,184
Careless of me, the
corporal has the keys.

571
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:16,251
But don't worry old boy, if
this is what you say it is

572
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:21,318

I find it calms me after
everything that's happened.

578

It doesn't bother me.

579
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,217

be staying for?

594
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:56,750
<i>in operation here
at the school?</i>

595
00:57:56,784 --> 00:57:58,084
<i>Just over a week.</i>

596
00:57:58,117 --> 00:57:59,917
<i>Tell me
about the Keller woman.</i>

597
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:00,750
She killed Smith.

598
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:01,917
Why?

599
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:04,384
Her operation was compromised.

600
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:06,617
<i>The Germans are
extracting the girls,</i>

601
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,884
<i>and she found out that we knew.</i>

602
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,184
So your cover is blown.

603
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,017
It's just you and
Smith, no bridge agent?

604
00:58:22,284 --> 00:58:23,517
What are you doing?

605
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,351
You can't be in here.

606
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:26,617
Why is he here?

607
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,351
That's none of your business.

608
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:30,284
You have any questions you
can speak to my corporal.

609
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:32,984
He's getting restless
so hurry it up.

610
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:07,084
Had you searched
his room properly,

611
00:59:07,117 --> 00:59:08,717
I'd have no reason to come here.

612
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:13,251
First Wheatley, now him.

613
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,084
Are they ready for tonight?

614
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:18,517
Yes.

615
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:24,617
And you, are you ready
to do what is necessary?

616
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:28,084
No one, nothing
gets left behind.

617
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:32,017
Yes.

618
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:51,151
I believe the word
you're looking for,

619
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:52,151
is <i>"danka".</i>

620
00:59:55,184 --> 00:59:56,017
Now leave us.

621
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,151
Gretel, what are
you doing here?

622
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,084
I was looking for
you Fräulein Keller.

623
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:08,850
Out, outside.

624
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:24,117
The war with Germany will
be the end of England.

625
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,151
An alliance is our only
hope that we can live.

626
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,951
And live with greatness.

627
01:00:37,184 --> 01:00:38,517
Hail Victory.

628
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:47,984
Save your strength.

629
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,084
You need to be ready.

630
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:03,850
Yes.

631
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:08,217
Here, let me.

632
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,550
My mother used to brush my hair.

633
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:21,017
And it had to be
brushed 100 times.

634
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:27,817
And if she found a knot,

635
01:02:32,617 --> 01:02:33,550
hand, hand.

636
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,117
What were you doing
outside Herr Miller's room?

637
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,750
Clever girl.

638
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,550
Always watching.

639
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,550
So you're not a teacher?

640
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:32,284
No.

641
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:35,550
Are you English?

642
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:36,650
My mother was.

643
01:03:38,817 --> 01:03:39,717
So you're a spy?

644
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:42,517
Apparently.

645
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:45,184
Is your name Thomas?

646
01:03:45,217 --> 01:03:46,051
Yes!

647
01:03:47,051 --> 01:03:50,384
Good, all this change
will kill ya, get on.

648
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,784
I have to make
a telephone call.

649
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,284
Not here mate, I'm afraid
the mines are caput.

650
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:53,418
Let's have a look.

651
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:57,418
This should do the trick.

652
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,051
Let's get you some clothes.

653
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:12,251
Out of the way old fella.

654
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,450
Clothes do the job?

655
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:14,284
Yes, thank you

656
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:16,017
This will help
take the edge off.

657
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:19,418
So what do you need a phone for?

658
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:23,650
I have to stop this Ilse
Keller taking the girls

659
01:05:23,684 --> 01:05:26,450
and her intelligence
back to Germany.

660
01:05:26,483 --> 01:05:28,184
Intelligence?

661
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:30,984
Details on British agents
operating behind the lines.

662
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:32,984
Oh bloody hell.

663
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:35,617
The balloon's going up then?

664
01:05:36,483 --> 01:05:38,483
What will happen to the girls?

665
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,151
They'll be detained
as prisoners of war.

666
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,850
Childhood is made up
with a few summers.

667
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:56,750
Quick, out of sight.

668
01:05:56,784 --> 01:05:58,550
I'll keep them busy.

669
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,917
- They're dangerous men Charlie.
- Save your breath.

670
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:06,583
Look inside that bus.

671
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:10,617
Whatever happens don't come
back inside, understand?

672
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:13,784
Find your moment and scarper,
those girls deserve better.

673
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:14,650
We all do.

674
01:06:16,117 --> 01:06:17,251
Charlie.

675
01:06:17,284 --> 01:06:18,184
My pleasure son.

676
01:06:46,617 --> 01:06:48,384
Can I help you gentlemen?

677
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:50,684
We're coming inside, Charlie.

678
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:53,550
Just a minute, old habits.

679
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:57,517
She'd kill me if we
messed up the carpet.

680
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,884
Where is your good lady?

681
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,917
Like I say, old habits.

682
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,583
Did Thomas Miller hurt you?

683
01:07:11,684 --> 01:07:13,084
Nothing I couldn't handle.

684
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:15,784
Good man.

685
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:20,051
He took some clothes, didn't
say much, then legged it.

686
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:44,917
Single malt.

687
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:48,650
Old habits?

688
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:50,717
Something like that.

689
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:51,717
Cup of tea?

690
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,917
What a good idea Charlie,
shall I be mother?

691
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,483
Sit down, Charlie.

692
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:40,583
If you've helped a
foreign spy, it's treason.

693
01:08:42,483 --> 01:08:44,017
You'll be hanged, yes.

694
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,817
And that's not clever.

695
01:08:50,717 --> 01:08:53,418
So are you a traitor, Charlie?

696
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,884
I'm not a bloody traitor,
he's half German,

697
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,251
half English, I helped
the English half of him.

698
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,583
Bravo.

699
01:09:09,684 --> 01:09:14,684
So where did he go?

700
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,583
Astrid, Beatrix,
what's going on?

701
01:09:34,284 --> 01:09:37,717
Ilse, Ilse, what is this?

702
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,251
I demand an explanation.

703
01:09:40,284 --> 01:09:41,784
Where are you taking my girls?

704
01:09:44,418 --> 01:09:45,884
They were never your girls.

705
01:09:46,884 --> 01:09:47,917
Ilse.

706
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:49,951
Stay where you are girls.

707
01:09:51,151 --> 01:09:52,750
Stop this at once.

708
01:10:01,684 --> 01:10:03,917
Ilse, what happened to you?

709
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:09,017
I grew up.

710
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,850
<i>Operator, number please.</i>

711
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,684
Whitehall, 1154.

712
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,051
<i>I'm sorry,
could you give me that number again?</i>

713
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,884
Whitehall, 1154.

714
01:11:11,984 --> 01:11:13,850
<i>Connecting you now.</i>

715
01:11:17,184 --> 01:11:19,951
Hello, hello!

716
01:11:22,684 --> 01:11:23,450
Can you hear me?

717
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,151
<i>I hear you loud and clear.</i>

718
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,850
Do you have the correct time?

719
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,051
It is six minutes to midnight.

720
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:33,251
<i>Repeat that please.</i>

721
01:11:33,284 --> 01:11:36,051
It is six minutes to midnight!

722
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,217
<i>You have clearance.</i>

723
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,450
This is Thomas Miller, send
a TX84 to Bexhill-On-Sea.

724
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:41,750
<i>Relax!</i>

725
01:11:41,784 --> 01:11:43,051
<i>Hello?</i>

726
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:44,717
Put that down!

727
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,951
<i>Agent Miller, please repeat.</i>

728
01:11:45,984 --> 01:11:47,583
<i>Step out of there!</i>

729
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:48,817
<i>Agent Miller, please...</i>

730
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:03,151
What happens now?

731
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:04,384
We take you in.

732
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:05,318
Where to?

733
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:06,617
End of a bloody noose.

734
01:12:08,184 --> 01:12:09,318
Corporal, ask your captain

735
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:11,884
how he knows
Fräulein Ilse Keller.

736
01:12:17,017 --> 01:12:18,550
Desperate Miller.

737
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,084
Tell the corporal what
information you gave her.

738
01:12:22,318 --> 01:12:23,684
Shall I handcuff him sir?

739
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,184
No, that won't be necessary.

740
01:12:32,617 --> 01:12:35,684
This is on you
Miller, remember that.

741
01:13:29,884 --> 01:13:32,418
<i>German girls are
leaving tonight, Sussex coast,</i>

742
01:13:32,483 --> 01:13:35,450
<i>location unknown, send
aircraft to intercept.</i>

743
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:36,717
<i>We are running out of time.</i>

744
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,517
Message understood
Captain Miller.

745
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:43,884
They're leaving, alert
the air defense fleet.

746
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:05,850
If they're gonna struck
the girls by air,

747
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:07,650
you're gonna have to
find an air field!

748
01:14:07,684 --> 01:14:08,984
Yes, but where?

749
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:25,984
You're too late.

750
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,217
She's taken them
away, all of them.

751
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:41,984
My girls.

752
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,583
Stop it! Please!

753
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:12,083
Keep walking. There's no time.

754
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,959
Trust it to be you.

755
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,125
Sorry, it was an old case.

756
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:26,750
Not her fault.

757
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:28,875
My case was too heavy.

758
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:31,625
Are we walking to Germany?

759
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,250
Or is this another of your silly exercises?

760
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:35,041
Don't be difficult Astrid.

761
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,208
Stop moving!

762
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,834
Keep walking!

763
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,958
Astrid, don't do this...

764
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,375
We're not going to follow you.

765
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:55,750
Your family needs you home, Astrid.

766
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,208
Who tells you these orders?

767
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,667
Who gave you the power?

768
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,917
It is not about power.

769
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:05,458
- No?
- No!

770
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:09,458
England doesn't want us.
Can't you see that?

771
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:13,166
I'm trying to protect you.

772
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:16,041
How?

773
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:20,250
What can you do, Fräulein Keller?

774
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,417
We're turning back!

775
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,000
I admire your strength, Astrid.

776
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:36,625
Start walking now!

777
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,083
Move!

778
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,958
Get up!

779
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:56,251
<i>I have to find
them, they're in danger.</i>

780
01:16:57,617 --> 01:16:58,817
They're being taken out by air,

781
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,951
did Ilse mention a
place somewhere remote,

782
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,784
flat, where they
could land a plane?

783
01:17:17,017 --> 01:17:21,850
You'll need bread, and mustard,
and a hogs head of beer.

784
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:33,318
Out beyond Pevensey
castle, the flat sands.

785
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,318
I've been there.

786
01:17:40,884 --> 01:17:41,717
Corporal Willis?

787
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:47,151
I'm done.

788
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:51,817
Go.

789
01:17:53,784 --> 01:17:55,184
Go.

790
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:56,051
Wait!

791
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,284
If you think for
a second I'm going

792
01:17:58,318 --> 01:17:59,984
to be left behind, you're wrong.

793
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:38,184
<i>How many
bullets in the chamber?</i>

794
01:18:40,017 --> 01:18:41,517
Who are you Thomas Miller?

795
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,884
How many bullets?

796
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:45,750
Five.

797
01:18:47,517 --> 01:18:49,217
You're not going to hurt them?

798
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:50,583
I'm British intelligence.

799
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:52,951
A spy.

800
01:18:54,517 --> 01:18:55,318
Are you alone?

801
01:18:55,351 --> 01:18:56,784
Whitehall are on their way.

802
01:18:58,384 --> 01:19:00,051
What will they do to them?

803
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:01,684
You needn't worry about them,

804
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:05,550
but if Ilse's mission fails,
she'll leave nothing behind.

805
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:09,151
I don't understand.

806
01:19:09,184 --> 01:19:10,351
Germany can't afford the girls

807
01:19:10,384 --> 01:19:12,284
to be captured, so
she will kill them.

808
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:15,051
She's one of them.

809
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,051
Not anymore.

810
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:43,717
I trusted her.

811
01:20:45,684 --> 01:20:46,817
I've been living a lie.

812
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,318
Hail victory.

813
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,151
There's nothing to be won here.

814
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,875
Wait!

815
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:51,334
Get ready!

816
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,125
Now!

817
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:27,450
Christ have mercy.

818
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:32,650
We're too late.

819
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,251
Fräulein Keller.

820
01:24:07,318 --> 01:24:08,047
Fräulein Keller.

821
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,292
Quiet!

822
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,917
Drop your flares.

823
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,666
Come closer.

824
01:24:43,017 --> 01:24:43,850
Ilse!

825
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:49,017
It's over.

826
01:25:01,951 --> 01:25:03,684
Ilse, this is finished.

827
01:25:03,717 --> 01:25:05,784
If only you were right!

828
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:08,483
Turn.

829
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:10,284
Turn!

830
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,717
Ilse don't.

831
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:45,650
Ilse!

832
01:25:58,117 --> 01:25:59,318
What are you doing?

833
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,384
Ilse!

834
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:23,583
Ilse!

835
01:26:28,318 --> 01:26:29,984
This is not the way!

836
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:34,550
Gretel get back!

837
01:27:15,184 --> 01:27:17,017
Gretel, you're cold.

838
01:27:18,251 --> 01:27:19,450
I was scared.

839
01:27:21,117 --> 01:27:21,951
Brave girl.

840
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:25,650
Braver than all of us.

841
01:28:15,017 --> 01:28:16,351
Where will you be going?

842
01:28:17,784 --> 01:28:19,817
The war office
expects me back.

843
01:28:20,784 --> 01:28:22,351
It seems I still have my uses.

844
01:28:24,117 --> 01:28:25,483
The girls will remain here under

845
01:28:25,517 --> 01:28:28,284
your care until a
solution can be agreed.

846
01:28:31,017 --> 01:28:32,817
Not bad for a
journeyman teacher.

847
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:37,583
Faith and perseverance?

848
01:28:39,117 --> 01:28:39,951
Quite.

849
01:28:53,184 --> 01:28:58,017

<i>This morning, the

861

<i>in Berlin handed the

862

<i>the final note, stating that
