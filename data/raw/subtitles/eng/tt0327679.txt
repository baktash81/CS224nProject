1
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:26,782
(narrator) Aairy tales tell,
as their labels imply,

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,661
stories of magic, of creatures that fly.

3
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,064
With giants and dragons
and ogres and elves,

4
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:39,071
and inanimate objects
that speak for themselves.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,041
Strange magic

6
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,172
Oh, what a strange magic

7
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:54,084
Oh, it's a strange magic

8
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:58,147
Got a strange magic

9
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,719
Got a strange magic

10
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,324
There's romance and danger
and plotting of schemes.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,066
There's good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between.

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,445
A fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth,

13
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,107
the perils of choices we face in our youth.

14
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,616
But our story today is different in theme,

15
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,785
for our hero had no choice,
or so it would seem.

16
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:40,798
- (cat meows)
-  Strange magic

17
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:45,361
It starts with a fairy bestowing a spell.

18
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,432
This one's for a baby named Ella of Arell.

19
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,877
Got a strange magic

20
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,976
Got a strange magic

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,543
Now, now, Ella. Mother's here.

22
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,626
There, now. Oh, dear Ella.

23
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:16,199
Oh, it's nothing a little burping won't cure.

24
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,165
- Up.
- There, now.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,970
Come on. All the way.

26
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,501
l gotta work on that.

27
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,012
Whoa!

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,242
Hello, ladies!

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,874
Lucinda!

30
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,820
- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.

31
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,048
Whoa!

32
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,286
Ah!

33
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,324
Lucinda here. Fairy par excellence.

34
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,131
Now, where's the baby?

35
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,300
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.

36
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,537
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.

37
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:04,072
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.

38
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,017
(baby cries)

39
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,021
Oh, look. She's back.

40
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,149
All right.

41
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,994
What shall we give
this beautiful little child today?

42
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,625
- What's her name again?
- Ella.

43
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,690
Ah.

44
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,203
Ella of Frell.

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,568
Not a very well-behaved
little stinker, is she?

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,839
Quiet, please. l can't concentrate here.

47
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,847
Ella of Frell,
l give you the gift of obedience.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
Now, go to sleep.

49
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,252
Now, wake up.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,429
- lsn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.

51
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,233
lt's a terrible gift to have to do
what you're told. Take it back.

52
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,570
l have a no-return policy.

53
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:08,274
And if you're going to be ungrateful, l can
always turn her into a squirrel instead.

54
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,511
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.

55
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,485
Besides, you should thank me.

56
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:19,491
l've just given you the perfect child.

57
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,496
ln spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.

58
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,666
Her gift made her obedient,
but her heart made her kind.

59
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,936
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

60
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,639
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.

61
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,641
- Nobody wants you here.
- l do.

62
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,746
Bite me.

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,689
Did you just see what Ella did?

64
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,656
l made your favorite,
so dig in and stuff your face.

65
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,724
l'm gonna get forks.

66
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,204
Sweetie, stop.

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,070
l always knew
something was wrong with me.

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,979
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.

69
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,108
l'm only a household fairy, honey.

70
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,051
Besides, according to fairy guidelines,

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,251
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back, and we've begged her.

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,625
Not only that, but she said
she'd turn your mother into a squirrel

73
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,598
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again.

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,930
lt's not fair.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,870
l know, darling. l know.

76
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,739
So Ella now knew
why she'd always obeyed.

77
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,211
But she never stopped fighting
to have things her way.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,875
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.

79
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,049
Fine, but l'll take
my own sweet time doing it.

80
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,055
Hurry up, now.

81
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,484
As she struggled
to find a way out of her gift,

82
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:08,557
she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift.

83
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,000
Please get well, Mother.

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,800
Listen to me.

85
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,310
Only Mandy and l know about the gift.

86
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,541
We've never even told your father.

87
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,909
And you must never tell anyone else.

88
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,951
- l don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.

89
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:36,757
Remember, no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do,

90
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,158
look to yourself, Ella.

91
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,695
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

92
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,722
Take this, then l'll always be with you.

93
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,363
A strange magic

94
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,535
Strange magic

95
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,568
A strange magic

96
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,807
(Mandy) Ella.

97
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,939
Your father would like to speak to you.

98
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,978
- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.

99
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,318
And she's very fond of my title.

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,915
lt was either get married or sell the house.

101
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,257
You'll adore Dame Olga,
and her two daughters.

102
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,957
She'll make a wonderful mother.

103
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,398
Well, a motherlike figure.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,165
Look, l'm sure
you'll all be the best of friends.

105
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,168
Whoa!

106
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,605
ls this the right address?

107
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,982
There must be some mistake.

108
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,044
My dear, welcome.

109
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,290
And these must be your lovely daughters.

110
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,854
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.

111
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,631
Oh.

112
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,932
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.

113
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,997
Yes. The house looks delightful.

114
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,976
But l do seem to remember
that at the noblemen's convention

115
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,342
you said that you lived in a castle.

116
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,439
No, l said a man's home is his castle.

117
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,283
Hi. l'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.

118
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,286
What's with the prince pinups?

119
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,351
Hattie's president
of the Prince Char fan club.

120
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,295
Char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom.

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,235
So? He's dreamy.

122
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,340
ls this hutch meant to be a closet?

123
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,004
lt's pathetic.

124
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,072
My clothes need more room than this.

125
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,853
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?

126
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,687
Show it to us.

127
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,756
Oh.

128
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,770
lt's so... quaint.

129
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,136
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,845
There's no room in here, either.

131
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,785
We're gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room.

132
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,915
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.

133
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,686
Oh.

134
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,631
What's this? l do actually like this.

135
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,794
Please don't touch it. lt was my mother's.

136
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,860
- Can l have it?
- No.

137
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,168
Oh.

138
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,437
lt can be your welcome gift to me.

139
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,843
Come on, hand it over.

140
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,741
Oh.

141
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,809
Aren't you accommodating.

142
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,877
(giggling)

143
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:28,023
The second l sell the last of these,
l'll be back. l promise.

144
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,029
l know it's not a great job,
not even a good job -

145
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,864
OK, even a monkey could do it -
but we need the money, Ella.

146
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,430
- l'll miss you, Father.
- l'll miss you, too.

147
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,947
(Hattie) Hey, Olive, we should call her
Ella the Smella from Frella.

148
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,782
(giggling)

149
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,252
Elves, giants, ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony,

150
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,627
but when King Florian was killed,
allegedly by an ogre,

151
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,294
Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest,

152
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,860
keeping their land for himself.

153
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:17,773
Passionately put, Ella.
Give yourself a pat on the back.

154
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,867
(giggling)

155
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,935
(teacher) Hattie?

156
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,004
Oh.

157
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:31,350
What my unworthy opponent fails to realize

158
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:36,521
is Sir Edgar has done a fantastic job.

159
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,586
He has driven the ogres out,

160
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:43,124
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers.

161
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,762
Therefore, if it weren't for him,

162
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,604
we wouldn't have today's
thriving free-enterprise system.

163
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:54,135
lt's only free because we've enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing.

164
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:59,947
Edgar is a monster, and l don't hold out
much hope for his nephew, either.

165
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,046
Well, that shows what you know,
aka nothing.

166
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,293
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.

167
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,023
- Right, girls?
- (all) Yeah.

168
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,660
l wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince's politics

169
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,864
or how cute she thinks his butt is.

170
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,342
Admit you're stupid
and don't know what you're talking about.

171
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,380
l'm stupid and l don't know
what l'm talking about.

172
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,938
(teacher) Ella?

173
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,576
Anyway, in conclusion...

174
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,517
Hold your tongue, Ella.

175
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,920
(teacher) Ella!

176
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,189
My tongue itches.

177
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,925
(teacher) lf you're not going to take this
seriously, l declare Hattie the winner.

178
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,990
(applause)

179
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,227
Ya!

180
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,347
Uncle, do l have to go to this mall opening?

181
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,819
As heir to the throne,
it's your royal responsibility, Char.

182
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,325
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.

183
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,327
Only for a little while longer.

184
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,727
Your coronation is next week.

185
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,858
You need to be out there
with the people, Char.

186
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:27,304
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.

187
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,901
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.

188
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,968
What's not to trust?

189
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,241
Nothing.

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:41,275
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.

191
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,187
ln your absence,
the ogres have become impossible.

192
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:51,992
He's right. Even the giants have become
more and more treacherous.

193
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,097
But the giants have always been peaceful.

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:14:00,696
The ogres were peaceful too,
until they ripped your father to shreds.

195
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,504
And l promised your father,
should anything happen to him,

196
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,274
l would take care of you and the kingdom.

197
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,580
And, well, l've kept my promise, haven't l?

198
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,683
Whoa!

199
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,713
Likewise, you must keep
your promise to the people.

200
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:25,492
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.

201
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,124
( ''Walking On Sunshine')

202
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,536
(cheering)

203
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,409
Thank you.

204
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,380
Thank you. Thank you.

205
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,113
lt's wonderful to be here
in your charming town of... Frell.

206
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,712
Prince Charmont and l...

207
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,724
We want Char! We want Char!

208
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:58,092
We want Char! We want Char!
We want Char!

209
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:03,601
Now it is my great pleasure to welcome
my nephew, Prince Charmont.

210
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:16,347
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

211
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,111
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

212
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,880
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

213
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,414
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Ella! You are embarrassing us!

214
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,224
Go home now.

215
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,662
l have to go. l'm sorry.

216
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,231
l love you, Prince Char!

217
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,293
(screams)

218
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,035
Hey! Prince Char!

219
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:46,134
- Are you a fast runner?
- Not particularly, no. Why?

220
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,202
Get him!

221
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,651
I'm walking on sunshine

222
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,179
Whoa-oh

223
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,121
I'm walking on sunshine

224
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,555
Whoa-oh

225
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,957
- Ow!
- Shush, shush, shush!

226
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,961
And don't it feel good?

227
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,372
- Prince Charmont.
- Please, call me... call me Char.

228
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,772
Sorry about that.
Occupational hazard.

229
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,175
- Allow me.
- l don't need your chivalry, thanks.

230
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,011
And l've no intention of curtsying,
either, so forget it.

231
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:29,049
You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing l can do about it.

232
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,851
Except have you beheaded,
but that seems a bit extreme.

233
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,518
Charming. Why don't you do
what your people usually do?

234
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,585
Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.
lf you'll excuse me...

235
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,325
Wait a second. Come back here.

236
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,459
Hm?

237
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,835
What is your name?

238
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,272
Ella of Frell.

239
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,072
Well, Ella of Frell,

240
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,809
you're the first maiden l've met
who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.

241
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,875
Then maybe l've done you some good.

242
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,854
Look, l've never stolen
anyone's land or livelihood.

243
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,055
l want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone.

244
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,896
So you have a new plan
once you take the crown?

245
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,299
Well...

246
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,237
Sort of. Of course,
l couldn't reveal it to a subject.

247
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,604
That's what l thought.
You're all just the same.

248
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,940
You care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament.

249
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:32,040
No, actually, l've never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing.

250
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,416
Perhaps that's why l find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.

251
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,583
Obvious? And l was trying
so hard to hide it.

252
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,729
Where's my purse? lt's back there.

253
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,962
Wait right there. l will get it.

254
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,562
(sighs)

255
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,976
Prince Charmont!

256
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,960
Prince Charmont!

257
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,431
Your Highness.

258
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,670
Are you crazy? Why didn't you move?

259
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:35,646
l would have... were it not for your apparent
fascination with knocking me to the ground.

260
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,615
That's the second time today, you realize.

261
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,017
l'll try and be more considerate
next time l'm saving you.

262
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,046
Next time? What makes you think
we'll see each other again?

263
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,116
Well, won't we?

264
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,252
No.

265
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,531
Ella of Frell, you are not like other girls.

266
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,430
You have no idea.

267
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,996
Ella, come here.

268
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,978
Shouldn't you be at home
cleaning the fireplace, huh?

269
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,519
Stop flirting with him.

270
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,920
lt's me he's going to have at his coronation.

271
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,257
Yeah, in the middle of the table
with an apple in your mouth.

272
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,320
Go back to the mall with Olive.

273
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,427
- Ella.
- Oh.

274
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,268
Don't bother with her. Ugh.

275
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,803
l'm the one you want.
l know everything about you.

276
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,643
l've got posters of you, and pictures.

277
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,275
And when we used to live in Lamia,

278
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:52,915
l used to stand outside your castle and
watch you turn your lights on and off.

279
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,885
Tell Ella l'll be in touch.

280
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,459
Right. l'll see to that.

281
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,902
- Where were you?
- Oh.

282
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,236
- l met the prince.
- You met the prince?

283
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,970
l don't wanna talk about it.
Olive and Hattie were there.

284
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,808
Hattie. Why do you always do
what Hattie tells you to do?

285
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,905
- l don't.
- Yes, you do.

286
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,246
- l don't.
- Tell the truth.

287
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,842
Oh, l do.

288
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,514
Olive, have you noticed
anything strange about Ella?

289
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,990
No, not really.

290
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,053
Have you noticed it gets darker at night,
then lighter when the sun comes up?

291
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,997
- That's because of Ella?
- Never mind.

292
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,093
- You've been acting odd, even for you.
- What do you mean?

293
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,401
- Oh... Don't let her see me.
- That's what l mean.

294
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,997
Aha.

295
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,535
- Areida, no!
- Ella, come here.

296
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,604
l have to go.

297
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,013
- What?
- l need you to do me a little favor.

298
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,886
Take that.

299
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,427
Cool! Let me try! Take that.

300
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,194
And that potion bottle.

301
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,394
OK! OK, that's enough.

302
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:15,998
l think that's for me to say, Ella.
We need one more thing.

303
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,065
Take those.

304
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:26,509
- Please don't make me do this.
- Well, since you said please...

305
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,282
No. Take them. Take them!

306
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,124
Run!

307
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,059
Stop that girl!

308
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,724
Buy a squirrel sandwich.
Get 'em while they're hot.

309
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,926
Here. Keep the change.

310
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,992
Excuse me.

311
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,909
Excuse me. Coming through.

312
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,970
Try our new perfume.

313
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,141
Thanks.

314
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,919
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

315
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,961
Ella, bravo!

316
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,560
Freeze!

317
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,177
Put your hands together.

318
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,250
You're under arrest.

319
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:42,625
A felon in my own family.
l could die from embarrassment.

320
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,924
Promises, promises.

321
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,230
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.

322
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,840
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.

323
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,706
lt really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.

324
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,905
She was forced to do it.

325
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,375
So, Ella, who put you up to it?

326
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,181
- (whispers) Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...

327
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,418
l'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.

328
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,324
Areida.

329
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,388
Areida! l might have guessed it.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,427
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?

331
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,869
(Areida) Ella?

332
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,338
How dare she come here now?

333
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,868
Answer the door and tell her
that you never want to see her again.

334
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,403
And tell her you could never be friends
with an Ayorthian.

335
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,417
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.

336
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,318
Don't argue. Just do it.

337
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,223
Thank goodness you're all right.

338
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,692
What's wrong?

339
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,770
l never wanna see you again.

340
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,904
Ha-ha. Very funny.

341
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,076
l don't understand.
We're best friends.

342
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:27,558
l could never be friends with an Ayorthian.

343
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,664
Just go.

344
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,178
l've done terrible things before, Mandy,

345
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,845
but this is the worst thing
the curse has ever made me do.

346
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,651
l've gotta do it.

347
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:59,789
l have got to find Lucinda
and get her to take back the curse.

348
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,091
You're right.

349
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,035
l have something to show you.

350
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,132
This is gonna help you find her.

351
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,506
l should have told you
about this years ago.

352
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,548
- But l was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?

353
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:22,713
Well, as you know,
l'm not the most talented fairy.

354
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:29,958
Anyway, this book...
is my boyfriend, Benny.

355
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,960
Hey.

356
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,625
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.

357
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,727
You're the first introduction
l've had in 20 years.

358
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,171
- l've never seen anything like this.
- l know. No one has.

359
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,075
And l don't want them to,
cos then they might take him away.

360
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:53,778
lt was an accident. l was just trying a spell
to trim his hair, and it went a little askew.

361
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,015
l would have left her ages ago,
except l love her so darn much.

362
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,420
Plus, l have no legs.

363
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,982
l love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.

364
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,255
Not as much as l love you, Cuddlebuns.

365
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,923
- l love you more.
- OK.

366
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,728
Lots of love. Moving on.

367
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,102
Well, l want you to take him with you.

368
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,663
You mean l'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?

369
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,768
There are so many places in my pages
l've been wanting to visit.

370
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,507
Wow. What is all this?

371
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,847
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.

372
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,284
lf l did, l'd be a lot thicker.

373
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,345
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?

374
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,122
- Can l show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.

375
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,219
Show me Lucinda.

376
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,127
Ta-da!

377
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,894
Cool trick.

378
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,461
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.

379
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,505
Ah.

380
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,633
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where
a person is. He can just show you pictures.

381
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,941
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.

382
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,779
Everything is so huge.
ls that a wedding registry?

383
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,519
Duh! They're in Giantville.

384
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,390
Look, she's going
to a wedding in Giantville.

385
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,326
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.

386
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,456
( Olga) Ella, the girls and l need bouquets
for our portrait sitting tomorrow.

387
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,523
Go and pick some.

388
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,377
What you want, baby, I got it

389
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,480
What you need, cos you know I got it

390
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:38,813
All I'm asking is for a little respect
when you get home, baby

391
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,252
Oh, my God!

392
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:51,759
So, as her stepfamily scratched
their newly found itches,

393
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:56,034
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.

394
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,008
Benny, can you show me a map
of the Forest of Pim?

395
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,069
Of course.

396
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,081
Whoa.

397
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:11,483
According to this map,
if we head due east towards Monster Rock,

398
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,581
we can cut half a day off our journey.

399
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,023
(yelp)

400
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,857
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.

401
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,829
Ouch!

402
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,128
- (man) Somebody help me!
- (man laughs)

403
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,829
- Wait a minute.
- (man) Sing soprano, little man!

404
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,065
Missed!

405
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,338
What do you think
you're doing to that poor elf?

406
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,503
Oh.

407
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,548
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?

408
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:45,783
Look, l think it's only fair to warn you that
l'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.

409
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,883
Paper folding?

410
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,486
l was hoping
you wouldn't know what that was.

411
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,863
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!

412
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
Don't let her do that.

413
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,139
Now rabbit punch.

414
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,303
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.

415
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,638
This chick is nuts!

416
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,184
Let's get outta here.

417
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,743
l think l'm gonna puke.

418
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,386
Let me help you with that.

419
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,723
l am gonna need
so much therapy after this.

420
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,527
Oh!

421
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,794
- Are you OK?
- No, l am not OK!

422
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,030
l think l broke something,
or dislocated it, or...

423
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,035
(crunch)

424
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,198
No, just a crick. Slannen of Pim.

425
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,442
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.

426
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:48,750
Well, if you're OK,
then l have to be going, but good luck.

427
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,621
You're going? You can't walk in this wood
on your own. How about a bite to eat?

428
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,353
That's very sweet,
but l'm on a tight schedule.

429
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:00,056
Fine. Message received,
Miss ''l Think l'm All That''.

430
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,567
- That's not what l meant at all.
- l extend the hand of friendship...

431
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,661
- l am on a tight schedule. Were l not...
- Everybody's busy...

432
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:11,835
- ..l would love to have dinner with you.
- Great! l've got a coupon.

433
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,982
(whispers) Slannen.

434
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:24,050
lf this is where you live,
why are we sneaking around?

435
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,353
lf they spot you, you'll be sorry.

436
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,292
You know how all elves
are forced to sing and dance?

437
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,852
Yeah. So?

438
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,460
Visitors!

439
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,662
- Places, everyone.
- One, two, three, four!

440
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,001
Run for it!

441
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,946
Let us entertain you,
let us make you smile

442
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,244
Let us give you a few tricks,
some old and then some new tricks

443
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,912
We're very versatile

444
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:59,218
And if you're real good
we'll make you feel good

445
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,191
We want your spirits high

446
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,760
(Ella) Where are we going?

447
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,889
(Slannen) l said get lost!

448
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:13,427
We'll have a real good time

449
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,869
Leave us alone!

450
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,039
Peace and quiet at last.

451
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,976
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

452
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,309
He was a good friend of mine

453
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,473
Hit the road.

454
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,540
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you...

455
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,609
Get outta here!

456
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,677
(waitress) l need this.

457
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,418
What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.

458
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,159
Yes. Why don't you like music?

459
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,725
That's right. Because elves are supposed
to be so happy and joyful all the time.

460
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,566
Singing and dancing for the man.

461
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,834
l don't wanna be an entertainer.

462
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,035
l wanna be a...

463
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,771
- What?
- Nothing.

464
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,676
- What were you gonna say?
- lt's silly.

465
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,079
Please tell me.

466
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,811
l wanna be a lawyer.

467
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,087
- l guess in small-claims court.
- What is that?

468
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,146
Nothing.

469
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,387
- Why can't you be a lawyer?
- Hello?

470
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,020
Elf.

471
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,226
l forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.

472
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,863
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation
other than singing, juggling

473
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,772
andlor tomfoolery.

474
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,366
They're never gonna let me
go to law school.

475
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,742
l'm never gonna get my day in court,

476
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,145
never gonna stand
in front of the judge and say

477
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,673
''You're out of order!
Permission to approach the bench?''

478
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,777
- ''l object!''
- No, l object.

479
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:40,415
- l heard it there. lt's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.

480
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,618
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

481
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,258
Great. l knew it. A talking book.

482
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,269
Good. Because for a minute there,
l thought l was going crazy.

483
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,395
Crazy

484
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,464
l'm crazy for feeling so lonely

485
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,483
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.

486
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,181
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. lt's personal.

487
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,420
A letter for Ella?

488
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:24,128
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?

489
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,161
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags.

490
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:33,541
l think l may have found you
another chance at your future husband.

491
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,948
Yes!

492
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,889
So you can really show me anything
anywhere in the kingdom?

493
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:54,830
You're kind of like a walking, talking
encyclopedia, except for the walking part.

494
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,890
- Come on.
- What?

495
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,693
What's going on?

496
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,231
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers
to perform at the coronation.

497
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,607
Get in. And you.

498
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,548
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia
and petition the prince.

499
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,518
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.

500
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,852
The sun will shine

501
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,859
(Slannen) You want me to go
to Lamia on my own?

502
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,862
We're going to Giantville.
lt's on the way. Come with us.

503
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,730
The prince will never grant an audience
with an elf. They think we're a joke.

504
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:35,262
l have met Prince Charmont, and l think
he might be different than his uncle.

505
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,105
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.

506
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,236
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.

507
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,907
Yeah, l hate the guy already.
l'm not wasting my time.

508
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,213
Lacking courage as well as height.

509
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,887
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.

510
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,124
That's just a myth created by that stupid
Elves and the Shoemaker story.

511
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,031
- Do l look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.

512
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,537
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?

513
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,903
Hey, l'm right here. Just cos l'm a book
doesn't mean l don't have ears.

514
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:14,308
Boys, if you can't play nice,
you can't play together.

515
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,438
(rustling)

516
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:21,542
Oh, no. The rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running.

517
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,450
l knew this was gonna happen.

518
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,958
They'll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor.

519
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:34,021
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known
case of a bunny attack was, well, never.

520
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,525
lt never hurts to be on your guard.

521
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,032
(twig snaps)

522
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,370
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
l've got this in hand.

523
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,568
Oi!

524
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,975
You! Thumper!

525
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,344
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you.

526
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,181
l don't like carrots.

527
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,884
How do you feel about rabbits,
cos one just went thataway.

528
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,122
l am the ogre, Nish.

529
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:10,657
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?

530
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,329
How about free range?

531
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,970
Stop! No!

532
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,340
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing?

533
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:25,280
l think there's been a big mistake here.
See, l'm pro-ogre.

534
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,839
Pro-ogre?

535
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,854
Absolutely. l led a rally on your behalf
the other day. Maybe you heard about it.

536
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:35,723
lt'll only hurt for a moment, l promise.
l'm a fast eater.

537
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,153
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, l want to help.

538
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,826
Help? From a human?

539
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,163
Humans took everything from us.

540
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,140
l was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.

541
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,372
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.

542
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,643
Nish, hurry up. l'm starving.

543
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,412
Right, you, into the pot.

544
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,248
Forget that.

545
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,019
- Who are you?
- l am the ogre, Nish.

546
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,422
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?

547
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,594
All right, that's enough fun and games.

548
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,935
Now, keep your mouth shut
and don't move.

549
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,243
ls it boiling yet?

550
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,748
lt's not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it.

551
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,650
You couldn't show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way?

552
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,416
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh!

553
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,787
l think l see bubbles.

554
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,552
(horse neighs)

555
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,266
Let her go!

556
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,814
Untie yourself.

557
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,845
Truce! Truce!

558
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,049
Can't we just get along?

559
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,222
Are you one of the monsters
who killed my father?

560
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,958
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.

561
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,364
Why would we kill him?

562
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,239
l'll spare your lives
where you didn't spare his.

563
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:09,245
You take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere.

564
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,781
We'll pick up something else on the way.

565
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,047
Anyway, you eat maiden,
an hour later you're hungry again.

566
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,357
What are you doing here,
with an elf for protection?

567
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,829
Do you get a kick
out of near-death experiences?

568
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,334
No. l was fine. l had things well in hand.

569
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,599
l could see that, as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron,

570
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,698
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security.

571
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,506
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't come barging in?

572
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,743
l see the score currently stands
at chivalry two, gratitude zero.

573
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,807
Look...

574
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,522
You're right. l'm sorry.

575
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,923
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

576
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,257
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?

577
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,354
Oh, it's just a scratch.

578
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,594
You'd better let me help you with that.

579
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,473
- So, will l live?
- l think the odds are in your favor.

580
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,348
So... where were you headed?

581
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,817
The giants' village for a wedding.
l'm meeting my godmother.

582
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,548
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.

583
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,283
That's not necessary.

584
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:31,056
lt makes it so much easier rescuing you
if l don't have to commute.

585
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:38,330
l'm so glad l was here
for this interesting development.

586
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,391
(Heston groans)

587
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,770
- Look, l really appreciate the offer, but...
- Are you crazy? Tell him to come with us.

588
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,832
Come with us.

589
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:59,186
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?

590
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,985
- No.
- Oh.

591
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,549
- Because l don't have one.
- Oh.

592
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,126
Your girlfriend doesn't mind
being left alone?

593
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,429
- l don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?

594
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,267
- l have many.
- Oh.

595
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,369
l'm kidding. Shouldn't believe
everything you read in Medieval Teen.

596
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,937
Excuse me. Excuse me.

597
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,882
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?

598
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,888
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?

599
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,824
lt just so happens l was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone

600
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,989
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to...

601
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,524
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer.

602
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,433
- A lawyer?
- Why not?

603
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:50,463
There were no laws against it
when your father was king.

604
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,601
That's not really my area of expertise.

605
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,874
My advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle.

606
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,677
l'm sure if you make a good argument,
he'll come round.

607
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,312
Well, thank you for your... advice.

608
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,131
- What?
- You're about to become king.

609
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,569
You'll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don't even care.

610
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:24,972
lt's not like l asked to become king.
l've had no say in the matter.

611
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,910
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter.

612
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,039
Nobody should be forced to do things
they don't wanna do.

613
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,778
Take it from somebody who knows.

614
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,547
Ella! Ella!

615
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,900
You're not finished yet.
You work until sundown.

616
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:07,616
( Char) The giants have always been
gentle. Why are they treated like slaves?

617
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,518
l'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.

618
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,579
He couldn't.

619
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,865
(lively music)

620
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,800
(Ella) Maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding.

621
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,770
( Char) Maybe you can find
your godmother.

622
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,701
(Ella) Whoa.

623
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,306
They're not so bad.
l thought they'd be all so big and scary.

624
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,744
Didn't hurt.

625
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,806
l hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.

626
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,478
They'll respect your courage
at showing up here.

627
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:21,115
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.

628
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,251
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?

629
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,728
No grudges, eh?

630
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,791
Well, l thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.

631
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:37,205
But now l'm thinking l should come back
when there's been a little less drinking.

632
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:41,267
He's here as a friend
to hear your complaints.

633
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,711
Then welcome.

634
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,273
l'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.

635
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,342
She was over there earlier.

636
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,816
Thank you. l'll be right back.

637
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,766
Excuse me. ls Lucinda Perriweather here?

638
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:11,069
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.

639
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,803
Do you know where l can find her?

640
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,335
Last l heard,
she was somewhere living in Lamia.

641
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,110
Do you know where the bathroom is?

642
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,382
Benny, show me Lucinda.

643
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,688
Looks like she's getting an FWl.

644
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:32,559
- FWl?
- Flying while intoxicated.

645
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,730
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!

646
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,234
Sorry.

647
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,469
Agh!

648
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,379
Ooh.

649
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,013
l'd no idea things were so bad.

650
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,786
l promise, first thing after my coronation,
l'll help you buy your farms back.

651
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,953
l'll hold you to that.

652
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,553
- l'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.

653
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,122
That's a fine young man you have here.

654
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:14,298
He's not fine. l mean, mine. He is fine...

655
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,698
Never mind.

656
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,676
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.

657
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,872
My godmother's on some kind of bender.

658
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,347
You can't leave now.
lt's the middle of the night.

659
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,749
You have to stay for the party.

660
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,152
OK, l'll stay.

661
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:37,655
l appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you don't have to stay.

662
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,960
l don't wanna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.

663
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,300
Thank you, Char. For everything.

664
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,361
So l'll see you around?

665
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,335
But l wish you would stay.

666
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,543
l guess one more night wouldn't hurt.

667
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,916
Mmm. Yuck.

668
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,996
So you're looking
for your godmother Lucinda?

669
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:18,091
She was supposed to be here,
and now l have no idea where she is,

670
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,968
and l need to find her
as soon as possible bec...

671
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,909
Because l miss her.

672
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,968
OK.

673
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,810
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.

674
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:36,375
We have every year's census in the castle.

675
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:41,220
lt's not open to everyone,
but l could probably pull a few strings.

676
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,488
Char, l can't tell you
what that would mean to me.

677
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,053
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.

678
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,792
OK.

679
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,999
- l gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?

680
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,005
The giants.
They want me to sing. l don't sing!

681
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:00,237
There he is. There's our little entertainer.

682
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:07,847
Mr Koopooduk, l know you may find this
hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.

683
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,911
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. l couldn't.

684
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,254
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.

685
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,520
Sing.

686
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,864
Can anybody

687
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,926
(clears throat)

688
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:31,304
Find me

689
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,038
Somebody to...

690
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,581
(deep voices)  Love?

691
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,790
Each morning l get up, l die a little

692
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,918
Can't barely stand on my feet

693
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:55,556
-  Take a look at yourself in the mirror
-  Take a look in the mirror and cry

694
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,123
Lord, what you're doing to me?

695
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,432
l've spent all my years in believing you

696
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,100
But l just can't get no relief, Lord

697
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,938
-  Somebody
-  Somebody

698
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,307
-  Somebody
-  Somebody

699
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:12,371
Can anybody find me

700
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,508
Somebody to love?

701
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,783
Louder!

702
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:24,384
Got no feel, l got no rhythm

703
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,294
l just keep losing my beat

704
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,764
l'm OK, l'm all right

705
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,860
-  She's all right, she's all right
-  Ain't gonna face no defeat

706
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,304
l just gotta get out of this prison cell

707
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:40,832
One day l'm gonna be free, Lord

708
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,435
-  Somebody
-  Somebody

709
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,945
-  Somebody
-  Somebody

710
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:48,075
Can anybody find me

711
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:53,418
Somebody to love?

712
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,822
Give it a little more soul!

713
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,360
-  She works hard
-  Every day

714
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,829
l try and l try and l try

715
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,095
But everybody wants to put me down

716
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,399
They say l'm going crazy

717
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,270
They say l got a lot of water in my brain

718
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,104
Got no common sense

719
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,475
l got nobody left to believe

720
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:21,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

721
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,342
Dance!

722
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:44,203
Find her somebody to love

723
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,437
Find her somebody to love

724
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,674
Find her somebody to love

725
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,875
Find her somebody to love

726
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,113
Find her somebody to love

727
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,315
Find her somebody to love

728
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,850
Can anybody find me

729
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:13,868
Somebody to love?

730
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:20,839
Find me somebody to love

731
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:27,346
Find me somebody to love

732
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:33,785
Find me somebody to love

733
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:41,360
Find me somebody to love

734
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,763
(applause and cheering)

735
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,771
l love singers.

736
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,043
Really?

737
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,952
Because, you know,
being an elf, l love to sing.

738
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,785
You know, l hope
you don't mind me saying this,

739
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:12,852
but you're much prettier
than l would have expected.

740
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:17,389
Oh, l know. Giants are supposed
to be big, ugly and mean.

741
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,732
lt's because of stories
like Jack and the Beanstalk.

742
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,295
Stinking Grimm Brothers.

743
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,176
l've seen weirder couples.

744
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,342
None that immediately come to mind,
but still.

745
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,250
My stepsister Hattie would die
if she knew l was here.

746
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,686
She's the president
of your fan club, you know.

747
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,953
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.

748
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:47,725
Now l know what name
to put on the restraining order.

749
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:52,063
No, you're lucky.
l wish l had brothers and sisters.

750
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,234
My mother passed away
before she had any more children and...

751
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,797
My mother passed away, too.

752
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,235
Oh.

753
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,780
You know, she used to sing me
to sleep every night.

754
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:13,790
My father used to sing to me,
loudly and very off-key, but...

755
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,848
l still miss him.

756
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,053
l have Edgar, l guess.

757
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:22,258
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.

758
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,495
And he brought me up as his own son.

759
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,833
l know you don't like his politics much,

760
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:32,932
but l'm sure when l tell him about
the giants, he will correct the situation.

761
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,773
Yeah, or you could.

762
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:40,373
lt took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.

763
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,782
You're a natural at this.

764
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,887
Wow, is that almost a compliment?

765
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:53,619
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.

766
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,723
You know what else?
Tomorrow l'm gonna go to my uncle

767
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,826
and l'm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions.

768
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:04,738
Slannen will have his day in court,
if l have anything to say about it.

769
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:18,882
l think you're gonna be
a great king someday.

770
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,549
Your father would have been proud.

771
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,458
Thanks.

772
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,929
l think he would have really liked you.

773
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,941
Kiss me.

774
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,479
That wasn't an order, you know.

775
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,223
l know.

776
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,362
l want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?

777
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,460
A time machine?

778
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,597
May l recommend our newest procedure?

779
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,805
Bat faeces and oxen blood.

780
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,003
Batox.

781
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,278
Works wonders, although l do caution you,

782
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,980
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction.

783
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,490
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?

784
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:05,790
l'm in town on business and heard
you were here. l came to see Ella.

785
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,831
- ls Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?

786
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:14,495
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive,
taking a tour of the castle.

787
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:23,342
Next we move into the castle lobby.

788
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,574
l can't believe it.

789
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:29,015
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!

790
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,988
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

791
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,024
Stop tonguing the foyer.

792
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,116
(all groan)

793
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,856
- Show us where Char showers.
- (excited giggling)

794
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,865
l bet he showers naked!

795
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,076
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- l'm with the prince. And l'm not that short.

796
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,946
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.

797
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,781
No elves in the palace
unless they're performing.

798
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,344
Discrimination. lntentional infliction of...

799
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,482
Whoa!

800
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,085
..bodily harm.

801
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,929
These portraits
were recently commissioned

802
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,629
in honor of tomorrow's coronation.

803
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,568
(women gasp)

804
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,567
(women scream)

805
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,411
Right, follow me.

806
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,474
What are they doing here?

807
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:39,545
l don't mean to rush, but now l really need
to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.

808
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,887
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.

809
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:47,157
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.

810
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,926
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.

811
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,432
l've been looking all over for you.

812
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:57,496
And who might
this charming young lady be?

813
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:01,601
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.

814
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,873
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.

815
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:09,478
And this is his... Heston.

816
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,877
Hey.

817
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:16,222
So, l trust your journey was pleasant?

818
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,887
We had a little run-in with some ogres,
but Char got the best of them.

819
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,523
You could have been killed.

820
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:28,231
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it,
l always say. Grin and bear it.

821
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,410
So, Char, might l trouble you
for a moment?

822
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:38,174
The crown maker needs to see you
in your chambers for a fitting.

823
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:44,380
Sure. l just have to take Ella to the...
to the hall of records.

824
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:48,555
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.

825
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,759
You were right about that girl. Very odd.

826
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,898
And l'm afraid she's been
filling our prince's head

827
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,239
with dangerous new thoughts.

828
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,740
Here's the latest census. Names are listed
first by location then species.

829
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,682
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

830
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,916
Sorry l couldn't be of more help,
but l don't have a census.

831
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:24,619
l mean, look at the size of that thing.
l do have a restaurant guide.

832
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,527
Lucinda, l hope you're in here.

833
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,107
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about
the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them.

834
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,009
l can't wait.

835
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,414
The giants' working conditions,
for instance. They're unbelievable.

836
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,215
Luckily, l've talked to them
and they're definitely open for negotiation.

837
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:58,284
The only negotiations between me and the
giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.

838
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,794
(Heston laughs)

839
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,727
Good one, sire.

840
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,631
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.

841
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,101
We'll talk about it
after your coronation, yes?

842
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:18,079
Fine, but we will talk.

843
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,479
Of course.

844
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,450
l... l'm going to ask her to marry me.

845
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,962
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?

846
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:40,025
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.

847
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,937
At the same time and in the same place
as my father proposed to my mother.

848
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:48,376
- (Hattie) Get off! Do you know who l am?
- (guard) Come with me.

849
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:53,279
- What now?
- (Hattie) Get off! Get off me!

850
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:57,786
- So, Ella of Frell is your sister.
- (Hattie drinks noisily through straw)

851
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,846
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?

852
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,689
Tell me, what do you know about her?

853
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,593
What's in it for me?

854
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:13,068
How about that your eyeballs
remain inside your head?

855
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:19,131
Now, now, Heston.

856
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:23,577
We like these girls. They're our friends.

857
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,449
l can't find anything in any of these books.

858
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,851
Benny, show me Lucinda.

859
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,087
(Benny) No, still sacked out.

860
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,951
l don't know where else to...

861
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,161
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries?

862
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,397
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm?

863
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:59,172
l might even be willing
to throw Prince Char into the deal.

864
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:04,276
Let's see, now. After the coronation
he'll need to take a queen,

865
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:09,552
and shall we say... his hand in marriage?

866
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,521
Queen Olive.

867
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,432
For the eldest daughter, of course.

868
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,132
Ella does everything she's told.

869
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:28,143
l don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.

870
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,044
Lucinda Perriweather,

871
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,516
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries, Lamia Heights.

872
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,110
Benny! Benny, we got her.

873
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,314
Hello, Ella.

874
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,758
l hope you've found everything
to your satisfaction?

875
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,630
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.

876
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,270
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.

877
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,937
Very good.

878
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:06,106
Now touch your toes.

879
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,410
Oh, no.

880
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,179
Oh, yes. And while you're about it,

881
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:15,691
why don't you pat your head
and rub your tummy at the same time?

882
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,217
Now jump up and down.

883
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,366
- Please stop.
- Wait.

884
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,130
Perhaps you know this one.

885
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:33,608
Put your left foot in, your left foot out

886
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,645
Put your left foot in
and shake it all about

887
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,146
Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake

888
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:42,378
Shake your booty, shake your booty

889
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,577
This is fabulous!

890
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:51,321
Hate to be a party pooper,
but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?

891
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,885
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.

892
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:05,631
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.

893
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,134
At some point,

894
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:14,809
amidst your frolicking and romancing,

895
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:21,454
Prince Char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors.

896
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:28,057
Then, just before midnight,

897
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:33,124
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question.

898
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,072
How do you know all this?

899
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,165
We know everything, my dear.

900
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:45,044
And the one thing we know
with most certainty

901
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:50,381
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

902
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,787
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him.

903
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,848
No! No, l won't!

904
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,417
Oh, yes, you will.

905
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:03,056
You will, because l order you to.

906
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,927
(Edgar chuckles)

907
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:16,773
Actually, it's lucky you're here,
so l won't have to do it myself.

908
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,542
You'd kill your own nephew?

909
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,915
Why not? l killed my own brother.

910
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:27,217
What? Why?

911
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,953
- l want to be king.
- Duh!

912
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,018
Now go.

913
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,292
Wait.

914
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,460
There's one more thing.

915
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:44,597
You will tell no one of this plan.

916
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,916
- Can l help you?
- l'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.

917
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,219
- lt's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.

918
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,089
- Do you know where l could find her?
- Nope.

919
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:10,030
You don't understand. lf l don't find her,
something terrible's going to happen.

920
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,466
Finding her would be something terrible.

921
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,775
(Ella) Dear Char.

922
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:26,838
This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to do, and I hope you'll understand.

923
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,976
We can't be together.

924
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,850
I can't tell you why.

925
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:36,585
Please believe
that this is the only solution.

926
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,423
I wish you the best.

927
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,124
I really do believe
you're going to be a great king.

928
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,963
Goodbye for ever. Ella.

929
01:06:54,643 --> 01:07:00,775
(narrator) Now, if she stayed clear
of the prince until midnight had passed,

930
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,785
then Char would be safe.

931
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,845
But how long could that last?

932
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:11,324
Slannen, where have you been?

933
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,589
What are you doing? Never mind.

934
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,927
This may sound strange,
but there's something l need you to do.

935
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,794
You are one freaky chick.

936
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,070
l need you to go back into the forest and
rally all the elves and giants you can find.

937
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:30,670
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.

938
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,512
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.

939
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:38,178
- Why? What's going on?
- l already told you, l can't tell you.

940
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,279
But if you don't,

941
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,848
you might very well be stuck
singing ''Kumbaya'' the rest of your life.

942
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:48,124
Fine! lnto the forest of certain death
walks Slannen.

943
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,093
- Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.

944
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,619
( waltz)

945
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,659
Where's your little friend?

946
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,933
Yes. She should be here by now.

947
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,668
l don't want to talk about her.

948
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,709
(bell rings)

949
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,181
Agh! Oh!

950
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,514
- Oh! Oh!
- (tree creaks)

951
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,485
Slannen, please hurry.

952
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,523
Would you stop that?

953
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:58,556
When you steal from here,
you are stealing from me now.

954
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:03,367
- What do you mean?
- This is my future home, isn't it?

955
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,999
- (clears throat)
- Oh.

956
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:09,567
Hi. l was just polishing...

957
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,545
(giggles)

958
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:14,105
Would you... would you care to dance?

959
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:18,176
Are you kidding?
That's all she ever talks about.

960
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,756
You wanted to look younger.

961
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,024
lf you spent less time on your face
and more on your maternal duties,

962
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,361
we'd know where Ella was right now.

963
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,662
(tree creaks)

964
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,965
(thunder)

965
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,346
Ouch!

966
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,405
Whoa!

967
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:51,314
What the...?
This isn't the salad bar at Brelly's.

968
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,220
Lucinda. Lucinda! Lucinda!

969
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:01,352
Oh, my goodness. Do l know you, child?

970
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,955
Ella of Frell. You gave me a gift.

971
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,469
Oh, yes. l remember you.

972
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,471
- The obedient one.
- l am so happy to see you.

973
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,133
l have been looking everywhere for you.

974
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:18,044
- l need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? l don't think so.

975
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:22,607
lt's not that l'm not grateful for the gift.
l am, really.

976
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,778
But because of the gift,

977
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:30,189
l'm about to do something horrible
to this guy l really like and might even love.

978
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:34,423
Girl, you out of your mind.
Everybody loves my gifts.

979
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:38,193
Lucinda! Lucinda, l am begging you.

980
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,896
l will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.

981
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,565
You don't like my gift? Fine.

982
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,905
Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.

983
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:51,378
- Did l chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
- Well...

984
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,280
- Huh?
- But you...

985
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,045
No.

986
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:02,917
And, in fact, just to prove
what a gem l am... l'll unchain you.

987
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,222
What? No! No!

988
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,891
Aren't l fabulous?

989
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:13,128
Now, look at you. A pretty girl like you
should be at the ball.

990
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:16,365
- What?
- Go get down with the prince.

991
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,135
- No, l can't go!
- Well, not dressed like that.

992
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:30,179
Now, that's what l'm talking about.

993
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,482
OK, that hurt.

994
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,216
Give, give, give.

995
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,384
You're welcome.

996
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,586
Tell me about your sister.

997
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,130
Olive? ldiot.

998
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,529
- No, Ella.
- Oh.

999
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:51,368
l don't wanna talk about her.
She's so dreary.

1000
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,841
- l just wanna talk about us.
- Us?

1001
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:59,040
lt sounds even more wonderful
when you say it.

1002
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,105
(Ella screams)

1003
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,649
(Hattie) Ow!

1004
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:21,193
Something tells me
she just couldn't stay away.

1005
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,829
- We need to talk.
- Char, please...

1006
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:28,240
Please tell me
you never wanna see me again.

1007
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,611
l will if you tell me that you don't love me.

1008
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,549
- lt's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?

1009
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:39,610
Tell me how you really feel about me.

1010
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:47,357
l love you. But l am wrong for you, Char.
l am wrong for the kingdom.

1011
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,388
ls that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.

1012
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,826
Come with me.

1013
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,858
The hall of mirrors?

1014
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:26,028
When l was little,
my father brought me in here.

1015
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:31,095
He told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader.

1016
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,039
Somehow, l never could.

1017
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:39,012
And then you come along.

1018
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,413
Ella, what's wrong?

1019
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,082
l wish l could tell you.
l wish l could tell you everything.

1020
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:49,090
These last few days have been so perfect.

1021
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:53,356
Well, except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres.

1022
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,695
And you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out.

1023
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,428
And l had to dance with Hattie.

1024
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:04,165
But none of these things matter.

1025
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,469
We're together now.

1026
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,477
And when we're together, it's like magic.

1027
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,051
- l never want it to end.
- l know, l know.

1028
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,020
- And l feel the same, but...
- That's why l brought you here.

1029
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:24,491
- Char, please listen to me.
- Ella, l know. You're scared.

1030
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,757
l'm scared, too.

1031
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,697
This is... this is a big step.

1032
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,841
Ella...

1033
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:44,174
Ella of Frell, will you marry me?

1034
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,572
(clock chimes)

1035
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,174
No, no, no, no, no!

1036
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:53,550
- No?
- No.

1037
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,523
l don't understand. What is it?

1038
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,288
My politics? Your family?

1039
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:04,424
Because those things aren't important.
What's important is what's in our hearts.

1040
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,298
lf our love is strong,
we can conquer anything.

1041
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,860
l do love you, Char.

1042
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:19,978
- (Hattie) Ella, come here.
- ( Olga) Don't argue. Just do it.

1043
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,243
- ( Olive) Take that.
- Keep your mouth shut.

1044
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,376
- (Hattie) Take those.
- (ogre) Don't move.

1045
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:28,446
(Edgar) On the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

1046
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,153
and plunge it through his heart
and kill him.

1047
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:37,995
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

1048
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,205
You will no longer be obedient.

1049
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,265
You will no longer be obedient!

1050
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,647
(clock strikes midnight)

1051
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:01,417
l'm free. l can't believe it. l'm free.

1052
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,689
You tried to kill me.

1053
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,694
Guards!

1054
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,753
- No, Char...
- Take her away.

1055
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,856
No, Char, please.
Please, Char, wait. No, Char!

1056
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:16,701
Char, please, wait.
l can explain! Please listen to me! Char!

1057
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,169
No, please. No! No!

1058
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,539
There's been a huge mistake.

1059
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,408
Please.

1060
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,913
Just listen. Please!

1061
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,256
(Edgar) You realize, of course,
she'll have to be put to death immediately.

1062
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,260
l just don't understand.
Maybe l should go and talk to her.

1063
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:42,126
No. No, l forbid you to go down there.

1064
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,792
Your Highness,
your uncle didn't want to frighten you,

1065
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,735
but the secret police informed us
of a possible uprising.

1066
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:54,003
Those ogres in the forest,
they were after you.

1067
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:58,038
The girl was obviously part of the scheme.

1068
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,810
The ogres never planned to hurt her.

1069
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,216
She was just toying
with your emotions, Char,

1070
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:09,747
so she could get close to you
and commit the murder herself.

1071
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:12,453
l... l just don't believe it.

1072
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,860
Yes. Yes, it does seem quite fantastic.

1073
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:22,328
You let me worry about all this, hm?

1074
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:27,034
You just concentrate
on tomorrow's coronation.

1075
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:34,610
Sire, you know l've been working
with the Red Guard.

1076
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:40,178
Why not call them in now and take over
the whole kingdom like we planned?

1077
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:44,749
First we must find a way
to get rid of the prince.

1078
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:50,162
And l think l have
a pretty good idea how to do it.

1079
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,997
(cock crows)

1080
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:09,150
All right. We just have to find a way
to get past those guards.

1081
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,675
(Benny) Help! Please,
somebody get me out of here!

1082
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:15,587
Benny? What's he doing here?

1083
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,620
Ugh!

1084
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,322
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?

1085
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:25,093
- l could kiss you.
- l think a nice thank-you note is enough.

1086
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,192
l think Ella's in trouble.

1087
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,238
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.

1088
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,637
Show me Ella.

1089
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,741
Edgar's done this?

1090
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:43,184
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
lt'll take courage, bravery...

1091
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,515
(Elves scream)

1092
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:49,887
l was gonna ask you
how you'd like to be eaten,

1093
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:54,020
but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.

1094
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,259
Welcome aboard.

1095
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,529
Executioner coming through.

1096
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,596
Enter.

1097
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:12,804
- Help.
- l wouldn't do that if l were you.

1098
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,399
Open up. l'm Miss Frell's
legal representation.

1099
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:35,595
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numbskull.

1100
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,036
lf the gauntlet doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

1101
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,974
Now, open this door before l sue you
for everything you own.

1102
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,978
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!

1103
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:51,110
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle,

1104
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:56,681
but when faced with a challenge
to equality, freedom and civil liberties,

1105
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,319
this elf will draw the sword of justice.

1106
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,923
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?

1107
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,994
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.

1108
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,607
- (Ella) Slannen?
- Ella?

1109
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,470
Ella!

1110
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,944
- Slannen!
- Oh, Ella!

1111
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,679
- Benny!
- Are you OK?

1112
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:28,018
l'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.

1113
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,924
- (Slannen) That's Char's crown.
- (Ella) He's poisoned it.

1114
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:37,192
We gotta go. Come on. Come on, guys.
We got a coronation to crash.

1115
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:40,063
(fanfare)

1116
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,703
People of Lamia.

1117
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:57,650
Today is a very special day
for our kingdom.

1118
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:04,755
For today you are here to witness
the crowning of a king.

1119
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,911
Bring in the crown.

1120
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,303
Drop that crown!

1121
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:04,111
- ( Char) Ella?
- Seize them!

1122
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,266
lt's payback time.

1123
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,435
Charge!

1124
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:35,375
Char!

1125
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,783
Kill them, and anyone
who gets in your way.

1126
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,956
Oh, my God!

1127
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,125
No! No, no, no, no!

1128
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,670
l can't believe l'm saving you,
after you tried to kill me.

1129
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,802
l didn't try to kill you.

1130
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,369
You get away from her!

1131
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,884
- Take this!
- (Benny) Hey!

1132
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:16,751
That dagger you were about to plunge into
my back was an early wedding present?

1133
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,850
Hello! Help!

1134
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,989
Mandy! Help!

1135
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,422
Fairies in kingdoms across the land,

1136
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,561
please help me turn Benny
back into a man.

1137
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,002
A pumpkin?

1138
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,979
OK, maybe l did try to kill you,
but that wasn't me.

1139
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:44,083
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.

1140
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,861
Then Edgar found out about the curse
and he ordered me to kill you.

1141
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,494
So l had to break up with you,

1142
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:08,065
even though l'm pretty sure that you're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1143
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,579
That crown he's about to put
on your head, it's poisoned.

1144
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,773
Duck.

1145
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,540
Whoa.

1146
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:20,019
- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.

1147
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,752
How vulgar!

1148
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:27,124
Excuse me. Thank you.

1149
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:33,191
Char, there's one more thing.

1150
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,335
He killed your father.

1151
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,601
What? That can't be true.

1152
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,735
Well, of course it's not true.

1153
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:50,581
Who are you gonna believe? This lying
little twit, or the man who raised you?

1154
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,984
(hisses)

1155
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:01,421
- He tried to kill Char!
- Get him!

1156
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,054
Uh-oh.

1157
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,698
Well, l guess that answers that question.

1158
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,135
You vile little girl.

1159
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:14,937
l should have disposed of you
when l had the chance.

1160
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,407
You almost destroyed this kingdom.

1161
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:23,349
You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?

1162
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,818
How could l?

1163
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:30,688
l wanted something,
he was in my way, l got rid of him.

1164
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,893
(muttering)

1165
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:40,299
He wasn't fit to wear this crown,
and you're not fit to wear this crown.

1166
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,496
This crown is mine.

1167
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,039
This kingdom is...

1168
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,308
Oops.

1169
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,845
(all gasp)

1170
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:57,248
We won't be needing that.

1171
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,561
You saved my life.

1172
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:16,099
Then we're even.

1173
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:20,198
Ella! Ella, stop kissing him!

1174
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,803
You are never to kiss him again.

1175
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:32,077
You wanna bet?

1176
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,694
Marry me?

1177
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:48,191
- Now, that l'll do.
- (all) Ah!

1178
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,701
l now pronounce you husband and wife.

1179
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,382
To a nation of equals.

1180
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:13,684
To my good friends.

1181
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:19,464
And to my true love, Ella.

1182
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:42,556
So, such is the story of Ella of Frell,

1183
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:45,923
a spunky young woman
once under a spell.

1184
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,293
lf there's one thing to learn,
it's you just can't go wrong

1185
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:53,266
if you follow your heart
and end with a song.

1186
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,666
Don't go breaking my heart

1187
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,039
l couldn't if l tried

1188
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,467
Honey, if l get restless

1189
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,944
Baby, you're not that kind

1190
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,980
(Slannen)  Don't go breaking my heart

1191
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,750
You take the weight off of me

1192
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:18,524
Honey, when you knocked on my door

1193
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,794
l gave you my key

1194
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,266
Ooh-ooh

1195
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,529
Nobody knows it

1196
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:33,904
-  When l was down
-  l was your clown

1197
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,136
Ooh-ooh

1198
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:41,011
-  Nobody knows it
-  Nobody knows it

1199
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:44,142
-  Right from the start
-  l gave you my heart

1200
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,743
Oh-oh

1201
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,279
l gave you my heart

1202
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,991
Don't go breaking my heart

1203
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:56,796
l won't go breaking your heart

1204
01:28:56,864 --> 01:29:00,061
Don't go breaking my...
Don't go breaking my...

1205
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:01,829

01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,072
l won't go breaking your heart

1222
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:46,341
Don't go breaking my...
Don't go breaking my...

1223
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,279
l won't go breaking your heart

1224
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:51,512
Don't go breaking my...
Don't go breaking my...

1225
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,747
l won't go breaking your heart

1226
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,153
Good luck, Ella!

1227
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,520
l won't go breaking your heart

1228
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:01,790
Don't go breaking my...
Don't go breaking my...

1229
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,353
l won't go breaking your heart

1230
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:07,891
(narrator) Now it's back to the real world,
all of you I must send,

1231
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:13,407
for I've only two words left,
and they are: the end.

1232
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,525
I thought that I was too old
to believe in fairy tales

1233
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:38,827
But there's a letter for me
waiting when I check my mail

1234
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,801
I start to shakin'
like a seven on the Richter scale

1235
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,430
When you say you love me

1236
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,906
I look in the mirror

1237
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:53,777
And I'm not who I used to be at all

1238
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:55,008
It's coming clearer

1239
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:58,313
I'm Cinderella at the ball,
I'm Alice growing ten feet tall

1240
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:02,083
It's not just makebelieve

1241
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:04,920
Here comes the prince's kiss,
I'm positive the slipper fits

1242
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:09,395
It's not just makebelieve

1243
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:15,231
It started out
like just another ordinary day

1244
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:18,568
Then suddenly
my life is different in every way

1245
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,631
The sun is brighter
and my happiness is here to stay

1246
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:25,236
It's like I'm dreaming

1247
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,679
Thank you for showing me

1248
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:33,516
That true love doesn't hurt
when you fall

1249
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:34,782
You got me glowing

1250
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:38,087
I'm Cinderella at the ball,
I'm Alice growing ten feet tall

1251
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,890
It's not just makebelieve

1252
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:44,727
It's really happening,
I feel so good, I gotta sing

1253
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:48,098
It's not just makebelieve

1254
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,366
I'm Ariel above the sea,
I'm Beauty dancing with the Beast

1255
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,102
It's not just makebelieve

1256
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,974
Here comes the prince's kiss,
I'm positive the slipper fits

1257
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:02,539
It's not just makebelieve

1258
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:10,123
It's not just makebelieve

1259
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,989
True to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1260
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:21,262
That's when the heavens will part
and, baby, shower you with my love

1261
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:25,704
Baby, I knew at once
that you were meant for me

1262
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:30,142
Deep in my soul
I know that I'm your destiny

1263
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:34,204
Though you're unsure,
why fight the tide?

1264
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:39,151
Don't think so much,
let your heart decide

1265
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:43,486
Baby, I see your future
and it's tied to mine

1266
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:47,892
I look in your eyes
and see you searching for a sign

1267
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:52,194
But you'll never fall till you let go

1268
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:57,033
Don't be so scared
of what you don't know

1269
01:32:57,104 --> 01:33:00,904
True to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1270
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:06,003
That's when the heavens will part
and, baby, shower you with my love

1271
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,641
Open your eyes,
your heart can tell you no lies

1272
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:11,878
And when you're true to your heart

1273
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:15,013
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me

1274
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:18,217
True to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1275
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:23,320
Got to be true to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1276
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:27,493
You gotta be true to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1277
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:32,767
That's when the heavens will part
and, baby, shower you with my love

1278
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,537
Open your eyes,
your heart can tell you no lies

1279
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,738
And when you're true to your heart

1280
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:41,782
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me

1281
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:45,580
True to your heart,
you must be true to your heart

1282
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:50,716
That's when the heavens will part
and, baby, shower you with my love

1283
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:54,557
Open your eyes,
your heart can tell you no lies

1284
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:07,698
Once upon a time

1285
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:11,233
I always did as I was told

1286
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:20,043
And every day and night

1287
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:23,716
I tried to make it on my own

1288
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,758
But I had a secret

1289
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:35,268
I needed someone there to tell

1290
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:38,430
You said: Look inside yourself

1291
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:42,306
You can break the spell

1292
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:46,779
Believe the voice inside of you

1293
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:52,646
Live out your dreams
and make them true

1294
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:57,781
Through your eyes you helped me see

1295
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:00,918
With your love you set me free

1296
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,930
Wishes can come true

1297
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:10,230
-  If you believe
-  If you believe in love

1298
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:13,330
Live out your dreams
and make them true

1299
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:16,274
If you believe in love

1300
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:19,676
Through your eyes you helped me see

1301
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:22,807
With your love you set me free

1302
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:26,478
Wishes can come true

1303
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:32,253
If you believe

1304
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:40,659
If you believe
