Community service.

When you realize
that life is bigger than you.

535
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,638
- You grow when you see...

PROFESSOR ROCHESTER: Mr. Camp.

537
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:47,675
Hmm? Yes?

538
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:48,678
You wanna come back to Earth?

539
00:32:50,713 --> 00:32:51,912
Honestly, not really.

Aw.

542
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,650
You got a little girlfriend?

543
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,854
So cute. No, really.
It's really, really cute.

544
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:01,321
- All right, you guys...
- (MOUTHING) Sorry.

are in the back.

What's this?

547
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:08,996
Right now,
it's just a blank tape.

548
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,664
MELISSA: Mmm-mmm.
Tapes have soul.

549
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,432
Why are you
giving this to me?

550
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:15,402
Well, our record label's
paying for a new album.

551
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:17,570
So I called the engineer.
He's a friend of mine.

552
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,707
If we hustle, we'll have
an extra couple of hours.

553
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:23,243
I can get you in there,
and we can turn that into your demo.

554
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:25,012
- No.
- Two songs, maybe three.

555
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:26,613
I'll send it off
to some producers.

556
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:28,550
I don't know what to say.
Are you serious?

557
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,417
Yeah.

- Yeah.
- Oh, no. I don't need to go...

No, no, no. Forget that.

563

Forget that.
I want you there.

MELISSA: I don't wanna go.

565
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:44,664
I have a song that I'd
like to play for you.

Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:33:57,947 --> 00:33:59,412
- see you later?
- Yeah.

- Yep. Bye.
- JEREMY: Bye.

574
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:04,921
You were out there
for a long time.

575
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:08,490
Did he ask you out?

576
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,425
Sort of.

577
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,860
Okay. And?

578
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,494
Doesn't this all
just bother you?

579
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,963
Yeah, of course
it bothers me, Melissa.

580
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:17,031
You should just tell him.

581
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,468
I can't tell him. I...

582
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:23,940
Are you wearing his jacket?

583
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:27,509
Yeah.

You're wearing
Jean-Luc's jacket?

585
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:32,479
Yes. He gave it to me.
He said I didn't have enough clothes.

586
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:33,580
And I actually
really like it.

587
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,750
Wow.
This is just... I, I...

588
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:38,585
I really cannot look at you
in the jacket.

589
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:40,320
(SIGHS)
He gave me the jacket.

590
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:41,490
It's not like I took it
from him.

591
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,424
Maybe... (SIGHS)

592
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:47,427
Maybe we should
just rethink all of this.

593
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,863
Rethink what,
us dating?

00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:51,832
See, now you're mad and
everyone seems to be mad.

to get to know each other.

all about you,

- like a broken record.
- Mom.

- I'm not mad.

Really? 'Cause you
seem mad to me.

617
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,794
Maybe it's because you're
embarrassed by your family,

and I don't get that.

619

I wasn't embarrassed
by them.

620
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,967
So, you're embarrassed
by me, then?

621
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:01,836
(SIGHS)
I'm embarrassed by the fact

622
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,737
that you don't want anyone
to know that we're dating.

Adrienne.

1585
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,806
JEREMY: You were right.

1586
01:49:59,608 --> 01:50:01,510
I've never seen stars
like this before.

1587
01:50:06,315 --> 01:50:07,483
I love you, Melissa.

1588
01:50:10,286 --> 01:50:11,487
And I'm gonna tell your story.

1589
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,974
(INAUDIBLE)

1590
01:50:52,194 --> 01:50:53,527
ADRIENNE:
<i>I feel very protective</i>

1591
01:50:53,529 --> 01:50:54,628
<i>of Jeremy and Melissa's story,</i>

1592
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:56,463
(VOICE BREAKING)
<i>I think, because of how much</i>

1593
01:50:56,465 --> 01:50:58,265
<i>the Lord did in my life.</i>

1594
01:50:58,267 --> 01:51:00,536
<i>That it was something
that I needed to hear.</i>

1595
01:51:03,172 --> 01:51:05,372
JEREMY: <i>God was telling me to
pick my guitar up, and I'm like,</i>

1596
01:51:05,374 --> 01:51:06,907
<i>"The last I wanna do
is pick my guitar up."</i>

1597
01:51:06,909 --> 01:51:11,044
<i>I remember feeling the presence
of God so thick in that room.</i>

1598
01:51:11,046 --> 01:51:13,380
<i>Like, just, like,
I needed that.</i>

1599
01:51:13,382 --> 01:51:17,119
<i>Right what came out was just,</i>

1600
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:19,219
<i>"Okay. I still believe."</i>

1601
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:22,556
<i>Literally. Like,
"I still believe in You."</i>

1602
01:51:22,558 --> 01:51:25,325
<i>That's what I wanted to say.</i>

1603
01:51:25,327 --> 01:51:27,928
<i>This is something that God
gave me as a gift to heal me,</i>

1604
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:30,399
<i>and I believe that God was gonna
use it to heal many people.</i>
