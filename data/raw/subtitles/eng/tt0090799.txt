00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,938

00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,908
* keep recalling

3
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:53,247
* how life used to be

4
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,687
* now and then i wonder

5
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,890
* have we changed?

6
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:11,865
* with your hand in mine

7
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:18,806
* oh, the moments shine

8
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,377
* like the pictures
in a storybook *

9
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,017
* we will turn the pages

10
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:35,323
* sharing pieces
of the memories *

11
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,459
* i care for you now

12
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:44,598
* as i did then
at our beginning *

13
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:52,005
* our beginning *

14
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,311
Oh, my!

15
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,680
He's found us.

16
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:04,017
This storm is
all his doing.

17
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,787
Yiiii!

18
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,696
Look out!

19
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,731
Yiiii!

20
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,841
Yeow!

21
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,280
It's him! It's him!

22
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,715
Rrrrr!

23
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,785
What'll we do?

24
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,787
Grrrr.

25
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,854
Hurry!

26
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,189
The mast.

27
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,293
Now!

28
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,297
Unnhh!

29
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,031
Yow! Yow!

30
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,000
Unnhh!

31
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,938
Oh! What's that?

32
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,441
We're heading
straight for it.

33
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,976
We're trapped!

34
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,445
Yiiiii! Yiiiii!

35
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,713
Aaannh.

36
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,648
Yeow!

37
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,818
Grrrr.

38
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,124
Ooooooh. Ooooooh.

39
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,766
Grrrr.

40
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,336
Run.

41
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,271
Run while you can.

42
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:35,242
No matter where you go,
i will find you.

43
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:39,513
You cannot escape me.

44
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,853
I am dark heart.

45
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
Ah.

46
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,382
Ooh.

47
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,216
Ooh ahh.

48
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,058
Wow!

49
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,060
Ha ha!

50
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,062
Hee hee!

51
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,131
He hee ha!

52
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:38,071
Well done, my little star
and heart buddies.

53
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,574
Our search is now over.

54
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,544
We have found
the two creatures

55
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,579
Whose love and kindness

56
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:50,117
Sets them apart
from the rest of the world.

57
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,086
From this day forth,

58
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,190
Because of their great love
and caring,

59
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:02,095
These two shall be known
as true heart bear

60
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,265
And noble heart horse.

61
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:09,102
As they have protected
the little orphan cubs,

62
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,105
They'll help others
share their feelings

63
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,609
And protect everyone
from dark heart's evil.

64
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,611
And this is how

65
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:22,115
The care bear family
began a long time ago

66
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,685
In the kingdom of caring.

67
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,495
Ha ho!

68
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,965
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

69
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,299
Wheeee!

70
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,334
Oh!

71
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,805
Yeee!

72
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,808
* i'm flying my colors

73
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,278

00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,834

00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,044

* i'm flying my colors

107
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,930
* isn't this a perfect way
to introduce me? *

108
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,200
* to say that i'm different,

109
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:24,004

110
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,407

* the magic of my color

115
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,561
The kingdom of caring

116
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,030
Became the care bear
family's home.

117
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,365
Whenever someone on earth
needed their help,

118
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,201
The caring meter would let

119
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,203
Noble heart
and true heart know.

120
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,274
The caring meter.

121
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:05,846
Someone needs help
on earth. What'll we do?

122
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,748
Why, go and help them.

123
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:08,849
Oooh.

124
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,350
Hurry. Hurry.

125
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,418
Wait.

126
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,086
Ooph.
Ooph.

127
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,757
Who's going to
look after the cubs?

128
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,759
Tee hee.
Tee hee.

129
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,094
I will.
I will.

130
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,596
Right.
Right.

131
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,598
I'll go.
I'll go.

132
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,966
Ooph.
Ooph.

133
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,268
I'll go, noble heart.

134
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:32,640
You stay here and
look after the cubs.

135
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,610
This was the care bears'
first mission.

136
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:41,815
True heart had never traveled
down to earth before.

137
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,686
Uh.

138
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,056
Good-Bye,
true heart.

139
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,792
Good luck,
and be careful.

140
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,794
We...

141
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,197
Care!

142
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,703
Ha ha!

143
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,013
Ooooh!

144
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,016
Ahh.

145
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,652
Aah!

146
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,554
Ah!

147
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,494
A totem pole!

148
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,299
The trouble seemed to be
coming from a summer camp.

149
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,367
This must be it.

150
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,839
Whoo!

151
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,675
My little swift heart rabbit.

152
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,577
You little stowaway.

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,250
Come help me find out
what the trouble is all about.

154
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,756
Where did everybody go?

155
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,659
Last ones back to camp

156
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,129
Do trash duty all week.

157
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,397
Ooh.

158
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,133
I'm winning!

159
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,768
Watch it!

160
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,137
Out of my way!

161
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,139
Come on!

162
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,640
Ah-Choo!

163
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,676
Wait up!

164
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,411
Wait for us!

165
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,113
No. No.

166
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,648
Oooh!

167
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,883
No!

168
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,818
First back! I win!

169
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,586
Ha!

170
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,590
John, dawn, and christy
are last again.

171
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,426
So what else is new?

172
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,764
Ha ha ha!

173
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,499
You three are
always last.

174
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,002
You're always
first at everything.

175
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,671
What does that make you?

176
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,174
Camp champ. That's what.

177
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,942
I run faster,

178
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,280
Swim better, and hike longer
than all of you.

179
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,017
But big deal.
So does everyone here.

180
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,888
Listen, if you
can't keep up, leave.

181
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,525
Uh, after you
do the trash duty.

182
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,094
Ha ha ha!

183
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,532
Unh!

184
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,907
I wish
i could be camp champ.

185
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,944
I hate being last,
and i hate being here.

186
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,613
So do we, christy.

187
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,583
We can't swim.
We can't paddle a boat.

188
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,954
He's right.
We'll always be last.

189
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,557
And we'll always
be doing trash duty.

190
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,060
And all
the camp laundry.

191
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,630
Well, not me. Not anymore.

192
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,468
I'm going to change things.

193
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,503
That's the way, christy.

194
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,605
What will...
you do?

195
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:56,309
I'm going to run away.

196
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,712
Run away? No!

197
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,582
Wait, christy.

198
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,018
We're going with you.

199
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,887
Don't run away!

200
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,090
Ooph! Ooooh. Let go of me.

201
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,658
Aaah!

202
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,729
Ahh!

203
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,133
Now which path did they take?

204
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,672
I hope things are going better
for noble heart than for me.

205
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,380
But it seems that noble heart
has more than his hands full

206
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,683
Taking care
of the little cubs.

207
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,759
Waaa!

208
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,261
Boo hoo!

209
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,496
Whew!

210
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:27,467
I'm sure this is
the right path, john.

211
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,704
It'll probably lead you
right back here.

212
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,207
Well, it looked as though

213
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,211
John and dawn were having
problems of their own.

214
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,981
See what i mean?
We're lost.

215
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,116
We can't even escape.

216
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,119
We're the first
to get lost.

217
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,555
We're the last
at everything else.

218
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,524
Here's the path
back to camp,

219
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,860
If you want to go.

220
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,295
Who are you?

221
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,729
What are you?

222
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,033
I am your friend
true heart.

223
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,938
I can help you find
your way back to camp.

224
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,707
No, we're not
g0ing back.

225
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,609
Ever! Ever!

226
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,879
Running away never
solved a problem.

227
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,383
Don't worry about
what you can't do.

228
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,287
Think about all the things
you can do.

229
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,089
Like what?

230
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,124
We can't
do anything.

231
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,993
That's not true.

232
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:30,397
For starters, everyone
can share their feelings.

233
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:35,235
Huh!
Nobody wants to share anything with us.

234
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,304
We're just losers.

235
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,506
Waaahh! Uh uh!

236
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,573
Waaah!

237
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,442
John and dawn,

238
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,279
Meet baby swift heart rabbit.

239
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,082
Don't cry,
little one.

240
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,817
There, there.

241
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,752
It's all right.

242
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,954
Ha ha ha!

243
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,158
You can do something.

244
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,028
You can share your feelings
and make friends.

245
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,530
Well...

246
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,098
Maybe.

247
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,534
I'll show you.

248
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,601
Ooooh!

249
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,537
Whoa!

250
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,273
Where are we going?

251
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,109
To meet my friend
noble heart.

252
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,877
Aren't you coming?

253
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,779
Oh, dear.

254
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,049
Hurry, true heart!

255
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,223
Whooo!

256
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,792
Thank you.

257
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:37,764
There has to be easier ways
of getting around.

258
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,176
Beware, true heart.

259
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:54,147
Soon i'll be coming for you
and your little cubs.

260
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,184
Ha...

261
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,751
Ha!

262
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:06,393
They went
to the kingdom of caring.

263
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,364
John and dawn want to learn
about sharing their feelings.

264
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,134
They already know
about feelings.

265
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,304
They cared enough
to come here.

266
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm going back
to find christy.

267
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,812
What's that?

268
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,280
Our caring meter,

269
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,283
Which tells when
something is affecting

270
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,319
The earth's
caring level.

271
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,788
This time
it might be dark heart.

272
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,694
Dark heart?
Who's dark heart?

273
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,697
Let's hope
you never find out.

274
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:49,136
If it is dark heart,
we both must go.

275
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,440
Could you
watch the cubs?

276
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,979
I think so.

277
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,381
Sure.

278
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,050
We know
you can do it.

279
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,620
Good luck.

280
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,160
Ah ah ah...

281
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,661
Waaaaaaah!

282
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,098
Waaah! Waaah!
Waaah!

283
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,168
Waaaah!

284
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,536
Waaah! Waaah!

285
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,318
Right! Right!

286
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,928
* i care for you

287
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,497
* it's kind of magical

288
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,365
* it just takes two

289
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,836
* to share with you

290
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:02,842
* i'd like to show you
by the little things i do *

291
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,212
* it warms my heart

292
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:11,384
* to think that you
might feel like sharing, too *

293
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,320
* that's what
it's all about *

294
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:17,557
* because i care for you

295
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,800
* it isn't so hard

296
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,838
* all you have to do
is try *

297
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,209
* now, you make
the first move *

298
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:42,014
* you'll see, good things
usually multiply *

299
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,517
* somehow it all works

300
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:49,522
* no, it's really
not so rare *

301
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,524
* give a little here

302
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,626
* give a little there

303
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,997
* no, it doesn't take much
to show you care *

304
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,000
* i care for you

305
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,702
* it's kind of magical

306
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,771
* it just takes two

307
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,542
* to share with you

308
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:15,415
* i'd like to show you
by the little things i do *

309
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:18,150
* it warms my heart

310
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:23,423
* to think that you
might feel like sharing, too *

311
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,558
* that's what
it's all about *

312
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,728
* because i care

313
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,730
* for

314
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,365
* you *

315
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,251
Even though
we didn't find

316
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,253
Dark heart
or christy,

317
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:58,090
I'd say that this
wasn't a wasted trip.

318
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,259
We left
two children

319
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:03,496
Who thought they weren't
good at anything...

320
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:07,434
And returned to find
world-Class baby sitters

321
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,101
In their place.

322
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:13,973
Christy was lost
in the woods

323
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,908
And was about to
need more help

324
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,511
Than anyone
could have guessed.

325
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,915
Where are those guys?

326
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,785
Maybe they ran away
without me.

327
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:30,790
Why can't i be good at anything
except shooting marbles?

328
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,362
Marble champ.

329
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,132
So what?

330
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:44,136
Oh, if only i could
run or swim

331
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:48,140
Or do something
to be the camp champ.

332
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,917
Huh! John? Dawn?

333
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,319
Hey,
what do you know?

334
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,522
The camp champ.

335
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,224
Me?

336
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,995
Sure. You are
the camp champ, ain't you?

337
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,464
No, i'm not.

338
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,501
Well, you sure
could've fooled me.

339
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,803
Who are you?

340
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,172
I'm from the camp
across the river.

341
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,276
You wouldn't want to be
the camp champ, would you?

342
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,148
I could fix it
for you.

343
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,084
Well, i don't know.

344
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,088
There's only
one catch, though.

345
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,091
I knew it was
too good to be true.

346
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,661
Not so fast.

347
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,865
Sometime i'll ask you
to return the favor,

348
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:51,037
And you just do it,
no questions asked.

349
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,338
What do you say?

350
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:55,408
You can't make me
camp champ.

351
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,943
Oh, no?

352
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:02,248
Sure. Ok, you got a deal.

353
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,918
Go ahead and make me
camp champ.

354
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,722
A favor now
for a favor later.

355
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,926
Done.
Do a cartwheel.

356
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,629
A cartwheel?
I can't do...

357
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,598
Just do it.

358
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:19,799
Huh!

359
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,639
I did it!
I did it!

360
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,308
You were telling
the truth!

361
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,410
Cartwheels are nothing.

362
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,881
Now you can race,
swim, paddle.

363
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:39,318
I am going to be
the camp champ!

364
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:44,390
Remember, when i come back,
you owe me a favor.

365
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,893
And i will come back.

366
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,394
Christy!
Christy!

367
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,529
Huh!

368
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,202
Wait till we tell
you where we were.

369
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,238
We met these cute
baby cubs.

370
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,608
We took care
of them.

371
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:05,077
Anyway, we don't
have to win races

372
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,013
To be champs.

373
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,917
We're friends. We'll
always help each other.

374
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:14,086
Good friends are
the real champs.

375
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:18,057
None of us have to
run away anymore.

376
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,694
Who's running away?
Not me.

377
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,731
I plan on staying
a while.

378
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,701
That's great,
christy.

379
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:32,071
Eehhhh!

380
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,440
Did you hear
something, dawn?

381
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,944
I... i don't think so.

382
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,446
Oh, it's getting
cold, john.

383
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,682
Let's go in.

384
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:52,992
I'll be back for you.

385
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,471
Knowing that it was
only a matter of time

386
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,907
Before dark heart found them,

387
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,978
Noble heart and true heart
moved the cubs

388
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,982
To a safer place...
In fact, two places.

389
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:20,653
The little care bear cubs
found a new home

390
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,724
In the billowy softness
of care-A-Lot...

391
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,334
While the care bear
cousin cubs took to the trees

392
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,837
Of the forest of feelings,

393
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:42,341
Where the cubs
could grow up big and strong

394
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:47,346
In what seemed to be
the twinkling of an eye.

395
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,749
* feelings

396
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,720
* we all have feelings

397
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:58,457
* we like to
give our love *

398
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:02,028
* and get love back

399
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:06,132
* it's part of caring

400
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,869
* you're learning caring

401
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:15,041
* when people grow
and share *

402
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:19,378
* and start to know
there's more out there *

403
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:23,215
* than just getting more
and taking more *

404
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,151
* there's giving more

405
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:29,722
* the best part of living

406
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,223
* growing up

407
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,893
* it's something
you can measure *

408
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,327
* growing up

409
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,997
* it happens every day

410
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,465
* being young

411
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,001
* is something
you can treasure *

412
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:46,005
* but life is good
when you're growing up *

413
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,041
* waiting

414
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:53,045
* i know you're waiting

415
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,048
* you'd like your turn

416
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:00,920

00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,961
* you're always growing

00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:13,099
* one day
you'll see and know *

420
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:18,104
* all the changes
you must undergo *

421
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,172
* you'll be stronger then

422
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,241
* and taller then

423
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:29,215
* and you'll begin
the best part of living *

424
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,616
* growing up

425
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,952

00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,482
* life is good

* when you're growing up *

440
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,165
Thanks to true heart
and noble heart,

441
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,201
All the cubs had learned

442
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:25,171
How to help people
share their feelings

443
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,674
And put those feelings
into action.

444
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,677
They were now
the care bears

445
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,180
And the care bear
cousins...

446
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,448
The care bear family.

447
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,686
Little did they know
that, from his secret cave,

448
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:45,491
Dark heart was planning to
capture the care bears.

449
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,626
The time is right

450
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:53,465
For me to begin ruining
all that is good in the world,

451
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:58,504
Starting with those furry
defenders of feelings.

452
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,909
I will remove them
one by one

453
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:06,779
And lock them away
in their own special place

454
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,016
For an eternity.

455
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,218
Ha ha ha ha!

456
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:16,388
With true heart and noble
heart busy elsewhere,

457
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,624
It's time for me
to pay a visit

458
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,961
To the rest
of the care bears.

459
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:23,562
Ha ha ha!

460
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,866
Ha ha ha ha ha!

461
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,701
Yeah! I won!

462
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,004
The camp champ
wins again.

463
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,139
Oh.

464
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,206
Whew!

465
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,574
Ohh.

466
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:39,611
Aren't you going to
congratulate me?

467
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,648
Sure, christy.
But it's nothing new.

468
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,951
You always win
at everything.

469
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,954
That's because
i'm the camp champ.

470
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,991
I remember when you
couldn't win at anything,

471
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,492
Except marbles.

472
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,830
It doesn't seem like
it was that long ago.

473
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:01,300
Hey, christy,
want to shoot some marbles?

474
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,135
Hmph!

475
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:11,911
Time to see if anyone
can beat the camp champ

476
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,779
At swimming.

477
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,047
Aw.

478
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:19,051
Last one to the water
gets trash duty!

479
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:22,188
Dark heart's influence
was changing christy,

480
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,858
As it would change
the entire camp.

481
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:30,529
Meanwhile, the care bears were
preparing a surprise party

482
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:34,833
To welcome true heart
and noble heart home.

483
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,536
None of them
even suspected

484
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:41,607
That an uninvited guest
was on his way.

485
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,682
This will be a wonderful party,
tender heart.

486
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,054
Noble heart
and true heart

487
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,056
Will really
be surprised.

488
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,058
Not if they return

489
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:02,128
Before we're finished
setting it up.

490
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,065
We'll have
time to spare, grumpy bear.

491
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:07,566
Everything's
ready now.

492
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,068
That's because

493
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,470
I've been doing
double duty.

494
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,774
Everyone, look!

495
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,146
The caring meter's
going crazy.

496
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,081
What's going on?

497
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm not sure.

498
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,253
Who's that?

499
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,255
I don't know.

500
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,390
Let's go find out.

501
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,927
Whee!

502
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:37,997
Huh!

503
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,132
Oow!

504
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,834
Howdy.

505
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,638
I'm the caring meter
reader.

506
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:51,243
I've come to read
your caring meter.

507
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,515
* hmm hmm hmm

508
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,951
* hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm *

509
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,955
I've just about got it.

510
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,694
Let it cool down,

511
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,629
And it'll be
good as new.

512
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:14,233
We're having a party.
Want to come?

513
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,903
Boy, would i ever!
Who likes games?

514
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,971
Oh!

515
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,173
Me!

516
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,909
Sack racers,
over there.

517
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,145
Hide-And-Seekers,
right over there.

518
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,814
Blindman's bluffers,
down there.

519
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,217
Leapfroggers, up there.

520
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,720
Time for a game
of disappearing bears.

521
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,157
Ha ha ha!

522
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,630
Come on.
We're ready.

523
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,499
Ok. Ready, set, go.

524
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:54,006
Ow!

525
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,244
Grrr!

526
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,814
Leapfrog!
Ha ha ha ha!

527
00:33:06,252 --> 00:33:08,754
Let's play
hide-And-Seek.

528
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,759
4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10.

529
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,761
Here i come!

530
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,297
1, 2, 3. Who do i see?

531
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,601
The caring meter reader.
You're it!

532
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,273
Here i come.

533
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,280
Aha!

534
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:38,084
One bear in the bag,
coming up.

535
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,452
Aah!

536
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,123
Leave me alone!

537
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,859
Whoa!

538
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,261
Whoo!

539
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,596
Whee!

540
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,131
Oh, no!

541
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,465
Ooohh!

542
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,766
Whoa!

543
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,967
Whuu!

544
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,204
Ohhh!

545
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,873
Aah!

546
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,743
Oh. Oh!

547
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,613
Aooww!

548
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,716
Oh! Whoa!

549
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,783
Whoa!

550
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,486
Aarghh!

551
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,424
Oh! We're
terribly sorry.

552
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,025
Can we
give you a hand?

553
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:21,693
Let's give him
a hug.

554
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,332
Nooooo!

555
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,969
Get away from me!

556
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:34,973
Keep your kindness
and affection to yourselves.

557
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,042
It's dark heart.

558
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,447
Yes. I've come here
to get you,

559
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:45,484
And now i shall
have you all.

560
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,454
That's what you
think, dark heart.

561
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,789
True heart!
Noble heart!

562
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,693
You'll have to
get through us first.

563
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,464
I should have
gotten rid of your helpers

564
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,233
Before i went after you.

565
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,834
Care bears.

566
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,403
Care cousins.

567
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,004
Stare!

568
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,439
Hold!

569
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,113
Roowwrrr!

570
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:22,221
No0000!

571
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:28,560
You have won today,
but i'll be back!

572
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,729
We must follow him

573
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,233
While his evil power
is still weak

574
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,235
And defeat him.

575
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,736
Care bears!

576
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,738
Care bear cousins!

577
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,573
While we're away,

578
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,710
It will be
up to you

579
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,613
To carry on caring
for the world.

580
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,081
You can count on us.

581
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,750
All of us.

582
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,887
Good-Bye!
Good-Bye!

583
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:59,725
We love you,
true heart, noble heart.

584
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,161
We love you all.

585
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:07,266
I hope we can do it
by ourselves.

586
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,269
We have to,
tender heart.

587
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,772
So, while true heart
and noble heart

588
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,308
Were off
chasing dark heart,

589
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:20,779
The care bears tried to
take care of everything

590
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,014
All by themselves.

591
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,585
Ok, sunshine,
love-A-Lot,

592
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,787
You're cleared
for takeoff.

593
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:32,424
I can't remember when we've been so busy,
tender heart.

594
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,793
True heart
and noble heart

595
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,796
Are counting on us to handle
everything until they get back.

596
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:42,334
They won't return until
they defeat dark heart.

597
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,237
I hope
they're ok.

598
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,807
Ha ha!
Yay!

599
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,809
Whee!

600
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,311
Ha ha ha!

601
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,879
Whee!

602
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,250
First one back.
I won!

603
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:02,020
You always win,
christy.

604
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,389
That's right.

605
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,024
That's why
i'm camp champ

606
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,659
And you're not.

607
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,194
Oh...

608
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,831
You lost, so you've
got trash duty.

609
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,666
Now, get started.

610
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,167
Please, christy.

611
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,505
If i ever become
camp champ again,

612
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,673
I'd let others win
sometimes.

613
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,041
Ha!

614
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,677
Umph! Oh!

615
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,080
Well, you'll never be
camp champ again.

616
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,250
No one will.

617
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,691
Are you
the camp champ?

618
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,528
Who's asking? Huh!

619
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,195
Good.

620
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,197
The time has come

621
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,368
For you to return
my favor.

622
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,438
Who... who are you?

623
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,677
Oh, you remember me.

624
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:03,214
What do i have to do
to repay you?

625
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,217
I want to trap
the care bears,

626
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,720
And i have a plan.

627
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:14,059
The world must learn
to fear me, dark heart,

628
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,895
And i need
your help.

629
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,332
What if i
refuse to help you?

630
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:26,505
Do you want to be the one
who always came in last,

631
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,706
Like him?

632
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,911
Huh?

633
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,780
Yeow!

634
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,181
Huh!

635
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,317
Oh, no!

636
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:42,153
I knew
you'd help me.

637
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,322
Huh!

638
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,628
Come, now.
We're wasting time.

639
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:50,829
Whoa!

640
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,335
Huh! Oh!

641
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,277
Boy, am i bushed.

642
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,280
Where's everyone else,
tender heart?

643
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:14,119
We sent them off this
morning to help some people.

644
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,121
They haven't
come back.

645
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,791
Neither has anyone
that went after them.

646
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,627
I hope
they're all right.

647
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,128
Help!

648
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,465
Someone
needs our help.

649
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,300
You and cheer bear
hold the fort, wish bear.

650
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,603
You ready, grumpy?

651
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,804
Let's go.

652
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,477
Oh, help! Help me!

653
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,480
Little did
the care bears suspect

654
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,483
They were heading
into a trap.

655
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,418
Look.

656
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,054
Help me!
Please, someone, help!

657
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:53,324
Help!

658
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,727
Brave heart
to the rescue!

659
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,230
Charge!

660
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,737
Brave heart lion.

661
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:09,741
Sometimes i think
you're too brave.

662
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,109
Look!

663
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,845
It's share, champ,
and good luck bear.

664
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,915
And friend
and secret bear.

665
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,349
Wait! Stop!

666
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,789
What are we waiting for?
Let's help.

667
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,291
Charge!

668
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,095
Whoa!

669
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:34,365
Oh, help!
Somebody, please!

670
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,934
Stop!

671
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,138
Look!

672
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,474
Oh, no!

673
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,510
Watch out,
care bears!

674
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,178
Whah!

675
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,680
Whoa!

676
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,348
Ah!

677
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,617
Ha!

678
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,451
Help me.

679
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,220
Grab the line.

680
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,858
Why won't she
grab it?

681
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,261
Oh!

682
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,395
Yeow!

683
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,264
Oh, no!

684
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:09,434
Yaah!

685
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,538
Hey!
Where'd they go?

686
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,640
Ha ha ha ha!

687
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,312
It's dark heart!

688
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:24,916
We have to help
that little girl.

689
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,252
Better not,
brave heart.

690
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,289
We saw her throw her
paddles into the water.

691
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,962
She's working
with dark heart!

692
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:40,431
That's what's happened
to the care bears.

693
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,934
Dark heart's
trapped them.

694
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:47,338
We're not going to
take this sitting down.

695
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:50,108
What should we do?

696
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:53,311
Gather all
the care bear cousins.

697
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,948
Meet us at
the hall of hearts.

698
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,284
Hurry, or
there won't be

699
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,353
Enough of us
left to help.

700
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,457
Why so glum,
christy?

701
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,627
You're doing
a great job.

702
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:11,296
When will we stop?

703
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,464
When i have
those bears

704
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,635
And their cousins
in my grasp.

705
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,069
No!

706
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,006
Noble heart
and true heart

707
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,474
Will realize they've
been chasing my shadow.

708
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,979
When they come,
i'll be ready for them.

709
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,949
There'll be no one
to stop me!

710
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,017
Aah!

711
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,218
Whoa!

712
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,552
Ow!

713
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:37,155
Hey.

714
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,491
Hey, what
are you doing?

715
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,727
Oh!

716
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,586
You saved me. Why?

717
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:14,425
Good or bad,
you're still a person,

718
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,294
Or whatever you are.

719
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:19,364
If you knew what
was good for you,

720
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,867
You would have
left me.

721
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,702
You would have
done that.

722
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,872
Maybe that's the only
difference between us.

723
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:37,048
Dark heart's evil influence
was already spreading

724
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,985
Through the children
in the camp.

725
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,552
Dawn, get down!

726
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,123
Ha ha ha!

727
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:49,627
Huh! Huh!

728
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,129
Come on.

729
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:57,435
Something's
going on, john.

730
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:58,804
All the other
kids...

731
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,339
Are destroying
everything.

732
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:04,375
Even the animals in the forest
were acting strangely

733
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,879
Because of dark heart's
evil presence.

734
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,248
Whatever has
gotten into them

735
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,250
Is getting
into everything.

736
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,952
Grrr!

737
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,086
John!

738
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,587
Grrr!

739
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,323
Blrrr!

740
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,827
Run!
Run!

741
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,938
Oh! We're in luck.

742
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,074
That's who we're
looking for.

743
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,077
Yeow!

744
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,581
Help! Help!

745
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,485
Oh, dear.

746
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:59,297
Yes, talking to him
might calm him down.

747
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,667
Uh, excuse me,
mr. Moose.

748
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,105
Are you angry
about something?

749
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,808
We can talk about it.

750
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,542
Grr!

751
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,644
Maybe not.

752
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,980
Run!

753
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,915
Hurry! Run!

754
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,423
Whoa!

755
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,136
Rroo!

756
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:41,873
Rroo!

757
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,144
Rroo!

758
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,148
Rroo!

759
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:02,693
You don't
make much noise,

760
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,662
But when you do...

761
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:09,534
Right. A little love
does go a long way.

762
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,170
It certainly
cured the moose

763
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,239
Of dark heart's
influence.

764
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,613
Hey, you're the cubs.

765
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,783
Right. We're here
to help you.

766
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:28,019
Come on.

767
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:31,957
There's a meeting
at the hall of hearts.

768
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,192
I'll explain on the way.

769
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:43,001
Dark heart had trapped
almost all of the care bears

770
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,070
And care bear cousins.

771
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:49,640
Only a handful of care bear
family members was left.

772
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:53,811
And now, everything
depended on them.

773
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:57,215
So this is all
that are left.

774
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:59,584
What can
we do?

775
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,486
We were
so many,

776
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,454
Now we're
so very few.

777
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:06,224
We can't just stop
helping people.

778
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:09,627
We just can't
stop caring.

779
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:13,464
Brave heart's right,
and dark heart knows it.

780
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,067
Whenever we help someone,

781
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:19,504
That someone could be christy
setting another trap.

782
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,440
What about noble heart
and true heart?

783
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,109
I don't know.

784
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:28,113
We can't wait for them
to come back.

785
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,516
It's up to us.
If we lose,

786
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,184
There'll be
nothing left.

787
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,753
We're with you,
tender heart!

788
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,323
All the way!

789
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,992
Hooray!
Hooray!

790
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,493
Hooray!

791
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,729
Yippee!

792
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,631
Cousins! Kids!

793
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,668
Every bear,
don't just sit there.

794
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,403
Care, care, care!

795
00:47:52,470 --> 00:48:02,647
* care a lot,
we care a lot *

796
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,051
* keep your chin up,
don't stop caring *

797
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:09,387
* we've got a job,
and it's tough to do *

798
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,122
* now is the moment

799
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,790
* start preparing

800
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:16,227
* stand up and fight
for the good and true *

801
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,730
* give your all
and never falter *

802
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:23,034
* we have promised
to defend *

803
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,337
* do your part
and put your heart in *

804
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:31,342
* our numbers are few,
but we know what to do *

805
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,612
* sticking together,
we can make it *

806
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,283
* nothing can stop us,
we can't go wrong *

807
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,752
* we can be tough,
yet we can take it *

808
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,689
* we care a lot,
and we will be strong *

809
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,526
* no feeling frightened,
scared of failing *

810
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,862
* don't want to
let the whole world down *

811
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,864
* we have to brighten

812
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,333
* keep on sailing

813
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,634
* give us a smile

814
00:48:56,701 --> 00:49:00,205
* and we'll turn up
your frown *

815
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,841
* sticking together,
we can make it *

816
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:07,278
* nothing can stop us,
we can't go wrong *

817
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:10,781
* we can be tough,
yes, we can take it *

818
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:19,490
* we care a lot,
and we will be strong *

819
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:28,299
* care a lot,
we care a lot *

820
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,311
Heh heh heh!

821
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,816
Ha ha ha!

822
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,256
The care bear family
was risking everything

823
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,324
To free the others.

824
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,329
Now's our chance.

825
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:10,841
That door must lead
to dark heart's secret cave!

826
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,395
There's
brave heart's signal!

827
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,730
You know
what to do?

828
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,232
Leave christy to us.

829
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,401
You help
the others.

830
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,802
Let's go.

831
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:44,242
This must be
where dark heart

832
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:46,244
Is keeping
the others.

833
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,314
Come on,
the coast is clear.

834
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,331
Ha ha ha ha!

835
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,334
They walked
right into my trap.

836
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,703
Now that the entire
care bear family

837
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,939
Is in my power,

838
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,610
All the love and kindness in
the world will soon be no more!

839
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:25,616
True heart and noble heart

840
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,518
Were the care bear family's
only hope,

841
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,020
But they were still away,

842
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,757
Unknowingly chasing
dark heart's shadow.

843
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:39,096
I don't like
the looks of this place.

844
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:42,032
I'm with you,
true heart,

845
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,304
But we have to
follow dark heart.

846
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,606
Grr!

847
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,142
There he is!

848
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,144
Aargh!

849
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,112
Come on.

850
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:09,860
Ha ha ha ha!

851
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:12,430
Now, true heart,
now!

852
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:13,631
Ha ha!

853
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,969
It's not
dark heart at all!

854
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:22,640
It...it...
it's his shadow!

855
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:27,812
We've been tricked into
leaving the others all alone.

856
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,581
Hurry. We
have to get back.

857
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,084
And hope we're
not too late.

858
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,522
They didn't know
they were already too late.

859
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:52,169
Ha ha ha ha!

860
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,608
Ha ha!

861
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,677
Looking for me?

862
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,247
Hey!

863
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,325
Hey.

864
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,194
Are you ok?

865
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:19,764
Now i have you all!

866
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,933
You can't
keep us here.

867
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,135
Oh, i don't intend to.

868
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,139
I have a very special
place all set.

869
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:34,178
That will keep
until i've rested.

870
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,716
Oh.

871
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:55,232
I shall be back shortly.

872
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,574
Now we're
all here.

873
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:08,078
That's the plan.
We wanted to get caught.

874
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:10,981
We're strongest when
we're all together.

875
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:15,052
Now we can stand united
against dark heart.

876
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,060
Hurry,
little star buddy.

877
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,563
We don't
have much time.

878
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,073
Christy?

879
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,509
John? Dawn?

880
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:41,078
What are you
doing here?

881
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:44,081
Run before
he gets you.

882
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,016
No, christy.
We're staying.

883
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,486
We're going to help.

884
00:54:48,553 --> 00:54:51,522
We can make
things go back

885
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:56,461
To the way they were
before dark heart came.

886
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:58,529
Since i've
been camp champ,

887
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:03,368
I've never made you
do trash duty.

888
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:07,472
No one laughs
at you anymore.

889
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,073
I won't let them.

890
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,844
I can't go back
to being a nobody.

891
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,814
You were never
a nobody, christy.

892
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:19,617
You were always
our friend.

893
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:25,390
A friend is the most special
person in the world.

894
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:29,894
I made a bargain
with him.

895
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,031
Oh, it's too late.
The damage has been done.

896
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,566
You've
paid him back.

897
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:38,569
Now you
have to stop him

898
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:41,071
From hurting
all the others.

899
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:43,340
Think of
your friends.

900
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:46,377
You were always
the marble champ.

901
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:49,313
That you did
all by yourself.

902
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,755
Dawn. John.

903
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:00,324
Wait for me!

904
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:05,396
Reunited, they set off
to help their friends.

905
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:08,065
Good work.

906
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:12,770
Little star buddy
can't unlock all these doors.

907
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:18,443
We have to get the key
from dark heart.

908
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,678
What if he
wakes up?

909
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:23,247
We have to chance it!

910
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:00,451
Whoa, hey!

911
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,223
It's out of reach.

912
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:16,801
Ooh, that's it.
That's it. You got it!

913
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,807
Uh-Oh.

914
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,215
Oh!

915
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:37,755
No, no!

916
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:40,758
Look out!

917
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:01,378
There's no
escape from me.

918
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:04,048
Well, it's time to put you all
where i should have put you

919
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,050
In the first place.

920
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:16,861
What did you
do to them?

921
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:23,233
Well, well, if it isn't
the camp champ!

922
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,503
Where are they,
dark heart?

923
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:29,239
The bears?
Their cousins?

924
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:33,310
Why, i've created
my most prized treasure.

925
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,314
Ah!
Ah!

926
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,552
Ha ha ha!

927
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:50,060
A chandelier
of frozen feelings.

928
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,262
Look! All of
your friends

929
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,566
Frozen in my
crystal prison.

930
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:59,637
All that love
right where it should be,

931
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,906
Trapped forever!

932
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,047
Ha ha ha!

933
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:14,518
You can't do this.
I won't let you.

934
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:17,354
But you made it
all possible.

935
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,357
Like this camp,
everything i touch

936
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:23,861
Will be drained
of goodness and kindness.

937
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:28,365
You have to deal
with us first!

938
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:33,303
We'll put an end
to your evil trickery.

939
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:36,674
Noble heart
and true heart!

940
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:39,644
True and noble
to the very end.

941
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:43,714
I'm glad you came,
but you're too late.

942
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:46,316
Now you shall
join the others

943
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:50,487
And leave me
to do as i will.

944
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,091
Ha ha ha!

945
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:56,393
No, stop!

946
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,329
Christy, move out
of the way.

947
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,066
Christy, do as he says.

948
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,835
I won't
let you do this.

949
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,337
Free the others.

950
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,339
We have concluded
our bargain.

951
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:14,411
I'm allowing you to leave.
Now go!

952
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:17,347
You don't want
to do this.

953
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:23,020
Leave us, or i'll take back
all that i've given you!

954
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,691
So be it.

955
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:32,096
You're back
to what you were...

956
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,131
A loser.

957
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:36,600
Ok. So what?

958
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:41,138
I'm going to
help stop you.

959
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:43,774
You saved
my life, christy.

960
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,643
Now run
and save yourself.

961
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:49,213
Go!

962
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,724
Aargh!

963
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:04,294
Stop!

964
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:06,964
Aah!

965
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,398
Christy.

966
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:09,800
John!

967
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,095
Ha ha ha ha!

968
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:41,265
Care bears, stare!

969
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,434
Care cousins, call!

970
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:47,604
Aargh!

971
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:49,639
No!

972
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,042
Aaah!

973
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,551
Ha ha ha!

974
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,888
Oh, no!

975
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:08,058
Good or bad,
you're still a person.

976
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:12,129
Oh, what have i done?

977
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,336
Help me, care bears.

978
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:20,637
Oh.

979
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,479
Oh!

980
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:34,018
Bring this child back
from where i've sent her.

981
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,088
We...we can't.
We...we can't.

982
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,027
It would take
more love and caring

983
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:47,431
Than even we have
all put together.

984
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:51,035
You've got to
do something.

985
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:55,039
What good is all
your love, your caring,

986
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,442
If it cannot
save this child?

987
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,744
If you can't help,

988
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,914
Who can?

989
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:05,315
We care.

990
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,484
We all
really care.

991
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,787
There have to be
other people

992
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:14,224
Who care as much
as we do.

993
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,494
If all of us
and everyone everywhere

994
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,663
All care together,

995
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,732
It just might
save christy.

996
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,235
Everyone hold hands,

997
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,839
And together
open your hearts

998
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:32,076
And listen hard
for the voice

999
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,844
Of those who care.

1000
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:38,582
We care.

1001
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,918
We care.
We care.

1002
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:45,089
If you have
ever cared, do it now.

1003
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,091
Tell us you care.

1004
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:52,262
Tell your friend
next to you that you care.

1005
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,598
We care.

1006
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,601
Tell them
how much you care.

1007
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,603
Tell them again.

1008
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,173
Say it. Shout it. Help us.

1009
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:21,191
We care.

1010
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:32,202
I care.

1011
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:34,271
I care!

1012
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:38,775
Christy?

1013
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:47,284
Hooray!
Yippee!

1014
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,290
Hooray!

1015
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:04,368
Hurry! We have to
leave quickly.

1016
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,360
Thank you.

1017
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,696
Thank you for caring.

1018
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,264
But...but...

1019
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,766
I did care,
didn't i?

1020
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,768
I never
really understood

1021
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:43,273
Why you pulled me out of the river,
but i do now.

1022
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,343
Hooray!

1023
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,346
Your eyes!

1024
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,150
Look.

1025
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:56,820
I'm a boy!
A real boy!

1026
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,789
Your evil left you
when you admitted

1027
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,725
How much you cared.

1028
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,860
Whooppee!

1029
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:06,230
I'm a boy!

1030
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,897
I can jump!

1031
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,799
I can run!

1032
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:13,037
I can turn cartwheels!

1033
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:14,438
Whoa!

1034
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,875
Ha ha ha!

1035
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:22,712
Don't worry.
We can learn together.

1036
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,880
Hey, come on.

1037
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:39,196
* i'm flying my colors
so that everyone can see *

1038
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:42,499

1039
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:43,967

1040
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:45,635

1041
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:50,207
* let the magic of my color
put its power on you *

1042
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,793
Ya-Hoo!

1043
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,211
* i like you, i like you

1044
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:30,980

* i'm flying my colors
so that everyone can see *

1047
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,757

1048
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:42,259

1049
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:43,860

* the magic of my color

1052
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,068
This camp's the greatest
place to be.

1053
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,504
I'm going to stay here

1054
01:08:27,571 --> 01:08:31,175
And make sure that
everyone's a camp champ.

1055
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:35,011
Just remember,
everybody's already a champ

1056
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:38,014
Because no matter
who they are,

1057
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:40,083
They're friends.

1058
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,588
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1059
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:55,732
Yes, sir, everything was back
to the way it was,

1060
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:00,737
But as always, it was
just a little bit better,

1061
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,806
A little more special,

1062
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:07,311
Thanks to the care bears,
the care bear cousins,

1063
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:09,313
And thanks to...

1064
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:11,315
Heh heh heh!

1065
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:14,818
Well, you all
know who you are.

1066
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,321
I thank my lucky stars

1067
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:22,326
That there are people like you
who really do care.

1068
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,762
You're not afraid
to share your feelings,

1069
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:31,835
And that makes you all
world-Class care bear champs.

1070
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:54,057
