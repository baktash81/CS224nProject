1
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,694
Well, here we are.

2
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:23,364
What do you think?

3
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,073
lt's nice.

4
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,700
What do you think, Louis?

5
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,119
l think he likes it, Mom.

6
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:36,038
Ride your bikes, too.

7
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:40,707
lt's really dark.
Let's get some light in here.

8
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,961
Listen, guys, there's only one bathroom.

9
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,130
So we're all gonna have to share.

10
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,090
lt's the only drawback. This is yours, Mil.

11
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,382
What do you think?

12
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,301
Of course,
we'll have to change the wallpaper.

13
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,844
The people who lived here before us
had two boys.

14
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,263
So both the kids' bedrooms
have boys' wallpaper.

15
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:04,680
This looks great, Mom.

16
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,139
l think you're going to like it.

17
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:08,224
lt's really very subtle.

18
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,818
Condo.

19
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:29,570
Shipwreck.

20
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:34,782
Barbecue.

21
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,639
Hi.

22
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,110
Hey, what's going on?

23
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,117
What's he doing?

24
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:49,619
l'd say an F-15.

25
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,332
Let's go, Max. Move out!

26
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,462
This goes over here.

27
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:23,849
Excuse me.

28
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,975
These your groceries?

29
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,142
Yeah.

30
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,560
l'm Geneva Goodman.
l live down the street.

31
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:32,688
l guess you'll go to Taft.
l go to St. Monica's Catholic School.

32
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,146
Shitty cafeteria.

33
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,607
l suppose this is your Coke, too.

34
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,193
We're going to be great friends.
Excuse me.

35
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,291
Drop in again some time, will you?

36
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,668
We're going to miss you, you stupid goof!

37
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,544
You're finished, pal.

38
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,846
Heel, Hitler!

39
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,184
Well, look at this.

40
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,518
Where do you think you're going,
Soldier Boy?

41
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,478
Just around the block.

42
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,479
Just around the block?

43
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:45,107
Nobody goes around the block here
unless you get our okay.

44
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:46,983
And you don't got it.

45
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,526
See, l'm new,
and l just moved down the street.

46
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,654
-So l didn't know.
-Shut up, Soldier Boy.

47
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,698
What do you say, guys? 10 seconds?

48
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:02,076
We'll give you a 10-second head start,
then your ass is grass.

49
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,035
One...

50
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:04,076
Wait a second.

51
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,411
...two...

52
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,287
three...

53
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:10,331
four, five, six...

54
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,082
seven, eight, nine, ten.

55
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,749
Go on! Get him!

56
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,710
Get back here, you coward!

57
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:21,962
There he is! Let's get him!

58
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:27,674
Get him!

59
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:34,512
lt's a fantastic mall.
Movie theater, all the best clothes.

60
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,013
-How much allowance do you get?
-Mom...

61
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,349
l'd like you to meet Geneva.
Geneva, this is my mom.

62
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,142
This is my brother, Sonny.

63
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,477
Hello.

64
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:49,896
Say hello to your new neighbors, idiot.

65
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,606
Nice to meet you.

66
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,274
-Well, see you later.
-'Bye.

67
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,360
See you later.

68
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:02,445
So you guys thought
you weren't going to make any friends.

69
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:35,549
Mom?

70
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:39,969
Hi, honey.

71
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:47,306
l was in bed.
l was almost asleep, and l just....

72
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:50,434
l got the strongest feeling
that something was missing.

73
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,434
That we forgot something at home.

74
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:56,478
So l came downstairs
and started going through everything.

75
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,522
l checked all the furniture.

76
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,773
l went over the inventory
from the moving company.

77
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:03,358
lt's all here.

78
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,570
And l realized...

79
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,448
what it was.

80
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:23,328
lt's not going to be easy, honey.

81
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,581
l'm really going to need your help.

82
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:29,290
l know, Mom.

83
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,625
Yeah, l know you do.

84
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,175
You better get to sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

85
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,845
Good night, Mom.

86
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,622
You didn't forget anything back home,
did you, girl?

87
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,742
We're late! Move it!

88
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,787
Louis, get dressed real fast. We're late.

89
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,247
Come on! Pretend you're a fireman.

90
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:46,458
You guys aren't moving very fast.
Where's your shirt?

91
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,417
l can't find my shirt.

92
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,378
-Would you help me....
-l got it, Mom. We're gonna be so late.

93
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,632
lf there's slobber on this shirt,
you're gonna get it.

94
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,893
You've got to take him to room number 3.

95
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:20,061
lt's right next to the school office.
Here's lunch money, honey.

96
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,021
-No soda.
-l can find it.

97
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,605
Milly better take you.

98
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:26,941
-No problem. You guys are already late.
-Are you sure?

99
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,484
-Yeah, no problem.
-Okay.

100
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:31,611
You be good.

101
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,112
First days count.

102
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,582
The name's Louis Michaelson.

103
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,167
lf this is the third grade, l got to be here.

104
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,918
So where do l sit?

105
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,597
Now, as to the theme....

106
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:22,641
Hello. You must be Amelia.

107
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,602
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:30,105
Come, Amelia.
Sit in this middle seat, will you, please?

109
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,355
Class...

110
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,523
this is Amelia Michaelson.

111
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,858
She's a new student here at Taft...

112
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,277
and l hope that
you will make her feel very welcome.

113
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:45,280
Amelia, we're discussing
Romeo and Juliet today.

114
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,240
The theme: young love.

115
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,033
Pure, passionate, ill-fated.

116
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:51,993
lt was not original...

117
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:55,078
even when Shakespeare
wrote this play in 1596.

118
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:58,872
The charm of Romeo and Juliet
is its language.

119
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:02,375
When Juliet learns who Romeo is,
she speaks:

120
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:05,668
''My only love sprung from my only hate!

121
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,170
''Too early seen unknown,
and known too late! ''

122
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,341
l was approaching the red light and
l was coming through this point here.

123
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:19,844
l put on my brakes,
and the guy smashed right into me.

124
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,971
Please make sure Collins takes that file
to the conference in Chicago.

125
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,680
-Yes, Mr. Brandt.
-Mr. Brandt?

126
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:26,639
Yeah.

127
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,932
Hi, l'm Charlene Michaelson...

128
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,225
Donald Michaelson's wife.

129
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:32,851
Yes, of course.

130
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:37,938
We're all very sorry to hear about Donald.
He was a delightful man.

131
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,355
Thank you.

132
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:43,858
So l understand you're going to give
the insurance business a go.

133
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:45,901
Well, l'm not new to the business.

134
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,403
l was a regional manager
when Donald and l first met.

135
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:53,113
l can't imagine
things have changed so much in 13 years.

136
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,626
Louis?

137
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:38,891
-Starting a new graveyard?
-Yeah, Duke got killed.

138
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,645
He was one of your favorites, wasn't he?

139
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:47,438
He was a good man, but he got careless.

140
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,357
A sniper got him.

141
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,985
You got to be careful in this war.

142
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:03,240
Why don't you come on inside
and set the table, okay?

143
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,448
Okay.

144
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,430
-Hi! l'm home.
-Hi, Mom!

145
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:46,308
How was school?

146
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,518
l got homework already!

147
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,769
What are your teachers like?

148
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,145
Mrs. Sherman, Mom. She's great.

149
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:59,566
-What about yours, Louis?
-She gave me homework already!

150
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,317
Yeah, well...

151
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:03,985
guess what?
Your mom's got homework, too.

152
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:05,194
What?

153
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:10,156
Suddenly it seems the entire
insurance business is run by computers.

154
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,449
Oh, no.

155
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,326
They got me working on a trial basis
till l can figure it out.

156
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:20,371
He sent me home with
a whole carload full of books to study.

157
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,582
-lt's okay. l'll be all right.
-l'm sure you will.

158
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,754
l found out about the boy next door.

159
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,213
His name's Eric Gibb.

160
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,048
They think he's autistic.

161
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,382
He's got some marbles loose, or what?

162
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,759
Well, they don't exactly know.

163
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:47,012
But he's never spoken a word in his life,
and he doesn't like to be around people.

164
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:50,055
There's some institute
that wants to come and take him away...

165
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:53,474
but Mrs. Sherman says
he's better off with his uncle.

166
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,017
He's in my class at school.

167
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,560
Mrs. Sherman used to teach
those kind of kids.

168
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,354
She thinks that maybe being around
normal people will help him, or something.

169
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,772
Where are his parents?

170
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,690
That's the weird part.

171
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,025
When Eric was five years old...

172
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,361
his parents went on a trip
to Spain or France, or someplace like that.

173
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:16,321
The plane crashed and they died.

174
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,864
Oh, dear.

175
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,865
Now, what l heard...

176
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:24,075
is at the moment the plane went down...

177
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,244
Eric was alone in his room.

178
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:29,496
And without anybody
even telling him anything...

179
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:32,748
he started to pretend to fly.

180
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:37,709
lt's like, somehow he knew
his parents were about to crash.

181
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:42,170
The way he figured he could save them
was by being an airplane.

182
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,755
He's been one ever since.

183
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:15,441
We have the staff and facilities
to give individual care.

184
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:20,110
He's doing fine at home, and
l'm giving him special attention at school.

185
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,529
-He'll be safer with us.
-He doesn't want to be there.

186
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:25,530
You saw how sick he got last time.

187
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:29,616
He had a fever. lt had nothing to do
with being in the institute.

188
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:35,120
Look, he still exhibits antisocial behavior.

189
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:37,788
lt wasn't the fever,
he's afraid of being confined.

190
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:41,665
l think, gentlemen, if you let him go,
you'll find out he'll go in by himself.

191
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,459
Be careful with him on the stairs.

192
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,544
You need any help?

193
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,422
Mil, what's happening?

194
00:19:57,133 --> 00:20:00,468
He's going to hurt himself.
Nothing is prepared here for him.

195
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:04,262
The windows don't have screens on them.
There's furniture with edges on it.

196
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:06,681
This place is not safe for him.

197
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:11,017
His place is here. ln his own home...

198
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,268
-with his own family!
-Stop it!

199
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,353
What's going on?

200
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:18,062
l don't know, Mom.

201
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,773
He's going to hurt himself on this.
l told you that.

202
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:23,357
That's why he has the straitjacket.

203
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,109
We really shouldn't be doing this.
lt's none of our business.

204
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,319
Take that damn straitjacket off him!

205
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,779
Come into the hall.
l'll show you what l've got.

206
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:35,698
lt is not a question of safety.
lt is a question of caring!

207
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,159
Allen!

208
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:42,244
He's okay there. He won't fall, believe me.

209
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,245
Christ!

210
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,039
He's going to hurt himself.

211
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,874
He needs constant supervision and care.

212
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,001
He needs somebody watching him
24 hours a day.

213
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:08,385
-Bedtime.
-Okay.

214
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,764
We have no alternative
but to place him in the institute.

215
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:24,145
We're going to have
a coed volleyball game.

216
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:28,648
Dexter, set up over here, please.
Scott, the other court.

217
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,149
Quickly.

218
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,858
Quickly, quickly!

219
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:36,777
Come on.

220
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:39,320
Thanks.

221
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,240
-So what do you think?
-Oh, my God.

222
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,618
-What did you do to get that, Mona?
-l accepted his invitation to the fair...

223
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:52,286
-and he was overwhelmed with passion.
-The fair's over two months away.

224
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,830
You'd better start whipping your ass
around campus now...

225
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:59,541
-or you'll wind up going with Eric there.
-You can fly to the fair with him.

226
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,626
Okay, girls. Cut the crap and warm up.

227
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:05,753
Will anybody volunteer
to warm up with Eric?

228
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,589
Anyone?

229
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,257
Come on.

230
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,009
l'll do it.

231
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,761
Thank you, Milly.

232
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,764
Remember, he won't catch the ball
when you throw it to him.

233
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:26,266
-So just be gentle, but be persistent.
-Okay.

234
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:27,850
Thanks.

235
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:31,728
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some warm-ups!

236
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,647
Lauren, you take the ball out.
lt's your turn to serve.

237
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:48,821
Hi, Eric.

238
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:52,240
Want to catch the ball?

239
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:00,912
Eric?

240
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:11,544
Hello?

241
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,342
Okay. l'll roll it to you,
and you catch it, okay?

242
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:33,390
Eric...

243
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:36,350
you can do it.

244
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:38,644
You've just got to try.

245
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,983
''Your son refuses to join
in classroom activities.''

246
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,067
l'm not going to sing. No way!

247
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,027
''lf his behavior does not improve...

248
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:54,653
''we'll have to have a conference
with the principal.''

249
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,322
Louis, how can you do this?
This is the first week.

250
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,365
You sign it.
You can do Mom's signature great.

251
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,700
''PS: Toy guns, knives, grenades
and flame throwers...

252
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:07,661
-''are not allowed on the school premises.''
-Don't show it to Mom.

253
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:11,830
l'll think about it.
Louis, could you get the dog?

254
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,707
Sure. Come on, Max. Come on, boy.

255
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,627
-l think l'm going to vacuum my room.
-Sounds good.

256
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,920
Yeah, l'll vacuum my room.

257
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,088
Mom will love it.

258
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:58,192
God.

259
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:00,985
Eric.

260
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,866
How'd you get in here?

261
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:15,577
Milly!

262
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:18,246
Milly, come quick.

263
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,956
The vacuum cleaner's eating my shirt!

264
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:29,544
Thanks.

265
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:04,023
What do you know about Eric?

266
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,275
Have you ever seen him
do anything weird?

267
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,861
-That is all l've ever seen him do.
-No, l mean really weird.

268
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,696
Dinky Patterson told me
something weird about him once.

269
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,280
Who's Dinky Patterson?

270
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:17,074
Dinky lived here before you,
had your room.

271
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:21,076
Dinky used to get really annoyed
with Eric climbing outside his window.

272
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,078
So he took his BB gun,
stuffed the barrel with wet Kleenex...

273
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,413
-and started shooting at Eric.
-That's sweet.

274
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:30,916
He said he kept it up for about an hour.
But Eric wouldn't budge, so he gave up.

275
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,541
Here's the weird part.

276
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:35,918
The next day,
Dinky's looking around for his BB gun.

277
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:38,337
You know where he said he found it?

278
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,212
See that telephone pole?

279
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:43,465
Dinky said it was up there,
up on top of that box.

280
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,300
That, somehow, Eric put it there.

281
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:49,218
Of course,
Dinky was the biggest liar l ever knew.

282
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:51,928
-lt probably never happened.
-Probably.

283
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,180
What happened to Dinky?
Why did he move?

284
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:59,182
His dad got some hotshot job in Atlanta.
Took the whole family.

285
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,478
So, where's your dad?

286
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:08,647
He died.

287
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:10,190
What of?.

288
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,149
Cancer.

289
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,901
Everyone in my family dies of cancer.

290
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:18,903
My grandmother had stomach cancer.
She lost 300 pounds before she died.

291
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:22,780
Never looked better in her life.
What kind did your dad have?

292
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,198
-l don't know.
-They didn't tell you.

293
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,242
They never tell the kids.

294
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:30,577
-Did it take a long time?
-Can we drop the subject?

295
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,328
-Sure.
-Thanks.

296
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,663
What were we talking about?

297
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,751
Eric?

298
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,962
Eric, get away from the edge!

299
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:51,965
What are we doing?

300
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:54,383
Hey, wait a minute!

301
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,303
Why are we doing this?

302
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:04,139
l don't think we should be doing this.
Get your mother, Louis!

303
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:07,683
Are you sure you want to do this?
This may not be too good of an idea.

304
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,226
Milly? Hello?

305
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:14,438
Mom, come quick! Emergency situation!

306
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:20,065
Milly, careful.

307
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,318
Milly!

308
00:28:24,401 --> 00:28:26,695
l'm okay, Mom. Come on, Eric.

309
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,029
Honey, be careful.

310
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:32,615
-No problem, Mom.
-Where are you taking him?

311
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:35,909
There's a window over here. We're okay.

312
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:05,130
Mil?

313
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:07,547
You okay?

314
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:09,633
Milly?

315
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:18,680
-We're fine, you guys.
-All right! Way to go!

316
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,931
-You coming down?
-Yeah. Just a sec.

317
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,102
Eric...

318
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:32,688
you're safer out on the windowsill,
so don't go on the roof again, okay?

319
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,067
Something tells me
you know what l'm saying.

320
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,234
You're just not letting on.

321
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,822
'Bye, Eric. You stay here.

322
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:22,844
Don't shake the floor, please.

323
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,312
There we go.

324
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:44,899
You see, you can't start on a bottle
until the cork lands on its feet.

325
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:49,736
lt's very frustrating
when it takes a long time.

326
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:56,739
On the other hand, it's quite delightful
when it happens on the first toss.

327
00:31:58,157 --> 00:31:59,784
Care for a drink?

328
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,576
No. No, thank you.

329
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:05,453
-Are you calling me a drunk?
-No.

330
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:08,873
Why not?

331
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:13,500
Well, because it wouldn't be polite.

332
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:14,959
Polite.

333
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:20,337
Well, it's more polite to be called a drunk
than a madman.

334
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,131
Wouldn't you agree?

335
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,632
Yeah, l guess so.

336
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,508
There you go.

337
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:30,344
l do believe we haven't met.
My name's Hugo Gibb.

338
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:33,137
l'm Milly Michaelson. l live next door.

339
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:36,931
Eric was out on the roof,
so l helped him back inside.

340
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:40,308
What on earth possessed you to do that?

341
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:43,727
l was afraid he would fall and get hurt.

342
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:58,236
Afraid he would fall?

343
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:06,658
Would you be afraid of a balloon falling?

344
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,122
Or a bubble dropping?

345
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,542
Or a feather fluttering to the ground?

346
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,128
No.

347
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:29,964
There you go.

348
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,385
lt's past your bedtime, Louis,
so make it quick.

349
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:46,474
Well, it was weird, that's all.
First your story about Eric and the BB gun.

350
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,350
Then Uncle Hugo telling me
how Eric can't fall.

351
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:53,519
That's because Uncle Hugo
does enough falling for the both of them.

352
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:56,814
l hate people who can't hold their liquor.

353
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:02,024
Your mom's out for the evening.

354
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,651
l have an idea.

355
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:12,239
Banana.

356
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:15,824
Nectarine.

357
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,286
Rum.

358
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:25,539
Will you give me
some of that Tanqueray over there?

359
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:27,749
l don't know about this. lf my mom knew--

360
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,791
Would you stop with ''if my mom knew''?

361
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,794
lf l did everything my mom said,
l'd be a nun. You're 14 years old. Live.

362
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:35,795
Okay.

363
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:46,511
-This looks, like, really disgusting.
-lt's like strawberries with a little....

364
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,303
Hey, to Uncle Hugo.

365
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,649
Look at him.

366
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,485
-Scary face.
-Yeah, very scary.

367
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,171
Give up, John. Admit who you are.

368
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:53,510
What?

369
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,344
Change the channel.

370
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:56,845
No.

371
00:35:57,304 --> 00:35:58,930
This is romantic.

372
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:24,404
lf Eric wasn't the way he is...

373
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:29,323
would you...

374
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,658
consider him handsome?

375
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:39,288
l guess he'd be okay
if he didn't have the brains of a goldfish.

376
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,039
-Geneva!
-What is it with you and Eric?

377
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:45,333
That's all you ever talk about.
You can't be in love with a retard.

378
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,168
lt's just not done.

379
00:36:49,669 --> 00:36:51,795
Well, what if he's fooling?

380
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,341
What if...

381
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,884
a bad witch...

382
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,011
put an evil spell on Eric...

383
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:08,722
and all he needs...

384
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,641
is the kiss of a young maiden...

385
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:16,143
to turn him back into a prince?

386
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:20,354
That's beautiful.

387
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:25,274
'Bye, Geneva!

388
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:28,693
-'Bye, Milly!
-l love Geneva.

389
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:32,779
-l love you, too, Ma.
-Yeah, l know.

390
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,154
l love...

391
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,906
all the people...

392
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:37,615
in all the world.

393
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,492
l even love Louis tonight.

394
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,119
Are you mad at me, Mom?

395
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:47,746
No, l'll be mad at you in the morning
when you're sober.

396
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,127
-Are you going to call me?
-Yeah, l will.

397
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,212
Milly.

398
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,381
Can l see you, dear?

399
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,883
Okay. Just a second, Mrs. Sherman.

400
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:30,518
Not now, Eric.

401
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:43,067
l hear you've been helping Eric
in his gym class.

402
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,985
l just threw him the ball a couple of times.

403
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:49,112
-And you moved into the Patterson house.
-Yes.

404
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:53,365
-Have you met Eric's uncle?
-Yesterday.

405
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:58,284
Why don't you sit down, Milly?

406
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:10,542
Did he tell you that Eric could fly?

407
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,168
Yeah.

408
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:17,963
Then l guess you see
what kind of guardian he must be.

409
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,631
ln fact, if it hadn't been for my support...

410
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:24,175
the state institute
would have put Eric away long ago.

411
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,886
And that can't happen, Milly.

412
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,304
The state people mean well...

413
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,932
but Eric can't exist
in that kind of environment.

414
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,559
A while ago, his uncle went on a binge...

415
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,602
and they did put Eric away
for about a month.

416
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,395
He got sick...

417
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,895
very sick.

418
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,772
He was dying.

419
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:48,773
No one knew why, but l was convinced...

420
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,192
that he had just given up.

421
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:54,819
l promised them then
that l would watch over him.

422
00:40:56,903 --> 00:40:59,489
But l can't be with him all the time.

423
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:06,826
Anyway...

424
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:10,119
l was hoping maybe you'd help.

425
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,039
l'll give you extra credits.

426
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:15,665
lt can be your science project.

427
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,459
l don't know anything
about those kind of kids.

428
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,917
You don't have to.

429
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:22,294
All you have to do is be yourself.

430
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,712
Besides, what l saw out there...

431
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:27,714
no doctor has ever been able
to do with him.

432
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:31,508
He was following you, mimicking you...

433
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,509
wanting to be like you.

434
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:38,220
Doctors haven't been able
to get a word out of him.

435
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,014
Maybe a friend could.

436
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,272
Mrs. Sherman said l should keep a journal.

437
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:56,857
So here it goes.

438
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,067
Day number one:

439
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:04,945
l sat in the back of the class with Eric
for about an hour today.

440
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:08,655
l figured that since he likes to copy me,
l could teach him stuff.

441
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:11,157
But, somehow, it's not that simple.

442
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,492
He really doesn't understand.

443
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,452
He doesn't see the words,
or even the book.

444
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,329
All he sees is me.

445
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:25,666
l have the same problem with him
in gym class.

446
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,959
He won't catch the ball or throw it.

447
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:30,378
He won't do anything on his own.

448
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,631
Milly.

449
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:38,841
Milly.

450
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:40,925
Say it.

451
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:42,593
Milly.

452
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:46,721
And, of course, he won't talk.

453
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:50,598
He won't smile, cry, or do anything,
unless he's mimicking me.

454
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:55,935
l have lunch with him every day.

455
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,561
Just him and me...

456
00:42:57,644 --> 00:43:00,562
right there in the middle of the schoolyard.

457
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:09,526
l'm beginning to think
this is a big mistake.

458
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:19,533
lt's been two weeks since l started
with Eric and nothing's really changed.

459
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:23,368
Sure, he imitates everything l do,
but a parrot can do that.

460
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,329
l'm like one of his airplanes,
something to watch, to copy.

461
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:30,497
lt's not as if we really communicate.

462
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,124
lt's not as if l'm really a friend.

463
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,667
l'm about to give up.

464
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,551
Day 21. Something happened today.

465
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,113
He smiled.

466
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:27,699
He didn't smile because l smiled.

467
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,784
He smiled because he wanted to.

468
00:44:32,077 --> 00:44:35,662
Today, l finally saw something
hiding behind those eyes.

469
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:38,247
Today l saw Eric.

470
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,836
Today we did things l thought he'd like.

471
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,796
lt's working.

472
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,882
''He told them all the sad things that
happened to Dumbo 'cause of his big ears.

473
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,258
''They flew down and offered to help.

474
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:58,677
''One of the crows took Timothy aside.

475
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,595
'''Flying's just like swimming,'
he whispered.

476
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:04,972
'''lt's just a matter of believing
that you can do it.'''

477
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:09,516
Day 33.

478
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:13,560
Just when everything was going well,
it got better.

479
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,354
Okay. Ready?

480
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:20,106
Here we go.

481
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:24,901
Tommy! lt's time to go home!

482
00:45:26,986 --> 00:45:28,194
Sic them!

483
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:31,696
Sic them!

484
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:40,161
No, no.

485
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:47,706
Right there. Hold this above your head.

486
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:51,709
There you go.
Hold it up, and don't let go till l tell you.

487
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,879
-Sic them!
-All right, let go!

488
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,681
All right. Let him hit it.

489
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:19,726
Watch out!

490
00:46:20,518 --> 00:46:22,102
Milly, heads up!

491
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:31,525
You did it. Eric, you did it!

492
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:10,882
Every day Eric opens up a little bit more.

493
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:14,135
Every day he tells me a new secret.

494
00:47:16,177 --> 00:47:18,387
l don't know
if he's becoming more like me...

495
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,721
or l'm becoming more like him.

496
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,349
Somehow those differences
don't seem to matter.

497
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:30,227
Sometimes l feel like l'm....

498
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:51,323
Do it again.

499
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:55,493
All right, Eric.

500
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,369
You're on.

501
00:48:01,371 --> 00:48:03,957
Don't be nervous. You can do this.

502
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:06,291
l know you can.

503
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:22,009
Right there.

504
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,971
You ready?

505
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:31,015
Catch it.

506
00:48:43,647 --> 00:48:45,107
Now catch it.

507
00:48:58,282 --> 00:49:00,324
Don't do this to me, Eric.

508
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:05,786
Put your hands up and catch it.
You can do it.

509
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:08,787
Catch it.

510
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:14,875
Okay. You ready?

511
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:25,131
Maybe you should try it again later.

512
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,049
No. He can do it.

513
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,596
Throw that as hard as you can at my face.

514
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:41,182
-Milly--
-No, don't worry about it. He'll catch it.

515
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:57,734
Maybe l should leave the country,
change my name, or something.

516
00:49:57,817 --> 00:50:00,570
How could you do all this?
Now l'm in big trouble.

517
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:02,779
-What did you do?
-l signed Mom's name...

518
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:06,323
to all those notes from your teacher.
Now she's going to find out.

519
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:09,450
-You're right. You're in big trouble.
-Shut up.

520
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:19,331
Wonderful day, just wonderful.

521
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:32,589
Are you sure we have to give this to her?

522
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:34,423
That's probably her now.

523
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:39,551
Maybe she'll be in a good mood.

524
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:42,636
Eric, come on.

525
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:49,558
Hi, Mom.

526
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:53,810
-What's for dinner?
-Spaghetti.

527
00:50:54,186 --> 00:50:57,104
Good.
That's only the fourth time this week.

528
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:10,862
What did you do to your eye?

529
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,948
-Somebody threw a ball at me.
-Who threw a ball at you?

530
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:17,742
Nobody, Mom. lt was an accident.

531
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,660
lt's a black eye. lt will go away.

532
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,995
Be more careful.

533
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:27,164
You do stupid things,
you're going to get yourself hurt.

534
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:38,212
How was work?

535
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:41,631
They made me
executive assistant to Mr. Brandt.

536
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:44,133
Executive assistant. All right!

537
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,468
What does that mean, Mom?

538
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,595
lt means l'm a glorified secretary.

539
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:53,972
lt means l got demoted.

540
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:59,809
lt means, l couldn't figure out
how to work the computer.

541
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,192
-What's that?
-What?

542
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:17,444
Give me.

543
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:21,239
-He's in trouble.
-For what?

544
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:23,865
Disobeying his teacher,
not doing homework...

545
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,201
and not participating in class.

546
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:29,077
Why is this the first time
l've heard about this?

547
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:32,120
l didn't want to bother you with it.

548
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:38,249
Go to your room.

549
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,042
-Mom, l was framed.
-Go to your room!

550
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:43,503
Yes, ma'am.

551
00:52:50,632 --> 00:52:53,175
l thought you were
supposed to be helping me.

552
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:55,802
-l am helping you.
-You call this helping?

553
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:59,637
Yes, l call this helping.
l do everything for that little creep.

554
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:02,181
l walk him home.
l help him with his homework.

555
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,807
l cook, l clean up, l do the dishes.

556
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,850
What do you do?

557
00:53:09,268 --> 00:53:10,478
l work.

558
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,732
Go to your room.

559
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:21,646
Honey, come on outside.
The hot dogs are almost ready.

560
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
Come on.

561
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:25,857
Louis, help your dad out.

562
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:28,108
Come on. l need some help.

563
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:43,909
-Hi!
-Hi.

564
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:47,662
Come on out.

565
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:52,289
Hello there, sports fans.

566
00:55:06,465 --> 00:55:10,759
Hi. Welcome to the beautiful home
of Donald and Charlene Michaelson.

567
00:55:11,635 --> 00:55:14,720
A typical family
doing the typical family things.

568
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:18,597
A family barbecue,
our tradition since 1846.

569
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:22,850
Hi. l'm Donald Michaelson.
And l used to be like this.

570
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,269
Oh, l am going to....

571
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:18,551
-My knee's hurt!
-Oh my God, l'll help you.

572
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,638
lt's a miracle! He's alive!

573
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,227
Let's go. The class is all ahead of us.

574
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:39,230
Move it. Left, right, left, right. Walk.

575
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,607
...indigenous to the rainforest.

576
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,400
Okay, is that everybody?
We'll just hold it here for a second.

577
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:48,610
Here we have reached
a more temperate climate zone.

578
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:51,196
l don't know if you know what that means.

579
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:54,322
A temperate zone is one
where you have warm winters....

580
00:56:54,406 --> 00:56:56,699
Sorry, cool winters and warm summers.

581
00:56:56,949 --> 00:57:01,785
So the vegetation here is the vegetation
that flourishes under those conditions.

582
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,621
We've got lantana and fuchsia.

583
00:57:04,704 --> 00:57:07,455
All plants that do well
in a temperate zone.

584
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:11,208
From this angle, too,
you can see how high up the dome goes.

585
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,960
lts height is 70 feet in the center
at the highest point.

586
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:17,462
The actual area that it covers...

587
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,214
is 15,386 square feet.

588
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:25,174
The diameter is 140 feet across....

589
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:34,138
Mona, you're not going to go up there.

590
00:57:34,222 --> 00:57:36,724
You're going to fall, Mona.
You've got to get back.

591
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:38,891
Don't go up. Mona!

592
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,644
Oh, God, you freaked me out!

593
00:57:41,727 --> 00:57:44,145
You are so strange.

594
00:58:47,225 --> 00:58:49,768
lt's okay, Eric. Don't worry.

595
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:44,635
Amelia!

596
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,344
Amelia!

597
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:48,262
Here we go.

598
00:59:48,554 --> 00:59:50,305
She's coming around.

599
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,765
She's going to be fine.

600
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,017
No internal injuries.

601
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:58,643
She has a slight concussion.

602
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:00,854
l think she'll sleep it off.

603
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:12,230
How did you get in here, Eric?

604
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,112
You caught me, didn't you?

605
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:28,031
You can fly?

606
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:54,839
What?

607
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,178
You are going to show me?

608
01:06:04,075 --> 01:06:05,160
Eric!

609
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,578
Honey, what's the matter, sweetie?

610
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:12,831
l was flying with Eric...

611
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:17,000
l saw Dad, and Mona threw a ball at me,
and l fell.

612
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:19,877
-lt was just a dream.
-No!

613
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,671
l mean, yes, it was a dream.

614
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:26,005
But he caught me in real life.

615
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:28,716
What are you saying, sweetie?

616
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:31,384
He caught me.

617
01:06:34,218 --> 01:06:35,678
Eric can fly.

618
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:39,305
He can really fly.

619
01:06:44,392 --> 01:06:46,602
Mrs. Michaelson, Dr. Granada.

620
01:06:46,643 --> 01:06:49,520
Oh, yes. Am l glad you're here.
l'm really concerned.

621
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:50,938
l'm sure you are.

622
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,606
-l'll go in and see Amelia now.
-Okay.

623
01:06:54,106 --> 01:06:55,566
You stay here.

624
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,775
Thank you.

625
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:02,403
Dr. Reynolds, please report to Five West....

626
01:07:02,528 --> 01:07:03,737
Amelia?

627
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,031
l'm Dr. Granada.

628
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:10,074
May l come in?

629
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:11,867
Sure.

630
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:19,580
Dr. Nelson asked me
to come by and see you.

631
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:23,916
ls it okay if we talk a few minutes?

632
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,293
-Yeah.
-Good.

633
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:37,007
Tell me about your accident.

634
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,802
l was on a bridge, reaching for a flower,
and l fell over the railing.

635
01:07:42,886 --> 01:07:46,554
You told your mother something
about a boy who rescued you.

636
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:52,684
What are you, a shrink?

637
01:07:53,935 --> 01:07:56,686
-Yes.
-Great. Now l'm wacko.

638
01:07:58,604 --> 01:08:02,732
lt's important that you tell me
everything you remember about this.

639
01:08:03,524 --> 01:08:06,692
Let me be the judge
of whether you're wacko or not, okay?

640
01:08:12,905 --> 01:08:14,280
Yeah, okay.

641
01:08:17,449 --> 01:08:20,826
l fell 50 feet without a mark on me,
except for this.

642
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,828
And l got this when l hit the railing.

643
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:27,788
l didn't hit the ground.

644
01:08:28,372 --> 01:08:30,082
Somebody caught me.

645
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:33,459
lt was a boy named Eric.

646
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:36,210
He can fly.

647
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,256
l'm wacko, right?

648
01:08:45,132 --> 01:08:46,174
No.

649
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:49,551
But did you see him fly?

650
01:08:50,969 --> 01:08:52,012
No.

651
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,179
But you don't know Eric.

652
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:57,474
All he does is sit in his windowsill
and pretend to fly.

653
01:08:57,557 --> 01:08:59,474
His uncle says he's seen him do it...

654
01:08:59,558 --> 01:09:02,601
and l've seen really weird things
around the house.

655
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:05,687
He can.
What other explanation could there be?

656
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:09,105
You fell.

657
01:09:09,272 --> 01:09:12,649
You have a concussion.
You were losing consciousness.

658
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,318
Maybe what you thought
was Eric catching you...

659
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,194
was a tree or a bush breaking your fall.

660
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:22,030
Your mind could be playing tricks on you.
lt can do that.

661
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:24,115
That's impossible.

662
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:27,075
lt's more possible
than a boy who could fly.

663
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,876
Dr. Nelson told me about your father.

664
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:47,296
He committed suicide not long ago.

665
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,756
He did not.

666
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:56,385
How did he die?

667
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,476
My father had cancer.

668
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:18,398
And when he found out...

669
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:21,650
that he had it...

670
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:27,529
he didn't want the rest of the family
to suffer needlessly.

671
01:10:34,366 --> 01:10:35,825
So one day...

672
01:10:39,327 --> 01:10:41,329
he kissed us all good-bye.

673
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:48,666
He said that he loved us very much.

674
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:54,086
Then he went away.

675
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,383
lt's okay, Amelia.

676
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,176
Milly.

677
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:06,344
lt's okay, Milly.

678
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:11,597
You know, sometimes
we need to believe in a little magic.

679
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,766
Especially when there's so much pain.

680
01:11:17,226 --> 01:11:18,643
lt's normal.

681
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,436
And you're not wacko.

682
01:11:44,992 --> 01:11:46,702
Come on, come here.

683
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,287
Louis, get Max off her.

684
01:11:50,162 --> 01:11:52,664
-Glad you're back, Mil.
-l missed you, too.

685
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:54,748
Now you can do the dishes.

686
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:07,090
Come here.

687
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,383
Did you miss me?

688
01:12:12,092 --> 01:12:14,427
Did you miss me when l was gone?

689
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:16,428
l missed you.

690
01:12:19,263 --> 01:12:20,640
Silly bird.

691
01:12:21,806 --> 01:12:23,933
Hey, guys,
how about we go out for dinner?

692
01:12:24,016 --> 01:12:25,683
Sounds great, Mom.

693
01:13:16,506 --> 01:13:17,632
Eric.

694
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:22,302
Mr. Gibb.

695
01:13:43,314 --> 01:13:46,192
l'm sorry, Milly. Don't be angry.

696
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,401
l'm not angry.

697
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:54,488
lt's just that sometimes l see things.

698
01:13:55,947 --> 01:13:57,824
l've seen things, too.

699
01:13:58,866 --> 01:14:00,325
Where's Eric?

700
01:14:04,994 --> 01:14:06,329
He's gone.

701
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,497
Those people came over,
but l was drinking.

702
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,415
So they took him away.

703
01:14:12,082 --> 01:14:14,750
l guess l messed up things pretty good.

704
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,965
Mr. Gibb, what do you mean?

705
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,216
Mr. Gibb!

706
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:05,824
Nurse Corbett,
would you please report to Ward 6?

707
01:15:12,244 --> 01:15:15,038
Have Dr. Wilding call me
when he comes in.

708
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,082
-Excuse me.
-Just a second.

709
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:23,668
Yes?

710
01:15:24,252 --> 01:15:27,170
-We're here to see a patient.
-Name, please.

711
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,755
Gibb. Eric Gibb.

712
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:32,840
G-l-B-B.

713
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:11,071
Let me see that. Come over here.
Sit down here.

714
01:16:15,449 --> 01:16:17,200
Play with this, okay?

715
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,371
l'm sorry, Mrs. Michaelson.

716
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,207
Only relatives
are allowed to see this patient.

717
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:29,833
We're his only friends. We live next door.

718
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:33,086
l'm sorry.
Our rules are very clear on the matter.

719
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:36,045
-Listen, lady....
-Louis!

720
01:16:47,052 --> 01:16:50,429
l got to talk to him, Mom.
l want to see if he's okay.

721
01:16:50,513 --> 01:16:53,681
Don't worry. This isn't over yet.
We'll make some calls.

722
01:16:53,765 --> 01:16:56,349
Mom, is everyone in there like Eric...

723
01:16:56,432 --> 01:16:59,518
or are they all different kinds
of crazy people?

724
01:17:04,063 --> 01:17:07,857
What if we talk to Mrs. Sherman?
Maybe she'd know what to do.

725
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,399
We'll give her a call.

726
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,802
What do you think you're doing?

727
01:17:54,177 --> 01:17:56,178
Give me a hand here!

728
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,148
Watch his legs.

729
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,399
-Get the restraints.
-Right away.

730
01:19:19,437 --> 01:19:20,687
Sic, them!

731
01:19:23,398 --> 01:19:26,191
No, not me, you idiot!

732
01:19:28,985 --> 01:19:30,819
Soldier Boy! Get him!

733
01:19:36,656 --> 01:19:38,116
You're dead!

734
01:19:38,198 --> 01:19:39,908
Let's get him!

735
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:07,341
-What a wimp!
-Come on. We did it.

736
01:20:07,425 --> 01:20:09,759
Let's go. Let's get out of here!

737
01:20:40,237 --> 01:20:43,697
There you are.
What the hell were you doing over there?

738
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:49,117
Get over here, now!

739
01:20:50,951 --> 01:20:52,619
l said now!

740
01:20:57,789 --> 01:20:58,873
Max!

741
01:20:59,831 --> 01:21:00,874
No!

742
01:21:24,222 --> 01:21:26,681
Hey, kid. How're you doing?

743
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,906
Water's running
right through your graveyard.

744
01:21:53,948 --> 01:21:56,241
Going to wash all the men away.

745
01:21:56,366 --> 01:21:59,076
l don't need them anyhow. They're dead.

746
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:10,083
Thinking about Max?

747
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:12,709
That stupid dog. He was dumb.

748
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:14,252
Couldn't learn a thing.

749
01:22:14,336 --> 01:22:16,462
We should've got rid of him
a long time ago.

750
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:20,381
Louis, the vet said
he had a good chance to pull through.

751
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:22,382
You got to...

752
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:24,884
think positive.

753
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:28,845
How can you be a good soldier
if you don't think positive?

754
01:22:28,928 --> 01:22:32,055
l don't want to be a good soldier.
l'm no good at it.

755
01:22:32,138 --> 01:22:34,556
l can't even get around the block.

756
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,892
What should l think positive for?

757
01:22:38,975 --> 01:22:41,436
You fall on your head,
Eric's in the loony bin...

758
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:43,144
and Max is going to die.

759
01:22:43,228 --> 01:22:44,979
l give up. l quit.

760
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,481
Dad did.

761
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:49,899
He did not.

762
01:22:50,983 --> 01:22:53,026
He didn't even try, Milly.

763
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:55,361
Why didn't he try?

764
01:22:57,111 --> 01:22:58,071
Why?

765
01:23:03,115 --> 01:23:04,909
l don't know, Louis.

766
01:23:06,325 --> 01:23:08,119
Maybe he was scared.

767
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:11,829
But we can't give up.

768
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,581
We've got to try.

769
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,667
That junk doesn't work.

770
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:24,170
You should tell it to people
like your dumb old Eric.

771
01:23:24,253 --> 01:23:27,005
He doesn't even have the brains
to know he's messed up.

772
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:30,007
lt doesn't matter if he's out there
or at the funny farm.

773
01:23:30,049 --> 01:23:32,259
He just sits there and flies.

774
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,636
Maybe that's what l should do.

775
01:23:38,095 --> 01:23:42,097
-Louis, what are you doing?
-l'm going to be just like Eric.

776
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:45,100
-l'm gonna sit on the sill--
-Louis, stop it.

777
01:23:45,183 --> 01:23:48,268
No one's gonna stop me. l'll fly like Eric.

778
01:23:48,351 --> 01:23:50,603
-l said stop it!
-No!

779
01:23:50,686 --> 01:23:52,437
Louis, come on.

780
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,357
Go away!

781
01:24:01,318 --> 01:24:03,861
-What's going on?
-l don't know, Mom.

782
01:24:10,448 --> 01:24:12,241
He's over there, Mom.

783
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:26,042
No, l got to find them!
They're in here somewhere.

784
01:25:09,318 --> 01:25:11,236
l've got them. No problem.

785
01:25:16,114 --> 01:25:18,031
Okay, sweetie, let's go.

786
01:25:32,749 --> 01:25:35,292
Can l sleep with you tonight, Mommy?

787
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,211
Okay, honey.
Let's just get you dried off first.

788
01:25:38,294 --> 01:25:39,753
ln you go.

789
01:26:31,994 --> 01:26:33,118
Eric!

790
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:02,679
Eric?

791
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,650
We were having some problems
with my son.

792
01:29:40,067 --> 01:29:41,693
Our dog got hurt.

793
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:46,321
And he was very upset,
so l took him to my bedroom...

794
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:48,447
and he spent the night with me.

795
01:29:48,488 --> 01:29:50,740
And l was so involved with him...

796
01:29:50,824 --> 01:29:53,783
l just assumed that she was home.

797
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:56,952
But this morning,
her bed wasn't even slept in.

798
01:30:01,371 --> 01:30:04,332
She's a little smaller than l am.
She's about 5'2'' or 5'3''.

799
01:30:04,374 --> 01:30:07,750
She has blue eyes and sandy hair.
She's very pretty.

800
01:30:16,214 --> 01:30:18,673
-Yeah?
-Mr. Gibb?

801
01:30:20,049 --> 01:30:22,718
lt seems your nephew Eric is missing.

802
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:25,219
No. He ain't here.

803
01:30:25,845 --> 01:30:28,471
-Do you mind if we just look around?
-Eric, wake up.

804
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:30,765
We've got to get out of here. Come on.

805
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:32,348
Go right ahead.

806
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:33,683
Come on.

807
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,354
He's not in his room.

808
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:43,397
Told you.

809
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,565
-What's up there?
-Attic.

810
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:51,277
-Want to look?
-Yeah, why don't you check it out?

811
01:30:59,115 --> 01:31:00,282
Mister!

812
01:31:00,657 --> 01:31:03,659
Looking for Eric and Milly? There they go.

813
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,063
Pretty girl!

814
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:11,075
Catch.

815
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:13,202
Okay, you get three. Okay?

816
01:32:13,369 --> 01:32:16,287
Excuse me, Miss D?
Do you know where Mrs. Sherman is?

817
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,831
She was in the teachers' lounge,
last l saw her.

818
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:20,831
-Thanks a lot.
-Yeah, okay.

819
01:32:20,873 --> 01:32:21,999
Eric.

820
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,750
Not bad.

821
01:32:46,264 --> 01:32:50,267
And then the next thing we knew,
he was gone. l don't know where.

822
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,435
Eric, Milly, come back!

823
01:33:27,206 --> 01:33:29,707
Hey, you kids, hold it right there.

824
01:34:00,934 --> 01:34:02,394
Hold it. Wait.

825
01:34:03,811 --> 01:34:05,729
lt's okay, little girl.

826
01:34:11,608 --> 01:34:12,734
Eric?

827
01:34:15,444 --> 01:34:18,028
Milly! Dan, over here.

828
01:34:27,325 --> 01:34:29,077
Milly.

829
01:34:36,623 --> 01:34:38,624
Can you really fly, Eric?

830
01:34:50,214 --> 01:34:51,382
Milly!

831
01:34:58,094 --> 01:34:59,178
No!

832
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:11,311
You did it!

833
01:35:26,028 --> 01:35:27,529
Look up there!

834
01:35:28,697 --> 01:35:29,488
One....

835
01:35:37,994 --> 01:35:39,745
Get out of the way!

836
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:55,380
Hey, Gibb!

837
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:21,437
Milly!

838
01:36:22,438 --> 01:36:23,481
Mom!

839
01:36:33,319 --> 01:36:35,404
-What is it? Explain it.
-Look!

840
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:36,572
Hi, Geneva!

841
01:36:36,655 --> 01:36:39,031
They're flying! This is great!
Go tell your mom!

842
01:36:39,073 --> 01:36:41,366
Oh, my God! You look great!
This is fantastic!

843
01:36:41,408 --> 01:36:44,118
l don't believe it. You look fantastic!

844
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:48,912
Uncle Hugo, my sister can fly!

845
01:36:49,872 --> 01:36:51,580
That's good, Louis.

846
01:36:53,415 --> 01:36:55,000
See, l told you.

847
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:24,934
Mom!

848
01:37:25,685 --> 01:37:27,060
Hi, Geneva.

849
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:28,603
Hey, Lou.

850
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:56,204
Eric?

851
01:38:06,043 --> 01:38:07,210
Good...

852
01:38:09,712 --> 01:38:10,879
bye...

853
01:38:13,214 --> 01:38:14,381
Milly.

854
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:22,052
l...

855
01:38:25,262 --> 01:38:26,430
love...

856
01:38:29,391 --> 01:38:30,432
you.

857
01:39:00,326 --> 01:39:01,451
Eric?

858
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:16,919
That night l found out why Eric flew away.

859
01:39:20,546 --> 01:39:23,923
Our house was crawling with people
who wanted to see Eric Gibb...

860
01:39:23,965 --> 01:39:25,842
the boy who could fly.

861
01:39:26,384 --> 01:39:29,760
There were scientists and doctors
and TV reporters.

862
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:32,596
Full color T-shirts of Eric Gibb,
the flying boy.

863
01:39:32,638 --> 01:39:35,222
When they couldn't find Eric,
they did tests on me...

864
01:39:35,306 --> 01:39:37,266
because l flew with him.

865
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:41,310
They did tests on Uncle Hugo, too...

866
01:39:41,393 --> 01:39:44,645
because he was a relative
and had the same genes.

867
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:48,939
Then they took everything out of his room
and sent it to some laboratory.

868
01:39:49,023 --> 01:39:51,774
l guess Eric was afraid
they'd do the same to him.

869
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:55,985
The children,
in an adolescent sexual frenzy...

870
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,695
somehow mesmerized the crowd....

871
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:02,030
Everyone had a theory
on how Eric was able to fly.

872
01:40:02,072 --> 01:40:04,282
But there was one l liked the best.

873
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:09,201
Eric always dreamed of flying,
so maybe if you wish hard enough...

874
01:40:09,743 --> 01:40:12,746
and love long enough, anything's possible.

875
01:40:13,871 --> 01:40:15,747
Mrs. Sherman was right.

876
01:40:15,872 --> 01:40:19,875
Eric made us believe
that anything is possible if you really try.

877
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:24,919
Uncle Hugo stopped drinking.
He even went out and got a job.

878
01:40:25,462 --> 01:40:28,505
Max got better.
He was weak and sore and broken up.

879
01:40:28,588 --> 01:40:30,715
But he was going to be okay.

880
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:35,593
Mom locked herself in a room for a day
and figured out that computer.

881
01:40:36,009 --> 01:40:39,262
And then there was Louis.
There was no stopping him.

882
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:48,851
You stay here, Max. l got to do this alone.

883
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:16,034
-Sonny, it's Michaelson!
-Get him!

884
01:41:16,535 --> 01:41:18,452
-All right!
-We got him!

885
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:04,272
So you thought
you could get around the block?

886
01:42:04,689 --> 01:42:06,815
Go ahead. Make my day.

887
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:10,859
l'm supposed to be real scared
of a water pistol?

888
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,986
Ain't no water in this gun.

889
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:14,820
So what's in it?

890
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:17,864
Piss.

891
01:42:18,823 --> 01:42:20,073
Shit!

892
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:24,034
Hitler! Sic him!

893
01:42:58,889 --> 01:43:00,472
Way to go, Max!

894
01:43:01,932 --> 01:43:03,266
All right!

895
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:17,984
Mom, Milly! We did it!

896
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,992
lt's been a while since we flew,
and Eric hasn't come back.

897
01:43:32,033 --> 01:43:35,119
But somehow he's still
a big part of our lives.

898
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:38,496
He made us believe in ourselves again.

899
01:43:40,206 --> 01:43:43,207
Now when l feel like giving up,
not trying...

900
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:47,877
all l have to do is think about him
and what he taught me.

901
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:51,713
l was telling Geneva just the other day...

902
01:43:51,838 --> 01:43:53,506
we're all special.

903
01:43:54,131 --> 01:43:56,340
We're all a little like Eric.

904
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,635
Maybe we can't soar up into the clouds...

905
01:44:01,052 --> 01:44:02,636
but somewhere...

906
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,220
deep inside...

907
01:44:05,596 --> 01:44:07,139
we can all fly.

908
01:46:55,055 --> 01:47:00,070
