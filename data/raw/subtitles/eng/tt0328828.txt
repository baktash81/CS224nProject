1
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,824
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

2
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,875
You know,
living at my parents' house,

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,003
th-that's, um...
that's a temporary thing.

4
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,840
Uh, we've been going out
for, what, three years.

5
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,551
You're not, like, getting bored
with things, are you?

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:56,097
Michelle, l... I'm gonna ask you something
that I've never asked you before.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,434
Is it kinky?
I don't think so. No.

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:04,481
You don't have to be embarrassed if you want
to add more spiciness to our relationship.

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,901
Actually, um,

10
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,779
maybe you could just, uh,
you know,

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,822
use your napkin.

12
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,785
My napkin?
Mr. Levenstein.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,328
Yes.
You have a phone call.

14
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,122
Excuse me.
Thank you.

15
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,918
- Hello. - Jim, it's Dad.
Uh, you left the ring at home.

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,920
The box is empty.
But-But I'm on my way,

17
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,089
and I've got the...

18
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,758
I've got the ring, so
don't panic, son. Okay?

19
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,718
Bye-bye.

20
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,471
Who was that?

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,307
Uh, that was my dad.

22
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,352
That was, uh, my dad. That was, uh...
He couldn't get through on...

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,479
I didn't answer my cell.
So he was, uh,

24
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,564
getting all, uh...
was getting all worried.

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,651
You know how he is. But everything is,
uh... everything is okay now.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,820
Everything is, uh...
Everything is perfectly fine.

27
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,489
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me.

28
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,869
And it's okay.
L... I don't have to use my napkin.

29
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,872
- Wha...
- I've got my own techniques.

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
Michelle, where... where are you going?

31
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,840
Michelle? Hey. Hey.

32
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,883
Okay.

33
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,094
Okay, Michelle. Michelle.

34
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,348
Okay. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Michelle.

35
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,726
Psst!

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,520
Michelle, I think you need to stop.
Okay, keep going.

37
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh, my God.
Michelle. Michelle.

38
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,112
Michelle! Oh, my God.

39
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,532
Oh, my God. Okay.

40
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,201
Well, I made it. Where's Michelle?
The washroom?

41
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,039
You know, I was so nervous she was
gonna spot me. Here's the ring, son.

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,416
Ohh.
Let me tell you something.

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,252
This is some ring.
Look at the rock on this baby.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,297
Mr. Big Spender. Hope you didn't
blow your wad on this, son.

45
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,883
Not yet.
Your mother and I...

46
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,552
could not be more
thrilled for you, Jim.

47
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,389
I mean, we're so happy. And I know
you're excited. I can see it in your face.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,392
- I mean, you look like you're ready to burst.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,479
I mean, your cheeks, they're flush.
I wish your mother could be here.

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,023
Not me. That's what I wish.
You know, this is...

51
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,859
this is one of those moments, Jim,

52
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,236
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

53
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,572
- Yes, it is.
- You bet it is.

54
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,908
You bet it is.

55
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,244
I cannot believe my son
is gonna pop the question.

56
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,372
- What was that?

57
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,457
Th-That?

58
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,751
That? Knockin' on wood.

59
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,338
And what is this, uh, popping...
popping what? What question?

60
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,757
You are...
Oh, you're a wreck. What...

61
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,926
You need some air.
You need some air.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,095
- Walk me to my car.
- No, I'm not walking you...

63
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,014
- Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

64
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,100
Oh!

65
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,894
Your penis!

66
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,024
Watch your penis.
I got it.

67
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,110
Your pants.
I got the pants!

68
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,153
I got the pants!
Please!

69
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,364
Everybody, please.
Everybody just calm down here.

70
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,741
Everybody, just quiet!
Lower your voice.

71
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,705
It's disgusting!

72
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,627
Now,

73
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,463
I came here to do something...

74
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,299
And, damn it, I'm...
I'm gonna do it.

75
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,974
Michelle.

76
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,563
Hello, dear.

77
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,026
Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

78
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,528
I love you...

79
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,990
more than I could...

80
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,784
ever explain at this particular moment.

81
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,499
Dad. The ring.

82
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,045
Oh.

83
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,343
Will you marry me?
Yes.

84
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,689
My son.

85
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,161
I'm the happiest man in the world.

86
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,210
We should all be so happy.

87
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,578
Cheers, gentlemen, sweetheart.

88
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,582
I'm impressed.

89
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,377
Marriage is a binding,

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,547
unifying, eternal,

91
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,925
never-ending, permanent...

92
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,886
chaining together
of two people.

93
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,724
Jim, have you thought this through?

94
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,143
Yes. Yes, Finch.
Thank you.

95
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,770
I had actually been trying to figure it
out for a while.

96
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,606
You know, when is the right time?
Is there a right time?

97
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,194
And finally I realized, duh, you love
the girl, marry her.

98
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,989
Aw.

99
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,575
Oh! Let's dance.
Dance?

100
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,453
No.
No, you have to learn sometime.

101
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,372
Come on!

102
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:59,294
Don't laugh at me.

103
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,089
Okay, okay.

104
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm just glad that's not me.

105
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,680
Finch, you don't think there's one girl you're
destined to spend your entire life with?

106
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,933
They're all for me, Kevin.

107
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,645
Not, uh... Not so bad, huh?
All right.

108
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,440
Do this.

109
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,442
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,070
Well, the wedding should be
rather entertaining.

111
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,210
Bro, that's it?

112
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,337
There's no keg anywhere.

113
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,216
Jim.
Hey, John.

114
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,510
The food and the drink
are really bad.

115
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,512
"F" for presentation.

116
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,390
The good news for you...
What's that?

117
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,934
We're gonna be
ushers at the wedding.

118
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,689
This is amazing.

119
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,441
I don't recognize half the people in
this place.

120
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,485
At least they all brought gifts.

121
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,196
Hello.
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

122
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,573
Oh, hello.
Harold Flaherty.

123
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,493
Please, please come in.
Lovely to meet you.

124
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,246
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

125
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,708
- Delightful.
- Who's excited about the wedding?

126
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,085
Anxious might be more accurate.

127
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,087
Oh, w-w-we've never met your son.

128
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,089
You'll get to meet him.

129
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,133
Rudy and Sam would like to meet him too.
Oh, yes.

130
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,427
Better bring them in from the car.
They've been cooped up.

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,470
Oh, for heaven sakes.
You brought your sons?

132
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,806
Our dogs.
We never travel without them.

133
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh, my goodness.
Well, honey,

134
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,812
why don't you go get those critters out of
the car and we'll start on some cocktails?

135
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,983
Ah, thank you.
Right. I'll, uh, get the dogs.

136
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,111
There's one thing that'll
make this wedding perfect.

137
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,155
No Stifler.

138
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,699
Well, that's one dick
we are not inviting.

139
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,410
- Motion seconded.
- Motion carried.

140
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,081
So, Finch, what are you gonna do
with that fancy NYU diploma?

141
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll frame it.
Then I'll write my memoirs.

142
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,672
Well, you should come to law school, man.
You know I could use the company.

143
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,967
Kids, Michelle's parents are here.
Come on. We're waiting.

144
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,677
Oh, crumbs on the shirt.
That's bad. Okay. That's fine.

145
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,181
I'll change. I'll change.

146
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,185
Fuckers.

147
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,573
Well, polish my nuts and
serve me a milk shake.

148
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,790
What's up?

149
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,336
That's right.

150
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,635
Oh, cake, huh?
Hope it's good.

151
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,016
Oh, gee. Thanks for inviting me
to the graduation party, fucker.

152
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,733
Oh. Fuckin' right, doggy!
That's good cake!

153
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,318
Holy shit!

154
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,778
Hi. How are you?
Congratulations.

155
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,153
Hey.

156
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,327
Congratulation, jism.

157
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,454
Excuse me. Stifler.

158
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,415
Hey, Jim.
Stifler.

159
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,750
- What are you doing here?
- Happy fuck day, ass mouth.

160
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,003
Put the cake down.
Check it out. I made it myself.

161
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,673
That's very cute. What happened to my
invite? Got lost in the mail, fuckface?

162
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,092
I don't want to discuss this. Quiet!
Oh, quiet yourself.

163
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,221
I think I can spell...
Seriously, man. Seriously...

164
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,432
Jesus! Damn it, Stifler.

165
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,767
Jim, look what you did.
Look what I did?

166
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,520
Look at this shit.
What am I supposed to do now?

167
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,398
Are you happy now, man?
Why are you here?

168
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,443
My dick looks like a corn dog.
I got cake all over my balls.

169
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,112
Jim, honey.
Shit.

170
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,115
The Flahertys are waiting.
You think he's upstairs, honey?

171
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,035
Oh, you're fucked now, Jim.

172
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,125
Stifler, get up.

173
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,170
This dog's great!
Is it weird that it feels good?

174
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,590
All right.

175
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,343
What about the dining room?
I know you'll just love him.

176
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,387
- Jesus, Stifler.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

177
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,890
Stop enjoying it so much.
- Lick it off!

178
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,225
Whoo-hoo-hoo.!

179
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,895
Son of a... You little shit.

180
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,856
- You gotta take your pants off, man.

181
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,487
- Jim.
- No, it's not what it looks like.

182
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,239
- What are you doing, son? Jim.
- My dogs!

183
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,576
Don't go in there. Lord knows what
they'll do to you. I love this dog!

184
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,579
- I-I-I was just trying to get him off, Dad.
- That is your son?

185
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,581
Back away from the animal.

186
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,250
Hey, great party.
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Flaherty, I presume.

187
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,836
Hey, where are you going?

188
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,589
Well, uh, lunch is, uh, served.

189
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,510
L-I really hope that, uh...
that-that we can just...

190
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,596
that we can all just forget about
this and-and-and move on...

191
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,432
and start again...
start again fresh.

192
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,978
Jim, if you hope to be the provider and
protector for our firstborn daughter,

193
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,980
you have a long way to go.

194
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,941
Thank you, sir.

195
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,276
They think you're an angel...

196
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,780
and-and I'm...
I'm just some ungrateful dog-rapist.

197
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,409
They just think they raised
a proper, little band girl.

198
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:27,747
And-And besides, sometimes it's...
it's nice to be a little more traditional.

199
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,751
How so? How-How do you mean traditional?
I'm thinking about the wedding.

200
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,672
Well, it's just this one day.

201
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,342
One day where-where everyone's
eyes are on me for a change.

202
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,928
I've just never walked into a room
and...

203
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,056
and had everyone go,
"Ooh," and, "Ahh,"

204
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,684
and, "Isn't she elegant?"

205
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,646
That is exactly how our wedding is
going to be.

206
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,606
I promise.

207
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,696
Shit, I've got a frosted ass crack.
Hey, Finch,

208
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,907
you want this for here
or to go?

209
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,077
"A witty saying proves nothing."
Voltaire.

210
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,289
"Suck my dick."
Ron Jeremy.

211
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,376
Oh, boys.
Anybody seen the bride's parents?

212
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,961
No? Hmm.

213
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,172
Wait a second.

214
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,007
Wait a second.
Come on, Stifler.

215
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,009
This isn't a graduation party.
Time to go.

216
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,679
Wait. Hold on.
Jim's getting married, isn't he?

217
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,057
Holy fuckin' shit!
This is major!

218
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,603
Do you have the slightest idea of how important
this is? We get to have a bachelor party.

219
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,773
Yes! We celebrate the death of Jim
with a party in his honor.

220
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,067
Chicks and boobs.
Tits and ass.

221
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,487
Titties, ta-tas, casabas, bazoongas
all up in our friggin' faces!

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,031
Buck up, fellas.
Show some enthusiasm.

223
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:47,035
It's gonna be fuckin' great.
Oh, my God!

224
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,997
Finch, he-he does make
a good point.

225
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,083
Yeah, he does.

226
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,546
You never heard me say that.

227
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,549
I do not deserve
a girl this cool.

228
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,010
Michelle said the wedding
was doable, right?

229
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,221
A wedding.
A wedding, yeah.

230
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,891
You know, I promised her her wedding...
you know, the wedding of her dreams.

231
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,685
Okay.
What's the problem?

232
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,104
Dancing. Uh, she wants...
she's gonna want to dance.

233
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,190
You know, there's that whole tradition:
The first dance at the reception.

234
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,901
She's gonna wanna dance
Fred Astaire kind of shit.

235
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,237
I can't do that. I can't... She learned
all that from band camp.

236
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,157
Okay, so you take lessons,
you know, right away.

237
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,662
Lessons. Okay. I have to convince her
parents that I'm not a shithead.

238
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,081
Challenging.
Indeed, challenging.

239
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,250
But doable.
What else?

240
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,252
What else?
I don't know what else.

241
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
That's the thing.
She cares too much to tell me.

242
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,507
She doesn't want me to worry
that she might be worried.

243
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,509
So I'm worried.

244
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,885
Recon.

245
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,016
You mean, like-like spying on, uh...
like spying on Michelle?

246
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,476
Spying is deceitful.

247
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,231
Extra attention
means you're concerned.

248
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,777
This is... This is true. This is good.
Guys, here's to the next step.

249
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,780
Would you please shut up with that
stepping? Put your glass down.

250
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,106
We'll find a wonderful place somewhere.
I promise. We'll keep looking.

251
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,238
Is everything okay in here?
The study can get a little chilly.

252
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,491
Do you have enough blankets?
We're fine. Thank you.

253
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,327
L-I was kind of hoping that, uh...

254
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,164
that someday soon
we could have a little talk.

255
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,126
I'd really like to tell you why I think I'll
make a good husband.

256
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,337
Whenever you get a chance.

257
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,590
- Oh, why is that?
Come on.

258
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,846
See, I was saying that soon...
we could talk.

259
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,393
This... This right now is-is sort of
the preliminary talk...

260
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,938
before the future... longer talk,

261
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,693
which would be like a...
a quiet, uh, private dinner talk.

262
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,195
Let him finish.

263
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,157
I'm talking to you.

264
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,160
Shh.
- Okay.

265
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,790
Good talking to you.

266
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,297
No. No, these aren't
gonna work.

267
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,551
Wow.

268
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:54,055
You guys in a sporting goods store.
Very good.

269
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,308
Hey, Finch,
I think they got your size.

270
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,310
Aw, beautiful.

271
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,563
Jim needs to learn
to dance for his wedding.

272
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,149
You know, I think he's screwed.

273
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,068
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

274
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,070
I can't wait to see this disaster.

275
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,906
What makes you think
you're invited?

276
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,708
I already called up Jim's mom,
got the info.

277
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,710
I'm preparing
for the festivities.

278
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,922
It's time for me to boom-boom with
the bridesmaids, Finch-fucker.

279
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,925
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

280
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,680
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

281
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,225
Ooh, yep, that's
what I'm talking about.

282
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,603
All right, Stifler. Um,

283
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,105
this-this is a little, uh,
difficult to explain.

284
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,025
Look, you're... you're okay.

285
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,944
You're okay.
L-l-I mean, uh... I mean, I like you.

286
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,947
Yeah, great.
You can blow me after practice.

287
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,116
I'm working, dude.
Well, dude...

288
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,953
- Come on. Work it! Hustle!

289
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,415
See, my mom didn't know that there
was a misunderstanding. Push it! Move it!

290
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,085
- You're not invited!
- Hold!

291
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,299
Dude, how the hell do you even
think you're getting married?

292
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,803
I've been looking out for your sex
life since high school. You what?

293
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,681
Ohhhh! Ohh!

294
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,102
The first tits
this guy ever saw...

295
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,978
were because of me.

296
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,606
The first girl he ever hooked up with...

297
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,192
was at my party at my cottage.

298
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,778
That girl is the girl he's marrying.

299
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,489
The Stif-man showed him the way.

300
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,951
- Can I get a "Hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah, Stifler!

301
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,161
But, my fuckers,

302
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,289
this mofo right here does not want
the Stif-meister,

303
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,917
the grand, fucking facilitator
to attend the wedding.

304
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,337
Who sucks donkey dick?
Jim sucks donkey dick!

305
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,632
Jim sucks donkey dick!
The answer's no. Okay? I'm sorry.

306
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,634
The answer's no.
I can dance.

307
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,679
What?
I can dance.

308
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,682
Jim sucks donkey dick!
Jim sucks donkey dick!

309
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,393
Five, six, seven, eight.

310
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,149
Okay. Now-Now what
exactly is this here?

311
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,318
Left box turn.
Left box turn.

312
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,405
Hi. Stop looking into
my eyes. Sorry. Sorry.

313
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,490
How do you...
How do you know how to do this?

314
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,993
My mom made me take it for three fucking years.
Yeah?

315
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah, I hated it.
No, you're really good.

316
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,206
Uh, you should take ballet
or something.

317
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,127
Fuckface! What part of "This sucks my ass"
do you not under-fuckin'-stand?

318
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,714
This is exactly what I'm talking about,
Steven. You can't behave like this.

319
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,176
L-l-lf you want to come to the wedding,
I'm sorry, you cannot act like this.

320
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,178
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

321
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,680
Impolite would be
an improvement. Look,

322
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,142
just... just try not to be,
uh, you know, uh,

323
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,227
you.

324
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,898
Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

325
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,108
Hey, wait, Stifler.
Stifler, hold on.

326
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,403
Wait. Okay. Wh-What if, uh... What if you,
uh, plan the bachelor party?

327
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,907
With a dildo show?
Sure.

328
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,910
Look. Just... If you can find the time,
uh, to fit it in,

329
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,787
go ahead, surprise me.

330
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,997
Sorry, chief. That only
gets you halfway there.

331
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,457
Why? Why ha...
What do you mean?

332
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,627
I need assurances that I'm gonna get
some quality action at this wedding.

333
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,629
I'm sor... I can't...
I can't make that promise.

334
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,256
Well, let me put it to you
this way, Jimbo.

335
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:19,427
No pussy, no dancing. Okay?

336
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,849
No pussy, no dancing.
How's that for polite?

337
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,232
Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

338
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,776
Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

339
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,905
The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

340
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,157
Now, if we leave right now,

341
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,034
we can get there by the time they close...
a three-hour drive.

342
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,579
A three-hour drive?
Kick fuckin'ass.

343
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,124
Are we going to Chicago
to see titties?

344
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,544
We are talking about getting Michelle
a dress in Chicago.

345
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,671
Now, please, vanish.

346
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,090
Hey, Finch, what's the capital
of Thailand?

347
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,092
Bangkok!

348
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,887
Dude...
Hey, I got shotgun.

349
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,271
Let's get this dress shit over with.

350
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,024
The strip bar has got
free hot wings before 7:00.

351
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,569
Now, Jim, let me handle this.

352
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,863
These are my people.
They're gay?

353
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,533
No, you bleeding imbecile.
They have style. They're cultured.

354
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,870
- They're sophisticated.
- So they're gay.

355
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,873
So, mademoiselle,
I'm sure that you can appreciate...

356
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,668
that monsieur here is stuck right between
Scylla and Charybdis.

357
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,713
Yes, I'm afraid he's no Ulysses.

358
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,467
- Okay, what's happening here?
- You need to speak to my dressmaker.

359
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:44,888
That's who would actually make the dress.
And I'm afraid Leslie has gone for the day.

360
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,318
All right. She-She said she'd probably be
at one of these bars here on Halstead.

361
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,112
I say we split up and ask around
for a Leslie Summers.

362
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,114
Right.

363
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,715
Hey there, sweet little thing.

364
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,760
Hey there, you sweet manly thing.

365
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,304
You know, I really love your shirt.
Do I know you?

366
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,307
I'm Jennifer.
Well, Jennifer,

367
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,018
just relax, take it slow...

368
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,020
and let the good times roll.

369
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,981
'Cause Daddy's a regular here.
Do you want to get a drink?

370
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,359
You're goddamn right I do.
Whoo-hoo!

371
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,488
Whoo. Two cold ones.

372
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:47,117
Hey, you know, my friend would really
dig your vibe. Will you wait here?

373
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,494
Sure thing, babe.
Good.

374
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,496
All right.

375
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,540
How you feeling, sexy?
Pretty good.

376
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,834
Whoa. You have a deep voice.

377
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,378
That's not all.

378
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,380
Oh, right.

379
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,133
You look really cute tonight.
Thanks.

380
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:06,136
I guess. What the...

381
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,807
Oh, hey.
Gettin' a little frisky.

382
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,476
Oh. Game over.

383
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,895
What's happening here?

384
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,358
Hey. Any luck?

385
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,319
- Not so much.
- All right. Let's, uh...

386
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,950
This is Bear.

387
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,536
Hey.
Wow. You are a bear.

388
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,666
- Yeah.

389
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,710
How much you bench?

390
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,338
- How much you weigh?
- Why?

391
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,548
You wanna try
and pick me up?

392
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,842
Yeah, I think I could.

393
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,261
Yeah, I bet you could.
You are big.

394
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,597
I could use
a guy like you on my team.

395
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:55,518
Are you... Are you talking about
our team or an actual team?

396
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,021
What the hell is "our team"?

397
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,023
Hi. Where's the girl?

398
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,025
What the fuck
are we talking about?

399
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,861
You need to take
another look around.

400
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,912
- Hey, honey.! - Oh, my God.
What the fuck is going on?

401
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,542
- Come on.
Is that all you got?

402
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,587
Pussy!

403
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,215
I, uh... I must have came
to the wrong place. Stifler.

404
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,425
Stifler.
Oh, man.

405
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,594
Hey.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

406
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,097
L... How did you get up the nerve
to check out a gay bar?

407
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,058
Yeah. Really don't wanna talk about it
right now. I just wanna go home.

408
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,227
- Your friend here was just leaving.
- Eat shit.

409
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,979
Did you find Leslie?
Fuck your stupid dressmaker, man.

410
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:43,566
- You guys know Leslie Summers?
- Uh, we're trying to find her.

411
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,363
You know what? I think you guys are
out of luck. Why don't you go home?

412
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,782
No. Y-You know Leslie... He knows Leslie S...
Okay, look.

413
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,660
My friends and I just drove
all the way from Michigan...

414
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,454
to find my fiancée the wedding dress
that she deserves.

415
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,166
Now, we need Leslie to make it for us.
Can-Can you please help us find her?

416
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,753
I'm sure Leslie always helps
associates of assholes.

417
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,174
What are you looking at?
I'm not a steak.

418
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,095
Listen, breeder, not every gay man
wants to have sex with you.

419
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,015
Oh, yeah?
Listen up, ass jockey.

420
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,517
If I were gay, you'd want me.
Really.

421
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,978
Really. I got style.

422
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,814
I'm cultured.
I'm sophisticated.

423
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:27,152
And all that just radiates
from your oh, so sexy self.

424
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,154
That's bullshit.

425
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,281
Everyone wants a piece of the
Stif-meister.

426
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,579
Right! Yeah!

427
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,832
Without a doubt!

428
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,876
- I'll show you fuckers.
- Bye.

429
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,836
Everybody say, "Bye. '"Bye.

430
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,464
Bye.

431
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,675
Bye.
Good luck with the dress.

432
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,597
Give us a drink.

433
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,630
Mother of God.

434
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,565
Bitch!

435
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,535
Whoo-hoo.!

436
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,204
What is this, a dance-off?

437
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,375
Oh, yeah?

438
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,331
Go, big boy.!

439
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,717
I love you!

440
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:39,761
What?

441
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,430
Fabulous. Seeing that
was worth anything.

442
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,475
Look, I'm Leslie Summers,
and you've got yourself a dress.

443
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,312
Thank you. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

444
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,856
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

445
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,652
Yeah, no problem.
Hey, who's your friend? Uh, K-Kevin.

446
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,992
Was that the best night
ever or what? Stifler,

447
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,286
are you... are you kidding me?
It was amazing.

448
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,373
Hey, guys!
Hey, hey.

449
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:12,502
Hey, when you get your bachelor party
together, I manage some girls in town.

450
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,588
Real ones.
All right.

451
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,759
Call me. Damn, Stiffy,
you got some moves.

452
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:31,021
Told you that guy
wanted to fuck me.

453
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:34,315
I can't believe this. They're really
gonna make the dress for me?

454
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,278
They are expecting your call.
Go ahead. This is so cool. Oh.

455
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,488
I love you.

456
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,574
Thank you.

457
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,997
Well, that worked out.

458
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,500
Well, maybe it's time we have
that special dinner chat.

459
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:54,627
I'll have turkey.

460
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,967
Thanks for helping out.

461
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,762
We're so close, and there's still so
much to do.

462
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,891
Cadence!

463
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,614
Hey.
Hi.

464
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,451
Cadence, this is Paul Finch. Finch,
meet my younger sister, Cadence.

465
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,245
Nice to meet you.
You're reading Descartes.

466
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,247
Yep.

467
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,501
Cogito ergo sum.
"I think, therefore I am."

468
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,796
Hungry.

469
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,799
Hungry.

470
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,093
So, when's Mark getting in?

471
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:46,638
Uh, let's see,
that would be never.

472
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,557
Did you guys break up?
How tragic.

473
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,851
Uh, sorry, Paul Finch.
Girl stuff.

474
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:03,154
Just stay calm. I'm available,
she's available. It's all good.

475
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,409
She's a beautiful girl,
and you're you.

476
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,329
I dumped him.

477
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:15,291
But it was Mark. I thought
you really liked him. He was nice.

478
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:20,171
Yeah, but sometimes nice isn't so nice.

479
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,298
W-Wait. Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

480
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,802
He didn't want to do it. He said he
didn't want to ruin what we had...

481
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,804
by deflowering ourselves.

482
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,806
Who the hell uses
the word deflower?

483
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,228
That's like something Mom would say.
Yeah.

484
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,523
And I'm starting to realize that Mom and
Dad's idea of appropriate behaviour...

485
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,567
might be a little bit different than mine.

486
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,820
Mitch, you're in love.
Shh.

487
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,031
You're getting married.
I mean, what's this like?

488
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,701
It's like it's...
I'm never gonna be able to explain it.

489
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:54,330
I wanted us to write our own vows for
the wedding, and now I can't do mine.

490
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,750
L... How do you explain love?

491
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,753
Uh, l-I guess
I wouldn't know.

492
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:03,048
I don't think I've ever
felt that way about a guy.

493
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,134
Oh, someday you will.
Maybe.

494
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,888
But in the meantime, I don't think it would
hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend.

495
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,223
Jim's got single friends,
right? Yes.

496
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:15,769
- Think Finch is a possibility?
- Oh, Finch is boneable.

497
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:18,605
Yes, he is boneable.

498
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:26,112
Dickhead. You do not send shit
to my office at school.

499
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,782
Hey, Stifler. Why don't you come in
and make yourself comfortable?

500
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,910
Your letter made a great impression on
Coach Marshall when he read it.

501
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,287
Let me just refresh your memory,
partner. "Dear Steve,

502
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:38,249
I will be forever in your debt if you teach
me to dance like you did in the gay bar."

503
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,251
I put serious thought
into that letter.

504
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:44,214
"Don't push me 'cause I'm
close to the edge.

505
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:47,759
I'm trying not to
lose my head." Uh-huh.

506
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,803
Uh-huh.

507
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,391
These are really nice. I mean,
for a bridesmaid dress.

508
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,935
- At least something you can actually
wear again. - Wear again.

509
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,313
But you don't think
it's too sexy, do you?

510
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:04,150
I mean, I don't want to seem slutty or anything.
I'm trying to attract a decent guy here.

511
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:08,071
It's a wedding.
They'll all be decent guys.

512
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,116
I just don't feel quite like a virgin in it.

513
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,118
Oh!

514
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,998
So, you guys have to be psyched
to be done with college.

515
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:22,460
I mean, I swear, I'm running out of
room in my brain for everything.

516
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:25,130
There's always room for
Plato and Aristotle.

517
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,258
Some of my favourites.

518
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,428
Excuse me, guys.

519
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,514
Finch,
she thinks you were being sarcastic.

520
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:38,309
Okay. It's so good to see you.

521
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:41,312
You want some help? Here. Let me...
Let me help you out there.

522
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,941
There you go. Okay.
You keep fighting the good fight, sir.

523
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,070
It's great.

524
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,114
That was really sweet of you.

525
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,284
Yeah. I love old people.

526
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,080
Hey, I hate to be nosy
and impolite, but, um,

527
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:02,042
do you know Jim Levenstein and
Michelle Flaherty? Yeah.

528
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,627
Are they here?
Well, I'm Cadence, Michelle's sister.

529
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,797
I had no idea.
I'm their good friend Steven.

530
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,342
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

531
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:13,178
Well, they're around town doing
some wedding stuff. That's cool.

532
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:16,514
But there's still a few of us in the
other room if you want to join us.

533
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,353
I don't know. I mean, you look so nice,
I feel underdressed.

534
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,648
Well, I think you look great.
Thank you.

535
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:29,235
Oh, here they are.
Hi, boys. Don't stand up.

536
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,239
- The dads aren't here yet?
- I'll go find him.

537
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:35,867
Now, which one of you
is the best man?

538
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,996
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he-he couldn't decide.

539
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,708
- Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.
- Mom, I want you to meet Steven.

540
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,296
He's friends of Jims and mine and,
oh, everyone's.

541
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,548
You look very familiar,
Steven.

542
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,051
Really? Oh, I'm afraid
we've never met. Oh.

543
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,261
Oh. Well, we have now.

544
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:58,682
Oh, looks like you found
Samantha's Sweets.

545
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,768
Oh, yes.
Isn't their chocolate just to die for?

546
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,396
- Oh, well, you have no idea.
- Actually, I do.

547
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,898
I love chocolate more than life itself.
More than life itself.

548
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,401
Yes.! I was just saying
to your friends that...

549
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:12,529
I have something
very precious here.

550
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,781
What is it?

551
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:18,451
Michelle's grandmother's...
my mother's... wedding ring.

552
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,745
Isn't that precious?

553
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,581
But since all of you
are the best man,

554
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:25,583
I don't know who should
ho-hold onto it.

555
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,711
- I think it's best if l...
- Oh, um...

556
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:32,257
I think you should get to know us first
and then decide.

557
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,261
You are such a gentleman, Steve.

558
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,556
I hear that all the time, but it never gets old.
Aw.

559
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,850
Hey, Paul, uh, do you have a camera?

560
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,769
How thoughtful.

561
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:48,106
I must have forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

562
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:50,608
Oh, m-maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

563
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:53,945
- I won't forget this moment.

564
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,322
I bet you won't.
Would you care to join us?

565
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:58,450
I would love to.
Thank you. Well, come on.

566
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,619
Lovely to see you fellas.
Thank you.

567
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,918
Oh, amazing.

568
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,171
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

569
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,798
I love the way the tulips
accentuate the, um...

570
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,760
- What do you call those again, sir?
- Double Lisianthus.

571
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:19,804
Lisianthus.
Double "Lisianthums."

572
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,140
What a pretty name.

573
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:28,271
I told him to be nice,
or-or he couldn't come to the wedding.

574
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,691
I will take care of this. I will take care of this.
Hey. Hey, James.

575
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,110
Oh, great. Come on over.
Oh, great. Come on over.

576
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,488
See if I forgot anything.
I don't think... Oh. Oh, oh.

577
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,990
We're having a great time.
I think I've got it all.

578
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,992
Oh, look, look, look, look.

579
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,495
- Sahara and Desert Rose...

580
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,830
for your bridesmaids' bouquet.

581
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,667
Oh, give me that.
Smell this.

582
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,669
It's fantastic.
Fantastic.

583
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,463
And, oh... Oh. Oh!

584
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,465
Oh, oh, oh!

585
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:59,386
Look at this.

586
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:03,348
Oh, boy. Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

587
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,684
I think with the Summer Blossoms.
Mm-hmm.

588
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,686
Cutie.
Thank you for everything.

589
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,397
What do you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable? Bye, Cadence.

590
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,692
Okay, I know... I know what you're doing.
Look. Have you seen yourself?

591
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,903
I can't believe you're doing this.
Just calm down, dude.

592
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,905
It's all set.
What's set?

593
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,450
I'm gonna teach you to dance
like a "Baryshiniankov."

594
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,994
Oh, yeah.
He is pretty good.

595
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,498
Jim, he's not doing it to be nice.
He's doing it to bone Cadence.

596
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,793
Look, maybe we should give him a chance.
You know, I think... I think...

597
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,338
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes,

598
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:39,551
there's a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance.

599
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,678
That's-That's what I think.

600
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:46,349
Oh, Jim, you've gotta stop masturbating.
It's melting your brain.

601
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,227
Observe the fuckin' Stif-meister.

602
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,229
What is his defining characteristic?

603
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,774
He uses the F-word excessively.

604
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,818
Thanks, man.

605
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:00,030
But I also have confidence.
You're one big floppy cock.

606
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,282
Look at you.
You've gotta stand like a man.

607
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,784
Your posture tells your partner
where to go.

608
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,953
Okay. Okay.
Okay?

609
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:09,039
Follow my lead.

610
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:13,543
This is the waltz.
Waltz. Okay.

611
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,087
Waltz. Okay.

612
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,051
That's pretty good.
You're fuckin' right it's good.

613
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,595
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

614
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,139
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

615
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,434
Should I shave my balls? Do you shave
your balls? How do you do it?

616
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,603
Dude, no.

617
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,440
L... l... I'm just...

618
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,484
Shaving.

619
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,528
You know, there's nothing like
a local pub.

620
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,530
Mm-hmm.
It's like real America...

621
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:46,242
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles.
Well, what's wrong with a good jingle?

622
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,953
I think it was Voltaire who said,

623
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:54,250
"A jingle witty proves everything
for my friends and I."

624
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,963
- Cadence.

625
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,965
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

626
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,301
You're just in time
for Voltaire's greatest hits.

627
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,638
Voltaire?
Stifler, please, who was Voltaire?

628
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,640
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

629
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:13,144
Actually, I'm getting a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff.

630
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,146
Yeah. Me too.

631
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,150
Being smart is so hard.

632
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,488
I'll give you some intelligence.

633
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,367
Voltaire can suck on my balls.

634
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,704
What?

635
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,289
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

636
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,542
Hey, I'm gonna give you a quote to live by.

637
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,544
"Love life, get paid and then get laid."

638
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:41,131
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finch-meister.

639
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:42,507
I like that.

640
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:45,969
- Bet you do.
- But I don't know why you do...

641
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:49,305
because Finch-meister doesn't
make any friggin' sense.

642
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,350
- Sure, it does.
- No fuckin' shit it does.

643
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:58,314
Cadence, let's leave
the "crayton" here, shall we?

644
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,567
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walkin' anyway.

645
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:04,696
Wait. You know, actually, I think I'm gonna
go stretch my legs with the Finch-meister.

646
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,365
- You don't mind, do you, Steven?
- No.

647
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,536
Ha!

648
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:19,085
It's on like Donkey Kong, bi-i-itch.

649
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,087
Pack it up, bitch.

650
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,089
I'm on it. Thank you.

651
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:26,343
So, uh, Cadence say
anything about me?

652
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:29,554
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

653
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,266
Finch. Is she gonna be
around tomorrow night?

654
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:36,519
No, she's going up to Chicago
with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

655
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,898
What about her parents?
I think her mom kind of likes me.

656
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:43,026
They're going up north with,
uh... with my parents...

657
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,071
for, uh... you know, to get things, uh,
ready for the rehearsal.

658
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,573
So, uh...
So that's where they'll be.

659
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:51,076
So don't bother looking for them or anything,
you know.

660
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,370
A wedding.

661
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,123
Shit. How do you know
she's the right girl?

662
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,209
I just do.

663
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:02,921
I'm a better person when I'm with Michelle.
Nobody else can... No, no, no, shithead.

664
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:06,633
You hooked up with one other girl for,
what, 10 seconds.

665
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:10,136
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fuckin' thing ever.

666
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,764
You're like a blind man picking
out his favourite porno.

667
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,808
This shit is crazy.

668
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,605
This is just the old pre-wedding jitters,
son.

669
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,316
It's so forever, you know. It-It's, uh...

670
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,819
You know, Michelle is the only, uh,

671
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,821
girl that I've... I've been with.

672
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:31,741
Honestly, now... Honestly, would you
have passed up sex with Nadia?

673
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,121
Why? Did she say something?

674
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,623
Hypothetically, Dad.
Oh, hypothetically.

675
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:41,251
Well, I mean, you know,
Jim, I'm a married man.

676
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm...
If-lf-lf you weren't married.

677
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,798
She's a college girl.
If you were a college guy.

678
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:49,509
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

679
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:54,472
First of all, what-what you're feeling is
so normal and perfectly natural.

680
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:59,477
Marriage is not about, uh, animal lusting
and-and kinky sex games.

681
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:04,149
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

682
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,151
It's-It's deeper than that.

683
00:42:06,276 --> 00:42:09,154
The longer a marriage lasts,

684
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,156
uh, the longer you can go,

685
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,158
uh, without sex.

686
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,703
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

687
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,705
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

688
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,832
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

689
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:23,043
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

690
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:26,629
Uh, and I mean that in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

691
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,299
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh... I think I, uh...

692
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:33,136
Anything else you need?
No. No, that's, uh...

693
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,139
Anything I can do.

694
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,870
He's not here. Park the cars down
there where he won't see them.

695
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:08,713
Hoo! Fuckin' right!

696
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,093
So, you like my pants, Stiffy? Whatever,
dude. As long as the girls are worth it.

697
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,930
They're worth it. Oh, and if you've got some
good wine too, that'll score some points for you.

698
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,891
- We think there's some in the...
in the basement. - I'll get it.

699
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:21,893
You ain't gonna want to miss this.

700
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,688
Gentlemen.

701
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,106
Gentlemen, I would like to introduce...

702
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:31,653
Officer Krystal und Fräulein Brandi.

703
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,031
Oh, my God.

704
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:38,743
Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Yeah.!

705
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:42,914
- Oh, my God!
- You boys have been very messy.

706
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,546
Whoops.
Can you see my fanny?

707
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,798
Whoops.

708
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,717
Ohh!

709
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,720
Whoo.!

710
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,596
- Oh!

711
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,851
- You naughty girl.

712
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,897
None of that pleading the Fifth crap!

713
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,442
- You boys are gonna talk.
- Uh... Uh...

714
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,110
Wow.!

715
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:16,031
Oh, my God!

716
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,950
Are you just gonna stand there and drool?

717
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:22,037
- Or are we gonna have a bachelor party?
- Fuck yeah, we are!

718
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,914
Yeah? What?
I can't hear you.

719
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,085
Louder!
Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes. Bachelor party.

720
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,670
Can't hear you.
Louder! Louder!

721
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:34,257
- Stick a finger in my ass!

722
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,012
- That's weird.
- You just wait.

723
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:41,973
Look, maybe we should
just wait for... Jim.

724
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:45,393
- Fuck Jim, man! This is for us.
- Take her top off.

725
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:48,938
My girlfriend has strict rules
about this. No touching.

726
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,941
What are you, a dancing clown?

727
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,653
You wipe that shit-eating grin off
your face, you punk-ass little bitch.

728
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:58,031
- This is awesome!
Oh, you like that?

729
00:44:58,114 --> 00:44:59,824
You like it, huh?
How much? Boob.

730
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,993
No! Hmph!

731
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:06,498
I'm sorry. No, not yet.
But you will be.

732
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:09,668
Like I said, this is awesome.

733
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:21,971
Hey, listen, l-l-l-I think we both know
that Officer Krystal and me have this...

734
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,058
You know. Yeah.
Thing? Mm-hmm.

735
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,694
No one has ever
slapped my ass like that.

736
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,239
No one's ever pinched
my nipple with such ferocity.

737
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:49,082
l... I'm a master
of the Tantric art.

738
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,292
L-I look at her body...

739
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,046
and I just see the chakras and
the things I can do to her and...

740
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,090
Ohh!

741
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,270
You. You look cute.
L... Oh, thank you.

742
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,313
Thank you, but you...
you're the cute one.

743
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,275
Stiffy! How slimming
is this, huh?

744
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,111
What the fuck,
Buffalo Bill?

745
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:21,322
What, this... What,
the pink too much?

746
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:25,535
It puts the dress in the drawer
and it does as it's told.

747
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:29,456
Oh, dude.
Now that's fucked up.

748
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,624
That's fucked up.

749
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:34,711
And in closing, you have been
a naughty, naughty girl.

750
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:37,756
You been naughty, Brandi?
You been fuckin' naughty?

751
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,343
Fresh.

752
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,387
Take her top off!

753
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:48,683
You didn't get to cleaning,
little bitch fucker? Huh? Ow!

754
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:52,228
Wanna see us kiss?

755
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,733
Fuck, no.
No, no.

756
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:58,818
None of that
"you go, we go" bullshit.

757
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:01,154
Already done that.
Very good of you.

758
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:16,086
I used to have this pet bass.
Oh.

759
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,672
His name was Arnie, and...
Oh, he was so cute.

760
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,674
And he just loved me too.
Yeah.

761
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,967
He'd just look up at me...
Maybe you could dance.

762
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:25,387
And make this face like...

763
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,265
Or something like that. I don't know.
It was great. God, I miss him, but...

764
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:32,018
Um, sometimes I watch
the Discovery Channel, and...

765
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,354
I don't care!

766
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:37,607
Could you just dance for me, please?

767
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:40,193
No, that's my favourite...

768
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:42,987
It was my favourite shirt.
Uh, okay.

769
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:46,616
Hey. What?

770
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,036
Nothin'.

771
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,123
It's a crazy party, huh?

772
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:05,635
Don't worry about him.
You don't worry about him.

773
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,640
He's... He's a... He's a maniac.
And you're a maniac, you know that?

774
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,233
Stifler, why in the world
are you focused on me?

775
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:22,110
I'm surprised to see
you don't have tits.

776
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:25,488
How can I clean you
if you are not dirty?

777
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:29,617
Go put something on that I must clean
off with my tongue.

778
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:33,121
Ohh. Anything for a French person.

779
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:36,166
If you insist, Fräulein.

780
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:49,721
- Ah!

781
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:51,431
Oh, yeah.

782
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,808
Look at you, you pathetic,
little weasel.

783
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:55,602
Can't I just watch?

784
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:59,856
Look, you don't have to do
anything if you don't want to.

785
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:02,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

786
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,736
Don't break character ever again.

787
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,823
Okay? I don't care if Kevin starts crying
because Finch bit his cock off.

788
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:13,661
You're a dirty cop, you're a prissy maid
and I am your filthy cabana boy in need
of much punishment and cleaning.

789
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:16,623
Don't you ever mouth off
to Officer Krystal,

790
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,458
- you dirty, little pervert!
- Okay.

791
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,044
Now, obey!
I obey! I obey!

792
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:22,462
Jesus!

793
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:41,981
Guys, are we having dinner?

794
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:48,905
Here, let me get that.

795
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:54,285
Holy shit!
Stifler.

796
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:58,081
I've got something really nice cooking
up for you. Well, we love surprises.

797
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:02,168
Stifler, you said you spoke to Jim. I did.
I was secret about it and everything.

798
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:05,588
He said he'd be the only one here
tonight. What the fuck, shit-brick?

799
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,841
Chocolate.
Ah, sh...

800
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:10,719
Now, I told everyone that you were
up north with my parents.

801
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,264
Okay. So we won't be bothered. We can
just, uh, totally relax and no worries.

802
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,641
Please come on in.

803
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,977
Make yourselves at home.
Right this way. Thank you.

804
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,979
Sir.

805
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,899
What?

806
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,360
Pink roses.

807
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,362
Pink roses.
Yeah.

808
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,117
They're nice, aren't they?
Yes. Artificial. Nice try.

809
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:36,995
Well...
I almost got ya.

810
00:50:37,078 --> 00:50:39,414
Yeah. Well.

811
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:42,751
So, has Michelle ever told you
the story of how we fell in love?

812
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,378
Oh, why don't you retell us now?

813
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:48,089
It's... It's one of my favourite stories.
Where should I begin?

814
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:50,091
Um...

815
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,177
Let's see. Uh...

816
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,348
Well, I suppose, uh...
I suppose it all started at, um...

817
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,521
Tall Oaks.

818
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,982
That's-That's right.
At Tall Oaks.

819
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:09,027
That was the summer when, uh... Oh!

820
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,237
Oh! The summer that was so hot.

821
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,823
So hot.
All right. Look what I got.

822
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,825
Jesus!

823
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:17,827
Hey there.
Hi there.

824
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:21,539
Hey.
Jim, I cannot believe you.

825
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:27,754
- You can't? - You hired help on our
account? That is entirely unnecessary.

826
00:51:27,879 --> 00:51:30,340
But I will have some of that wine, sir.

827
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,843
- Say, "Please," Harold.
- Please. Of course.

828
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:38,098
Absolutely. It's what he's here for,
is-is the wine, obviously.

829
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:41,017
Yes. Evidently.
What else would you be here for?

830
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:46,272
And-And-And I certainly appreciate
your-your-your courtesy, sir.

831
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:48,733
Ah. Uh, well, yes.

832
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:52,529
Uh, we have... we have right here
a 1999...

833
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:55,281
cabernet seve... um...

834
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:59,911
full-bodied, masculine wine.

835
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:02,914
Just shouts sophistication.

836
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:06,501
- James.
- Yes.

837
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:10,422
Well, I can see you're very surprised
to see me here. A little bit.

838
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:12,841
I'm going to go check on the dogs.
Yes, yes!

839
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,969
In fact, why don't you both
go check on the dogs and...

840
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:19,514
No, no, no. Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

841
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,392
- How do you know?
- Because I just checked on the dogs.

842
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,020
Because he just checked on the dogs.
Good work, man. I did.

843
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,522
- Jim, I'll help you with the turkey.
- Okay.

844
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:30,525
Um, and I'll keep you company.

845
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,527
Thank you. Whoo.

846
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:35,905
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mr., um...

847
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,533
Belvedere, ma'am.
Oh. Belvedere.

848
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,536
It's chilly in here.

849
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:44,289
So, how long do we have to
stay in here for?

850
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:46,875
I don't know.
They said to hide.

851
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,294
I guess we'll just wait
for 'em to call us.

852
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:52,380
Who knows what kind of kinky shit
they're getting ready for us.

853
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:54,466
Do these go
in your ass tonight or mine?

854
00:52:57,594 --> 00:53:00,138
Do you have a serving dish ready?

855
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:02,182
- Jim.
- Hmm?

856
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:04,601
We need a serving dish.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

857
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:07,479
- Oh!
- What?

858
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,359
- Nothing.
- Then why the excitement?

859
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,819
I thought, uh, the-the dish was broken.

860
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,113
Well, is it?
No.

861
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:19,115
Then, are you going to get it?
Yes.

862
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,295
Here you go. One serving dish.
Excellent.

863
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:35,173
Now what we need...
a cutting board.

864
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:36,841
Huh? No, no, no, no!
Stop! What?

865
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:41,262
L-I will get it for you.
Nonsense. I can get a cutting board.

866
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:45,809
Ah, let's see. There you go.
This should do nicely.

867
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:48,645
I presume we're having
white wine with the turkey.

868
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,689
Uh, let me go check.

869
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:58,238
What happened here?

870
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,241
Oh, um, that... that's mud.

871
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:04,744
I meant to clean that up this morning.
How embarrassing.

872
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:07,414
That's gonna stain.
We're gonna need a mop.

873
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,832
I'll get it.
It's in this closet.

874
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:12,711
Oh! No, no, no!
No, it's not.

875
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,005
- It's in there.
- It's not in this closet...

876
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,675
because l-I, um...
I moved it... I moved it.

877
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,719
Well, where?
I'll go get it.

878
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:23,013
L-I don't...
I don't remember.

879
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:25,181
You don't remember?

880
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:28,351
You know why I don't remember
is because I actually did not move it.

881
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,937
The cleaning lady did.

882
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:32,897
Your mother said you don't have
a cleaning lady.

883
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:36,026
I don't know why she would say such a...
You called, master?

884
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:39,195
Holy...
Well, there you are.

885
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,364
Hello.
How do you do?

886
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:45,452
Uh, so, cleaning lady,

887
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,538
we were wondering
where... where the mop was.

888
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:51,583
Master put the mop
in my fanny.

889
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,210
- You what?
- Who put what where?

890
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,005
I did no such thing anywhere.

891
00:54:57,088 --> 00:54:59,591
Shall I clean?

892
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,720
Harold.

893
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,018
Very well.
It is so hot in here.

894
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:13,355
- Holy Jesus!

895
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:22,572
Oh, Brandi, Brandi. What are you doing?
You're not in Eastern Europe anymore.

896
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:28,370
You can't do that. I am so sorry about my
... my cousin. She's not used to our customs.

897
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:31,539
Jim, I apologize for recommending
her to you.

898
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:34,292
Oh, here's, uh...
here's this, by the way.

899
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:37,045
Ah, yeah. Got the mop.

900
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,173
Brandi, you left the mop
in the car. Hmm?

901
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:43,885
Now remember, it's called a car,
not a fanny.

902
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,847
You remember last time when you wanted
me to take a ride in your fanny? Of course.

903
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:51,643
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

904
00:55:51,726 --> 00:55:53,853
You know what?
We should probably just go.

905
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:57,524
I'm so sorry about this. I just came by
to make sure everything was in order.

906
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:00,443
Ooh, food smells great!

907
00:56:00,568 --> 00:56:02,821
Au revoir.

908
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:05,323
Jim, you have unique friends.

909
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:08,910
Harold!
Let's get that cleaned up.

910
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:12,080
Um, I think I saw some Pine-Sol in
here too.

911
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:15,750
Aye-yay-yay.
Oh, my God!

912
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,794
Oh, my Lord.!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

913
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,338
He's okay. Are you all right?
Are you okay?

914
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:23,049
Who did this to you? I'm sure he's okay.
Are you okay?

915
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,803
Get some help! Harold, call the police!
No, no, please.

916
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:29,556
- All right!
- Jesus!

917
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:32,017
I'll take charge from here.

918
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,686
- They are fast here. And nicely attired.
- What's going on here?

919
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:37,564
- She's here to protect and serve.
- Quiet!

920
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:39,858
- Okay.
- Who let this boy out of the closet?

921
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,110
You are all in for
a hard punishment now.

922
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:44,320
Don't you touch him.
He's been hurt.

923
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,364
- No, this is hurt!
- Ow!

924
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:48,658
You can't do that.
Silence, fucker!

925
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:50,744
Ow!
Oh, you like it.

926
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:52,787
Oh!
Harold!

927
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:55,040
What's gotten into you?
I meant "ow."

928
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:57,667
Dirty whore!
Shut your hole! Obey!

929
00:56:57,792 --> 00:56:59,961
You can't do that.!

930
00:57:00,086 --> 00:57:03,381
- You're a disgrace to the police force.
- I'll be giving you an enema!

931
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:05,717
Hey, somebody untie me.!

932
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,012
Back off! All right, forget it.
We give up.

933
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,348
Oh, Steven! Steven!

934
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:14,267
Oh, it's okay, Mary.
What's going on?

935
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,311
Listen. This isn't
working, guys.

936
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:19,147
Krystal, you can drop the act.
This isn't a real cop.

937
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:21,733
Kevin wasn't assaulted.

938
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:24,444
I just wanted to make Jim
look good for you guys.

939
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,946
Like a real hero.
Kind of like me.

940
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,450
So, we hired a fake cop and we tied
up Kevin and put him in the closet.

941
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:33,203
Jim was supposed to rescue him,
untie him, give him mouth-to-mouth.

942
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,330
I don't know
what he likes to do.

943
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:38,792
You know, and then Paul Finchhired an
exotic dancer instead of a real actor.

944
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,002
Jim, is this true?

945
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:46,966
- Every word of it. - That is the stupidest
idea I have ever heard.

946
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,178
You've embarrassed me and Harold
and Mr. Belvedere.

947
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:54,140
It's all my fault.
I'm a bad person.

948
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:59,729
Oh, you're not a bad person. You were
just trying to help out your best friend.

949
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:03,817
And it was an awful idea. But I suppose
it's the thought that counts.

950
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,195
You know, actually, um...

951
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,574
Actually, l-I never
should have allowed...

952
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,537
such a... such a crazy plan
to happen in the first place.

953
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:20,375
If you're gonna blame anybody here,
blame me.

954
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,712
Well, I'm sorry, Jim. I didn't realize how
much pressure we put on you.

955
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:27,465
I'm sure you both learned your lesson
and I suppose I understand.

956
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:31,386
Jim, if you put half as much energy into
your marriage as you put into tonight,

957
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:33,722
I'm confident that I can give you
my blessing.

958
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,561
And, Steven, we still adore you,
honey.

959
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:43,440
In fact, I think I know
who should hold onto this.

960
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:46,234
We adore you.
You'll take good care of it.

961
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:49,112
You've gotta be kidding me.
No.

962
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:51,823
Look it, Jim. Kevin. Boy, this really makes
me important to the wedding, huh?

963
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,994
Yes.

964
00:58:56,077 --> 00:59:00,081
Well, Mr. Belvedere, it's gonna
be one fucked-up wedding.

965
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:02,250
Absolutely.

966
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:05,712
Drive carefully.
There's more bags in the study.

967
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:07,964
Thank you.
You're welcome.

968
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:14,888
Ow! Is there any room
for me?

969
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,265
Uh, nope.

970
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,642
Oh, I'll just drive up north
all by myself.

971
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:21,895
That sounds good.
We'll see you later.

972
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,732
No, I'll drive with you.
Oh, thanks, Cadence.

973
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:29,027
- Beautiful lady.
- Sure.

974
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:34,657
Hey, Finch... I know, shut up.
Kevin.

975
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:48,755
So, my mom found the dogs playing with
something unusual this morning.

976
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,801
What?
I told her it was a neck massager.

977
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:56,888
Oh, these are great.

978
01:00:20,995 --> 01:00:24,958
Hilarious, huh?
Yeah.

979
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,585
That kind of thing's
so lethargic to me.

980
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:30,422
What do you mean?

981
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:32,257
I'm not sure.

982
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:54,154
Mr. "Stifler,"
I already told you...

983
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:56,865
you called two days ago
and cancelled your reservation.

984
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,950
Since you now
wish to stay here,

985
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,536
I thought you could persuade
Mr. Finch to share his room.

986
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:04,497
Hey, shithead.
I didn't cancel my reservation.

987
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,583
Mr. Fuckface Finch
called here,

988
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,960
and Mr. Idiot-Behind-The-Desk
cancelled it.

989
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:13,673
Kristof, please pardon my friend's
uncouth behaviour.

990
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,508
I did no such thing.

991
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,469
Nor did I, sir,

992
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:21,514
and your rudeness and obscenities
won't change anything.

993
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:24,142
Oh. Well, then,
I guess it doesn't matter...

994
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:27,103
if I call you a crotch-face,
you ball-scratching Finch-fucker.

995
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:29,230
- Or better yet, go blow your dad!
- My dad?

996
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:30,982
Hear, hear!

997
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,735
While you're there, stick a finger up
both their asses.

998
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,819
Oh.

999
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,821
Um, uh, hey.
Hi.

1000
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:39,574
Um, Finch, rudeness and obscenity
won't change anything.

1001
01:01:39,699 --> 01:01:43,078
Here's a thought. Grow a sack,
fill it with some balls,

1002
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:47,582
magically sprout a dick, shove it up
your ass, start fucking yourself with it.

1003
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:49,125
Yeah, baby!

1004
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,211
Whoo! Baby, you know
what I'm sayin'? Oh!

1005
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:52,879
Ohh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1006
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:54,589
Yeah!
This is disgusting!

1007
01:01:54,714 --> 01:01:58,677
- Why don't you go dust with your
perverse European cousin?

1008
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,514
Is she here?
Unbelievable.

1009
01:02:02,597 --> 01:02:05,350
I'd like to book a tee time
for my husband...

1010
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:07,644
and a European pumpkin-peel facial
for me, please.

1011
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,729
Ooh!
Make that two.

1012
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:12,065
You're gonna have
a fun weekend, Ma.

1013
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:15,026
I am missing my soap.
Well, don't you worry about your soaps.

1014
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,071
Will you push faster?
I'm tired.

1015
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:21,825
And wait till you meet Michelle.
You're gonna love her. She's sweet as sugar.

1016
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:25,745
I can't eat sugar.
I know, because you're diabetic.

1017
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:30,625
You know, Ma, I know things haven't
been going well for you. I know that.

1018
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,420
But wait till you see Jim standing
up there at the altar tomorrow.

1019
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:38,174
I mean, if ever there was a time to be
happy and smile the biggest smile,

1020
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:41,594
now is the time.
Okay. Okay!

1021
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,222
I'm overjoyed.

1022
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:47,809
That's... That's a start.

1023
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:51,104
Proud grandmother
coming through.

1024
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:53,189
Grandsons getting married tomorrow.

1025
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:56,151
You think she's happy now?
Wait till tomorrow.

1026
01:02:57,527 --> 01:03:00,155
Congratulations.

1027
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,997
Grooming.

1028
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,753
The flowers stay refrigerated
until morning.

1029
01:03:56,878 --> 01:03:59,506
Just as we made them.
Oh, I'm sure they will.

1030
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,966
Oh, my...

1031
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,313
- Oh! Ah!
- Oh, Jimmy, no!

1032
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:17,565
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1033
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:28,076
I hope you'll be more careful
with the next one.

1034
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,954
My kitchen is not a toilet.
Okay?

1035
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:41,715
Boy, pubic hair was just not an issue
when I was dating.

1036
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:46,886
The ladies, uh, never complained
when they were...

1037
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,888
you know, down in that general area.

1038
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:51,349
Okay, if you never mention that
ever again, that'd be great.

1039
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:54,978
You're right. No, no, no. Okay.
Shouldn't have brought it up. Maybe...

1040
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:55,186
So, can I see the ring?

1041
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:56,980
So, can I see the ring?

1042
01:04:57,105 --> 01:05:01,609
Nope. Promised to keep it safe.
It's not leaving my pocket.

1043
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:03,987
Okay, Frodo.

1044
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,950
You really care about
this wedding, don't you?

1045
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:13,163
Yeah. I'm gonna cry
at the ceremony.

1046
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:16,207
I know it.

1047
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,376
Are you just saying
all of this?

1048
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:24,174
I mean, do you act differently
around certain people? Namely me.

1049
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:28,261
Of course not. Why? Do you act
differently around me?

1050
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:32,807
Generally I'm just me. If people don't
like it, then that's their problem, right?

1051
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:34,934
Yeah. Fuck those fuckers.

1052
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,936
What?

1053
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:40,565
L-I didn't... No, you know, you're right.
Fuck 'em.

1054
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,783
- Hey, Harold and Mary.
- Oh, hi, kids. - Hi.

1055
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:51,910
How's it going?

1056
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:55,163
Thanks for, um... Come on.
Thanks for watching the dogs.

1057
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:59,918
I love these guys. Hey, you guys want
more Snausages? Huh? There you go.

1058
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,587
- Eat 'em up, fellas.
- Give me some.

1059
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:05,590
Oh, there you go.
I don't think I have any left.

1060
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:11,304
- What's wrong?
- Oh, shit.

1061
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:14,307
- Are you okay?

1062
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:17,852
Yeah.

1063
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:23,608
You kissed Stifler?
Yeah, but then he freaked.

1064
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:26,486
And it's like he's been paying more
attention to the dogs than me.

1065
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:30,573
Can I stop worrying then? Michelle,
he's been nothing but nice to me.

1066
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:33,785
I mean, do you think
he really likes you? Like...

1067
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,579
I don't know.
I hope he likes me.

1068
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:39,124
I mean, I think
he likes me.

1069
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:43,128
We're... Well, yeah, I guess
I hope he likes me.

1070
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:48,425
Do it.

1071
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:50,427
Don't fuck around.

1072
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:53,179
Just relax and let it go.

1073
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,181
I'm sick of waiting.

1074
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:57,684
Do it for Daddy.

1075
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,645
Will you just take a shit already?

1076
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:04,983
Great.

1077
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:07,318
You fed the ring to the dogs,
didn't you?

1078
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:13,241
Of course not.

1079
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:16,453
You have been staring at those dogs
like a hawk all day.

1080
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:18,997
I'm a dog lover.

1081
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,416
Oh, and by the way...

1082
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:25,295
apparently you missed
when Cadence kissed me.

1083
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,547
Slight tongue action too.

1084
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,675
It was something like this.

1085
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,552
You're a terrible liar, Stifler.

1086
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:36,097
If I were lying, I'd think of something
better than a kiss.

1087
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:39,059
Maybe a blow job
or some titty grabbin'.

1088
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,019
No pussy for you, Finch.

1089
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,731
Oh, fuckin' right, doggy!

1090
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:48,568
It's about goddamn time.
Jackpot.!

1091
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:53,406
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some shit to attend to.

1092
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,706
Great!

1093
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,635
Thanks, assholes.

1094
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:17,764
You know, maybe you can call them.
Oh, okay.

1095
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:21,851
Steve, come over here.

1096
01:08:22,977 --> 01:08:25,855
Uh, I'm a little busy.

1097
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,274
With what? Come on over.
We need you.

1098
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,028
Get over here, you little rascal. We were
just talking about Michelle's wedding band.

1099
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:34,030
Could I see it?

1100
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:36,741
Um, no.

1101
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:40,161
- No?
- I don't have it.

1102
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:43,456
What? You mean you lost it?
Of course not.

1103
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,376
I'm keeping it safe in my room,
you silly Sally.

1104
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:49,170
- I apologize.
- That's fine. I'll just see it later.

1105
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:52,007
Okay. All right then. What do you have
in your hand there?

1106
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:59,889
- This one?
- No, the other one.

1107
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,519
It's a chocolate truffle.
Ooh, yummy.!

1108
01:09:04,644 --> 01:09:06,730
Where did you get that?

1109
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:11,651
Oh, the caterer said she was saving
the truffles for tomorrow.

1110
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:13,695
You sneaky devil.

1111
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:18,491
Well, hey, I managed
to sneak one right past her.

1112
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,869
Oh, come on.
This woman loves chocolate.

1113
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:23,413
- At least give her a tiny nibble.
- Give it to Mama.

1114
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,791
Mama don't want this.
This is the only piece that I have.

1115
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,669
- Idiot.
- Well, break it in half. Come on.

1116
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:32,839
You know what? Let's just leave
the surprises till tomorrow, huh, guys?

1117
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:35,759
- It's gonna be a great day.
- I'd like my surprise right now.

1118
01:09:35,884 --> 01:09:38,887
- No, it's mine!
- Steven, give it to me.

1119
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,639
- No.
- Give me the "G" darn truffle.

1120
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:45,852
Steven, that is so selfish.

1121
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:50,648
Mm, it's good.
Is it? Is it sweet?

1122
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:56,196
- It's so sweet.

1123
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:00,116
Close your mouth when you chew, Steven.
Don't do that.

1124
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:05,080
At least you could describe to the
lovely woman how delicious it is.

1125
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:08,917
Well, tastes like twigs
and berries.

1126
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,169
Is it Swiss or French
chocolate?

1127
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:13,421
Maybe German.
Oh, really?

1128
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:16,549
Uh-huh.
Is it creamy?

1129
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:19,219
Yeah, it's creamy.
Easy to go down, right?

1130
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,763
Well, I'm trying to savor the flavor
right now.

1131
01:10:21,888 --> 01:10:24,557
Is it fresh?
- Oh, it's so fresh.

1132
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:27,769
Nothing better than when they're fresh.
Nothing better.

1133
01:10:27,894 --> 01:10:30,397
The problem is you can't
eat just one, can ya?

1134
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:34,359
No. No, you can't. But you've got
to know when to stop, don't you?

1135
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:36,861
You really do, but it's hard.
It's really hard.

1136
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:39,781
Droppings from the gods.
Ooh!

1137
01:10:39,906 --> 01:10:41,783
Get me another one, darling.
Come on.

1138
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:44,411
You selfish boy. Next time, bring
enough for everybody.

1139
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:47,163
Hey, let's keep this
to ourselves. Huh? Okay?

1140
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:50,000
Okay.
I gotta go, okay?

1141
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,919
Don't have any more because it's gonna
spoil your appetite.

1142
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:55,630
Okay. Hey, look, man.
I gotta go.

1143
01:10:55,755 --> 01:10:57,090
See ya.

1144
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:05,765
Grandma, I want you
to meet some people.

1145
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,978
Grandma, this is Michelle.

1146
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,563
I'm so proud to be joining your family.

1147
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,733
She's real pretty, huh?

1148
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:19,404
Isn't it great?
We're getting married.

1149
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,531
It's amazing, Gram.

1150
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:28,246
Not Jewish. No wedding, Jimmy!
No wedding.

1151
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,915
Forget it. Goy.!
Grandma?

1152
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,043
- Shit.
- Jim, she hates me.

1153
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:36,963
Oh, my God!
Grandma!

1154
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,090
Grandma, we love each other.

1155
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:41,217
Michelle and I love each other
very much.

1156
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:44,054
And that's all that matters.
Grandma.! Grandma.

1157
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:48,558
Michelle. Michelle.

1158
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:51,770
But, uh, Grandma's okay.

1159
01:11:51,853 --> 01:11:55,732
Oh, she's okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, Dad.
She's okay. She's just a little tired.

1160
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:58,651
Okay. My mother
hasn't been well.

1161
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:01,321
When your dad sees the look
on Grandma's face...

1162
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:04,407
it's... it's gonna
break his heart.

1163
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:07,369
Because of me.
It's not because of you.

1164
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:09,454
Michelle, it's not because
of you at all.

1165
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:12,415
It's because Grandma thinks
it's 1801.

1166
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:16,461
Look. Don't... Don't worry.
I will... I'll come up with something.

1167
01:12:17,545 --> 01:12:19,631
I promised you
the wedding of your dreams,

1168
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:22,759
and I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

1169
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,969
Oh.

1170
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:27,013
I would like to propose a toast.

1171
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:31,434
These last few weeks have really been
something for my lovely wife and me.

1172
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:34,604
We have met some people
we didn't know existed.

1173
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:38,274
We've experienced some things
we didn't think were possible.

1174
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,444
We've always tried to make
the best of every situation.

1175
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,322
- This is a good situation.
- That's what I'm saying.

1176
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,825
This is a wonderful situation.

1177
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:50,537
The coming together of two families
from different backgrounds.

1178
01:12:50,662 --> 01:12:54,040
So, to our new son-in-law,
may we say Erin Go Braugh.

1179
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:57,502
To our lovely daughter
Michelle, L'chaim.

1180
01:12:57,627 --> 01:12:59,796
- Did I get that right?
- Very good.

1181
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:03,842
Uh, and let's hope we can sip
many happy shivas together.

1182
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:07,137
Here's to a wonderful wedding.

1183
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:09,514
Cheers.

1184
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:18,189
See that, shit-brick.
Told you I won.

1185
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:21,693
Hey.
Hey.

1186
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:26,823
So, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if
I freaked you out with the whole kiss thing.

1187
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:28,867
You didn't freak me out.

1188
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,454
I just wanted
to let you know that...

1189
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:34,664
you make me feel special.

1190
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,001
I think you're the most
special girl I've ever known.

1191
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:43,840
Maybe you'd wanna make things
extra special tonight.

1192
01:13:43,923 --> 01:13:46,384
Which room is yours?

1193
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:48,928
I'm crashing at Kevin's.

1194
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:51,598
Damn.
But I saw...

1195
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:55,852
like a big, fluffy linen closet
at the end of the main hallway.

1196
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:58,313
Yes. Big, fluffy linen closet is good.
Okay.

1197
01:13:58,396 --> 01:14:00,899
Midnight? All right.
Yeah. Okay.

1198
01:14:00,982 --> 01:14:03,109
Oh!

1199
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:07,030
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1200
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:10,200
Gonna have sex with Cadence

1201
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:12,452
Whoo! Uh-huh.

1202
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,331
Cadence
Jesus!

1203
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:18,792
You fuckin' stalker.

1204
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,127
You're nota very stealthy thief.

1205
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:23,797
Oh, really?
Guess what, shit-brick, it's a wedding.

1206
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,258
Everything's free.
What do you want?

1207
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,721
Well, Stifler, Jim's grandma
doesn't approve of the wedding.

1208
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:35,141
We're trying to run
interference and,

1209
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:38,019
reluctantly, I am asking for your help.

1210
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:42,649
Hmm. Sorry, Finch-meister.
I got plans with Cadence.

1211
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:47,237
Stifler, maybe you could forget about your
dick for one second and actually be useful.

1212
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,989
Fuck you, Finch.

1213
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,492
You didn't eat shit, okay?

1214
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:55,245
You didn't prance around here
like a ballerina for the whole week.

1215
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,497
"Oh, wedding" this.
"Suck my ass" that.

1216
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,126
"I'm special. You're special." We're all
just a bunch of special fuckers, aren't we?

1217
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:04,337
Well, you know what?
I'm a-gonna get laid, Finch-fucker.

1218
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:06,464
And it's gonna be
oh, so good.

1219
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,466
It's gonna be like,
"You like this shit, Mama?"

1220
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,802
She's gonna be like,
"Fuckin' right, doggy, give it to me.

1221
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:13,513
Suck on my nipples
like you're milking a cow."

1222
01:15:13,638 --> 01:15:15,598
Like...

1223
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:27,360
You been here long?

1224
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,489
Oh, shit.

1225
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:36,786
Yeah.
Cadence,

1226
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:38,955
it is my distinct pleasure
to introduce you...

1227
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,501
- to the real Steve Stifler.
- Hi.

1228
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:45,337
Hi.

1229
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,675
Pumpkin.

1230
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:56,014
You are quite the gentleman, Stifler.

1231
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,974
You could have told me
she was behind me.

1232
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:02,187
Between Grandma and Stifler and Cadence.
The cake. The cake!

1233
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:07,192
I mean, are you kidding me? You know,
I thought I had grown out of this...

1234
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:11,071
sort of behaviour, but I keep messing up.

1235
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:13,073
These things keep happening to me.

1236
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:15,617
And if I can't bring it
together for one day,

1237
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,495
how am I gonna hold it together
for the rest of our lives?

1238
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,830
I'm really afraid that this is
how it's always gonna be.

1239
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:23,917
Yeah, but you always manage
to get yourself into serious shit,

1240
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:27,671
and somehow you always come out
of it better than you went in.

1241
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,924
I don't know how, but you do.
Everything is gonna be fine.

1242
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:35,970
Yeah. Um, uh, you need to
come into the kitchen right now.

1243
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:39,349
There's... Yeah.
Jesus, now what?

1244
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:48,191
There is no way to remake
all these in time, is there?

1245
01:16:48,274 --> 01:16:50,527
Something must have
disrupted the power.

1246
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:54,030
The compressors need time to reset
after a power loss, or they overheat.

1247
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:57,117
Essentially, it turns the refrigerator
into an oven.

1248
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:01,579
Stifler was in here earlier
flipping switches.

1249
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:03,873
Michelle, I am so sorry.

1250
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:08,545
Hey!

1251
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,967
Ooh. Those flowers
look hideous.

1252
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:15,969
That's 'cause you killed them,
Stifler.

1253
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,847
You've ruined everything.

1254
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:22,225
F... What are you
talking about?

1255
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:25,812
You obviously don't care about this
wedding or anyone in it.

1256
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:31,234
Cadence.

1257
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:35,822
Jim?

1258
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:39,743
Shit-brick, come on.

1259
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:47,792
Maybe you should
just leave, Stifler.

1260
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:55,175
Fine. Adios.

1261
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:05,495
Fuckers, it's not my fault!

1262
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:08,331
I'm not an "intellectual Einstein".
I'm not...

1263
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,961
- Damn it.!

1264
01:19:16,506 --> 01:19:18,758
Fuck!

1265
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:30,020
Hey, flower fuckers, you there?

1266
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,897
Zyskowski.

1267
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,702
Hello?

1268
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:48,955
Are you awake?

1269
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,209
Come on. Come on.
Anybody awake?

1270
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:55,545
Oh.!

1271
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,298
- Are you Miss Zyskowski?
- Who are you?

1272
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:02,218
I'm the guy who just killed all the flowers
for the Levenstein-band geek wedding.

1273
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:05,305
- What?
- Yeah, I'm that guy.

1274
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:09,559
Now what I need you to do is drag
your ass down to your little store,

1275
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:11,603
gather up some flowers,
slice 'em and dice 'em,

1276
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:15,398
jam 'em all together and cart that crap
down to the wedding.

1277
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,609
Are you completely insane?

1278
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:21,071
- You have no idea.
- Even if I overlook the fact...

1279
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,823
that this is the rudest thing
I have ever encountered,

1280
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:26,659
there is no time
to redo all that work.

1281
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:29,954
I had four assistants working two
full days on that wedding.

1282
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,956
I'm sorry.

1283
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,292
It's impossible.

1284
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:41,925
We don't quit at halftime, ma'am!

1285
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:45,095
You don't score
until you score!

1286
01:20:50,141 --> 01:20:52,143
That's the spirit, sweetheart.

1287
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:05,115
Pick up the pace.

1288
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:08,243
You guys keep working this hard,
we'll be able to beat the Wildcats.

1289
01:21:08,326 --> 01:21:10,954
You remember how tough
they were last year.

1290
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:13,289
Come on. Let's see
some determination.

1291
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,834
Determination.!

1292
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:23,133
Come on. Keep working.!

1293
01:21:27,303 --> 01:21:29,889
Good, Connor. Very good.
Good, DeBoer.

1294
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,975
Really sucks.
Go fix it.

1295
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:35,979
Hey, party guy. Having a good time,
huh? Can I get you a gin and tonic?

1296
01:21:36,062 --> 01:21:39,566
Ring! Hold on a second.
Hello. Okay.

1297
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,818
It's for you.
It's "get to work, fucker."

1298
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:46,156
We are gathered here today
to join these two great people...

1299
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,617
in a blessed union and bladdah,
bladdah, bladdah and crap.

1300
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:52,328
Coach, this is kinda gay.

1301
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:56,583
Yeah, it is.

1302
01:21:57,876 --> 01:22:01,546
Good work.
Hey, no problem.

1303
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,548
So, you got a date
for this thing?

1304
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:05,550
Don't push it.
Sorry.

1305
01:22:10,722 --> 01:22:12,724
Holy shit.

1306
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:14,893
How the hell did this happen?

1307
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:17,020
It's a miracle.

1308
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:19,105
Stifler. Save it, dickhead.
I'm working.

1309
01:22:30,575 --> 01:22:33,870
- You're an asshole.
- I know.

1310
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:36,122
You really are an asshole.

1311
01:22:37,248 --> 01:22:39,876
Thanks.

1312
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:43,713
I don't do apologies so good.

1313
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,592
Well, you get an "A" for effort.
This is amazing.

1314
01:22:47,717 --> 01:22:49,844
Cool.

1315
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:52,597
I was always kind of
a "C" student.

1316
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:55,225
So, did you do all this
just to have sex with me...

1317
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,602
or because you really care
about the wedding?

1318
01:22:57,727 --> 01:22:59,896
Both.

1319
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:04,150
And, uh...

1320
01:23:04,275 --> 01:23:06,152
I like you.

1321
01:23:06,277 --> 01:23:07,904
What?

1322
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:11,574
I like you.

1323
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:14,119
Well, that's an honest answer.

1324
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:16,162
I gotta go.

1325
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:25,630
Steve Stifler just gave
a rose to a girl and meant it.

1326
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:31,594
This is huge. It's... It's like watching
monkeys use tools for the first time.

1327
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:31,803
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1328
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:33,680
You still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1329
01:23:33,805 --> 01:23:35,682
No. Let's see.

1330
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:38,059
She wasn't into the heavy intellectual
stuff.

1331
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,854
She actually liked me
being that imbecile.

1332
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:45,066
No, no, somehow I think
she's probably better off with you.

1333
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,152
Thanks, shit-brick.

1334
01:23:49,112 --> 01:23:54,200
Ooh. Dick.
Fucking hate not hating you.

1335
01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:00,832
I did fuck your mom.

1336
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:04,210
Twice.

1337
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:08,256
Ooh! That's better, fucker!

1338
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:13,303
Oh. Whoa!
Ready to go?

1339
01:24:13,386 --> 01:24:16,056
Um, the wedding's
not for another hour.

1340
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,183
No, I mean you and me.

1341
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:20,310
Hold on. Hold on.

1342
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,520
Do I still gotta do
this bullshit meeting?

1343
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:24,731
Stifler, you are not
bailing on Jim.

1344
01:24:24,856 --> 01:24:27,567
Shit!
Give me 10 minutes?

1345
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:34,824
I'll meet you at the closet.
The closet.

1346
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:44,042
You wanted to see me,
Michelle?

1347
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,586
Oh! Okay, sit.

1348
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:52,676
So, uh, Jim said that you've always
kind of been there for him...

1349
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:55,887
when he needed you, so I thought
maybe you could help me.

1350
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:58,348
Jim said that?

1351
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:03,853
What's, uh...
What's the problem?

1352
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:07,899
Okay. Well, I, uh...

1353
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:09,943
I still can't get
my vows right.

1354
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:13,905
Oh. I haven't been this confused
since I got my first period.

1355
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:16,449
That's a very confusing time
for any young lady.

1356
01:25:16,574 --> 01:25:20,412
You know, your body
is going through, uh, changes.

1357
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:24,749
Um, stuff coming out,
stuff going in.

1358
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:28,962
Oh, no. I need help with my vows,
not my period.

1359
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:31,214
Oh, your vows.
Your vows.

1360
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:35,135
Yes, uh, good.
Um, go on.

1361
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,804
Jim just wants a groomsmen's meeting
before the wedding.

1362
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:42,726
It shouldn't take long.
Just don't let her talk to anyone.

1363
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:45,103
Be careful.
She's feisty.

1364
01:25:48,898 --> 01:25:50,859
Okay, let's go.

1365
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,611
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming out
here and meeting me.

1366
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:56,740
I, um... I just have a couple of things
I wanna say.

1367
01:25:56,865 --> 01:25:59,784
This sucks.

1368
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:04,706
Did I say that out loud?

1369
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,961
Keep going.
It's good.

1370
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:12,756
Now, I thought about
what you said, Kev.

1371
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:17,052
About, uh, about how my problems
always seem to work out.

1372
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:21,598
And I realized that the reason
things always work out...

1373
01:26:21,681 --> 01:26:25,810
is because you guys have always
been there to back me up.

1374
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,812
Even you, Stifler.

1375
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,193
For the first time in my life...

1376
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:38,031
I actually feel like
I can't mess anything up.

1377
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:43,161
Which is pretty amazing.

1378
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:45,538
So, uh,

1379
01:26:45,663 --> 01:26:49,876
l-I guess I just wanted
to say thank you.

1380
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:55,131
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks?

1381
01:26:55,256 --> 01:26:57,550
This whole thing
was about thanks?

1382
01:26:57,676 --> 01:26:59,969
Ooh! You're welcome,
cock-block!

1383
01:27:03,306 --> 01:27:05,725
That was good, Jim.
Real nice.

1384
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,061
Let's get you married.
Hmm?

1385
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:10,313
Okay.

1386
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:13,942
Love is very difficult
to describe.

1387
01:27:14,025 --> 01:27:16,903
And I understand the angst.
I mean, it's your wedding.

1388
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:19,823
And it's natural.
It's perfectly natural.

1389
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:22,909
But it's impossible
to describe a feeling.

1390
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:26,204
Okay, first,
nothing is impossible.

1391
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:28,832
So, let's not focus
on that.

1392
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:34,504
Why do you think, Michelle,
they call it "making love"?

1393
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,675
I don't know.
I just call it "boneing."

1394
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,512
Boneing.

1395
01:27:42,637 --> 01:27:45,890
Well, when you're doing
other things with Jim...

1396
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:48,518
when you're not,
um, boneing...

1397
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:50,562
how does
he make you feel?

1398
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:54,065
Horny, like I wanna bone.

1399
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:57,027
But we can't be boneing
from sunrise to sunset, dear.

1400
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,070
Oh, you've never tried it?

1401
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:03,158
I certainly have.
I have. I've boned.

1402
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:06,953
From sunrise right through brunch,
on more than one occasion.

1403
01:28:07,078 --> 01:28:11,875
But boneing aside, um, I think they call it
"making love"...

1404
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,295
because you have to
make love work.

1405
01:28:16,838 --> 01:28:19,716
You know,
it's about compromise and sacrifice.

1406
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:22,093
And I think Jim
has sacrificed for you.

1407
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:24,429
My God, he shaved
his entire pubic region,

1408
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:27,515
which would baffle most
cultures around the world.

1409
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,604
But he did it,
and he did it for you.

1410
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:37,859
You're right.
Love isn't just a feeling.

1411
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,986
It's shaving your balls.

1412
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:42,739
Thanks, Dad.

1413
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:47,911
I wouldn't get into too much detail
on that.

1414
01:28:48,036 --> 01:28:50,246
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

1415
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,248
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

1416
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:55,085
Gonna have sex with Cadence
Uh-huh.

1417
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:07,722
You know, son, I think this is probably
the right time to tell you that...

1418
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:13,853
that...
I know, Dad.

1419
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:26,658
I can't see anything here.

1420
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,163
Oh, there you are.

1421
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:37,002
Guys, what are you doing?
Where's Jim's grandma?

1422
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:39,421
The old bitch sucked.
We had to ditch her.

1423
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:41,589
You what?
Don't worry.

1424
01:29:41,673 --> 01:29:44,968
We put her someplace
no one will find her.

1425
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:49,055
Cadence, where are you going?
Oh, Mom.

1426
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:53,393
Oh, baby.
I'm so ready for this.

1427
01:29:56,062 --> 01:29:59,691
Your body's not quite what I was
expecting, but that's okay.

1428
01:29:59,816 --> 01:30:03,945
The Stif-man digs
what's underneath.

1429
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:09,242
Oh, you are so beautiful.
Oh, I just wanna...

1430
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:14,539
Stifler.! Granny.!

1431
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:17,834
Granny? What?
Focus! Focus! Focus!

1432
01:30:17,959 --> 01:30:20,962
Out...
It's not what it looks like!

1433
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:24,174
- Shut the fucking door!

1434
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:27,344
You got it, champ.

1435
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:51,076
You're a hero.

1436
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:54,621
Hey, pussy's pussy.

1437
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:59,042
Look at the smile
on my mother's face.

1438
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:02,045
Do you know how long she's been
waiting for a day like this?

1439
01:31:02,128 --> 01:31:04,464
I can't imagine.

1440
01:31:10,428 --> 01:31:12,931
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you.

1441
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:17,435
Don't.

1442
01:31:19,562 --> 01:31:22,273
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

1443
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:29,280
What made Grandma
come around?

1444
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:31,533
Finch said Stifler
talked to her.

1445
01:31:31,616 --> 01:31:34,244
Stifler?

1446
01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:38,248
Grandmother fucker.

1447
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:40,917
You're a motherfucker.

1448
01:31:41,042 --> 01:31:45,338
Yes, I am.
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1449
01:31:45,463 --> 01:31:49,968
And I promise to love you
for as long as I shall live.

1450
01:31:50,093 --> 01:31:53,972
Michelle, you are the one woman
I want to be with...

1451
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:56,766
and the woman
I can't be without.

1452
01:31:56,891 --> 01:31:58,852
I love you.

1453
01:31:58,977 --> 01:32:00,770
I love you.

1454
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:18,538
Jim,

1455
01:32:18,663 --> 01:32:22,709
I had trouble finding the words
to tell you how I feel.

1456
01:32:22,834 --> 01:32:25,045
And I realized something.

1457
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,173
Love isn't just a feeling.

1458
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:30,175
Love is something you do.

1459
01:32:31,676 --> 01:32:34,971
It's a dress,
a visit to band camp.

1460
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:38,308
A special haircut.

1461
01:32:38,391 --> 01:32:41,311
Jim, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted.

1462
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:43,897
And it is my solemn vow...

1463
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:46,649
to give everything I am to you.

1464
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:03,291
James Emanuel Levenstein...

1465
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,293
and Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

1466
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:08,380
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1467
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:10,965
You may kiss the bride.

1468
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:34,197
Let's all welcome Mr. And Mrs. Jim and
Michelle Levenstein onto the dance floor.

1469
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,033
Just follow my lead.
I'll try.

1470
01:34:06,396 --> 01:34:08,481
I taught him that.

1471
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:12,402
Jim, you learned to dance.

1472
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:57,989
Well, seems like everything worked out.
Magnificently.

1473
01:34:58,114 --> 01:35:02,952
I feel a bit sad that tonight our little
Michelle is going to be a woman.

1474
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:06,748
Honey, you don't honestly believe
that Michelle is still a...

1475
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:10,460
Well, I'll tell you, Mary. I can't recall a
single moment with either one of them...

1476
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:12,796
that would make me
think otherwise.

1477
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:14,673
Thank you. See?

1478
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,634
Whew! Whoa!

1479
01:35:24,849 --> 01:35:26,726
Hey, tough guy.

1480
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:29,145
Stifler's mom.

1481
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,191
Well, we meet again.

1482
01:35:33,316 --> 01:35:36,152
I was curious.
Didn't see you here.

1483
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:38,738
I try to keep a low profile.

1484
01:35:38,863 --> 01:35:41,658
I never really did
like these things anyway.

1485
01:35:41,741 --> 01:35:45,036
You know, this has actually
made quite an impression on me.

1486
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:47,997
I have something to look for
in a woman now.

1487
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:50,375
Well, if this is your idea
of a proposal...

1488
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,670
Finchy, you gotta know
that I'm over you now.

1489
01:35:53,753 --> 01:35:56,172
And I'm over you.

1490
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:59,801
But as they say,
we will always have Paris.

1491
01:35:59,926 --> 01:36:02,178
And the pool table.
And the car.

1492
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:05,682
And the two-room suite
I have upstairs. Come here.

1493
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:14,524
Turned out better
than I ever imagined.

1494
01:36:14,607 --> 01:36:18,361
How did a little perv like you
turn into such a great guy?

1495
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:21,865
How did a little nympho like you
turn into such a great girl?

1496
01:36:21,948 --> 01:36:24,868
I'm still a nympho.
Oh, I'm still a perv.

1497
01:36:24,951 --> 01:36:29,247
I know.
What's wrong with us?

1498
01:36:46,556 --> 01:36:48,558
You know, Michelle,

1499
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:52,103
to quote someone
I've learned quite a bit from,

1500
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:54,606
"I think you and I...

1501
01:36:54,689 --> 01:36:58,818
are a perfectly natural,
normal thing."

1502
01:36:59,986 --> 01:37:02,322
Perfectly natural.

1503
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:23,176
That's her.
Holy shit, dude.

1504
01:37:23,259 --> 01:37:25,428
I told you this wedding
would be worth it.

1505
01:37:25,553 --> 01:37:29,349
Oh, my goddess.
My queen. My MILF. Oh.

1506
01:37:29,432 --> 01:37:31,476
MILF. MILF.
MILF. MILF.

1507
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:33,478
MILF. MILF.

1508
01:37:47,742 --> 01:37:50,245
No way, bro!

1509
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:53,832
Hey, you're not finished yet,
are you, Finchy?

1510
01:37:53,915 --> 01:37:58,044
No, ma'am.
Just getting started.

1511
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:00,630
This guy is the fucking master.

1512
01:38:02,632 --> 01:38:04,551
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

1513
01:38:04,634 --> 01:38:06,886
Make it stop.

1514
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:09,931
Oh, Stifler's mom.

1515
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:11,224
Oh, Stifler's mom.
