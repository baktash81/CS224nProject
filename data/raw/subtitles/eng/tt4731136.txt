1
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,206
Son of a bitch!

2
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,730
No, we can't touch the munis.

3
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,411
We'll use them as collateral for
a leveraged equity position in Cisco.

4
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,801
Then I want you to take everything out of
First National and move it over to Banyon.

5
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,450
Wait, you mean Delaware?
I thought that was dead.

6
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,601
That's resurrected.

7
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
We need to clean up the
Reynolds account...

8
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,768
in case those fucks at AML
decide to do their job.

9
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Are you sure about this?

10
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,121
Nothing on email.

11
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,850
Move everything back on Monday.

12
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,561
You paying attention?

13
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,926
Yeah, yeah, I am.

14
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,684
- Tickets?
- I don't know if...

15
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,569
I'm sending the numbers through now.

16
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,960
What about Green?

17
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Uh, stall him. I don't give a shit.

18
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,201
Call in sick if you have to.

19
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,765
Business or pleasure?

20
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,604
I don't know. I just...

21
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,886
Seriously?

22
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,644
Look, I don't know
if I feel comfortable...

23
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,087
Josh! Josh! Stop being such a pussy.

24
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Just do what I tell you to do,
and call me when it's done.

25
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,923
To my fellow members of the board.

26
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,971
A man cannot unsee the truth.

27
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,521
He cannot willingly return to darkness...

28
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,650
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

29
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,286
any more than he can be unborn.

30
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,241
We are the only species
capable of self-reflection.

31
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
The only species
with the toxin of self-doubt

32
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,882
written into our genetic code.

33
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Unequal to our gifts, we build,

34
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,644
we buy, we consume.

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,404
We wrap ourselves in the illusion
of material success.

36
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,484
We cheat and deceive as we claw our way...

37
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,883
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement.

38
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,484
Superiority to other men.

39
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,005
Corner office.

40
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Who'd you have to blow?

41
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,609
I heard he closed the Reynolds account.

42
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,245
How exactly did you do that?

43
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,606
Just that good, I guess.

44
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,290
Don't forget about us little people.

45
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,926
Oh, how could I?

46
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,290
You know how I take my coffee.

47
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,525
Excuse me, but they wanna see you
upstairs in the partners boardroom.

48
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,970
Tell them I'll be right there.

49
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,202
Oh, and tomorrow
is your mother's birthday.

50
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,050
Get her something for me, would you?

51
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,611
Of course.

52
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,926
There is a sickness inside us.

53
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,763
Rising like the bile that leaves that
bitter taste at the back of our throats.

54
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,523
It's there in every one of you
seated around the table.

55
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,203
We deny its existence until one day
the body rebels against the mind...

56
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,760
and screams out,

57
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,171
"I am not a well man."

58
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,281
No doubt you will think
only of the merger.

59
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,208
That unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions.

60
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,843
But the truth cannot be ignored.

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,402
For only when we know what ails us
can we hope to find the cure.

62
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,844
I will not return.

63
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,088
Do not attempt to contact me again.

64
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,402
Sincerely, Roland E. Pembroke.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,525
Well, Mr. Lockhart...

66
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,849
what do you make of that?

67
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,889
Clearly, he's lost his mind.

68
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,451
Our thoughts exactly.

69
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,769
Man goes for a two-week spa vacation,
and has a complete mental breakdown.

70
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,561
Who the hell takes the waters
in the 21 st century anyway?

71
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,246
I trust you understand the sensitivity

72
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,522
of some of the information in that letter.

73
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,605
So it's true.

74
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,923
A merger of this kind will make us...

75
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,171
one of the biggest financial service firms
on the Eastern Seaboard.

76
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,926
Something that stands to
enrich everyone in this room.

77
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,246
Including you.

78
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,731
We hear good things.

79
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,690
Your work on the Reynolds
account was inspired.

80
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,240
Of course, the SEC will want

81
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,891
unfettered access to our books.

82
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,044
Any irregularities are sure to come out.

83
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,606
You didn't really think
we wouldn't find out?

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,809
I don't know what you're talking about.

85
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,484
You think there's a trick
you can pull we haven't tried?

86
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,486
This is amateur.

87
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,723
Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?

88
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,728
You ever have a 12-inch
black dick in your ass?

89
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,921
Prison, Mr. Lockhart.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,411
You're in a lot of trouble.

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,282
If that were the case,
you would have already turned me in.

92
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,809
So, my guess is the SEC
is after someone a little more senior.

93
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,489
Someone on the board, perhaps.

94
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,644
Or someone who's clearly unstable.

95
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,288
We'd like you to go to Switzerland
and bring Mr. Pembroke back to us.

96
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,487
You see...

97
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,001
the merger cannot go through
without Mr. Pembroke signing off...

98
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,960
on certain legal matters.

99
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,771
I don't have the relationship
with Mr. Pembroke that Morris had.

100
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
Fuck Morris.

101
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,167
Now, Morris was a good salesman,
dependable family man.

102
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,725
God rest his soul.

103
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,086
But he didn't have vision.

104
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,925
Someone has to take responsibility.

105
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,005
Josh, it's me again.

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,764
In an hour and a half, the Nikkei closes.

107
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,047
When it does, I want you to empty
Banyon and buy puts in Glenco.

108
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm sending the details over now.

109
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,527
And fucking call me back.

110
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,682
I don't like leaving messages like this.

111
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,044
You're here for the cure?

112
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,249
No, I'm just visiting.

113
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,761
You mind?

114
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,441
Go ahead.

115
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,448
You're younger than most of my passengers.

116
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,882
Do a lot of driving for the sanitarium?

117
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,326
All the driving.

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,887
Every week, I pick up
rich people from the train...

119
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,769
and take them up the mountain.

120
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,922
Only rich people, huh?

121
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,809
Must be expensive.

122
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,361
Well, wealthy people
have wealthy problems.

123
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,522
Me, I'm happy with a simple life.

124
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
That's it? No ambition?

125
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,888
Just drive people
up and down the mountain?

126
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,204
Most people tend to stay.

127
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,647
Why's that?

128
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,085
I guess they like it there.

129
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,241
Oh, shit.

130
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,327
I don't go in for spas
and that kind of thing.

131
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,204
I work for a living,
like my father before me.

132
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,080
A son learns what it is to
be a man from his father.

133
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,321
Am I right?

134
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,446
I wouldn't know.

135
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,681
I didn't grow up with my father.

136
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,962
How long will you be gone?

137
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Just a few days. It's business.

138
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,969
You don't look well.

139
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,883
I'm fine. I just haven't been
sleeping much.

140
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,883
You need to rest.

141
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,605
You know, I always
told your father to rest...

142
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,721
but he wouldn't listen.

143
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,120
He was weak.

144
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,126
You didn't know him.

145
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,770
And whose fault is that?

146
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,605
So, are you happy here?

147
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,245
Are they taking good care of you?

148
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,961
People come here to die.
Why would I be happy?

149
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,043
I'm getting a promotion.

150
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,291
So, when I get back

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,129
I'll be able to move you
to somewhere better.

152
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,328
Somewhere near the beach or something.

153
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
You won't come back.

154
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,130
Of course I will.

155
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,205
Another ballerina?

156
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,209
She's not like the others.

157
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,646
Why's that?

158
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,922
She lives in a dream.

159
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,724
But she's dancing.

160
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,682
That's because she doesn't
know she's dreaming.

161
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,164
Friendly bunch.

162
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,606
Yeah.

163
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
There's always been bad blood

164
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,920
between the villagers
and the people on the hill.

165
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,401
Why's that?

166
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,286
History.

167
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,163
How old is this place?

168
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,607
Foundations date back
to the time of the barons.

169
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,367
For centuries, all this land
and everyone in it...

170
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,010
belonged to one family.

171
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,648
The Von Reichmerls.

172
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,325
What happened to them?

173
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,690
Hmm. Interesting story.

174
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Apparently, the last baron

175
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,764
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline...

176
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
he decided only his sister

177
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,688
was clean enough to carry his child.

178
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,844
When the church forbade
the union, he renounced God.

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,440
That must have gone over well.

180
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,567
No shit.

181
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,244
So on his wedding night...

182
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,970
the villagers came up the hill...

183
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,122
chased the Baron and his bride
into the catacombs...

184
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,931
and made him watch
while they burned her alive.

185
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,321
Then they burned
the whole place to the ground.

186
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,642
That's a hell of a story.

187
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,321
Yeah.

188
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,889
But that was 200 years ago.

189
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,168
A lot's changed since then.

190
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,565
20 minutes max.

191
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,165
No hurry.

192
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,726
Welcome!

193
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,961
May I help you?

194
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,970
I'm here to see a guest.
Mr. Roland Pembroke.

195
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,889
I'm sorry, but visiting hours
are over for the day.

196
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,926
I've come a long way.

197
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,287
Maybe you could make an exception.

198
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,090
There are no exceptions.

199
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,526
Is there a manager I could speak to?

200
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,130
Sign here.

201
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,281
Please.

202
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,089
Thank you, Mr. Lockhart.

203
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,969
I'll see what I can do.

204
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,602
You won't get any service here.

205
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,091
Part of the treatment.

206
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,526
You get used to it.

207
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,331
What's a ten-letter word for amnesty?

208
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,481
No idea.

209
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,766
Exemption.

210
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,724
Nope. That's only nine.

211
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,251
Absolution.

212
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,361
Yes!

213
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,330
You like puzzles?

214
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,921
Not really.

215
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,007
You mind?

216
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,481
Thank you.

217
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,647
I believe the reception nurse explained...

218
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,009
that visiting hours end
at 3:00 p.m. precisely.

219
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,728
She did. But as I'm sure you're aware...

220
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,560
Mr. Pembroke remains the CEO

221
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,449
of a major financial institution.

222
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,800
Under the circumstances,

223
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,410
I was hoping you can make an...

224
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,365
exception.

225
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,921
Vitamins.

226
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,604
If we are to help the people
that come here...

227
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,802
we must keep up our strength.

228
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,009
May one ask what it is concerning?

229
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,605
It's a business matter.

230
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,884
I'm not at liberty to say
any more than that.

231
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,200
Of course. And I hope you understand

232
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,089
that we also have our rules.

233
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,561
Our treatments here are most effective...

234
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,240
when exposure to the stresses

235
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,810
of the modern world is strictly limited.

236
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,689
Director Volmer is quite firm on that.

237
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,001
Hydrotherapy?

238
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,161
That is correct.

239
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,482
That's a long way to come just for water.

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,482
The sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer...

241
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,531
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities.

242
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,241
Rebuilt.

243
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,929
After the fire.

244
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,761
Yes.

245
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,282
History is full of darkness.

246
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,722
If you would like to leave a note...

247
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,770
I'd happily pass it along to Mr. Pembroke.

248
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,571
Mr. Pieterson?

249
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,210
I understand the work
you do here is important...

250
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,250
and you're obviously a very busy man.

251
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,680
But if you wouldn't mind
finding time between

252
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,569
administering aqua aerobics
and Jacuzzis...

253
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,688
to inform Mr. Pembroke he has a visitor...

254
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,168
with information of the utmost
urgency to him personally...

255
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,685
I'd be grateful.

256
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,440
On the other hand, if you
want me to write a note...

257
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,640
so you can slip it under his door
with his breakfast tray...

258
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,281
on the off-chance he notices it
before his morning rubdown...

259
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,209
I'm afraid that's not gonna cut it.

260
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,761
You see, I just traveled
4,000 miles to get here.

261
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,649
There's a red-eye going back
to New York tonight...

262
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,531
and I intend Mr. Pembroke
and I to be on it.

263
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,129
You plan to take Mr. Pembroke
back to New York with you?

264
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,645
Is that a problem?

265
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,282
Of course, it is entirely
up to Mr. Pembroke.

266
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,410
He's a patient, not a prisoner.

267
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,207
He'll be in treatment until after 7:00.

268
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,880
If you'd like to come back then,
I'll make sure he's available.

269
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,049
Thank you for your understanding.

270
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,925
Leaving already?

271
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
What a nice-looking young man.

272
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,040
Where's your friend?

273
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,121
What time's the last train to Zurich?

274
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Not till 10:00.

275
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,288
Get me to a hotel. I gotta make a call.

276
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,761
Pretty girl.

277
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,881
What the fuck!

278
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,243
How long will you be gone?

279
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,730
Just a few days.

280
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,002
Are we waiting for someone else?

281
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,523
There is no one else.

282
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,450
Sleep well?

283
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,841
Uh...

284
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,447
I can't remember having slept better.

285
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,601
It's the mountain air.

286
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,767
Mr. Lockhart...

287
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,450
my name is Henrich Volmer.

288
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,443
I am the director of the sanitarium here.

289
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,850
How long have I been here?

290
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,047
Three days.

291
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,801
Oh, Jesus!

292
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,288
You can count yourself lucky.
It was a clean break.

293
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,841
Although I do feel partly responsible.

294
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,321
The locals tell me I should hunt
the deer on the property...

295
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
but I can't bring myself to harm
the innocent creatures.

296
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,891
After all, they were here long before us.

297
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,205
I need to call New York.

298
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
I took the liberty
of informing your office

299
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,082
of the accident, if that's your concern.

300
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,163
They agreed with me...

301
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,927
that business can wait
and your health cannot.

302
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,727
Hank Green said that?

303
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,280
Even the acting head

304
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,044
of a major Wall Street finance firm...

305
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,002
can't argue with the consequences
of a serious car accident.

306
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,685
We don't get many visitors here.

307
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,843
Most of my patients have done
extraordinary things.

308
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,163
Built vast fortunes...

309
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,243
commanded great empires...

310
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,889
but at a terrible cost.

311
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,522
They have no one who cares for them.

312
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,684
Mr. Pembroke is lucky.

313
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,126
He has you.

314
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,722
So, do your best to relax.

315
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,201
Enjoy yourself.

316
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,769
You are at the foot of the Swiss Alps...

317
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,281
one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

318
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,205
Think of it as an enforced vacation.

319
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,440
Although I know you Americans

320
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,727
are not so good at vacations, are you?

321
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,363
And remember, you're at altitude.

322
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,124
It can take a while to acclimatize...

323
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,250
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water.

324
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,885
Believe me, you're in good hands.

325
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,081
Are you lost?

326
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,088
Uh... Yeah.

327
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,606
I guess so.

328
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,410
Where is it you're supposed to be?

329
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,606
I don't know.

330
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,081
Name?

331
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,560
Pembroke.

332
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,605
Roland Pembroke.

333
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,841
Here it is.

334
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,641
Pembroke. Room 609. Steam bath.

335
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,444
Of course.

336
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,764
Mr. Pembroke...

337
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,922
the steam baths are in that direction.

338
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,124
You can't go in there.

339
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,965
Not like that.

340
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,205
Pembroke?

341
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,367
It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?

342
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,525
Do I know you?

343
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,411
My name is Lockhart. Mr. Green sent me.

344
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,489
I thought they'd send Morris.

345
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,091
Morris is dead.

346
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,560
Heart attack.

347
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,766
Mr. Pembroke, I've come to
bring you back to New York.

348
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,680
You want me to leave here?

349
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,251
Just for a few days.

350
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm afraid I can't do that.

351
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,401
Why not?

352
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,361
I'm not well.

353
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,691
You look all right to me.

354
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,251
That's because you are blind.

355
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,611
As I was.

356
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,209
But soon you'll see.

357
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,204
Rest assured,
they'll take good care of you here.

358
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm not a patient.

359
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,129
What happened to your leg?

360
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,490
Mr. Pembroke, the situation in New York

361
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,647
is really quite serious.

362
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,404
No longer my concern.

363
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,601
The director says
I must not involve myself

364
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,085
in business matters.

365
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,484
Have you met Director Volmer?

366
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,561
This morning.

367
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,643
He is a great man.

368
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,451
Kind man.

369
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,568
Not like other doctors.

370
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,721
Mr. Pembroke...

371
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,928
This obsession with blood.

372
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,890
You see, they have it all wrong.

373
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,082
Do you know the body is 65% water?

374
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,083
It's our fluids that must be purified.

375
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,402
Word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked.

376
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,721
The share price is in free fall.

377
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,966
Lockhart?

378
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,811
You're not any relation
to Henry Lockhart, are you?

379
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,081
My father.

380
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,090
You knew him?

381
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,249
We started out together.

382
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,442
Terrible, what happened to him.

383
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,605
They said there was a boy left in the car.

384
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,487
I don't remember much, to be honest.

385
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,002
He didn't deserve what we did to him.

386
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,451
What do you mean?

387
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,284
He was an honest man.

388
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,967
And we destroyed him for it.

389
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,124
Well, people get fucked over every day.

390
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,965
Either you have what it takes
to survive, or you don't.

391
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,811
And I suppose you do.

392
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,328
Is that why you came all this way?

393
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,851
Ambition?

394
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,526
Then you have it worse than any of us.

395
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,845
What's that?

396
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,121
The sickness.

397
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,841
Your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us.

398
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,970
The pointlessness of the entire endeavor.

399
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,481
We've all done terrible things.

400
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,808
So many terrible things.

401
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,446
What's it trading at?

402
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,006
What?

403
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,202
The stock! What's it trading at?

404
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,091
Eight and a half at close on Friday.

405
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,201
Parasites.

406
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,362
It'll be lower by now.

407
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,807
We're all concerned for your
well-being, Mr. Pembroke.

408
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
Mmm.

409
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,043
Just a few days.

410
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
There are certain irregularities
in some of the accounts...

411
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,525
that need to be clarified before

412
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,801
the merger can be completed.

413
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,929
And I suppose someone
has to take responsibility.

414
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,051
Something like that.

415
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,048
Then I better get my things.

416
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,041
I need a car to take me to the station.

417
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,404
Will you call one for me, please?

418
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,130
I'll see what I can do.

419
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,048
That's where the baron hung the priest.

420
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,043
- What's that?
- See?

421
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,325
The church would have been
right over there...

422
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,400
where that funny little building is now.

423
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,527
I'm sure of it.

424
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,044
People used to come from miles around...

425
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,168
for the miracles attributed
to the holy water.

426
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,641
Guess some things don't change.

427
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,801
How marvelous.

428
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,207
Terrible thing, though. Such violence.

429
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,647
That's what you get
for marrying your sister.

430
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,051
Sister?

431
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,282
Yeah, it was all about
a pure bloodline, wasn't it?

432
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,685
How fascinating!

433
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,841
I must look into that.

434
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,126
Glad to see you're back on your feet!

435
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,804
We heard about the accident.

436
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,166
You're American, aren't you, Mister...

437
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,401
Lockhart.

438
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,528
Frank Hill. Stockholm.

439
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,682
And this is Mr. Nair from London.

440
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,171
Bombay, originally.

441
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,484
I see you've met Mrs. Watkins,
our amateur historian.

442
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,926
Yes, of course. How rude.

443
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,003
Victoria Watkins. 40 years at Xerox.

444
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,400
Why don't you pull up a chair?

445
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,005
We need a fourth.

446
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,083
Careful. Like most Brahmins, he cheats.

447
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,208
Coming from a venture capitalist,

448
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,606
I take that as a compliment.

449
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,160
Actually, I was just on my way back

450
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,401
to New York with Mr. Pembroke.

451
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,841
Then he's...

452
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,921
He's feeling better?

453
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,045
Well enough.

454
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,371
I suppose that's wonderful news.

455
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,849
Isn't that right, Mr. Nair?

456
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,210
Wonderful news.

457
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,566
Mrs. Watkins...

458
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,127
time for your treatment.

459
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,361
Yes, of course.

460
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,247
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lockhart.

461
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,606
Safe travels.

462
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,529
Something in the water?

463
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,204
At the bottom.

464
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,441
I don't see anything.

465
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,880
Did it hurt?

466
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,611
Can't remember.

467
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,611
Better that way.

468
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,005
I saw you.

469
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,290
Before.

470
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,450
Are you a patient here?

471
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,000
It's just, you're so much younger

472
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,286
than everyone else.

473
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,204
Director Volmer says I'm a special case.

474
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,125
What about you?

475
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,605
Are you here for the cure?

476
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,246
No.

477
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,965
Actually, I was just leaving.

478
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,565
No one ever leaves.

479
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,570
What are you talking about?

480
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,523
Why would anyone want to?

481
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,163
Yeah, I see your point.

482
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,962
Did you get what you came for?

483
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,521
Well, I came to bring
someone back to New York.

484
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,645
So, yeah. I did.

485
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,410
Does he want to go?

486
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,926
Not really.

487
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,403
That song you were singing.

488
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,006
Where did you learn that?

489
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,885
I have to go now.

490
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,283
What's your name?

491
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,126
Hannah.

492
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,525
Mr. Pembroke?

493
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,643
Where's Pembroke?

494
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,610
The patient that was
in this room, where is he?

495
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,923
I thought you were Pembroke.

496
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,040
Do you know what they used to recommend

497
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,804
for the common stomach ailment?

498
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,042
The application of leeches.

499
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,682
Based on the diagnosis,
I always pitied the leech.

500
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,562
Mmm. Mr. Lockhart...

501
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,245
please, won't you join us?

502
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,760
The sturgeon is excellent,

503
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,808
unless of course you prefer the venison.

504
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,724
I couldn't let it go to waste.

505
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,970
Where's Pembroke?

506
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,448
Mr. Pembroke has unfortunately
taken a turn for the worse.

507
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,046
I fear your conversation
about business matters...

508
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,964
has set him back somewhat.

509
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,960
But, no matter. We have moved him on

510
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,201
to the next stage of treatment.

511
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,646
He looked all right to me.

512
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,126
But you're not a doctor.

513
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,282
Maybe it's time for a second opinion.

514
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,602
That, of course, is up to Mr. Pembroke.

515
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,404
And he's not available.

516
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,244
Ever since I got here...

517
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,448
you people have been
giving me the runaround.

518
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,449
I would ask you please
to keep your voice down.

519
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,961
We wouldn't wanna upset
the clientele, would we?

520
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,960
Mr. Lockhart, giving you the runaround

521
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,724
is the furthest thing from my mind.

522
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,168
My sole concern is for
the welfare of my patients.

523
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,806
It's bad for business if
people start getting better.

524
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,530
Am I right?

525
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,523
What are you implying, Mr. Lockhart?

526
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,160
Old people paying through
the teeth for what? Water?

527
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,810
What's your overhead anyway?

528
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,570
That is not your concern.

529
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,609
I don't wanna have to
get lawyers involved...

530
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,603
but I came to get Pembroke
back to New York...

531
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,240
and that's what I'm gonna do,
if I have to hit him over his head...

532
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,368
and drag him out by his hair.

533
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,844
Are you feeling all right,
Mr. Lockhart? You seem pale.

534
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,845
I'm fine.

535
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,321
You're bleeding.

536
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,681
What?

537
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,370
Perhaps you should sit down.

538
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,682
No signs of concussion.

539
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,403
Any headaches, hallucinations?

540
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,006
No.

541
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,041
You may dress.

542
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,609
Are you drinking the water?

543
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,441
Yes.

544
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,840
Good.

545
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,246
Make sure you do.

546
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,801
I took the liberty of running a few tests

547
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,046
after the accident.

548
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,161
Hannah.

549
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,161
Isn't it?

550
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,881
Yes.

551
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,210
She's a very special case.

552
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,328
What does that mean exactly?

553
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,400
She was exposed to serious trauma

554
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,641
when she was very young.

555
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,643
Her development was delayed.

556
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,603
Hannah did not utter a word
until she was 11 years old.

557
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,364
Please understand...

558
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,931
Mr. Lockhart...

559
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,565
she is like a daughter to me.

560
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,563
But we're here to discuss you.

561
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,402
An imbalance in your fluids.

562
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,562
Strain to the major organs.

563
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,484
Depleted immune system.

564
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,520
Many indicators that you have in common

565
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,840
with most of my patients...

566
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,409
but I will confess
I have never seen a case...

567
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,961
as advanced as this...

568
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,848
in someone so young.

569
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,605
Is that right?

570
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,169
Tell me, Mr. Lockhart...

571
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,285
when was the last time
that you actually felt well?

572
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,247
Before you came here,
when was the last time...

573
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,767
that you even slept through the night?

574
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,641
The mind may lie...

575
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,644
but the body cannot.

576
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,162
I should like to help you.

577
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,321
What we offer here...

578
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,484
is a simple process of purification.

579
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,090
Away from pressures of the modern world.

580
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,041
A return to a simpler time.

581
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,851
Mr. Pembroke will not be ready
to travel for a day or two.

582
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,926
And if you're willing...

583
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,606
I would like to recommend a treatment.

584
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,924
I can speak to the duty nurse...

585
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,651
and we may be able to start
as early as this evening.

586
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,768
If you think it's necessary.

587
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,161
Good.

588
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,881
Greta?

589
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,927
Greta?

590
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,042
You're in luck, Mr. Lockhart.

591
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,883
We can get you in right away.

592
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,646
"VR."

593
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,721
Von Reichmerl.

594
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,201
It was found during the reconstruction.

595
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,008
Then it belong to the baron?

596
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,447
The baroness, actually.

597
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,568
Vanessa Von Reichmerl.

598
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,404
She was sickly.

599
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,248
The Baron was obsessed
with finding a cure.

600
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,960
It was he, in fact, who first discovered

601
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,042
the medicinal properties of our water.

602
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,608
He sacrificed everything.

603
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,202
He must have loved her very much.

604
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,846
Yes.

605
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,091
Like a sister.

606
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,681
History is right, of course,
to judge him on moral grounds.

607
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,121
But, as a man of science...

608
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,209
I can't help but admire him.

609
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,848
The duty nurse will escort you
to our isolation wing.

610
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,361
Thank you.

611
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,521
Mr. Lockhart...

612
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,730
If you wouldn't mind.

613
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,330
Just so we can keep an eye
on your progress.

614
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,285
Are you ready, Mr. Lockhart?

615
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,330
Then let us begin.

616
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,602
Life on this planet first came from water.

617
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,484
We spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged...

618
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,047
our bodies mostly liquid.

619
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,800
This sensory deprivation chamber

620
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,166
simulates a return...

621
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,322
to that embryonic state.

622
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,484
Think of it as a cleansing of the mind...

623
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,290
as much as the body.

624
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,481
Some patients experience
increased heart rate...

625
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,130
visions...

626
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,250
even primal memories.

627
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
But rest assured,

628
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,131
it's just the toxins leaving the system.

629
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,290
Give yourself over completely
to the process...

630
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,601
and you will see the results.

631
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,846
Keep a close eye on him.

632
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,001
Yes, sir.

633
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,961
Mr. Lockhart...

634
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,282
the treatment lasts 30 minutes.

635
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,480
I'll be monitoring you from here.

636
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,560
If you have any issues...

637
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,404
just tap on the side of the tank.

638
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,727
Get back!

639
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,046
In the last five days, a total collapse.

640
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,044
The Dow plunging over 508 points...

641
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,521
as panic spread throughout Wall Street...

642
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,126
wiping out more than
one-third of the gains...

643
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,044
from this rare, five-year bull market.

644
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,851
More than half of that
in a single trading day.

645
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,810
Chairman of New York
Stock Exchange, John Phelan...

646
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,962
tried to reassure investors.

647
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,281
Dad?

648
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,967
Dad!

649
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,449
Mr. Lockhart, are you all right?

650
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,601
Get off me.

651
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,881
Try to stay calm.

652
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,080
I'm terribly sorry.

653
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,321
Something must have
gone wrong with the machine.

654
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,880
There's something in the water.

655
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,923
There's something in the fucking water.

656
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,646
There is nothing in the water,
Mr. Lockhart.

657
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,729
But I saw them.

658
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,120
As the Director explained...

659
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,000
some patients experience visions

660
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,411
with this particular treatment.

661
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,001
Just the toxins leaving the body.

662
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,162
It's all part of the cure.

663
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,682
You need to rest now.

664
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,524
I will help you to your room.

665
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,360
Got you.

666
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,201
Morning, Lockhart.

667
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,161
Feeling better?

668
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,210
Joining us for breakfast?

669
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,850
The kedgeree is excellent.

670
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,411
I'm not hungry.

671
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,210
You must keep up your strength.

672
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,727
Mrs. Watkins?

673
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,082
That building where the church
used to be...

674
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,011
What's it used for now?

675
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,971
I couldn't say.

676
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,202
You were right about
the baron and his sister.

677
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,289
But that's not the reason
the villagers burned the place down.

678
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,408
It was on account of the experiments.

679
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,401
Some sort of medical experiments.

680
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,163
Apparently performed on his own peasants.

681
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,970
People went missing.

682
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,201
And then...

683
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,762
Im Jahre 1814...

684
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,244
farmers, tilling their fields,
stumbled on human bodies...

685
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,607
disfigured and emaciated.

686
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,528
Dried up like the mummies of Egypt.

687
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,604
He was looking for a cure.

688
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,603
- A cure?
- For the baroness.

689
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,205
She was sick.

690
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,210
Oh, I see.

691
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,086
I knew you liked puzzles.

692
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,531
Of course.

693
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,361
Mrs. Watkins...

694
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,485
time for your treatment.

695
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,681
Are you certain?

696
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,723
I just had one this morning.
I'm sure of it.

697
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,963
I have you on the schedule.

698
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,644
I must not be feeling myself today.

699
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,122
There is a terrible darkness here.

700
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,166
What is this place?

701
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,167
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

702
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,845
I thought I saw you with a patient.

703
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,482
No. Patient.

704
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,361
Okay.

705
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,521
Thank you.

706
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,441
Going for a swim?

707
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,203
I'm not supposed to.

708
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,681
Why's that?

709
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,047
On the account of my condition.

710
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,809
Thought the water made you better.

711
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,841
Told you. I'm a special case.

712
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,841
Right.

713
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,530
How far is it to town?

714
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,723
A few miles, I think.

715
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,403
Are you going to walk all the way?

716
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,768
Unless you wanna lend me your bike.

717
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,604
What will you give me?

718
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,050
It was my mother's.

719
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,004
Her eyes are closed.

720
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,285
Yeah, she's dreaming.
She just doesn't know it.

721
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,401
What happens if she wakes up?

722
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,846
I don't know.

723
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,848
My mother never finished the story.

724
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,886
So, we got a deal?

725
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,527
How will you ride it?

726
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,043
Maybe you could come along.

727
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,808
I'm not supposed to.

728
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,771
You always do what you're supposed to do?

729
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,967
It's okay.

730
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,361
Coming?

731
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,605
Want a beer or something?

732
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,886
I don't know. Do I?

733
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,325
I don't know what you want.

734
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,248
All right. If you're having one.

735
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,961
Still here?

736
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,447
Thought you were just visiting.

737
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,244
You've looked better.

738
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,451
Same to you.

739
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,446
How's the car?

740
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,563
That car was a piece of shit.

741
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,805
Sanitarium offered me enough
to buy a new one.

742
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,325
So, gracias a Dios.

743
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,642
Everything happens for a reason, right?

744
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,126
You drink too much.

745
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,042
I hope you're not driving.

746
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,602
You two are from up on the hill?

747
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,681
That's right.

748
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,040
We don't get many patients down here.

749
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,004
Good kids at heart.

750
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,571
Just weren't raised properly.

751
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,682
No respect for tradition.

752
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,923
Know if there's a doctor in town?

753
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,723
All the doctors are up on the hill.

754
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,405
A pharmacist?

755
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,085
Something like that?

756
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,720
There's Pieter. Over the road.

757
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,930
He a doctor?

758
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,769
Close enough.

759
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,046
Don't you like it?

760
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,205
No.

761
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,408
What, you never had a beer before?

762
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,728
How long have you been at the sanitarium?

763
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,167
Since I can remember.

764
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,845
What about your family?

765
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,486
My mother died in a fire when I was young.

766
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,480
Director Volmer says that
my father will come for me

767
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,800
when I'm better.

768
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,811
Does he visit?

769
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,929
He'll come when I'm better.

770
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,848
- Vitamins?
- Mmm-hmm.

771
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,365
Can I try?

772
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,481
Um...

773
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,287
Okay.

774
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,320
Ugh.

775
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,407
Tastes like sweaty seafood.

776
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,123
You get used to it. Eventually.

777
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,849
Will you be okay here for a few minutes?

778
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,960
I just have to go see about something.

779
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,883
But I won't be long.

780
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,368
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

781
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,406
Hello?

782
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,003
Do you know if there's a doctor here?

783
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,291
What's that you're drawing?

784
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,970
He won't talk to you.

785
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,169
Doesn't know how.

786
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,927
That's the castle...

787
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,843
when they burned it down.

788
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,442
My grandson, Wilmosh.

789
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,887
He likes ghost stories.

790
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,644
What can I do for you?

791
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,846
Could you take a look at this,
tell me what it says?

792
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,481
Human?

793
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,886
That's right.

794
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,121
Not my line.

795
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,406
I'll pay you.

796
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,126
How much is this?

797
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,281
Not much.

798
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,571
But enough.

799
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,041
Got a tampon?

800
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,689
My friend's time of the month.

801
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,961
Freak.

802
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,685
So is he fit to travel?

803
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,568
He's not a well man.

804
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,802
Some of those are
dental records, aren't they?

805
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,170
- That's right.
- What do they mean?

806
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,288
His teeth are falling out.

807
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,770
What could cause something like that?

808
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,007
Barring any pre-existing
condition, I'd say...

809
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,003
chronic dehydration.

810
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,530
Dehydration?

811
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,528
All they do up there is drink water.

812
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,889
I'm not a doctor.

813
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,326
Now, if you'll excuse me...

814
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,005
Wait a second.

815
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,883
The baron's experiments.

816
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,724
They found bodies in the fields, right?

817
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,803
Dried up like mummies.

818
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,883
Maybe there's some kind of connection.

819
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,240
The baron was burned alive

820
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,765
on his wedding night 200 years ago.

821
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,611
Yeah, but this is happening now.

822
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,046
People come here for the cure.

823
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
That's what the baron was looking for.

824
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,241
His wife was sick.

825
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,805
She wasn't sick.

826
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,049
She was infertile.

827
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,803
They tried for years.

828
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,681
But the baroness could not
carry a child to term.

829
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,360
They say her body rejected the fetuses

830
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,680
because they were deformed.

831
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,322
Now, you must excuse me.

832
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,811
I have to put this animal
out of its misery.

833
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,083
What's wrong with it?

834
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,369
Wandered off where
it wasn't supposed to be.

835
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,965
Broke its leg.

836
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,121
Like you.

837
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,361
Found it trapped in a drainage ditch...

838
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,565
drinking sewage water.

839
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,928
I need to make a phone call.
Long distance.

840
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,320
Your credit card.

841
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,450
Lockhart.

842
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,681
Mr. Green.

843
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,205
Where the hell have you been?

844
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,686
I have a question.

845
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,808
Did Pembroke have
any pre-existing conditions?

846
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,961
What are you talking about?

847
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,240
Before he got here.

848
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,641
Any medical conditions? Was he sick?

849
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,640
No. The guy is a fucking health nut.

850
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,643
Drank kale for Christ's sake.

851
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,800
Now what the fuck is going on?

852
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,211
You were supposed to be here
four days ago.

853
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,850
Yeah. But there was an accident.

854
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,641
What accident?

855
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,727
What?

856
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,602
I don't understand.
They said they called you.

857
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,445
Nobody called.

858
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,324
Are you sure about that?

859
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,403
Lockhart, do I have to reiterate to you...

860
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,523
the importance of what
you've been sent there to do?

861
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,968
Get Pembroke on a plane
within the next 24 hours...

862
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,282
or this whole place goes ass over tits.

863
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,766
And you with it. Understand me?

864
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,841
Lockhart?

865
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,201
Lockhart!

866
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,610
- I need to speak with you
- Hey, hey, hey.

867
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,280
You said no one ever leaves.
What does that mean?

868
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,407
You're hurting me.

869
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,369
- What happens to them?
- Please let me go.

870
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,965
Why won't they let me see Pembroke?

871
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,120
You know something, don't you?

872
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,247
No.

873
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,728
What is this stuff?
What makes you special?

874
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,330
Fuck off, Adolf!

875
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,121
Hey!

876
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,486
- Come on.
- No!

877
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,411
- I paid for this dance.
- No!

878
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,640
Let her go!

879
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,768
Go back to the sanitarium, cripple.

880
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,247
No!

881
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,769
No! Please, stop!

882
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,366
I am not a patient.

883
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,886
Hannah.

884
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,041
Hannah.

885
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,283
She may look like a woman...

886
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,251
but she's just a child.

887
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,409
Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart...

888
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,731
is the great enemy of science.

889
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,849
I wanna see Pembroke.

890
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,800
And you will.

891
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,890
Coming, Mr. Lockhart?

892
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,241
Nothing happened.

893
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,004
That's because I arrived when I did.

894
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,330
Lockhart was there.

895
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,289
With a knife to his throat.

896
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,566
Hannah...

897
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,449
Mr. Lockhart is not able
to look after himself,

898
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,641
let alone you.

899
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,609
He can't protect you the way I can.

900
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't need protecting.

901
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,360
Of course you do.

902
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,530
We were just having fun.

903
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,044
He's not like the others.

904
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,491
He's young.

905
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,601
What?

906
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,444
- What is it?
- Nothing.

907
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,601
- Let me see.
- No.

908
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,841
I'm your doctor. Come here.

909
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,166
No! Don't touch me!

910
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,884
When will I be ready?

911
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,207
Soon.

912
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,761
When?

913
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,680
Patience.

914
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,886
Come here.

915
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,730
I said, come here.

916
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,850
Now, haven't I always looked after you?

917
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,927
Soon, I will make you better.

918
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,405
And you will thank me.

919
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,410
And my father will come?

920
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,366
Yes.

921
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,082
Get some rest, my little lamb.

922
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,801
Bitte?

923
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,410
I have a problem with my...

924
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,005
May I?

925
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,165
I'll just pop it in some milk, shall I?

926
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,481
There we are.

927
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,401
Mrs. Watkins?

928
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,600
Where's Pembroke?

929
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,365
You took him.

930
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,080
Back to New York.

931
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,129
What? No.

932
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,442
They moved him. He's down here somewhere.

933
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,360
You told me about
the experiments, remember?

934
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,045
Your puzzle?

935
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,043
I like puzzles.

936
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,281
Yeah.

937
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,886
I left it for you.

938
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,610
You'll see.

939
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,640
Listen to me.

940
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,050
The experiments...

941
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,929
I think they're happening again.

942
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,764
The baroness was infertile.

943
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,604
Not experiments.

944
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,446
A cure.

945
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,246
She was pregnant the night of the wedding.

946
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,046
Before they burned her...

947
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,487
the villagers cut out the fetus...

948
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,483
and threw it in the aquifer.

949
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,768
The child survived.

950
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,250
She doesn't know.

951
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,243
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

952
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,121
Take it easy.

953
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,250
Marcus!

954
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,124
It's all right.

955
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,966
Mr. Lockhart...

956
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,400
every time I turn around,

957
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,130
you're somewhere
you're not supposed to be.

958
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,163
I guess I'm lost.

959
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,361
I'm just trying to find
my way back to my room.

960
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,880
This is a restricted floor.

961
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,121
There are signs everywhere.

962
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,204
Surely you didn't just wander
down here by accident?

963
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,880
What is it exactly that
you are looking for?

964
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,003
I had a problem with my tooth.

965
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,000
Your tooth?

966
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,005
Actually, it's feeling much better.

967
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,606
If you could just point me
in the direction of my room.

968
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,171
Nonsense.

969
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,846
We can't let you get an infection.

970
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,321
You must let us take care of you.

971
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,521
After all...

972
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,162
that's why you're here.

973
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,971
Doctor Brennan takes care

974
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,208
of all our patients' dental needs.

975
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,041
I'm sorry.

976
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,520
Hmm?

977
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,647
About Hannah.

978
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,326
It won't happen again.

979
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,441
Hmm.

980
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,326
Tell me...

981
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,125
what were you doing in town?

982
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,045
Just having a beer.

983
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,321
Ah. Hmm.

984
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,731
What are you doing?

985
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,321
Get your hands off me!

986
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,241
It's all for your own safety,
Mr. Lockhart.

987
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,402
We don't believe in chemical
anesthesia at the institute.

988
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,485
The impurities inhibit the cure.

989
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,809
But, you will find that
with a proper focus...

990
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,646
the mind can overcome any amount of pain.

991
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,924
Trust, Mr. Lockhart. Hmm?

992
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,441
I mean, if we can't trust each other...

993
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,200
then how can I help you?

994
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,966
Mrs. Abramov...

995
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,731
so glad that you are here.

996
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,644
How long do we have you with us?

997
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,211
Just two weeks.

998
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,646
I probably overpacked.

999
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,847
Nonsense.

1000
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,400
You'll be surprised
how time just slips away

1001
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,811
here at the institute.

1002
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,800
Drive!

1003
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,881
What happened to your face?

1004
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,001
Just drive!

1005
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:33,210
They held me down and pulled my tooth out.

1006
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,362
They threatened me.

1007
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,170
Why would they do that?

1008
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,605
Because I know what they've done.

1009
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:45,842
There is a room full of bodies
floating in tanks like specimens.

1010
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,011
These are very serious allegations.

1011
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,561
No shit.

1012
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,081
Director Volmer is a well-respected man.

1013
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,407
The sanatorium is of great importance
for the local economy.

1014
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,040
Take me up there,
and I'll show you what I saw.

1015
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,690
Do you have any identification on you?

1016
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,528
No, they have everything.

1017
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,887
Well, then, is there someone
I could speak to...

1018
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,884
who might confirm you are
who you say you are? Family?

1019
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,371
I hope you understand the need
to verify your identity.

1020
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,769
You can call my office.

1021
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,725
All right.

1022
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,722
Can I get you coffee or tea?

1023
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,608
You got anything stronger?

1024
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,121
Of course.

1025
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,241
Rest assured...

1026
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,563
we will get to the bottom of this.

1027
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,401
Thank you.

1028
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,808
Mr. Lockhart,
we've been worried about you.

1029
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,325
Stay away from me!

1030
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,521
Is this man a patient of yours?

1031
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,681
Yes, that's right.

1032
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,366
I'm not a patient. I was in an accident.

1033
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,888
You signed the admission form.
I have it right here.

1034
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,121
That's bullshit.

1035
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,563
I did warn you about
possible delusions, remember?

1036
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,688
A side effect of the toxins
leaving the body.

1037
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,729
And my leg, is that a delusion?

1038
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,400
Mr. Lockhart has been a disruptive element

1039
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,561
since he arrived.

1040
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,927
He stole confidential medical files...

1041
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,321
assaulted a member of our Dental staff...

1042
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,845
and threatened Mr. Pembroke.

1043
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,321
I didn't threaten anybody!

1044
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,723
I believe your exact words were...

1045
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,240
"If I have to, I'll hit him over the head

1046
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,163
"and drag him out by his hair."

1047
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,245
I was sent here to bring
Pembroke back to New York!

1048
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:37,842
According to your employer, a Mr. Green...

1049
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,206
you're being investigated

1050
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,169
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

1051
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,601
You're one of them.

1052
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,569
Listen to yourself, Mr. Lockhart.

1053
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:46,846
You're not a well man.

1054
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,367
Stop saying that!

1055
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,204
- Let us help you.
- Get back!

1056
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,526
I know about the experiments.

1057
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,205
The baron and his wife.

1058
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,410
He has been spending time
with Mrs. Watkins.

1059
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,521
Who is Watkins?

1060
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,923
She was institutionalized
before she came to us.

1061
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,525
The others humor her...

1062
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,927
but clearly Mr. Lockhart's condition

1063
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,202
has made him susceptible
to her conspiracies.

1064
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,761
I know what you're
trying to do. All of you.

1065
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,207
You're trying to make me think I'm insane.

1066
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,289
I have seen this before.

1067
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,970
It's not uncommon.

1068
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:23,727
Some deep-seated childhood
trauma rises to the surface...

1069
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,840
something a patient has been running from

1070
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,160
their entire life.

1071
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,770
In your case...

1072
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,322
I would say misplaced guilt...

1073
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,401
over the death of your father.

1074
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:40,131
How do you know about that?
I never told you that.

1075
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,251
You didn't have to.

1076
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,163
That's why you came to us, isn't it?

1077
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,002
I saw him.

1078
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,242
Pembroke is dead.

1079
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,006
That's what this is all about?

1080
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,767
The evil doctor killing off his patients?

1081
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,967
That's right.

1082
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:03,091
All right. Perhaps we should
consult Mr. Pembroke.

1083
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,010
Do you know this man?

1084
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,367
He tried to take me back against my will.

1085
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,605
Pembroke?

1086
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,966
Please keep him away from me.

1087
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,489
You were dead.

1088
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,286
- Do you wish press charges?
- That won't be necessary.

1089
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,602
Mr. Lockhart is not a criminal.

1090
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,290
He is a patient.

1091
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,761
To the members of the board...

1092
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:34,041
You sent me here for a purpose.

1093
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,607
To retrieve a man against his will...

1094
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,090
and bring him back to your world.

1095
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:46,451
But I realize now...

1096
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,086
that is not the reason I am here.

1097
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:56,440
There is a sickness inside each of us.

1098
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,126
We do our best to deny its existence...

1099
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,930
dealing in lies...

1100
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,490
and distraction.

1101
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:08,005
Until one day the body
rebels against the mind

1102
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,246
and screams out...

1103
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,565
"I am not a well man."

1104
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,120
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1105
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:29,685
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1106
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,008
He cannot willingly return to darkness...

1107
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,644
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

1108
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,531
any more than he can be unborn.

1109
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,361
Fuck.

1110
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,681
Hannah!

1111
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,927
Stay away from me.

1112
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,726
- Hannah.
- Stay away from me.

1113
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,564
- We need to go.
- I said stay away!

1114
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,000
There. Everything is all right.

1115
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,286
Please enjoy your meal.

1116
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:38,721
Hannah?

1117
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,249
What have you done?

1118
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,764
What's happening to me?

1119
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,083
Here, here, here.

1120
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,969
It's all right. You're safe now.

1121
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,081
Leave her alone.

1122
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,129
Haven't you upset her enough,
Mr. Lockhart?

1123
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,890
Please, escort the patient
back to his room.

1124
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,280
I am not a fucking patient!

1125
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,641
Come on!

1126
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,761
Come on!

1127
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,969
Had enough of cripples and old people?

1128
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,127
Try it with me!

1129
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,726
That's enough! Mr. Lockhart...

1130
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,445
I can see you're extremely upset.

1131
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,329
Why don't you come with me to my office...

1132
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,448
and we can discuss
whatever's on your mind.

1133
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:21,921
No.

1134
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,443
We're gonna talk about it right here.

1135
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,281
In front of everybody.

1136
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,771
I don't think that's a good idea.

1137
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,843
He's making you sick.

1138
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,529
This place is making you sick!

1139
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,965
It's in the water.

1140
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,161
Mr. Lockhart.

1141
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,766
I saw the bodies dried up like mummies!

1142
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:53,801
Look at you people!

1143
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,490
Your teeth are falling out!

1144
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,123
You're dying, and you can't even see it.

1145
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,691
But I'm here for the cure.

1146
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,080
There is no cure!

1147
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,885
Don't you see?

1148
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,324
He's the one that is making you sick!

1149
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,323
There's nothing wrong with you people!

1150
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,841
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

1151
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:16,884
There's nothing wrong with you.

1152
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,481
Yes.

1153
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,721
Yes!

1154
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,847
That's it!

1155
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:32,326
Stand up!

1156
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,806
Come on!

1157
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,001
Yes!

1158
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,687
Stand up!

1159
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,530
He is making you sick!

1160
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,764
Yes, that's it. Come on.

1161
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,526
That's it!

1162
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:53,007
There's nothing wrong with you!

1163
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,004
I am not well.

1164
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,571
I am not well.

1165
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:00,886
What are you doing?

1166
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,401
What are you doing?

1167
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,361
Get the fuck off me!

1168
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,443
No. No, no!

1169
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,087
Get off me.

1170
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,250
Help me! Help!

1171
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,125
Pembroke.

1172
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,125
Pembroke.

1173
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,569
What have they done to you?

1174
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,930
Done to me?

1175
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,482
I've never felt better.

1176
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,529
Relax, Mr. Lockhart.

1177
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,125
It'll all be over soon.

1178
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,804
Ah, yes. Remarkable creatures.

1179
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:26,961
Anywhere else on the planet,

1180
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:29,811
this species lives a dozen years, at most.

1181
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,167
Here, in our aquifer...

1182
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,166
they can live 300.

1183
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,129
For the human physiology...

1184
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,851
the effect of the water can be quite toxic

1185
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,525
as you have discovered.

1186
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,684
Unless, of course,
it is properly filtered.

1187
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,049
The baron devised the process.

1188
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:57,530
Using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land...

1189
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:01,000
he managed to distill the water...

1190
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:03,722
to its life-giving essence.

1191
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,166
Of course, he paid

1192
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,402
a terrible price for his ingenuity.

1193
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,121
His only mistake...

1194
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,521
was to use subjects who were unwilling.

1195
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,250
Luckily, times have changed.

1196
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,206
The last 200 years

1197
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,322
have been the most
productive in human history.

1198
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,847
Man rid himself of God...

1199
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,049
of hierarchy, of everything
that gave him meaning...

1200
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,725
until he was left worshiping

1201
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,047
the empty altar of his own ambition.

1202
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,210
That is why they come.

1203
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,166
Men like you.

1204
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,364
You're quite right, Mr. Lockhart.

1205
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:50,885
No one ever leaves.

1206
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,921
What you fail to understand
is that no one wants to.

1207
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:17,249
Do you know what the cure
for the human condition is?

1208
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,081
Disease.

1209
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:25,321
Because only then
is there hope for a cure.

1210
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:17,284
I don't understand.

1211
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,650
For so many years,
I've tried to protect you...

1212
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:23,804
from the impurities of the outside world.

1213
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:27,165
But ironically, it is
your friend Mr. Lockhart

1214
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,486
who we have to thank.

1215
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:33,005
You're a woman now.

1216
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,485
But I'm not well.

1217
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,005
And I will always be here
to take care of you.

1218
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,851
She's awake now.

1219
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,404
You made me believe
I could leave here one day.

1220
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,248
Why would anybody wanna leave?

1221
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:25,441
What is it?

1222
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:27,561
Come.

1223
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,004
What is this place?

1224
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,728
This is where you began.

1225
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,771
I don't want to.

1226
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:18,765
You know...

1227
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,362
you look just like she did
on her wedding night.

1228
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:32,089
The night they took her from me.

1229
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,720
The villagers cut out the fetus

1230
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,404
and threw it in the aquifer.

1231
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,728
The child survived.

1232
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:19,201
Please don't.

1233
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:20,481
Don't be frightened.

1234
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,688
Soon we'll be a family again.

1235
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,444
The way we were always meant to be.

1236
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,531
It's all right.

1237
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:46,207
My sister was also
somewhat resistant, at first.

1238
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,365
But after a while, she grew to like it.

1239
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:57,849
We tried so many times
to make something pure.

1240
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:06,008
That something was you, my love.

1241
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:11,407
And now...

1242
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,481
we can begin again.

1243
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,927
I've waited so long.

1244
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:06,771
So long.

1245
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,607
He will have you. Yes?

1246
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,046
Yes.

1247
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,967
You can't keep her here forever.

1248
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:43,927
No?

1249
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,843
And what do you think would
become of her in your world?

1250
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:54,320
People like you come to me in droves

1251
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,004
with your disposable lives.

1252
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,285
She's your daughter.

1253
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,841
And what have you ever loved, hmm?

1254
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:09,241
What have you ever sacrificed?

1255
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:16,321
This is what the outside world has to offer.

1256
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:34,806
You're right.

1257
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:39,121
No.

1258
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:24,401
No.

1259
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,363
Fire. Fire!

1260
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:15,207
Everything I have built has been for her.

1261
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:23,684
You think I would let someone
like you destroy that?

1262
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:25,041
Dad?

1263
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,201
Hannah.

1264
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:57,762
Magnificent, isn't it?

1265
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:09,361
Lockhart!

1266
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:14,451
It's time to go.

1267
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,882
- Are you okay?
- Jesus Christ.

1268
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:39,001
Easy, easy.

1269
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:40,846
Lockhart?

1270
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:42,405
My God.

1271
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:44,365
What have you done?

1272
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,329
Where's Pembroke?

1273
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,161
He's gone.

1274
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:52,924
What do you mean "gone"?

1275
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:55,246
Get in the car.

1276
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:03,321
You came here to perform a task, remember?

1277
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,682
Now get in the car.

1278
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,042
Did you hear what I said?

1279
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:24,289
Have you lost your mind?

1280
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,250
