00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:10,462
Thank you.

3
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:15,593
Whether I turn out to be the hero
of my own story

4
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:18,762
or whether that station will be held
by anybody else...

5
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,308
...these moments must show.

6
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,480
<i>I entered the world at The Rookery.</i>

7
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,109
Peggotty!

8
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,278
I'm coming. I'm coming.

9
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,197
As I promised.
Peggotty promised, see?

10
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,790
I'm coming, my love.
Just give me three seconds.

11
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:48,000
Three seconds is too long.

12
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:55,007
<i>Where are the towels?</i>

13
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,967
OK. Why do I have this?

14
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,262
I'm panicking. I'm completely panicking.
Peggotty, you daft mare.

15
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,768
<i>Now, Peggotty!</i>

16
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,811
I'll be with you in 45 seconds, 45.

17
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:10,648
Peggotty!

18
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:15,110
Just breathe. Just keep breathing, my love.
I'll be back in two breaths.

19
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,112
Peggotty!

20
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,077
- Just try to pretend it doesn't hurt.
- It does.

21
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:24,662
I know.

22
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:26,163
To begin my life...

23
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,833
...with the beginning of my life.

24
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,128
Mrs David Copperfield, I think?

25
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:36,882
- Miss Trotwood. You've heard of her?
- Yes.

26
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,760
Yes, I believe I've had that pleasure.

27
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:41,971
Well...

28
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:43,264
Now you see her.

29
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,642
Might I ask, why Rookery?

30
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:52,189
When my husband bought the house,
he liked to think there were rooks about it.

31
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:54,692
- And are there?
- No!

32
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:58,028
My late brother all over.

33
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,949
Calls a house a rookery,
takes the rooks on trust.

34
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,828
A better name would have been
Gullible Manor.

35
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,706
- Will this person be stopping, ma'am?
- Now, Peggotty.

36
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,166
Peggotty? Peggotty? Peggotty?

37
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,712
You mean to say a human being went into a church
and had herself named Peggotty?

38
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:17,131
Did your mother sneeze
when you were christened?

39
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,341
- Sorry, what was your name?
- Trotwood.

40
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:23,387
Trotwood. It's funny because I thought your name
was Pot Kettle Black when you walked in,

41
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:25,014
but never mind.

42
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,266
Ah! Here she comes.
Here comes the girl.

43
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,396
- Or it could be... a boy!
- Oh, no, no, no. She will be a girl.

44
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:33,772
Certain to be a girl.

45
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:37,401
And, may I beg you, you will call her
Betsey Trotwood Copperfield

46
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:39,278
and I will be her godmother.

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,324
And there will be no mistakes
in the life of this Betsey Trotwood.

48
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,535
There will be no trifling
with her affections, poor dear.

49
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:51,248
Bless me, you're very young.

50
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,751
We need a nurse and a doctor.

51
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,837
- We're here.
- Hello.

52
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,965
- Come on, my love.
- Nice and slow.

53
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,093
- We're going to need towels.
- I have lots of towels.

54
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:06,263
Go nice and slow.
Very good, very good.

55
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:19,610
I record that I was born on a Friday
at 12 o'clock at night.

56
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,157
- Is that it? Is it over?
- Wonderful news! Fabulous news!

57
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,494
- Doctor, tell Miss Trotwood the news.
- How is she, Doctor?

58
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,455
She is as comfortable
as any young mother can be.

59
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:33,707
No, I mean how is she, the baby?
How is she?

60
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:36,710
It's a boy, ma'am.
I'm very happy to congratulate you.

61
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:41,131
Why congratulate? The boy is the first of twins
and his sister being born as we speak?

62
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,759
No. It's just one boy.

63
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,271
Ludicrous.

64
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,451
Look at you, Baby Davy.

65
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:11,120
Face like a peach.

66
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,414
I'm very fond of peaches.

67
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

68
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,004
I remember Peggotty's rough fingers,
like a pocket nutmeg grater.

69
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,216
Are you smiling?

70
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,801
Almost there.

71
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,180
<i>Everything looked
terribly tall to me.</i>

72
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,309
Charge!

73
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,231
Take this,
you naughty monster rabbit!

74
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:45,404
I see my father's gravestone,

75
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:48,115
shadowed by trees
bending to one another in the wind,

76
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,119
like giants whispering secrets.

77
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:58,375
"Crocodiles can be found in Africa,
the Americas and Australia."

78
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:02,004
- What a remarkable vegetable.
- Not vegetable, reptile.

79
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,257
No, I tell you, a crocodile is a potato.

80
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,636
It has some scales
and they have spikes.

81
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:11,138
Well, what a world
of gammon and spinach it is.

82
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:15,226
<i>I can easily recall
people of strong character...</i>

83
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:18,479
What did Peggotty say when you were little,
the one you liked?

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,900
- A world of gammon and spinach.
- That's a good one. I'll put that one down.

85
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,527
Do you remember everything she says?

86
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,780
It's hard to forget.

87
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,531
That's true.

88
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,911
<i>...and weave their memory
into the life I was about to lead.</i>

89
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:44,088
- All packed for the journey, Peggotty?
- Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,589
Uh, here.

91
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:50,219
You should always go in the middle, Davy,
if you want to win noughts and crosses.

92
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:53,806
The gentleman is here, ma'am,
with the black hair and particular manner

93
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,808
who walked you home
from church on Sunday.

94
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,726
Yes, thank you, Peggotty.

95
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,067
- Are these your famous geraniums?
- Indeed they are.

96
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:07,611
Oh.

97
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,738
- Do come in.
- Ah!

98
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,409
- Carrot down.
- You must be the man of the house.

99
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,619
I'm a boy, sir.

100
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,164
Dear boy.
Come, shake my hand.

101
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,838
Well, no, that's the wrong hand,
isn't it, boy?

102
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,089
Davy.

103
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,262
Well, maybe your way will catch on, hm?

104
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,431
You're a very brave boy.

105
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:38,475
Davy, my sweet potato.

106
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:41,061
Let's take you to Yarmouth.

107
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,980
My brother is driving us there.

108
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,405
Look at all that sky, eh, Davy boy.

109
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:54,033
That's too much sky, innit?
Even for a bird.

110
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,496
If the world is really as round
as my geography book says it is,

111
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,790
how can this bit of it be so flat?

112
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:03,292
Not to your liking, Davy?

113
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,629
There's a molehill there, look.
That ain't flat.

114
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:11,634
- There's a bird there. That ain't flat.
- A flower there. That ain't flat.

115
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:14,970
It's flat here,
it's flat here and it's flat, OK?

116
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,935
All right, maybe you're right.
It is a bit flat.

117
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,562
Ooh, nearly at the harbour.

118
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,358
That's where
Ham and Emily work.

119
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,952
It's four. I've done my gutting.

120
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:40,704
It's four already?
These are ready to go, yeah.

121
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:41,956
Hey!

122
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,293
There we go.

123
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,881
I turn my back for a second, Ham,
and you sprout like a beanstalk.

124
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:54,301
Oh, I forgot how hard you squeeze, Peggotty.

125
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:58,305
- You'll have the marrow out my bones.
- She's a human mangle, that woman.

126
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:00,641
Master Davy, Ham.
Ham, Master Davy.

127
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:04,311
- Pleased to meet you, Ham.
- I'm... Master Davy.

128
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:07,231
Likewise. Let's show you
where we live, eh?

129
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:09,358
- Is Emily here?
- No, it's four. She's...

130
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,360
- She's done gutting.
- Yeah, done gutting.

131
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,946
Davy, hop up. Come on.

132
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,950
Careful with him.

133
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,952
Wait till you see this.

134
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,207
That's where we all live, Davy boy.

135
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,918
- It's amazing.
- It's no mansion.

136
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,754
It's a downside-upside capsized boat.

137
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,131
It's Aladdin's palace!

138
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,593
We'll be like spiders
trapped under a teacup!

139
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:38,804
Digs for joy, that boy.
Finds it too.

140
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,394
Peggotty.

141
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:49,064
This place is amazing.

142
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,524
Davy, come look at this.

143
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:55,654
- And this is where you'll be sleeping.
- Do you like it, then, Davy?

144
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,990
Yeah, what do you think,
Master Copperfield?

145
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:02,369
I think this is the most desirable bedroom
I've ever seen.

146
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:03,913
Desirable.

147
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:06,081
I love your words, Davy.

148
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:12,046
- Peggotty says your mother's a lady.
- Emily, mind your manners! This is Emily.

149
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,589
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,802
Are Ham and Emily your children?

151
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:22,514
No, they're adopted.
Both their fathers was drownded.

152
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,851
Oh, Ham.
Not another mouth to feed!

153
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:31,023
Let me die and be a riddance.

154
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:34,652
That's Mrs Gummidge.
Her husband drownded too.

155
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,363
There's a lot of drownding goes on.

156
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,700
How's that? You can't complain
about a nice bit of kipper.

157
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,118
You just watch her.

158
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,789
Potatoes are burnt, like coals.

159
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,041
There she goes.

160
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,921
These potatoes could be my last.

161
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:57,549
- Can I go out onto the beach, Uncle?
- Well, have you done your gutting?

162
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:01,637
- Yes, I've done my gutting. Finished at four.
- There's a six-o'clock gutting as well.

163
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,807
- Fish do go off, you know.
- Ham, I've been gutting fish since dawn.

164
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:08,060
- You need to get gutting till it's finished.
- Never mind about that.

165
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,479
Go on, but take young Davy with you.

166
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,314
Come on.

167
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:15,109
Mind you don't get drownded.

168
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,530
What's gutting?

169
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,700
Unless you want hands like mine,
you don't wanna know.

170
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,743
Come on.

171
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,455
<i>Is your mother really a lady?</i>

172
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:32,001
Uh, yes, I think so.

173
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:37,131
Does she attend to her correspondence
and receive callers in the drawing room?

174
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,674
I don't know.

175
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:43,220
A gentleman with big hands
calls to admire our geranium.

176
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,141
I should like to become a lady.

177
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,226
He has two eyebrows.

178
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:54,356
I say eyebrows rather than eyes
cos they're much more important in his face.

179
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,401
Yeah.

180
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:06,785
Look! Look at this, Davy.

181
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,829
You can see past Yarmouth.

182
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:13,250
Emily, get down!
You'll smash in 20 pieces if you slip off there.

183
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,628
- Hello, Ham!
- I'm not scared.

184
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,964
- Hello, Davy. You having a good day?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,847
<i>Dear Mama,</i>

186
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:32,895
<i>Yarmouth is, upon the whole,
the finest place in the universe.</i>

187
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:38,776
<i>Emily has taught me to skim stones</i>

188
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,987
<i>and I'm only sorry you cannot see it.</i>

189
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,661
<i>She and Ham have become
the best friends imaginable.</i>

190
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,752
What? What?

191
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:01,173
I told them what we decided
between us, our news.

192
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:03,801
- Getting engaged?
- Getting engaged, yeah.

193
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:06,345
- You can just say "getting engaged".
- We're engaged.

194
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:13,269
- Are you happy for us, Uncle?
- Happy? I'll tell you how happy I am.

195
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,604
I'm happy as a dog with two bones.

196
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:19,608
And as the owner who discovers

197
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,988
that the hole the bones was dug from
is full of gold watches.

198
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,740
- Oh, oh, and money!
- And money.

199
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,784
Yeah, that's how happy I am.

200
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,120
- Everybody should get married.
- Yeah!

201
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,872
Let's be having you!

202
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:46,927
What have you got there?

203
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,097
It's a boathouse, sir.

204
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,350
A house made from a boat.

205
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:57,271
Draw a house or draw a boat.

206
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,273
None of this nonsense.

207
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,358
Welcome back, Davy.

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,403
Mrs Copperfield,
is that a new ring or your proper one?

209
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,447
Yes, you must congratulate us.

210
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,284
Davy, you have a pa.

211
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,745
- A new one.
- A new pa?

212
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,956
- Yes, your mother and I are now married.
- I meant to tell you sooner.

213
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:19,543
Now, you just addressed my wife
by a surname that is not hers.

214
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,212
She is now Mrs Murdstone.
Will you remember that?

215
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,590
Sister.

216
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:27,885
Jane Murdstone.

217
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:32,765
Jane, my wife, Clara Murdstone.

218
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,852
A fair choice.

219
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:39,730
I regret I missed the wedding

220
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:42,733
and the chance to meet you
at the peak of your beauty.

221
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,777
A boy.

222
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,571
I presume it is named?

223
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:50,699
I'm David, Miss Murdstone.
How do you do?

224
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,160
My question
was not directed at you, child.

225
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,996
Wants manners.

226
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:17,476
The parlour's rather bright, I thought.

227
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,729
- Well, it's south-facing.
- I'll take care of it.

228
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,362
There she is.

229
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,783
I'm Miss Murdstone
and I go through every single cupboard.

230
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:36,120
Look in that cupboard,
look in that cupboard, look in that cupboard.

231
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:39,582
She looks
like she's made of wax.

232
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:42,793
- Or Dutch cheese.
- Is that one of yours?

233
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,837
- You should write that down.
- Later.

234
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,088
Davy boy.

235
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,632
Time for your lesson.

236
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,304
And verbs have two voices:

237
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:56,056
one active,

238
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:58,392
two, um...

239
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,395
- Clara!
- Jane.

240
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,606
We should switch
to a less enjoyable activity.

241
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:04,648
Jane!

242
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:07,443
Oh, Davy, Davy.

243
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:10,988
No, don't say, "Oh, Davy, Davy".
He either knows his lesson or he does not.

244
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,489
- He does not.
- Jane!

245
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,667
Pick it up. Read it to me.

246
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,297
Sometime today, boy!

247
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,133
Sorry, sir.

248
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:33,969
I can't when you're watching me.

249
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,137
It's...

250
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:39,266
The words have skates and skim away.
I'm very stupid.

251
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:42,394
- You'd as soon as teach the furniture.
- Jane Murdstone, silence!

252
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,189
- You're not stupid, just nervous.
- Clara Murdstone, silence!

253
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,524
Clara Copperfield, sir!

254
00:16:57,243 --> 00:16:58,410
- Edward.
- Come on.

255
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,579
- Edward, please, no.
- Clara. Come on, boy.

256
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,707
- Let your husband improve your son.
- Edward, please!

257
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:04,958
No. Get off me.

258
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,919
David. Wait. Davy.

259
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,170
Now, whenever I have
an obstinate dog or horse,

260
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:11,090
I beat him, hm?

261
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:15,427
I conquer him, even if it costs him
every last drop of blood he has.

262
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:19,890
I'm trying to learn, sir, but I can't
when you and Miss Murdstone are watching me!

263
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:21,559
Oh, can't you indeed?

264
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,704
- Edward, please stop!
- Clara!

265
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,707
- Let me break the door down, Mrs Copperfield.
- Mrs Murdstone.

266
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,333
Jane!

267
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,419
- Edward is teaching.
- Jane!

268
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,753
Let him teach.

269
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,192
What's to become of me?

270
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,987
- You're to be sent away.
- To school?

271
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:18,782
Education, boy, is costly.

272
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:24,914
What lies before you
is a fight with the world.

273
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,375
And the sooner you begin it, the better!

274
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:59,240
OK, so, cork with the hand corker, yeah?
Pass it to Mealy Potatoes.

275
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:03,035
He labels. Five a minute
or old Creakle hangs your guts out for bunting.

276
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,954
Come on, let's go.

277
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,872
Pull. Just pull it.

278
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,501
- Just pull it.
- He's so tiny!

279
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,046
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
Where are you living?

280
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:18,634
I'm lodging with the Micawber family,
whom I'm yet to meet.

281
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:22,054
"Whom I'm yet to meet?"
Where were you brung up? Windsor Castle?

282
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,140
Here, practise.

283
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,310
Quiet!

284
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:29,478
Quiet!

285
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:34,525
I said quiet, didn't I?

286
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,819
I didn't say stop working!

287
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,407
- Who broke the bottle?
- It was him, sir.

288
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,617
Breaking bottles?
On your first day?

289
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,121
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You're sorry, are you?

290
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:48,789
We'll find out about sorry.

291
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,671
- You know my rules.
- Rules.

292
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,216
- Half a day's pay per bottle.
- Per bottle.

293
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,392
The famous biting boy. Here.

294
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:09,935
Biting boy. Here.

295
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:14,148
I have the happiness
of knowing your step... father.

296
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,524
Step... father.

297
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:18,903
- A man of a strong character.
- 'aracter.

298
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:28,037
- Tie it to him, Tungay.
- To him, Tungay.

299
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:31,165
That's me. Sorry.

300
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:47,556
Look at the writing on his back.
What's it say?

301
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:49,808
It says he bites.

302
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:14,041
Hey! Open the door!

303
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,585
You can't get away!

304
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:19,213
Swindler!
We know you're in there!

305
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,968
- Come on, Micawber!
- Micawber, are you in there?

306
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:26,136
Come on, open the door!
Take it off its hinges!

307
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:30,516
Come on, Micawber!
Open the door now!

308
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,684
Are you Mr Micawber?

309
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,604
- Are you Master Copperfield?
- I am indeed.

310
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,774
How do you do, Master Copperfield?

311
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,444
- Very good.
- Master Copperfield,

312
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:45,781
it would be of material assistance to me
if you would join those gentlemen,

313
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,575
echo their slanderous cries,

314
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:51,662
and then enunciate the following:
"'Ere, round the back. He's flittin'."

315
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:52,871
Here, round the back...

316
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:54,873
- 'Ere.
- Here.

317
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,251
Ear, as in the aural organ.

318
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,337
- Ear.
- 'Ere. Round the back.

319
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:02,172
- Mm-hm.
- He's flitting.

320
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,300
- Flittin'.
- Flittin'.

321
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,595
Precisely. Splendid.
Now, there's no time like the present.

322
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,389
Open up!

323
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,766
Come on!

324
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,769
Pay up the money, please!

325
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:19,815
- Micawber!
- 'Ere! Round the back. 'E's...

326
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,859
- What?
- ...flittin'.

327
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:23,777
Flittin', is he? Micawber!

328
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:27,740
There he is!
Micawber, come here, you!

329
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:31,285
We'll be back tomorrow, Micawber.

330
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:35,080
- You can't hide forever.
- You haven't got away with this.

331
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,294
A bravura performance,
Master Copperfield.

332
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:44,048
Welcome.
Welcome to our humble home.

333
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,799
- Who are the...?
- Those are, um...

334
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:50,346
Jackals is what they are! Hyenas!
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

335
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:53,557
This woman is the apple of my eye,
Master Copperfield.

336
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,436
The lodestar upon whom
the sextant of my heart is set.

337
00:22:57,478 --> 00:22:59,521
In short, my wife.

338
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:01,106
- How do you do?
- Ooh.

339
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,526
- I'm owed for candles. Pay me.
- On your way. You will be paid.

340
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:07,571
- Clock. Clock.
- No, give me that clock.

341
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,865
Hands off, you horrible creature.

342
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,743
- Clock, very valuable.
- Micawber!

343
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,370
- Micawber!
- Leave me alone!

344
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,831
- Thank you.
- No! No! No!

345
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:23,003
Oh, right, that's it!

346
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,339
That is it!

347
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:27,091
This is too much!

348
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,968
I shall end it.
Where's my razor?

349
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,930
- Razor.
- I don't think we sold it.

350
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,223
Razor!

351
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,141
Oh.

352
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:39,436
Swift, final.

353
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:43,649
- Let them have their blood.
- Never! Hold that.

354
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,859
If you are to exit, then so shall I!

355
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,408
If it would help, I have some money
from Mr Murdstone for my supper.

356
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:05,045
Angels in his fingertips.

357
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,895
- There you go.
- Ah!

358
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:24,440
Mrs Micawber is renowned
for her way with a mutton chop.

359
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,111
- Would you care for one?
- No, no.

360
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:32,990
Those are your specific chops
and your particular taters.

361
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:36,452
You'd be very welcome.
This is a royal banquet.

362
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:49,089
Ooh, very nice.

363
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,844
"They're your particular chops

364
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:57,139
and your specific taters."

365
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:58,349
"Taters."

366
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:04,563
London is full of more wonders
and wickedness

367
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,649
than all the cities of the earth.

368
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,275
Cities.

369
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:12,571
And it's ours, David,
to go wherever we choose.

370
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:16,951
No, not down there.
Creditors make that road impassable.

371
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:20,537
Two tailors
and a most unreasonable muffin man.

372
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:22,248
More creditors.

373
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:26,961
A knife grinder, a dairyman
and an unhinged florist.

374
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:31,966
You find us fallen back financially
but something shall turn up.

375
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:36,595
- But won't we run out of roads?
- I think we already have. Run!

376
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:38,722
Come here!

377
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,099
There's St Paul's.

378
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:51,151
Forward! Right! Right! Right.

379
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:57,616
He's a corker of a corker.

380
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,788
Five a minute.

381
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:08,127
Keep at it, Wilson, else I'll have to cork six
to make up for your four.

382
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,588
Jump. Imagine you're an acrobat.

383
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,631
Much better. Good. Faster.

384
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:21,473
I hope your day
was more remarkable than mine.

385
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:24,643
It certainly involved
a remarkable number of bottles.

386
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:28,480
If Mr Micawber had but a shilling for each bottle
you corked in the warehouse today...

387
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:33,611
I should still face a remarkably
disheartening pile of debt.

388
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:37,156
I'm like the tomatoes
shrivelling in our yard.

389
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,075
In short, blighted.

390
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:44,997
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Bailiffs. Hide...

391
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,457
Hide the spoons!

392
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:49,960
- The child.
- It's the rug

393
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:51,754
- The rug.
- I've got it.

394
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:53,756
Get the child.

395
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:57,176
- Me child!
- Hold the rug. Off it.

396
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,932
- What's happening?
- Bailiffs. We are undone.

397
00:27:02,973 --> 00:27:05,893
The sun goes down upon us.
The debtors' prison awaits.

398
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:09,897
The curtains.
He's taking the curtains.

399
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:13,359
That is not your chicken.
You're stealing an honest man's chicken.

400
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,903
At least let him finish his meal,
you malicious apes.

401
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:19,114
Hands off Micawber.
He bruises like a peach.

402
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:22,117
Oh, Martha!
The bailiffs are taking Martha.

403
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,286
- Here. Come here.
- All right.

404
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:25,788
I trust you're happy.

405
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:29,041
That's all my stuff!

406
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,335
St Paul's.

407
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,809
Until something turns up.

408
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,420
Copperfield!

409
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,850
- Come in.
- Come in.

410
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:36,525
- Your stepfather informs me...
- Me.

411
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:40,029
- That your mama is ill.
- Ill.

412
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,906
- How ill is she?
- Tell him.

413
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:43,365
- Jane.
- Jane.

414
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:46,452
- Tell me, please.
- I won't deceive you.

415
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,704
- Very ill.
- Very ill.

416
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:50,080
- Very ill?
- Very ill?

417
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,415
Dangerously ill.

418
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:52,666
She's dead.

419
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:01,300
We're, uh... We're very sorry.

420
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:08,474
And...? And her funeral?

421
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,434
- On Saturday.
- Saturday.

422
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,770
Saturday.

423
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:16,815
Ought I to come back with you now
or take a later coach?

424
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:20,569
No, it was the Saturday just gone.
She's buried.

425
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,741
- We didn't want a fuss.
- Fuss.

426
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:41,006
- Copperfield.
- Copperfield.

427
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:54,687
Copperfield, I will allow you that.
You are upset.

428
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,772
- But do not...
- Do not...

429
00:29:56,814 --> 00:30:01,151
- Right, that's it. Half a day's pay.
- Half of nothing is nothing.

430
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:05,364
Given the manner of your overreaction,
it is a good thing you were not at the funeral.

431
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:07,449
You can't take
from someone who has nothing!

432
00:30:07,491 --> 00:30:10,202
- Nothing!
- You think of your future, boy.

433
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:12,871
Apart from your Aunt Betsey,
you are without relatives.

434
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,958
I deserve more than this.
Far more!

435
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,592
David!

436
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:31,473
You two are ghosts.

437
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,602
You've always been dead.

438
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,689
Quiet!

439
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,815
Quiet!

440
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:06,800
Hey! That's my box! No!

441
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:07,843
That's...!

442
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:11,722
Hey! Hey! You scoundrel!

443
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:12,848
Hey!

444
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:23,692
Excuse me. Do you know
where Miss Trotwood lives?

445
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:25,110
About a mile up that way.

446
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:28,697
Good luck.
She's fierce like a birthing badger.

447
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:29,782
Thank you.

448
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,919
Janet! Donkeys!

449
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:43,629
Donkeys!

450
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:44,755
Go on!

451
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:46,340
Go on! Go away!

452
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:52,388
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Get off my lawn! I'll box your ears!

453
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,058
Off you go!
This is a donkey-free zone!

454
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,560
Move it!

455
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,979
- Cheek of it.
- Somebody! Somebody, please!

456
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,065
King Charles I.
Are we certain that he's dead?

457
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:06,443
When last seen in public,
his head was not attached to his body.

458
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,321
Good. Thank you. Much obliged.

459
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,447
Boy there.

460
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:15,327
No, no. Shoo. No young men needed here.
I've got a garden fork.

461
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,913
- I'm not just a young man.
- I'll summon the constable.

462
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:24,545
Listen!

463
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:27,256
You're my aunt.

464
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:29,049
- Janet!
- I'm your nephew.

465
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:32,761
I'm David Copperfield.
From The Rookery.

466
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:34,054
Mr Dick!

467
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:38,225
I've been ill-used and put to work not fit for me.
And you're the only family I have.

468
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:42,104
- Come inside. Come inside. Janet!
- Yes, ma'am?

469
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:43,772
- Mr Dick.
- Shall I get water?

470
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:45,649
And I've barely eaten.

471
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:48,861
- I think there are donkeys out there.
- Mr Dick!

472
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:50,946
Don't touch anything.
That's it. That's it.

473
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:53,490
- I'm sorry.
- Can you put the thing on the thing?

474
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:55,534
There we go.
Not the chair. It's Viennese.

475
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:57,620
- Everything's circular.
- On the sofa.

476
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:01,790
- He's actually going to the other chair.
- I'm gonna drop.

477
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,585
He's gone.

478
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,588
Hello? Can you wake up?

479
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,137
- What are you doing?
- Medicine. Reviving you.

480
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,473
- This is salad dressing.
- Is it?

481
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:20,059
Thought it was Armagnac.
Don't have my spectacles on.

482
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,020
Do you have a lettuce somewhere
covered in ointment?

483
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:27,441
His head is entirely removed from his body?
We're sure?

484
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:30,778
Let's leave Charles's head
on one side for the moment, Mr Dick.

485
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:33,197
Pick it up later. Understood.

486
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,158
- How do you do?
- Now, Mr Dick, don't be a fool,

487
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,036
because nobody can be more discerning
than you when you choose.

488
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,623
David Copperfield, my brother,
you've heard me speak of him?

489
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,833
Yes, just then.

490
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,337
Oh, you mean before that?

491
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:51,757
Uh, yes, I'm sure I remember.
Ooh. I'm hungry.

492
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,051
- Cakes. Those are cakes.
- Mr Dick.

493
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:57,554
My brother, David Copperfield,
this is his son, who's run away.

494
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,057
- What shall we do with him?
- One thing you could do is...

495
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:03,519
- If I were you, I'd wash him.
- Janet!

496
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,396
- Yes?
- Run the bath! There you are.

497
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:08,190
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mr Dick cracks it every time.

498
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:10,901
The thing is,
I haven't eaten in a very long time.

499
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:13,279
- Donkeys! Janet!
- Yes, ma'am?

500
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,447
There must be 50 of them.
It's an infestation.

501
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,991
- Thank you.
- Janet!

502
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:24,456
- Is my aunt really going to...?
- To visit violence upon the boy? Yes.

503
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:27,209
She's a remarkable woman.

504
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:28,960
Very kind.

505
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,426
"Very kind."

506
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,052
"Very kind." Hm.

507
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,806
"Somebody. Somebody, please."

508
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:43,225
"Somebody, please."

509
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:49,772
"Head taken off?"

510
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,026
"We're sure?"

511
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:53,319
"Janet! Donkeys!"

512
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:09,752
- Good morning, Mr Dick.
- Come in. Come in. Form a queue.

513
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,132
The capital letter Q.
I'm trying different forms.

514
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:17,551
I like this one.

515
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:22,181
- A cigar in an ashtray. You see?
- Or a kite with a string.

516
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:27,353
"The executioner's blade
is cold and sharp."

517
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:28,395
I'm sorry?

518
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:33,234
Your aunt gave me that kite to encourage me
out of the house from time to time

519
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,903
while she drinks coffee and is quiet.

520
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm still in the house.

521
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:43,160
I see you're writing stories
about Charles I.

522
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,246
Why? What makes you say that?

523
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:50,376
There seems to be
the occasional reference to him.

524
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,628
- Everywhere.
- Yes.

525
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:55,798
Yes, King Charles I does creep in.

526
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:58,717
You see, I'm trying to draft a petition

527
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,223
calling for improved housing conditions
for the labouring poor,

528
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:05,724
and I work very hard at it

529
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:08,686
but the thoughts
in King Charles's head,

530
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,355
they keep intruding.

531
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,857
Sorry. King Charles's head?

532
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:14,900
Yes.

533
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:18,529
Owing to a disagreement,
they cut it off.

534
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,907
In 1649.
That's well documented.

535
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,117
Is it?

536
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:27,162
Well, for reasons
that I don't fully understand,

537
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:30,791
they decided to remove
the troubling thoughts in his head

538
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,334
and put them into mine.

539
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:36,213
Very, very disruptive.
I have to write them down, you see.

540
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:37,923
- Uh...
- You write them down?

541
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,258
Yes, I...

542
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:45,598
"I mount the scaffold wearing two shirts
so shivers aren't mistaken for fear."

543
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,561
You must think this very peculiar.

544
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:53,397
No. By no means.
Something similar happens to me.

545
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:56,859
It does? With King Charles?

546
00:36:56,901 --> 00:37:01,947
No, but I find when I've been in the company
of some person of strong character,

547
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,826
their voice becomes lodged
in my head.

548
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,244
And...

549
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,084
And I too write down
the thoughts I have.

550
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:16,670
And the things I observe.
St Paul's on there.

551
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:19,757
See.

552
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:26,221
"Miss Murdstone's sleepless eyes,
like two red suns."

553
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:31,477
"The bottles are propelled
by iron pistons

554
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:35,856
that nod up and down
like melancholy mad elephants."

555
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:39,818
- What do you think?
- I think that's very, very good.

556
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,614
- And your calligraphy is excellent.
- Breakfast is ready!

557
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,199
That'll be breakfast.

558
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,871
Aunt, Mr Dick, is he at all...?

559
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:53,749
- Did he mention Charles I?
- Quite a lot.

560
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:56,502
He connects his, um, particular situation

561
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:58,879
with great disturbance and agitation.

562
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:01,882
But his mind's sharp as a surgeon's lancet,
make no mistake.

563
00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:05,344
- I think I may be able to help him.
- Well, on you go back up, Trotwood.

564
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:08,722
- Janet can soft-boil an egg in a flash.
- Thank you.

565
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:13,477
Um... Sorry.

566
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:18,399
- Trotwood?
- Yes, I thought I might call you Trotwood.

567
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,445
If I'm to financially support my nephew,
I want to like his name.

568
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,074
- Trotwood, that's me, yes.
- Mm.

569
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:29,285
Mr Dick?

570
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,204
Mr Dick? Mr Dick?

571
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,291
Is it lunch?

572
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:37,793
No, the troubling thoughts
from King Charles's head,

573
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:39,753
they weigh you down?

574
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:42,923
Yes, I try and keep them in order
but they do pile up and oppress me.

575
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:46,135
"As I die, I move
from corruptible crown to in..."

576
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,263
No, Mr Dick, we can release them.

577
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:51,348
We can cast them to the wind.

578
00:38:57,104 --> 00:39:01,525
- Can't say that I'm feeling much better.
- You have to fly it first. Come on.

579
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:06,739
- Kite time!
- Lead on! Lead on!

580
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,575
- Up, up, up, up! Fly!
- That's it, Mr Dick. Steady.

581
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:12,328
- Steady.
- I can't believe it.

582
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,371
The sky is absorbing my words.

583
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:18,542
- The higher the words go...
- The clearer my mind becomes.

584
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,962
Oh, I... I haven't felt like this...

585
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,674
It's as if I'm reading
for the bar again.

586
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:27,843
Before everything...

587
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:32,222
I used to share a staircase
with Tommy Traddles.

588
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:34,683
He was a terrific fellow.

589
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:37,478
<i>Un camarade très formidable,</i>
as the French say.

590
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,231
Well, now, there's a thing.

591
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:43,651
I'd completely forgotten that I can...
I can speak French.

592
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:48,530
- This is a remarkable day.
- It's a delight to see you so liberated.

593
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:52,326
- Isn't that magnificent?
- Beautiful.

594
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:56,205
With one hand, sir.
With one hand, I tell you.

595
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:59,083
This boy is terrific.

596
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,002
Thank you, um...

597
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:04,630
Trotwood. David's son.

598
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,759
- Thank you, Trotwood Davidson.
- Pleasure, sir.

599
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,934
Donkeys! Shoo! Shoo! Come on!

600
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:19,687
On your way. I'll tan your hide
and put you in a stew!

601
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:21,438
I'm a huge maniac!

602
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:24,149
That's it. Shoo.

603
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:27,987
- Very ferocious shooing.
- Hello.

604
00:40:29,238 --> 00:40:31,949
We suffer from a plague of donkeys.

605
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,452
You must be Trotwood.
I'm Wickfield.

606
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:39,123
- I act for your aunt in matters of finance.
- Right.

607
00:40:39,164 --> 00:40:41,792
- This is my daughter, Agnes.
- Oh.

608
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:45,212
A bow. I'm so rarely bowed to.

609
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:49,300
I hope I've started a new fashion.
Unless you deem it inappropriate.

610
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:52,928
No, not at all, Trotwood. I shall demand it
at our every meeting from now on,

611
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,638
as if I'm an empress.

612
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:56,682
Or mad.

613
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,727
Ah, Mr Wickfield.
Agnes, how very nice to see you.

614
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:01,937
- Are you well?
- That was quite the journey.

615
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:04,231
- Was it?
- Is it too early for sherry?

616
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:05,691
A little early.

617
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,778
Port, then.
It's seven in the evening in Singapore.

618
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,656
- I imagine.
- Father, it's too early to drink.

619
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:15,618
Trotwood,
Mr Wickfield owns the freehold

620
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:19,955
of a very fine educational
establishment in Canterbury.

621
00:41:19,997 --> 00:41:24,168
It's snapping at the heels
of the better-known establishments.

622
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:28,505
I have a thirst for education
that sadly has never been quenched.

623
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:32,259
Really? You give the impression
of a very well-watered intellect.

624
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,678
All this talk of thirst
is making me thirsty.

625
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,182
- How is business, Mr Wickfield?
- All is well.

626
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:43,479
Uh, there are, of course, challenges.
Uh, the reduced tariffs.

627
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,359
The retreat of mercantilism.
If I could show you on the globe...

628
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:58,452
Here in Europe and... the Americas.

629
00:41:58,494 --> 00:42:00,162
I could go on.

630
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:02,957
- India.
- "All is well" would have sufficed.

631
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:04,583
Somebody. Somebody.

632
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:08,796
No, no, no, Mr Dick.
Mr Dick, come. Come be with us.

633
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:12,299
Hello. I'm Mr Dick.
I'm very partial to gingerbread.

634
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:15,928
As am I, Mr Dick.
I adore the fiery taste.

635
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:18,889
Delighted to meet you.

636
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:20,557
Delighted. Thank you.

637
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:23,352
Can you just confirm something?

638
00:42:23,394 --> 00:42:25,521
- My head...
- Yes?

639
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:27,147
Am I right?

640
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:31,151
- My head is connected to my body?
- Well, let me have a look. Yes.

641
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:35,406
- I can confirm without any doubt that it is.
- Well, that's good to hear.

642
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:39,743
- Would you like to see my kite?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

643
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:41,036
Come on, Davidson.

644
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:46,834
Where's that?

645
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:49,878
- Mr Dick?
- Uh, no.

646
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,674
Agony. It's about the king's agony.
That's going up there.

647
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:57,177
He believes
when Charles I was executed,

648
00:42:57,219 --> 00:42:59,722
the king's troubles flew from his head
to nest in Mr Dick's own.

649
00:43:00,556 --> 00:43:02,600
Is that why you fly them
on your kite, Mr Dick?

650
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,269
- Precisely.
- It's the obvious course of action.

651
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,187
Oh, I like you.

652
00:43:07,229 --> 00:43:10,399
What a happy coincidence,
because I like you too.

653
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:13,736
Davidson's idea.
The boy's a marvel.

654
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:19,199
Mr Dick, you look like
you're playing the kettledrums.

655
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:21,452
He does.
You should write that down.

656
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:24,955
I will arrange for Trotwood
to board with Mrs Strong.

657
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:27,625
- This calls for a celebration.
- Yes.

658
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:29,960
- Hooray!
- Hooray.

659
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:34,632
I was thinking
more along the lines of a...

660
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:36,926
- Tea? Janet!
- Yes.

661
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,052
- Tea.
- Tea.

662
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:39,386
- Tea. Tea.
- Tea. Tea.

663
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:41,388
- Tea's fine.
- Kite time!

664
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:47,311
Oh, Mr Wickfield, why don't you have
a big glass of port wine?

665
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:49,563
- You do love it so.
- I do, Mr Dick.

666
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:52,358
I'm touched you remembered.

667
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:54,818
- It's working, Agnes!
- My gosh.

668
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,405
- I wouldn't call myself an expert, but...
- Do you do this every day?

669
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:03,369
- Look.
- Look how happy he is.

670
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:15,506
Kite time!

671
00:44:18,008 --> 00:44:21,262
<i>I'm going to miss our picnics
when you go away to board.</i>

672
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:23,222
You'll enjoy Mrs Strong's establishment.

673
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:25,766
It's not in a perfect condition
but it means well.

674
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:27,184
A little like my father.

675
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:30,104
Oh, now.

676
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:43,492
Thank you.

677
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:49,873
- That's all right.
- No.

678
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:53,168
It's not even a bit of trouble to help.
It's pure Christian pleasure.

679
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,462
- I'm Uri...
- Would you open the door?

680
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:57,506
Mr Wickfield, steady on.

681
00:44:57,548 --> 00:45:00,843
These steps are lethal.
Very, very high.

682
00:45:00,884 --> 00:45:03,846
- Uriah, there's no need.
- I can't. Shall I get back in?

683
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:06,682
You're getting close.
Come on. One step.

684
00:45:06,724 --> 00:45:08,767
- Slowly. There you go.
- Mr Wickfield.

685
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,145
Mrs Strong. Welcome.

686
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:14,148
No, you're welcome.
I'm already here.

687
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:16,317
- My head's muddled.
- From the bumpy journey.

688
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,195
- This is Cropwood Trotterfield.
- Trotwood Copperfield.

689
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,948
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs Strong.
- Pleasure is all mine.

690
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,117
- What do you have in your hand?
- It's nothing.

691
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:28,787
Oh, just a small piece of wall.
But all is well. Follow me.

692
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:31,457
We live just over there.
Come and visit.

693
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:32,499
I will.

694
00:45:33,584 --> 00:45:36,587
- I'm Uriah Heep...
- Oh, here we are!

695
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:40,549
Oh, dear. That's disappointing.
Uriah, drip.

696
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:44,845
- Shall I do the bucket?
- Thank you. Follow me.

697
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:49,934
Like all the great old establishments,
we have our little traditions.

698
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,271
Good morning!

699
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,652
Oh, well,
I think we'll let Mr Steerforth

700
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:03,614
just finish his funny little story
about the geography teacher.

701
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:06,742
Wearing the shortest of his three wigs.

702
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:10,246
Oh.

703
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,040
This is Copperfield. He's new.

704
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:16,168
I surmised as much, Mrs Strong,
but I appreciate the confirmation.

705
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:20,297
Oh.
Oh, very good, Mr Steerforth.

706
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,425
I'm thrilled to make your acquaintance,
Master Copperfield.

707
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:26,387
- Thank you.
- Uriah, bring that to the dormitory.

708
00:46:26,428 --> 00:46:28,514
I'm in deep humility.

709
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:38,649
And with that,
Uriah Heep rubbed himself out of the room.

710
00:46:40,484 --> 00:46:43,070
Steerforth. James Steerforth.

711
00:46:43,112 --> 00:46:44,738
Davidson. No, David Co...

712
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,283
No, sorry.
Trotwood Copperfield.

713
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:49,577
Is all that hyphenated?

714
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:54,957
- You see, my aunt calls me...
- What do you make of our friend Heep?

715
00:46:57,626 --> 00:46:59,878
- He's perplexing.
- Perplexing.

716
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,715
- Perplexing how?
- Difficult to describe?

717
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:07,177
He twitches his mouth
like a curious lizard.

718
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:11,265
Yes, he does.
Tell me another one.

719
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:14,977
He stands so close by
that he's nearer to you than your own shirt.

720
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:18,022
Yes. You are as sharp as a whip.

721
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:22,276
I like you. Come, sit.
Markham, move these boys, will you? Quickly.

722
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,236
- Round. Move round.
- Come, sit.

723
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,822
- Round. You sit there.
- Sorry.

724
00:47:26,864 --> 00:47:27,865
Heads!

725
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:33,412
Forgive the collapsing.
Old Wickfield's funds are drying up.

726
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:35,497
Unlike the man himself.

727
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,958
Loves his drink.
Do you know Wickfield?

728
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,462
"Is it too early for sherry?"

729
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:46,884
Look, here he is trying to thread a needle.

730
00:47:50,346 --> 00:47:53,515
Well, welcome. Yes?

731
00:47:53,557 --> 00:47:55,267
Welcome.

732
00:48:07,112 --> 00:48:08,697
I'm glad you've arrived.

733
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:11,742
Nice cut on that waistcoat.

734
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:17,623
- Who's your tailor?
- Just a man.

735
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:20,376
From Dover.
My aunt took me to...

736
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,419
Your aunt brought you up?

737
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:26,048
Well, she certainly brought me up sharp
a few times, I can tell you.

738
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:31,762
The very daisy in the field
is not fresher than you are.

739
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,142
I shall call you Daisy.

740
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:40,187
- Will you mind?
- Not at all.

741
00:48:40,229 --> 00:48:42,898
Why on earth would you, Daisy?

742
00:48:44,817 --> 00:48:49,154
I have some currant wine here
and almond cakes, if you'd like?

743
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:51,198
Yes, I'd like that very much.
Thank you.

744
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,660
You haven't got a sister...

745
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,329
...have you, Daisy?

746
00:48:58,831 --> 00:48:59,999
No.

747
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,250
Pity.

748
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:09,717
Daisy.

749
00:49:11,844 --> 00:49:14,013
- Yes?
- Read to me.

750
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,224
I can't sleep.

751
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:18,726
Read?

752
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:25,024
This book's quite long.
Why don't I tell you a story of mine?

753
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:29,111
Perhaps... one about
a kindly nurse and her charge

754
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:31,530
who slept in an upturned boat
in Yarmouth.

755
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:34,742
No. I don't care for whimsy. Sorry.

756
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:36,952
Right.

757
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:40,581
Do you have a scary story?

758
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:46,754
- Oh, I have one about an evil factory owner.
- Yes.

759
00:49:46,795 --> 00:49:51,050
<i>His name is</i> Murderstone
<i>and he delights in terrifying children.</i>

760
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:52,343
Enough!

761
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:55,930
- The monster.
- He has an equally cruel sister.

762
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:57,848
So, he's got a sister.

763
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:00,059
She's a cold and metallic lady.

764
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,436
- I'll smash it.
- Then I shall smash you.

765
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,563
Jane! Jane!

766
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:07,066
- Be quiet.
- No!

767
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:12,238
- Is there vengeance on the pair?
- Wait for it.

768
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:18,744
Listen to me.

769
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:29,755
And you made these tales
of the factory boy up out of thin air?

770
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:33,384
- All invented, yes.
- Daisy, you truly are the Eighth Wonder.

771
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:34,677
Thank you.

772
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:36,262
You should publish.

773
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:39,014
You seem to have a lot of knowledge
about the detail in the factory.

774
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:41,308
Was your father in manufacturing?

775
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,395
- My stepfather.
- Stepfather?

776
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:47,523
So you had a stepfather,
but you were raised by an aunt?

777
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:49,400
Look. Who's that, Steerforth?

778
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:52,361
Ah, yes.
That's the eldest, Miss Larkins.

779
00:50:52,403 --> 00:50:53,821
Pretty, isn't she?

780
00:50:54,822 --> 00:50:58,701
- She's a blaze of beauty.
- She's engaged to an army captain.

781
00:50:58,742 --> 00:51:01,036
Only because she's yet to meet me.

782
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:02,454
Look out.

783
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:05,457
A couple of Miss Strong's prize poodles
have got loose.

784
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,794
- Very amusing.
- Ignore him.

785
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:12,965
Oi! Ladies! I'll beat you
with one hand tied behind me.

786
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:17,469
- You wanna fight, do you?
- Yeah.

787
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:19,346
Then, sir...

788
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:22,016
...name your time!

789
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:23,309
Fight!

790
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:27,396
- You can box, I take it, Daisy?
- After a fashion, certainly.

791
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:30,357
All right, gentlemen.
No eyeball-gouging. No...

792
00:51:30,399 --> 00:51:33,861
Actually, everything else is allowed.
Get set, fight!

793
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:42,912
Get up! Get up now!

794
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:46,081
Daisy, you need a hook,
feint, upper cut.

795
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:47,416
- What?
- Upper cut.

796
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:50,920
It's done. It's done.

797
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,173
Daisy.

798
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:57,426
You did, in some ways,
do very well, Daisy.

799
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,430
Let's get you back to Wickfield's house.
Come on. Up.

800
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,475
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

801
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:09,396
Come on.

802
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:14,652
Well, try not to die
or anything boring like that, Daisy.

803
00:52:14,693 --> 00:52:16,028
I'll try my best.

804
00:52:19,156 --> 00:52:21,200
What a confident gentleman he is.

805
00:52:23,118 --> 00:52:25,704
Mother taught me the medical rudiments.

806
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:30,209
She's the laundress here.
Washes your bed sheets.

807
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,795
Always very clean. Relatively.

808
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:34,588
Oh, she will burst with gratitude

809
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:38,300
that you have acknowledged her
spontaneously, Master Copperfield.

810
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:43,305
Miss Wickfield is very...

811
00:52:43,347 --> 00:52:45,933
- Do you not think?
- Very what?

812
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:48,769
My dear Trotwood,
they told me you were here.

813
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:52,940
Oh dear, look at you. I imagine
the other fellow must be dreadfully injured.

814
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:55,859
Oh, yes. Close to death.

815
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:57,861
Measured for his coffin.

816
00:52:57,903 --> 00:53:01,365
- How were Uriah's ministrations?
- He's like a human cold in the head.

817
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,701
- He gets so close.
- Yes.

818
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:06,912
It's as if he lives in your nose
and is keen to get home.

819
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:08,872
- Did he mention his mother?
- His mother?

820
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:11,375
Oh, Agnes,
I burst with gratitude

821
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,669
that you should ask me
such a question spontaneously.

822
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:18,048
So, is this Steerforth's doing,
getting you into fights?

823
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,884
No. In fact, he tried to stop me.

824
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:24,305
Doesn't think a gentleman should be seen
fighting with a butcher's boy.

825
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:26,265
- Gentleman?
- Yes.

826
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:29,268
Steerforth thinks of me
as a gentleman.

827
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,895
You are.

828
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:35,900
- I assume you haven't told him about your past.
- No. I fear he might...

829
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,447
It's the first time someone like that
has regarded me as an equal.

830
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:43,657
Except you, Agnes.

831
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:45,826
- And I think of you as a sister.
- Special?

832
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:49,371
A special sister.

833
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:52,625
Might I be so bold, Master Copperfield,

834
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:56,295
as to ask you to come to tea?

835
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:57,504
With me and Mother.

836
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:03,052
What a shame. I fear I have
a prior engagement on that date.

837
00:54:03,093 --> 00:54:06,555
On which date?
I don't believe I mentioned a date.

838
00:54:06,597 --> 00:54:08,849
- I don't believe you did.
- I understand.

839
00:54:08,891 --> 00:54:10,768
Master Copperfield, I understand.

840
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:14,104
It's not my place
to invite the likes of you to tea.

841
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:19,944
No, I'd be...
I'd be glad to come, Mr Heep.

842
00:54:19,985 --> 00:54:21,195
Uriah, please.

843
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:25,366
Oh, Mother will go off like a rocket.
Like a rocket.

844
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:28,619
On the 14th, perhaps, at four?
And if Miss Wickfield would care to...?

845
00:54:28,661 --> 00:54:32,581
Sadly on the 14th at four
I have a prior engagement.

846
00:54:32,623 --> 00:54:36,627
Of course. I'm meant to join you
in that engagement, am I not, Agnes?

847
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:38,087
I don't believe so, no.

848
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:43,550
Good. Then I can definitely come to tea.

849
00:54:43,592 --> 00:54:47,596
Oh, I am so proud
to be noticed by you.

850
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:51,934
- Are you done with that?
- Yes, of course. Help yourself.

851
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:54,061
That's a tolerably nice bit of rump.

852
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,438
No offence meant, I'm sure.

853
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:02,987
300 hurrahs!

854
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:05,447
And a dozen imperial whoo-hoos!

855
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:07,199
The higher the kite goes,

856
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:10,202
all those ridiculous thoughts
from King Charles's head

857
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:12,329
seem to just dissolve away.

858
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:15,958
I like that one, but tell me more
about the impecunious debtor

859
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,210
with his dreadful concertina.

860
00:55:18,252 --> 00:55:22,047
- "There's something on the way."
- "Something will turn up."

861
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:26,093
- Yes, that's it.
- An excellent precept, young man.

862
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:30,180
Oh! We have a new master
in our midst.

863
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:32,349
Professor Micawber.

864
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:35,644
Good morning, boys.

865
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:37,855
Please, be seated.

866
00:55:37,897 --> 00:55:40,274
Oh, dear Lord,
this place must be short of money.

867
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:44,612
You lived with the professor when you were
in London, I do believe, Mr Copperfield.

868
00:55:44,653 --> 00:55:49,617
Professor? Yes, briefly,
and at the same time lengthily.

869
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,827
Very nice. Very genteel.

870
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,163
Uriah.

871
00:55:56,916 --> 00:55:59,209
- Good morning, boys.
- Sir.

872
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:01,629
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

873
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,047
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

874
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:12,264
Now, which dish
from the great feast of knowledge

875
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:16,644
is it our mutual privilege to partake of
at this current juncture?

876
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:21,565
In short, which lesson is it now?

877
00:56:21,607 --> 00:56:23,442
It's Latin grammar now, sir.

878
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,403
Latin?

879
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:28,572
Good.

880
00:56:28,614 --> 00:56:30,199
Good. Um...

881
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:33,661
<i>Amo, amas, amat.</i>

882
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:35,996
Yes. <i>Amo, amas, amat.</i>

883
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,207
Gymnasium.

884
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,251
Geranium.

885
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,378
Coliseum.

886
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:45,381
Australasian.

887
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:46,507
Australasian.

888
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:47,800
Possum.

889
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:53,931
No. A possum is a beast
of an Australasian, uh, distraction.

890
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:57,393
Sniggering, gentlemen?

891
00:56:58,561 --> 00:57:01,939
Hilarity? In short, ha-ha?

892
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,275
I don't think so.

893
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:09,488
What you all need
is an aid to concentration.

894
00:57:12,992 --> 00:57:16,412
There is a belief
that music may help

895
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:20,583
in the absorption of knowledge.

896
00:57:25,504 --> 00:57:28,007
- It's him.
- Don't say anything.

897
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:42,563
Enough! Enough!

898
00:57:42,605 --> 00:57:45,691
I'm tempted to burst my eardrums
with a pair of pencils.

899
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,234
I beg your pardon, sir?

900
00:57:47,276 --> 00:57:52,406
Steerforth meant that possibly the instrument
might have developed a leak or something.

901
00:57:52,448 --> 00:57:54,450
No, not at all.

902
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:56,994
I meant that he is a dismal musician.

903
00:57:57,036 --> 00:58:01,332
Be quiet, please, Mr <i>Steelforge.</i>
Who are you to insult a gentleman?

904
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,460
And where is he, this gentleman?

905
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:07,796
- All I see is an impudent beggar.
- You...

906
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:11,884
I heard all manner
of mad wheezing, Professor.

907
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:14,094
Is there a squirrel
trapped in the pipes again?

908
00:58:14,136 --> 00:58:16,931
He is no professor.
Ask him about debtors' prison.

909
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,808
He has extorted money for years

910
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,519
and has followed Daisy here
to continue his efforts.

911
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:24,772
Uh...

912
00:58:26,023 --> 00:58:27,524
Mr <i>Steepgorge</i> is correct.

913
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:33,739
I did, to my shame,
reside within prison walls...

914
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:37,159
Even we draw the line
at employing former convicts.

915
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:40,746
And even often above that line
is where we draw the line, actually.

916
00:58:42,373 --> 00:58:45,459
We must part if you please.
Mr Heep, show him out.

917
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:49,088
Steerforth!

918
00:58:51,173 --> 00:58:52,549
Micawber is harmless.

919
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:55,094
The rogue was exploiting
your charitable good nature.

920
00:58:55,135 --> 00:58:58,514
- You should be thanking me, Daisy.
- My name is David! Not Daisy, not Trot!

921
00:58:58,555 --> 00:59:01,350
- My name is David Copperfield!
- Then why don't you go by it?

922
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:04,019
Big step.

923
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:06,564
- Up you go.
- Mr Micawber!

924
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:08,065
In you go.

925
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:10,985
- Mr Micawber.
- Master Copperfield.

926
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:14,697
No sooner are we reunited
than we must part again.

927
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:19,577
Like the Bible story. I'm sure
there must be a Bible story about that.

928
00:59:19,618 --> 00:59:20,619
Yes.

929
00:59:21,537 --> 00:59:25,040
Were you aware I studied
at Mrs Strong's before you came here?

930
00:59:25,082 --> 00:59:26,417
Not as I recall, no.

931
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,920
But your being here as a professor,
in the same building as me...?

932
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:34,842
Pure kismet and happenstance.
"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods."

933
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:37,595
- To quote our ultimate poet.
- Shakespeare.

934
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:40,306
All aboard. Who's going aboard?

935
00:59:40,347 --> 00:59:42,182
I wonder, um...

936
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:45,603
I found the funds
for my family's travel,

937
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:49,523
but my own fare is lacking.

938
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:52,401
- I wonder if I could trouble you...
- No trouble.

939
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:54,153
- ...for the exact sum...
- Of course.

940
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:56,405
...of four pounds,
ten and thruppence?

941
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,956
Five pounds.

942
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:11,378
I will, uh, make sure
that we are quadrilaterally concluded.

943
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,422
In short, square.

944
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:15,466
Geometry.

945
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:18,010
Safe travels.

946
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:21,597
I imagine you've forgotten.

947
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:25,726
- What?
- I imagine you've forgotten.

948
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:27,478
Tea!

949
01:00:29,146 --> 01:00:30,940
There you go.

950
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,150
Cake? It's quite heavy.

951
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:35,778
I like a heavy cake.

952
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:40,032
I like to... to know I've had a cake.

953
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:42,701
- He can't abide a light sponge.
- I see.

954
01:00:43,827 --> 01:00:45,579
Well, this looks very, uh...

955
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:54,797
Mm. Good Lord. That's, um...

956
01:00:56,006 --> 01:00:57,967
It's wonderfully dense. Hm.

957
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:03,430
Oh, I see you're studying, Mr Heep.

958
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:05,391
Uriah, if you can bear to.

959
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:09,562
Yes. I'm trying to improve
my legal knowledge.

960
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:15,985
I'm hopeful that Mr Wickfield might be willing
to take me on as an apprentice at law.

961
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:17,736
Perhaps you'll become a partner.

962
01:01:18,988 --> 01:01:20,406
Do you mock me?

963
01:01:21,323 --> 01:01:25,953
You seem to search for mockery.
That was meant sincerely, Uriah.

964
01:01:25,995 --> 01:01:29,290
Uriah! Did you hear that?
He said Uriah.

965
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:31,500
- I did.
- Unprompted, Mother.

966
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,918
And him a gentleman.

967
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,588
It is like the blowing of old breezes
to hear you say Uriah.

968
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:37,923
It thrills me to the stomach.

969
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,804
Time is an issue? Are you worried
humbleness is an infectious disease?

970
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:45,973
Oh, no.
I cannot stay too long is all.

971
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:50,227
- You can if I bar the door.
- We could keep him as a little pet.

972
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,147
I beg your pardon?

973
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:55,399
It was a joke.
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

974
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:59,862
I've been attempting to learn
gentlemen's humour from a book.

975
01:01:59,904 --> 01:02:01,822
- He has.
- Indeed.

976
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:04,617
What do you think of Mr Wickfield?

977
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,704
He takes his wine with an enviable degree
of enjoyment, don't he?

978
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,916
- I've seen him take wine, but...
- You've seen him?

979
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,084
That's good to know.

980
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:23,385
Your associate, the, uh... the professor.

981
01:02:23,427 --> 01:02:24,845
He's a sort, isn't he?

982
01:02:24,887 --> 01:02:28,641
Lodging with a beggar.
Is that a London particular?

983
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:31,477
Mr Micawber isn't a beggar.
He's a man of fluctuating...

984
01:02:31,518 --> 01:02:32,519
More tea.

985
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:37,650
I had an interesting little conversation
with Micawber

986
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:39,318
as I was showing him out the school.

987
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,237
Yeah, fascinating.

988
01:02:41,278 --> 01:02:42,738
Your time in London.

989
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:45,991
- Oh, Mother?
- Yes?

990
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:48,160
Bring another bottle of milk.

991
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:52,122
This bottle is empty
and another bottle is needed.

992
01:02:52,164 --> 01:02:54,583
You seem very vexed by this bottle.

993
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:03,092
Your friend Steerforth is, um...
is damning of the humbler classes.

994
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,348
A veritable factory of damnation.

995
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:14,353
How would you feel about helping me
secure a position with Mr Wickfield?

996
01:03:16,355 --> 01:03:20,234
I have a mind
to throw this cake at you.

997
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,903
It will break a rib.

998
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:25,781
You're very fond of violence,
aren't you?

999
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:29,159
Oh, look at you two.

1000
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:31,161
- More heavy cake.
- Cake.

1001
01:03:31,203 --> 01:03:33,539
You must take some home with you.

1002
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:51,056
- I should like to go home.
- Just another two hours.

1003
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:53,601
- The donkeys will be back.
- 45 minutes, then.

1004
01:03:53,642 --> 01:03:57,271
Oh, Mr Wickfield!
It is very, very uneven ground.

1005
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:59,481
I nearly slipped over myself
just a minute ago.

1006
01:03:59,523 --> 01:04:03,611
- Very dangerous indeed. We need a sign here.
- It is dangerous. We need a sign.

1007
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:04,987
- More wine?
- No, not for me.

1008
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:07,990
No, not for him.
Thank you very much.

1009
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:14,246
I see. So, do you want me to take it away,
the delicious, tannic, deep-red wine?

1010
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:15,623
Yes, please.

1011
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:21,587
Actually, maybe the smallest amount.
Thank you. An ounce.

1012
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,048
Mrs Steerforth.

1013
01:04:30,012 --> 01:04:31,847
<i>"Oi. Ladies."</i>

1014
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:34,892
"I could beat you with one hand
tied behind my back."

1015
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:37,269
Getting better.

1016
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:42,316
- James?
- Ah, Mother.

1017
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:44,026
This is, um...

1018
01:04:44,068 --> 01:04:46,946
David Copperfield.
A very great pleasure to meet you, Mrs...

1019
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:49,740
What's your background, Mr Copperfield?
Who are your people?

1020
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:53,202
- My people?
- Your family. Are you anyone?

1021
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:56,872
- My parents died when I was...
- Prep school?

1022
01:04:56,914 --> 01:05:00,376
- Yes. In London.
- I probably know it. Which one?

1023
01:05:01,543 --> 01:05:02,544
Creakle's.

1024
01:05:03,754 --> 01:05:08,550
Creakle's. Is that a saint? I don't think so.
Who was the headmaster?

1025
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:12,096
- Mr Murdstone.
- What was the uniform?

1026
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:13,847
Uh...

1027
01:05:15,224 --> 01:05:17,351
Trousers, certainly, and...

1028
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:18,310
Anyway...

1029
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:22,648
James, I'm here,
since you bleated and bleated.

1030
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,068
I'll see you at Mrs Strong's interminable speech.
I brought a book.

1031
01:05:26,652 --> 01:05:28,195
And a pillow.

1032
01:05:30,656 --> 01:05:32,783
My mother.

1033
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:34,827
- Good Lord.
- Yeah.

1034
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:36,912
- Did you notice her scar?
- Yes.

1035
01:05:36,954 --> 01:05:39,790
As a young boy
she once exasperated me

1036
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:41,333
so I threw a hammer at her.

1037
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,338
Oh.

1038
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,591
Oh, good luck and God bless.

1039
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:52,011
You were always my favourite
and the most handsome.

1040
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:54,722
- Here's a book.
- Thank you.

1041
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,518
No breeze, not a breath.

1042
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,062
The air is as still as a royal corpse.

1043
01:06:02,104 --> 01:06:03,606
- How do you do?
- Trotwood.

1044
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,108
Uh, let me introduce Mr Spenlow.

1045
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,943
- Your future employer.
- What am I to be?

1046
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:10,946
You know this, Trot.

1047
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:14,241
- A proctor.
- Yes, sorry.

1048
01:06:14,283 --> 01:06:15,951
- Good afternoon.
- Mr Spenlow.

1049
01:06:15,993 --> 01:06:17,202
Mr Spenlow.

1050
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:22,499
- Bye, Daisy.
- Don't wave at anyone.

1051
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,927
You were staring slightly.

1052
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:36,263
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No. Goodness me, no.

1053
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:40,017
- I apologise for my rudeness.
- Oh.

1054
01:06:40,726 --> 01:06:43,229
He's apologising, Jip.
Shall we forgive him?

1055
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:47,399
He says we shall.

1056
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:52,321
- Thank you, Jip.
- Think nothing of it, sir.

1057
01:06:52,363 --> 01:06:54,698
- Speaks very well.
- It was actually me.

1058
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:57,868
I like to pretend he speaks.

1059
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,162
Some people think it idiotic.

1060
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:02,915
Oh, no.
I do it myself all the time.

1061
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:06,794
Don't I, Mr... Apple Tree?

1062
01:07:06,835 --> 01:07:08,337
Yes.

1063
01:07:08,379 --> 01:07:09,880
Yes.

1064
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:13,008
I'm David Copperfield.

1065
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:15,552
Are you still being the tree?

1066
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:17,972
- No.
- I'm Dora...

1067
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,559
- ...Spenlow.
- Spenlow?

1068
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,352
Dora Spenlow?

1069
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:26,063
Yes. I don't know
why I said it like that.

1070
01:07:26,105 --> 01:07:28,857
Dora... Spenlow.

1071
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:32,778
- I don't usually stop in the middle.
- Trotwood! Mr Spenlow!

1072
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,488
- Sorry.
- Yes.

1073
01:07:35,864 --> 01:07:37,116
Bye-bye.

1074
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:40,369
- Sorry? What was that?
- Just Jip.

1075
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:43,372
Bye-bye. Tree. Apple tree.

1076
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:45,207
I know.

1077
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:48,043
- Sorry?
- I know.

1078
01:07:51,046 --> 01:07:53,215
Agnes, have you seen Mr Sp...?

1079
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:56,677
- You look very striking.
- Thank you.

1080
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:57,928
I'm in love.

1081
01:07:58,554 --> 01:08:00,723
- Really?
- Utterly.

1082
01:08:00,764 --> 01:08:02,141
With Dora... Spenlow.

1083
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:06,270
- I don't know why I said it like that, but...
- Ah. The girl with the yapping dog.

1084
01:08:06,312 --> 01:08:09,273
- What a face.
- What a voice that comes out of it.

1085
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:11,650
Do you mock me?

1086
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:16,655
I do. I do. With affection
but entirely without mercy.

1087
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,365
And up. Yes.

1088
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:21,577
Do you know Papa and I
are also moving to London?

1089
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,454
Oh, I see.

1090
01:08:23,495 --> 01:08:27,499
You probably think I'm following you.
"Help me. I'm being followed by Agnes."

1091
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,836
"She's as persistent as a bluebottle
in a sash window."

1092
01:08:31,462 --> 01:08:32,796
Oh, sorry.

1093
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,052
Mr Spenlow.
Apologies for my earlier distracted state.

1094
01:08:38,093 --> 01:08:42,388
I look forward tremendously, Mr Spenlow,
to joining Spenlow & Jorkins, Mr Spenlow.

1095
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:45,892
- Excellent. Ready to become a proctor?
- Eager to become a proctor.

1096
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:47,311
That's the attitude.

1097
01:08:47,977 --> 01:08:49,396
Let's celebrate.

1098
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:53,150
What is a proctor?

1099
01:08:53,191 --> 01:08:55,069
I haven't the faintest idea.

1100
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:58,571
But I'll take possession of my own apartments
and soon I'll find out.

1101
01:09:02,284 --> 01:09:04,995
That's Dora... Spenlow.

1102
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:06,038
Ah.

1103
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,082
I don't know who that is.

1104
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,343
<i>I returned to London for the first time
since I fled the bottling factory in rags.</i>

1105
01:09:19,385 --> 01:09:22,303
<i>This time I was a gentleman,
with money in his pocket.</i>

1106
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:25,099
<i>I was a proctor.</i>

1107
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:27,726
I don't suppose you know
what a proctor is?

1108
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:31,396
Oh, now you're asking.
Do they make hats?

1109
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:36,485
<i>I had a generous monthly allowance
from my aunt.</i>

1110
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:39,863
<i>This paid for my training
with Mr Spenlow</i>

1111
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:42,740
<i>and allowed me
to live London life to the full.</i>

1112
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:55,963
A proctor is a sort of monkish attorney.

1113
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,006
I see.

1114
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,469
Mind these floorboards.
They squeak.

1115
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:03,512
There we are.

1116
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:07,600
<i>I never learned
what a proctor was an attorney of</i>

1117
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:09,560
<i>but I soon excelled about the office.</i>

1118
01:10:11,395 --> 01:10:13,230
Floor!

1119
01:10:14,565 --> 01:10:17,776
<i>And I was conveniently positioned

I was convinced a famous soprano
was practising upstairs.

01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:03,739
You could come up

Yes. Lovely.

Dora, lovers have loved before,
but no lover shall ever love as we love.

That's very complicated, but thank you.

1151
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,243
- Mm.
- Yes.

1152
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:34,496
I'm very familiar
with the lobster people of Yarmouth.

1153
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:37,166
Do the lobster people of Yarmouth
worship lobsters?

1154
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:38,918
Do they take on their characteristics?

1155
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:43,422
If you're thinking of travelling
to Yarmouth soon, might I join you?

1156
01:12:43,464 --> 01:12:46,300
- Let's all go to Yarmouth, huh?
- No.

- Well, I want to.
- Then you shall.

Yes.

01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:30,154
That's very good.

1182
01:14:30,195 --> 01:14:33,032
Agnes, did you tell Mr Copperfield
about my new position?

1183
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:35,993
Uriah has joined the firm.

1184
01:14:36,952 --> 01:14:38,996
An apprentice to Mr Wickfield.

1185
01:14:39,038 --> 01:14:43,167
Ury couldn't make progress any faster
if he was steam-powered.

1186
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:46,587
Oh, Mother, please.
I redden in the face.

1187
01:14:47,671 --> 01:14:49,340
Nothing for me, just the wine.

1188
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,217
They live with us now.

1189
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:56,305
I hear their snores,
like lovelorn toads calling across a swamp.

1190
01:14:57,181 --> 01:14:59,350
- And how is Dora?
- Wonderful.

1191
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:01,435
Curly.

1192
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:04,188
In fact, I, um...

1193
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:09,401
I propose to intend to marriage her
in the morning.

1194
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:12,029
Oh, what pleasing news.

1195
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:13,656
Daisy!

1196
01:15:13,697 --> 01:15:15,407
Come along.

1197
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:17,785
- When am I going to Yarmouth?
- Agnes...

1198
01:15:17,826 --> 01:15:22,414
Don't follow your companions, Trot.
You need to go to bed. Good night.

1199
01:15:22,456 --> 01:15:24,917
There you are.

1200
01:15:24,959 --> 01:15:28,295
Very generous, but I may be nearing
the limits of my capacity.

1201
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:31,215
It'll get soaked up
by my dense sponge.

1202
01:15:31,257 --> 01:15:32,258
Oh.

1203
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:35,761
Wait.

1204
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:39,056
You called her Agnes just now,
not Miss Wickfield.

1205
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:41,642
I must get back to the dramatics.

1206
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:46,063
Agnes.

1207
01:16:01,745 --> 01:16:06,834
♪ And would thou hack it down ♪

1208
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:09,086
Do you like my singing, Doady?

1209
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:11,839
I'm going to call you Doady.
Do you mind?

1210
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:14,633
I love being called by other names.

1211
01:16:17,136 --> 01:16:18,512
And...

1212
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:23,976
...in return I have a new name
it is my heart's desire to offer you.

1213
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,103
Oh, no, I like Dora.

1214
01:16:26,145 --> 01:16:30,316
It reminds me of doors,
and doors are such jolly useful things.

1215
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:35,696
- Dora, may I be frank?
- Oh, no, I hate hearing frank expressions.

1216
01:16:35,738 --> 01:16:37,281
Say it like Jip.

1217
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:41,327
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1218
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:48,500
I'm intoxicated with joy
whenever I see you.

1219
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,588
I love your hair and I love...

1220
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:53,714
Sorry.

1221
01:16:53,756 --> 01:16:56,216
Yes, that just seemed odd.

1222
01:16:58,052 --> 01:17:00,262
I idolise and worship you.

1223
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:03,682
- If you'd like me to die for you, say the word...
- Oh, no, don't die.

1224
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:06,435
If you were dead,
you'd miss Jip's new trick.

1225
01:17:06,477 --> 01:17:08,354
Speak.

1226
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:09,480
Speak.

1227
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:11,899
Speak.

1228
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:16,153
Dora, I'd like to ask you...

1229
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:19,531
Mr Copperfield,
your landlady sends a message.

1230
01:17:19,573 --> 01:17:24,286
A man with a kite and a severe lady
have arrived and need to see you now.

1231
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:27,706
- At my lodgings?
- Yes. Now.

1232
01:17:27,748 --> 01:17:31,835
- You were going to ask me if...?
- If you would wait for my question later.

1233
01:17:46,684 --> 01:17:49,979
- Trotwood, I'm ruined.
- Like a castle.

1234
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:54,066
- So, Mr Dick suggested we come here.
- Ruined? But how can you be ruined?

1235
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:56,902
- Like a big castle.
- Because I've lost everything, Trot.

1236
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:59,405
- In the mining way and the banking way.
- Banking, mining.

1237
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:06,704
<i>Mr Wickfield cannot fully explain why,
but our money is gone.</i>

1238
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:12,751
<i>We've had to say farewell to lovely Janet,
close up the house and walk away</i>

1239
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:14,211
from our beautiful garden.

1240
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:16,672
Like a paradise for donkeys now.

1241
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:21,760
My shares have plummeted
like lead droppings from a stone goose.

1242
01:18:21,802 --> 01:18:26,390
And all I have left are my clothes,
my porcelain bird

1243
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:27,975
and my Hesperis Diviniana.

1244
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:30,185
- It's the plant.
- And Mr Dick.

1245
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:31,353
It's me.

1246
01:18:32,062 --> 01:18:33,898
No, this can't happen.

1247
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:39,069
I'll never again let light and goodness
turn to gloom, as it did in my past.

1248
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:42,740
Well, we're not the only ones to suffer.
There are two bailiffs' carts in this street.

1249
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:45,451
Surely Mr Wickfield
has been monitoring your affairs?

1250
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:49,371
- Mr Wickfield has troubles of his own.
- He often sleeps during the day.

1251
01:18:49,413 --> 01:18:50,706
Because of...

1252
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:56,045
I have no notion what that spasmodic gesture
is supposed to indicate.

1253
01:18:56,086 --> 01:18:58,672
If you're talking about overindulgence,

1254
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:01,800
have you returned
to the bottling business of your youth?

1255
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:05,554
- I entertained some friends.
- I beg your pardon?

1256
01:19:05,596 --> 01:19:09,475
Well, they seemed to number
the entire populace of the city.

1257
01:19:09,516 --> 01:19:11,936
You'll have no money for that now.

1258
01:19:11,977 --> 01:19:14,897
Mr Dick, can you cast any more light
on what has happened?

1259
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:16,148
Yes, I can.

1260
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,069
The day before yesterday, she said:
"Mr Dick, I am ruined".

1261
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,738
And I said: "Oh, indeed?"
And then we travelled here.

1262
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:26,617
That's not a lot of light.

1263
01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:28,911
We had bottled porter
and sandwiches.

1264
01:19:28,953 --> 01:19:30,913
Do you understand what ruin means?

1265
01:19:32,248 --> 01:19:36,752
It means distress
and want and starvation.

1266
01:19:39,964 --> 01:19:42,007
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

1267
01:19:46,095 --> 01:19:48,847
"By what earthly power
do you condemn me?"

1268
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,599
"By what authority?"

1269
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:53,227
Mr Dick, we must try to keep
a cheerful countenance.

1270
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:56,355
- Yes?
- Absolutely. Cheerful.

1271
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:58,941
There's what looks like a bit of meat
stuck on the wall.

1272
01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:02,194
What?

1273
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:05,656
We'll ensure
this cannot happen again.

1274
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:10,744
Although that's problematic, considering
I've no idea how it happened in the first place.

1275
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:14,248
But, of course,
we'll authorise a loan to tide you over.

1276
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:17,418
Thank you. I promise repayment will occur
just as soon as something...

1277
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:18,877
Something turns up?

1278
01:20:19,753 --> 01:20:21,171
With respect, Mr...
Excuse me.

1279
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:26,635
With respect, Mr Wickfield,
I think a more sober judgement is required

1280
01:20:26,677 --> 01:20:28,804
when considering a loan of this nature.

1281
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:29,930
I am sober.

1282
01:20:29,972 --> 01:20:33,142
Mr Copperfield, I'm afraid
a loan is out of the question. Apologies.

1283
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:35,436
Do you have authority here, Uriah?

1284
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:39,565
Yes, and it's Mr Heep,
as in Wickfield & Heep.

1285
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:42,067
I am a partner.

1286
01:20:44,904 --> 01:20:46,238
Agnes, could you...?

1287
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:49,992
We are drinking
to the firm hands of Mr Heep

1288
01:20:50,034 --> 01:20:53,537
who is grasping
or co-grasping the tiller.

1289
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:58,250
Yes, we can all of us, man and woman,
benefit from having a partner.

1290
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,960
Do you not agree, Agnes?

1291
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:04,256
In times of trouble we must all do
that which we must do.

1292
01:21:04,298 --> 01:21:07,134
Small heavy cakes
to go with the sherry.

1293
01:21:07,885 --> 01:21:09,929
Like tasty billiard balls.

1294
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:12,765
Mother, have you seen?

1295
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:15,684
Oh, Ury.

1296
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,355
- Those two are weeds.
- Get a drink for Mr Wickfield.

1297
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:21,815
I've seen a pair like them before.

1298
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:26,946
Unchecked, they will overrun and choke
all life and joy from this place.

1299
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:31,700
- They must be stopped.
- I fear the time for that has passed.

1300
01:21:31,742 --> 01:21:34,578
- To partnerships.
- Partnerships.

1301
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,874
I'm far too humble to say
that I've saved this firm, but...

1302
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:43,837
Uriah has been very good
for our business.

1303
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:48,592
He has. He's been diversifying
in smaller rental properties.

1304
01:21:48,634 --> 01:21:52,805
In parts of London
that aren't necessarily first choice.

1305
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:56,350
Is one of these properties
to be my only choice?

1306
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:07,987
<i>This is your new lodgings.</i>

1307
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:12,908
It may be not the most spacious
of properties,

1308
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:18,497
but it would suit someone
in your circumstances very well indeed.

1309
01:22:18,539 --> 01:22:22,209
I am not someone
in my circumstances.

1310
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:23,502
No, of course.

1311
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:27,715
- At least we won't get lost in here.
- Can't fly your kite in here.

1312
01:22:27,756 --> 01:22:31,760
Well, you can't fly a kite in a house anyway.
There's no breeze. See?

1313
01:22:31,802 --> 01:22:34,013
No, I bow to your expertise.

1314
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:36,890
Can't fly his kite
but he could swat an irritant.

1315
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,352
Well, enjoy your lodgings.

1316
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:44,899
If any problems arise,
I suggest you tend to them yourselves.

1317
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:48,527
- He's a fellow.
- We'll make do.

1318
01:22:48,569 --> 01:22:52,406
Ale for me now. Much better for you
than wine anyway, much less bilious.

1319
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:54,491
I should like to make a contribution.

1320
01:22:55,784 --> 01:22:57,870
- Oh, Mr Dick.
- Will you...?

1321
01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:02,124
And it's this.

1322
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:13,302
I would have been shut up
to lead a very dismal life these last years

1323
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:14,845
if you hadn't taken me in,

1324
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:18,849
the way David's friends
took those orphans in in Yarmouth.

1325
01:23:18,891 --> 01:23:21,644
Wait. Yarmouth. What's today?

1326
01:23:21,685 --> 01:23:24,480
- Oh, I know this. Uh, Wednesday.
- It's Tuesday, Trot.

1327
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:27,900
Tuesday? I should be meeting Steerforth
to take him to Yarmouth.

1328
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:29,526
He'll be waiting for me.

1329
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:34,198
I could postpone.

1330
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,866
No, no. Go, go.

1331
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:38,702
Mr Dick and I, meanwhile, will...

1332
01:23:38,744 --> 01:23:42,998
We will, uh, transform this
into the most desirable mousehole in London.

1333
01:23:51,924 --> 01:23:53,926
Sorry! Pardon me!

1334
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:55,803
Sorry, ma'am!

1335
01:24:09,608 --> 01:24:13,279
Apologies for my lateness.
I've just been in my apartment,

1336
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,990
which is there...

1337
01:24:16,031 --> 01:24:20,369
Two bags? Such extravagance,
given how much the coach people charge.

1338
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,667
Ah. Uh, no, this contains laundry
for my housekeeper to collect.

1339
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:29,211
Hm. Curious arrangement.

1340
01:24:29,253 --> 01:24:32,506
We should get to the Spread Eagle.
Our coach leaves in ten minutes.

1341
01:24:53,444 --> 01:24:57,114
- <i>I hope you like the boathouse.</i>
- <i>With the lobster people?</i>

1342
01:24:57,156 --> 01:24:59,199
<i>The lobster people are rough,</i>

1343
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:03,037
<i>but the dwelling itself
is such a sparkling sight to behold.</i>

1344
01:25:06,665 --> 01:25:08,918
What a delightful residence.

1345
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:12,588
In my recollection
it was more colourful.

1346
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:15,799
Peggotty?

1347
01:25:15,841 --> 01:25:19,637
Oh! Hello! Davy.

1348
01:25:19,678 --> 01:25:21,722
Oh, look at you.

1349
01:25:21,764 --> 01:25:25,809
You've growed out of all knowledge.
You in good kelter, boy?

1350
01:25:26,602 --> 01:25:30,105
Good kelter, I... are.
Yes, I'm very well, thank you.

1351
01:25:30,147 --> 01:25:32,566
This is my dear friend,
James Steerforth.

1352
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:36,946
This young man's affections for you are such
that I feel like I know you all.

1353
01:25:36,987 --> 01:25:39,990
- Aw.
- Peggotty, it's such an honour to meet you.

1354
01:25:40,032 --> 01:25:42,034
Oh, you have a lovely speaking voice.

1355
01:25:43,494 --> 01:25:47,039
- That's a very bright waistcoat.
- It's brocade. Savile Row.

1356
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:48,999
That's a row in London.

1357
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:53,128
See, now, we mardled plenty
with this 'un when he was a nipper,

1358
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:55,839
and we're uncommon proud of him, thankee.

1359
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:57,633
That's dialect, isn't it?

1360
01:25:58,384 --> 01:26:02,012
I am fascinated in how language changes
around the country.

1361
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:05,724
We can write it down for you
if it's too difficult. We can write.

1362
01:26:06,392 --> 01:26:08,644
- Come through here. It's the perfect...
- Mind your head!

1363
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:11,981
It's the perfect little bedroom
I told you about.

1364
01:26:12,022 --> 01:26:13,274
Mind your head!

1365
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:15,442
Ah!

1366
01:26:15,484 --> 01:26:17,319
Mrs Gummidge ain't well.

1367
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:20,531
She brings up more than she eats these days.
Don't you, my love?

1368
01:26:20,573 --> 01:26:23,701
They say it can't be done.
But I does it.

1369
01:26:25,286 --> 01:26:27,580
- Look who's here, Emily.
- Davy!

1370
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:29,248
Mind your head.

1371
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:31,584
- How are you?
- Good to see you again, Davy.

1372
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,919
- My friend, James Steerforth.
- Oh.

1373
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:37,339
- And to meet you, sir.
- Emily.

1374
01:26:37,381 --> 01:26:40,634
Daisy tells me that you like to climb
the masts of sailing boats.

1375
01:26:40,676 --> 01:26:42,636
You can see for miles up there.

1376
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:45,139
All the ladies off to the ball
at Browston Manor.

1377
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:48,100
Did you just call Davy Daisy?

1378
01:26:48,142 --> 01:26:49,852
Is that dialect?

1379
01:26:49,894 --> 01:26:53,480
We've no food, so don't expect food.

1380
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:56,609
- We do have food.
- Fish.

1381
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:59,987
I imagine you and Ham
have been married for some years now.

1382
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:02,615
- No.
- Still engaged, still not married.

1383
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,659
- Oh.
- Been saving up, though, haven't we?

1384
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:08,454
Trying to decide
where we might want to live.

1385
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:09,580
We wanna live here,

1386
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:12,333
knock up our own boathouse,
a couple of hundred yards up the coast.

1387
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:14,126
Or we could go further.

1388
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:17,087
Of course we could.
Half a mile, three quarters even.

1389
01:27:17,129 --> 01:27:18,964
Oh, Peggotty.

1390
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:24,803
I fear I'm going to be sick
in a substantial way.

1391
01:27:24,845 --> 01:27:27,348
No matter.
Our floor is a beach.

1392
01:27:28,557 --> 01:27:31,602
- Bucket coming through. Excuse me.
- I'll just grab my bag.

1393
01:27:31,644 --> 01:27:33,479
Mind your head!

1394
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,858
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
I'll see you again very soon.

1395
01:27:40,069 --> 01:27:43,072
That stern looks like new, my friend.
Splendid.

1396
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:45,991
<i>I found it curious
how almost immediately</i>

1397
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,701
<i>and without the least effort,</i>

1398
01:27:47,743 --> 01:27:51,288
<i>Steerforth managed to charm
and beguile my Yarmouth friends.</i>

1399
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:54,333
The manager,
he turns to me and he says:

1400
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:58,545
"I've had 30 people
use that towel before you, sir,

1401
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:01,590
and you're the first
to complain that it's dirty."

1402
01:28:04,885 --> 01:28:08,180
- Look at him.
- He's faster than me.

1403
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:13,477
- Very nice knife work there, Mr Steerforth.
- Why, thank you. I could be a murderer.

1404
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:15,229
Very nice work.

1405
01:28:19,608 --> 01:28:23,070
Steerforth, Ham and Emily
were just saying the same as me,

1406
01:28:23,112 --> 01:28:25,406
that everyone loves James Steerforth.

1407
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:26,532
Ha!

1408
01:28:26,574 --> 01:28:29,702
Everyone except James Steerforth,
my dear friend.

1409
01:28:33,163 --> 01:28:35,666
Did you have enough money
to pay for the drinks?

1410
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:37,084
- Plenty.
- Are you sure?

1411
01:28:37,126 --> 01:28:38,210
Yes, I am.

1412
01:28:38,252 --> 01:28:43,507
Promise me, Daisy, won't you,
that you'll think of me at my best?

1413
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:45,759
Promise me that much.

1414
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:47,761
Yes. You seem low.

1415
01:28:48,762 --> 01:28:51,765
- Where's this sudden cloud come from?
- Who's up for a shanty?

1416
01:28:53,684 --> 01:28:57,813
♪ One Friday morn when we set sail

1417
01:28:57,855 --> 01:29:00,816

1418
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,446

1422

Yeah!

1423
01:29:24,882 --> 01:29:26,175
<i>Your last night.</i>

1424
01:29:26,216 --> 01:29:28,469
I'm gonna miss this little routine.

1425
01:29:29,261 --> 01:29:31,931
There you go.
Got a bit of privacy for you now.

1426
01:29:32,514 --> 01:29:36,852
- That's all I do have at the moment.
- Oh, I know, my love.

1427
01:29:36,894 --> 01:29:40,356
But you had nothing, then you had something,
now you've got nothing again,

1428
01:29:40,397 --> 01:29:43,442
so stands to right
you'll have something again.

1429
01:29:43,484 --> 01:29:46,320
- I wish I could be so sure it worked like that.
- Uncle!

1430
01:29:46,362 --> 01:29:49,073
Have you seen all that herring
with their guts still intact?

1431
01:29:49,114 --> 01:29:51,408
- Uncle.
- What's that Emily been up to?

1432
01:29:52,326 --> 01:29:54,036
Emily's written you a note, Uncle.

1433
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,584
"Dear Uncle,

1434
01:30:00,626 --> 01:30:05,464
when you, who love me
better than I deserve, read this,

1435
01:30:06,298 --> 01:30:08,175
I shall have gone far away

1436
01:30:08,217 --> 01:30:11,804
and will not return
unless he brings me back as a lady."

1437
01:30:12,846 --> 01:30:15,307
- Emily.
- And Steerforth.

1438
01:30:16,934 --> 01:30:18,727
They'll be in the boat he rented.

1439
01:30:21,939 --> 01:30:23,440
<i>We set off in the morning,</i>

1440
01:30:24,191 --> 01:30:26,402
<i>and I pray you do not come after.</i>

1441
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:32,241
<i>Ham, love some good girl
that'll be true to you.</i>

1442
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:34,451
Emily! Emily, jump!

1443
01:30:34,493 --> 01:30:35,703
No, Ham!

1444
01:30:35,744 --> 01:30:38,706
<i>And forget me as if I died
and were buried somewhere.</i>

1445
01:30:39,498 --> 01:30:40,666
Steerforth!

1446
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:44,295
Send word if that louse's mother knows
where they've gone.

1447
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:52,845
<i>Don't search for me.</i>

1448
01:30:53,762 --> 01:30:55,180
<i>Don't come looking.</i>

1449
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:00,519
<i>For you will not know me...</i>

1450
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:04,940
<i>...even if you find me.</i>

1451
01:31:07,192 --> 01:31:09,737
<i>For he will have made me a lady.</i>

1452
01:31:12,114 --> 01:31:15,951
A lady?
She's far below him. A lady!

1453
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:19,455
Could you?

1454
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:25,961
All I've chosen to ignore in your son
of snobbery...

1455
01:31:26,962 --> 01:31:29,798
...and an unyielding, wilful spirit
I see in you, madam.

1456
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:31,425
I beg your pardon?

1457
01:31:34,887 --> 01:31:35,971
Do you see this?

1458
01:31:36,764 --> 01:31:39,808
- It's tea.
- And this and this and this. Tea.

1459
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:42,311
Every Wednesday,
James joins me here for tea

1460
01:31:42,353 --> 01:31:47,024
and this tea shall not be removed
from the table until he returns.

1461
01:31:47,066 --> 01:31:48,234
That shall be his welcome.

1462
01:31:49,526 --> 01:31:54,323
Well, I'm sure he'll find it
cold and stale. Door.

1463
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:00,746
And as for her,
if there were any word of comfort

1464
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:03,165
that would be of solace to her
in her dying hour,

1465
01:32:03,207 --> 01:32:06,252
I wouldn't part with it for life itself.

1466
01:32:08,295 --> 01:32:10,631
- You looking for a lift, sir?
- No.

1467
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:19,014
I think I know what you're about to say.

1468
01:32:19,056 --> 01:32:21,350
You have no reason
to worry about my answer.

1469
01:32:21,392 --> 01:32:22,726
I need to tell you...

1470
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,354
I have no money.

1471
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:28,023
I don't fully understand.

1472
01:32:29,942 --> 01:32:32,361
- I'm poor.
- Well, no matter.

1473
01:32:32,403 --> 01:32:37,199
But, Jip must have a mutton chop
every day at 12 or he will die.

1474
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:41,370
Precisely. So how, my love,
should we get the meat?

1475
01:32:43,998 --> 01:32:45,291
So, my answer is yes.

1476
01:32:45,332 --> 01:32:48,627
I will marry you, Doady.
Let's go and tell Papa.

1477
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,505
Let's do that,
for I am so happy.

1478
01:32:53,882 --> 01:32:55,926
- Did he...?
- He did!

1479
01:32:56,552 --> 01:33:01,098
Congratulations, Dora and Trotwood.

1480
01:33:04,643 --> 01:33:06,228
That is wonderful.

1481
01:33:07,187 --> 01:33:09,023
You will have a happy lifetime.

1482
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,818
- Lifetime?
- 60 years at least.

1483
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:17,323
Too many people in this street
for me to get a run with my kite.

1484
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:19,450
Ah, now, look.

1485
01:33:20,451 --> 01:33:22,494
Ah. Can't go that way, Mr Dick.

1486
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:25,039
The gentleman who makes my waistcoats
is up there

1487
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,792
and I haven't been able
to fully clear my debt with him, so...

1488
01:33:30,169 --> 01:33:31,879
We'll head over this way.

1489
01:33:39,345 --> 01:33:41,805
Mr...? Mr Micawber?

1490
01:33:45,517 --> 01:33:48,812
My dear young friend.

1491
01:33:48,854 --> 01:33:50,981
And I believe Mr Dixon?

1492
01:33:51,565 --> 01:33:54,151
- Are you well?
- Never better.

1493
01:33:55,027 --> 01:33:57,321
- Right.
- And how's Mrs Micawber?

1494
01:33:57,905 --> 01:34:00,407
In even finer fettle than I am.

1495
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:02,868
There she is over there.

1496
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:05,120
With our happy tribe of dependents.

1497
01:34:07,873 --> 01:34:09,541
Do you live on the streets now?

1498
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:13,212
Well, uh, we do currently exist
primarily <i>al fresco</i>

1499
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:16,131
but with all the advantages
that that entails.

1500
01:34:16,173 --> 01:34:17,633
It's much better living outside.

1501
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:20,219
Every meal's a picnic.

1502
01:34:20,261 --> 01:34:22,429
- Segment?
- Oh, thank you.

1503
01:34:26,016 --> 01:34:30,020
David Copperfield.
Might you help me, Master David?

1504
01:34:30,062 --> 01:34:31,480
Yes. What do you need?

1505
01:34:31,522 --> 01:34:34,984
I popped me concertina
with the Floral Street pawnbroker.

1506
01:34:35,943 --> 01:34:37,152
I'd love it back

1507
01:34:37,194 --> 01:34:41,699
but he knows me and he will charge
much more than the six bob that it's worth.

1508
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,534
I need a surrogate.

1509
01:34:47,663 --> 01:34:50,332
- How much for the concertina?
- Ten bob.

1510
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:55,921
What if I offered you six shillings?

1511
01:34:56,964 --> 01:34:57,965
No.

1512
01:34:59,425 --> 01:35:05,222
But I can let you have a fishing rod
for six shillings.

1513
01:35:13,564 --> 01:35:14,565
Is that a concertina?

1514
01:35:15,816 --> 01:35:19,194
- With all due respect, is that a concertina?
- It's not a concertina.

1515
01:35:19,236 --> 01:35:22,031
No. What we need is the concertina.

1516
01:35:22,865 --> 01:35:24,325
You tricked me.

1517
01:35:24,366 --> 01:35:27,202
All right. You can have
the damn squeezebox.

1518
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:31,457
For 11 shillings. Actually, no.

1519
01:35:32,124 --> 01:35:35,419
Twelve shillings.
Thirteen shillings. A pound.

1520
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:37,087
You can have it for a pound.

1521
01:35:37,796 --> 01:35:40,758
- How much for the mad wax biscuits?
- Yeah.

1522
01:35:41,634 --> 01:35:45,304
The wax seals.
Interesting story about them, actually.

1523
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:46,555
I basically... Oi!

1524
01:35:47,139 --> 01:35:50,434
- Run! I'm a criminal!
- There's the concertina!

1525
01:35:50,476 --> 01:35:51,977
Oi!

1526
01:35:53,854 --> 01:35:56,774
I preferred, I think,
the larger apartment.

1527
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:03,030
We were sadly not able
to express a preference.

1528
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:06,825
I'm sure it's only small
because Doady is saving for a castle.

1529
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:09,328
Is he really, do you think?

1530
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:11,664
Will the lady be in soon
with some tea?

1531
01:36:12,665 --> 01:36:16,460
I will fetch some tea.
The lady does not exist.

1532
01:36:16,502 --> 01:36:19,088
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Will she ever?

1533
01:36:20,798 --> 01:36:23,801
Dora, when I was your age,

1534
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:27,638
I made an unsuitable marriage.

1535
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:32,726
With a man.
I've, uh, bitterly regretted it ever since.

1536
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:38,399
We were simply very young
and incompatible.

1537
01:36:42,152 --> 01:36:43,153
Oh.

1538
01:36:46,365 --> 01:36:48,534
I'm so sorry
you found the wrong man.

1539
01:36:48,576 --> 01:36:51,203
It makes me doubly happy
that I found the right one.

1540
01:36:53,122 --> 01:36:54,832
Bless me, you're very young.

1541
01:37:04,925 --> 01:37:09,263
- If anything, it plays sweeter than before.
- Bravo.

1542
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:13,767
What an adventure we have had.
You know, you should write about all of this.

1543
01:37:13,809 --> 01:37:14,810
Peggotty!

1544
01:37:16,687 --> 01:37:19,982
- Peggotty.
- Davy, my precious potato.

1545
01:37:22,568 --> 01:37:25,279
- Mr Micawber. Mr Dick.
- It's Peggotty.

1546
01:37:25,321 --> 01:37:29,116
- What brings you to London?
- Well, Dan and Ham asked me to come.

1547
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:31,785
You know, they've been searching
all this time for Emily.

1548
01:37:31,827 --> 01:37:32,912
Emily!

1549
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:35,789
<i>They've been up and down the country
trying to look for her.</i>

1550
01:37:35,831 --> 01:37:37,666
Ham even sailed all the way to France

1551
01:37:37,708 --> 01:37:41,337
cos he heard that Emily
and... that man had been seen.

1552
01:37:41,378 --> 01:37:43,047
But now they're looking in London.

1553
01:37:43,088 --> 01:37:45,716
They've narrowed it down
to a few streets to the east.

1554
01:37:45,758 --> 01:37:46,842
Emily!

1555
01:37:46,884 --> 01:37:49,053
They've gonna find her, Davy.
I just know it.

1556
01:37:49,094 --> 01:37:51,597
A most arduous expedition.

1557
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:53,807
I doff what remains of my hat to them.

1558
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:56,977
You need to love those that help you out
and help out the ones you love.

1559
01:37:57,019 --> 01:37:58,520
That's a Peggotty proverb.

1560
01:37:59,271 --> 01:38:01,523
You're a very charitable woman.

1561
01:38:04,193 --> 01:38:05,611
Mr Micawber...

1562
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:08,781
I'd love to.

1563
01:38:11,283 --> 01:38:13,244
Where shall I put these?

1564
01:38:13,285 --> 01:38:16,372
Which one of you
requires a change of nature? Come on.

1565
01:38:17,248 --> 01:38:20,334
Are my... papers anywhere?

1566
01:38:20,376 --> 01:38:25,297
And you've, uh...
You've never given a professional recital?

1567
01:38:25,339 --> 01:38:29,176
That's a very perceptive question.
I have never been seriously approached.

1568
01:38:29,218 --> 01:38:31,929
Peggotty, have you seen
my papers anywhere?

1569
01:38:31,971 --> 01:38:36,225
You should write a story
about our adventure at the pawn shop.

1570
01:38:36,267 --> 01:38:37,685
That would make a cracking tale.

1571
01:38:37,726 --> 01:38:41,105
I should try to write it down
if I could just find my...

1572
01:38:41,146 --> 01:38:45,192
No, no, no, Trot. No, not "try".
You will write it down.

1573
01:38:45,234 --> 01:38:47,361
- You're a writer, Trot.
- Hear, hear!

1574
01:38:47,403 --> 01:38:49,196
Where? I can barely
move my elbows in here.

1575
01:38:49,238 --> 01:38:51,740
- Oh! Shall we...?
- Yeah, I think we should.

1576
01:38:51,782 --> 01:38:53,284
Step this way.

1577
01:38:54,201 --> 01:38:56,370
We've prepared somewhere
for you to write, Trot.

1578
01:38:56,412 --> 01:38:59,039
Next batch of children
for the chamber pot.

1579
01:38:59,081 --> 01:39:01,417
You probably want a bit of privacy.
Sorry. Come on.

1580
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:04,878
- It's a little room.
- Write time.

1581
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,423
- There you are. Peace and quiet.
- Here.

1582
01:39:12,886 --> 01:39:15,723
"A house made from a boat."

1583
01:39:15,764 --> 01:39:18,183
"Draw a house or draw a boat."

1584
01:39:19,894 --> 01:39:21,186
"Or draw a boat."

1585
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:26,442
Do you see this?

1586
01:39:26,483 --> 01:39:27,651
"Do you see this?"

1587
01:39:27,693 --> 01:39:28,777
It's tea.

1588
01:39:28,819 --> 01:39:30,404
"Tea."

1589
01:39:30,446 --> 01:39:32,364
- It's tea.
- "It's tea."

1590
01:39:33,157 --> 01:39:36,535
This tea shall not be removed
from the table until he returns.

1591
01:39:36,577 --> 01:39:38,662
"Until he returns."

1592
01:39:39,788 --> 01:39:44,001
<i>She was a clever woman.
She brought everything to a grindstone</i>

1593
01:39:44,043 --> 01:39:47,588
<i>and sharpened it as she had sharpened
her own face and figure over the years.</i>

1594
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,970
<i>Mr Micawber,</i>

1595
01:39:55,012 --> 01:39:59,141
<i>a rake-thin, middle-aged person,
carried a jaunty sort of stick.</i>

1596
01:39:59,183 --> 01:40:00,768
More creditors.

1597
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:04,438
<i>His methods for avoiding creditors
were as inventive</i>

1598
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,190
<i>as they were elaborate.</i>

1599
01:40:08,984 --> 01:40:10,611
Oi! I know who you are!

1600
01:40:10,653 --> 01:40:11,654
<i>Come here!</i>

1601
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:14,823
<i>Work hard.</i>

1602
01:40:14,865 --> 01:40:18,577
Procrastination is the thief of time, David.
Collar him!

1603
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:20,955
"Collar him!"

1604
01:40:20,996 --> 01:40:22,248
<i>In my factory</i>

1605
01:40:22,289 --> 01:40:26,085
<i>pistons nodded
like melancholy mad elephants.</i>

1606
01:40:26,126 --> 01:40:28,963
<i>I became one of those
who live solitarily in great cities,</i>

1607
01:40:29,004 --> 01:40:31,048
<i>like in a bucket of a human well.</i>

1608
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:33,133
<i>You can't take
from someone who has nothing!</i>

1609
01:40:33,175 --> 01:40:35,386
I deserve more than this, far more.

1610
01:40:35,427 --> 01:40:37,680
I need more, sir. Please, sir.

1611
01:40:38,764 --> 01:40:41,475
<i>My Aunt Betsey was
a tall, hard-featured lady...</i>

1612
01:40:41,517 --> 01:40:42,601
Janet!

1613
01:40:42,643 --> 01:40:46,730
<i>...with quick bright eyes
and the most kind and forgiving spirit.</i>

1614
01:40:47,815 --> 01:40:50,818
My mind is as clear as a soap bubble!

1615
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:53,571
<i>Mr Dick moved
as if playing the kettledrums.</i>

1616
01:40:53,612 --> 01:40:56,865
<i>Peggotty had cheeks and arms
so hard and red</i>

1617
01:40:56,907 --> 01:40:59,910
<i>that I wondered the birds did not peck her
instead of the apples.</i>

1618
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:01,996
<i>Mr Murdstone was firm.</i>

1619
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,790
<i>Nobody in his world was to be so firm
as Mr Murdstone,</i>

1620
01:41:05,374 --> 01:41:09,253
<i>for everybody was to be bent
to his firmness.</i>

1621
01:41:09,878 --> 01:41:13,507
Everyone except James Steerforth,
my dear friend.

1622
01:41:13,549 --> 01:41:17,219
<i>There was a passionate dejection
in Steerforth's manner that amazed me.</i>

1623
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:19,305
What a confident gentleman he is.

1624
01:41:19,346 --> 01:41:22,308
<i>Uriah Heep hovered
like a great vulture,</i>

1625
01:41:22,349 --> 01:41:24,476
<i>gorging himself on our company.</i>

1626
01:41:24,518 --> 01:41:27,813
I'm thrilled to make your acquaintance,
Master Copperfield.

1627
01:41:27,855 --> 01:41:30,065
"Master Copperfield."

1628
01:41:30,107 --> 01:41:32,276
<i>I'm in deep humility.</i>

1629
01:41:32,318 --> 01:41:35,237
<i>It's as if he lives in your nose
and is keen to get home.</i>

1630
01:41:36,155 --> 01:41:37,239
<i>Agnes.</i>

1631
01:41:37,281 --> 01:41:38,449
Yes.

1632
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:40,701
<i>Agnes. Agnes. Agnes.</i>

1633
01:41:40,743 --> 01:41:43,329
<i>You look very striking.
I'm in love. Utterly.</i>

1634
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:46,749
<i>They will overrun and choke
all life and joy from this place.</i>

1635
01:41:47,499 --> 01:41:49,209
<i>They must be stopped, Agnes.</i>

1636
01:41:51,587 --> 01:41:56,050
<i>For weeks Agnes had been observing
Heep's every movement</i>

1637
01:41:56,091 --> 01:41:58,260
<i>with meticulous care.</i>

1638
01:41:58,302 --> 01:42:01,722
<i>Finally, she entered the dwelling
in high spirits.</i>

1639
01:42:06,435 --> 01:42:08,854
The door was open.
Is this anyone's little boy?

1640
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:11,190
Think he's one of ours, yes.

1641
01:42:11,232 --> 01:42:14,777
Goodness. So many people.
Will the floor hold up?

1642
01:42:14,818 --> 01:42:18,197
Miss Trotwood, do you have a letter
bearing my father's signature?

1643
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,449
One moment. One moment.

1644
01:42:20,491 --> 01:42:24,286
- Agnes. Is something wrong?
- Something's about to be made right.

1645
01:42:25,871 --> 01:42:29,083
Ha!
I think maybe this. There it is.

1646
01:42:29,124 --> 01:42:30,584
Yes.

1647
01:42:31,293 --> 01:42:34,505
Uriah Heep's fate is in here.
But I need your help.

1648
01:42:34,546 --> 01:42:37,466
- Gather round.
- Oh, gather. Gather round.

1649
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:46,559
Mr Copperfield and Miss Wickfield.
Two fields.

1650
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,310
Neither lying fallow, I hope.

1651
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:50,187
- Clever.
- Tiresome.

1652
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:53,274
- Yes, I was being polite.
- You're not busy, Uriah?

1653
01:42:53,315 --> 01:42:58,070
Mr Heep is very busy.
Doing the work of two men, sadly.

1654
01:42:58,112 --> 01:43:02,366
Well, Mr Heep, we're here to talk to you
about Miss Trotwood's investments.

1655
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:06,704
- More people. Oh, it's a party.
- This doesn't feel like a party.

1656
01:43:06,745 --> 01:43:08,956
Shall I make us a bowl of punch?

1657
01:43:09,623 --> 01:43:12,459
We need a lemon. Miss Trotwood,
you look like you're sucking one.

1658
01:43:12,501 --> 01:43:14,128
Now, you fellow...

1659
01:43:15,546 --> 01:43:18,340
Mr Heep, you have stolen my money

1660
01:43:18,382 --> 01:43:20,884
and you have embezzled funds
from this firm.

1661
01:43:20,926 --> 01:43:22,094
That's slander.

1662
01:43:22,136 --> 01:43:24,638
- Anyone else here wanna defame me?
- I do!

1663
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,764
And me.

1664
01:43:25,806 --> 01:43:27,057
I put it to you

1665
01:43:27,099 --> 01:43:30,561
that, for your own
pecuniary aggrandisement,

1666
01:43:30,603 --> 01:43:36,025
you falsified documents
in order to mystify an individual

1667
01:43:36,066 --> 01:43:39,153
whom I will designate in code
as Mr W.

1668
01:43:39,194 --> 01:43:40,613
Wickfield?

1669
01:43:41,947 --> 01:43:43,449
- Maybe.
- Prove it.

1670
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:46,327
To prove it we would need access
to certain documents.

1671
01:43:46,368 --> 01:43:51,290
But, Agnes, wherever might we find
such documents?

1672
01:43:51,332 --> 01:43:52,958
I believe they used to be in that bureau.

1673
01:43:56,462 --> 01:43:59,632
All you've done is prove you're thieves.
You've stolen my documents.

1674
01:43:59,673 --> 01:44:03,552
Stole? Can Mr Wickfield's daughter
not tidy up her father's paper?

1675
01:44:03,594 --> 01:44:06,347
- They were in a locked drawer.
- I'm an enthusiastic tidier.

1676
01:44:06,388 --> 01:44:08,807
You stole this lady's house,
you stupid little turnip.

1677
01:44:08,849 --> 01:44:11,977
Mr Dick, what do you think?

1678
01:44:15,356 --> 01:44:17,191
- Swans.
- Where?

1679
01:44:17,233 --> 01:44:18,317
- Swans?
- Swans?

1680
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:19,443
- Swans?
- Swans?

1681
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:26,200
I've been studying these,
and when Mr Wickfield signs his name,

1682
01:44:26,242 --> 01:44:27,826
the W looks like a swan.

1683
01:44:28,577 --> 01:44:31,497
But when Mr Heep
mimics his signature,

1684
01:44:31,538 --> 01:44:35,000
his W looks like an upturned hip bath.

1685
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:37,503
You forged my signature!

1686
01:44:37,544 --> 01:44:41,215
You're the source of this calamity, Heep.
A thousand curses upon you.

1687
01:44:41,257 --> 01:44:43,592
I take it back.
A thousand and four.

1688
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:46,512
Agnes, if you have any love
for your babbling father,

1689
01:44:46,553 --> 01:44:48,639
you'll leave this gang and marry me.

1690
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:50,808
- I will ruin him otherwise.
- Never.

1691
01:44:50,849 --> 01:44:52,643
Ury, make terms. Be humble.

1692
01:44:52,685 --> 01:44:57,356
No, Mother!
No more! No more of this!

1693
01:44:57,398 --> 01:45:00,693
No more pulling off our caps,
making bows.

1694
01:45:01,735 --> 01:45:04,655
Knowing our place
and abasing ourselves before our betters!

1695
01:45:04,697 --> 01:45:06,448
No more of it!

1696
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:08,075
Do you know what I want?

1697
01:45:08,117 --> 01:45:10,828
What? A straitjacket? A husband?

1698
01:45:11,453 --> 01:45:14,540
- I want my home.
- Well, I ain't got it.

1699
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:18,669
You and yours have always hated
me and mine. And who are ya?

1700
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,129
A fine set of people.

1701
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:24,633
You, Copperfield, were pure scum
before anyone had charity on ya.

1702
01:45:24,675 --> 01:45:27,720
And you, Miss T,
you're a grim old prospect.

1703
01:45:27,761 --> 01:45:30,264
No wonder your old man
knocked you about.

1704
01:45:37,271 --> 01:45:40,065
- Aahh!
- Now stove his head in with a cake.

1705
01:45:40,107 --> 01:45:43,777
And in case that wasn't clear enough,
you're dismissed with immediate effect.

1706
01:45:43,819 --> 01:45:47,114
You were always a puppy
with a proud stomach,

1707
01:45:47,156 --> 01:45:50,701
riding on the coat tails
of that vile creature who called you Daisy.

1708
01:45:50,743 --> 01:45:52,119
Trotwood.

1709
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:53,954
- Davy.
- Doady.

1710
01:45:53,996 --> 01:45:55,664
My name is David Copperfield.

1711
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:59,126
I forgive ya, Mr Copperfield.

1712
01:45:59,168 --> 01:46:02,338
It is not for you
to forgive anyone, Mr Heep.

1713
01:46:02,379 --> 01:46:04,048
Isn't that right, Jip?

1714
01:46:04,089 --> 01:46:05,633
Yes, it is.

1715
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:07,968
What's she doing here?

1716
01:46:10,804 --> 01:46:12,890
There's no reason for me to be here.

1717
01:46:14,975 --> 01:46:16,143
I wasn't there.

1718
01:46:16,185 --> 01:46:18,520
Heep happened yesterday,
and I was away.

1719
01:46:18,562 --> 01:46:21,565
I know, but I'm writing it now
and I want you to be in it.

1720
01:46:21,607 --> 01:46:23,359
I fear I don't properly fit.

1721
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:26,904
I want you to be in all my stories.

1722
01:46:28,447 --> 01:46:31,200
No, I don't belong. Write me out of it.

1723
01:46:31,242 --> 01:46:33,118
But I still want to be of some use.

1724
01:46:35,079 --> 01:46:36,956
May I hold your pens?

1725
01:46:51,011 --> 01:46:53,973
- Do let me know when you need a new pen.
- Yes.

1726
01:46:59,895 --> 01:47:01,605
I really don't fit.

1727
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,402
Write me out, Doady.

1728
01:47:18,372 --> 01:47:21,000
- Davy! Davy!
- Yes.

1729
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:24,211
You have to come right now.
I think we've found Emily.

1730
01:47:39,435 --> 01:47:42,062
Someone saw her in this building.
I hope she's here.

1731
01:47:42,104 --> 01:47:45,399
- That's Mrs Steerforth's carriage.
- Does that mean her son's with her?

1732
01:47:45,441 --> 01:47:46,817
- Em?
- Emily?

1733
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:50,237
- Emily, my love, Peggotty's here.
- Emily?

1734
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,364
Emily?

1735
01:47:53,657 --> 01:47:55,492
- We're here.
- Emily?

1736
01:47:58,162 --> 01:48:01,790
Do you ever think
of the home you have wrecked?

1737
01:48:01,832 --> 01:48:02,833
Of course.

1738
01:48:03,626 --> 01:48:05,085
Every day.

1739
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:08,172
- Poor Uncle.
- Not your home.

1740
01:48:08,213 --> 01:48:11,175
His. Mine.

1741
01:48:11,216 --> 01:48:13,844
A veil of shame hangs over me
because of what you made my son do.

1742
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:14,970
Where is he?

1743
01:48:15,012 --> 01:48:16,597
- I don't know.
- I can hear her.

1744
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,350
- Through here. Emily!
- Worthless creature!

1745
01:48:19,391 --> 01:48:21,268
- She's in here.
- Tell me!

1746
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:24,021
- Leave me alone!
- I imagine you want this discarded toy.

1747
01:48:24,063 --> 01:48:27,191
She was just a trifle
for the occupation of an hour!

1748
01:48:27,233 --> 01:48:28,943
Enough, madam. That is vile.

1749
01:48:28,984 --> 01:48:32,029
When James was at his truest
he loved me.

1750
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:35,157
I will leave when I have news of my son,
and not before.

1751
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:38,410
- Do you understand me?
- Tell her, Em, and then let's leave. Please.

1752
01:48:38,452 --> 01:48:41,497
Let's get going.
This house feels like it's gonna blow away.

1753
01:48:41,538 --> 01:48:44,208
There's a big storm coming.
We'd better leave now.

1754
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:47,086
At least tell me, Em,
if you won't tell her.

1755
01:48:48,337 --> 01:48:50,256
Is that snake with you?

1756
01:48:50,297 --> 01:48:51,548
No.

1757
01:48:52,591 --> 01:48:54,134
He fled from me.

1758
01:48:55,135 --> 01:48:56,553
In France.

1759
01:48:57,846 --> 01:48:59,098
Steerforth abandoned you?

1760
01:49:01,141 --> 01:49:03,227
I'm no good for you.

1761
01:49:03,269 --> 01:49:06,021
I'm no good for anyone.
Think of me at my best.

1762
01:49:09,817 --> 01:49:12,861
How can you do that
and still call yourself a man?

1763
01:49:12,903 --> 01:49:17,116
I've been here ever since,
scared I might never be forgiven.

1764
01:49:17,157 --> 01:49:19,743
My love, of course you're forgiven.

1765
01:49:19,785 --> 01:49:22,204
Do you know,
does Steerforth plan to return?

1766
01:49:22,246 --> 01:49:23,414
Yes, he does.

1767
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:26,917
Tomorrow night.
He's sailing into Yarmouth.

1768
01:49:26,959 --> 01:49:28,836
He wants to say sorry, Davy.

1769
01:49:28,877 --> 01:49:33,799
Tomorrow? That's mad.
The storm will be at its peak. It's suicide.

1770
01:49:35,426 --> 01:49:36,802
Come on, lend a hand!

1771
01:49:39,805 --> 01:49:41,265
Quickly, now!

1772
01:49:42,099 --> 01:49:43,475
Come on, now!

1773
01:49:46,729 --> 01:49:49,732
- What's happened?
- A wreck close by, sir.

1774
01:49:49,773 --> 01:49:52,151
- How many in? How many out?
- Two out.

1775
01:49:53,068 --> 01:49:56,238
Second man out now.
At least one more out there.

1776
01:50:00,784 --> 01:50:03,203
- That's Steerforth.
- Mates, make me ready.

1777
01:50:03,871 --> 01:50:06,415
- Get me some rope. I'm going in.
- Please, no.

1778
01:50:06,457 --> 01:50:08,417
Ham, you can't.
You know who that is.

1779
01:50:08,459 --> 01:50:10,377
If my time has come,
then it's come,

1780
01:50:10,419 --> 01:50:13,964
but I am not watching another man die,
even if it's that man there. Rope.

1781
01:50:14,924 --> 01:50:16,592
Tie it right. Tie it right.

1782
01:50:16,634 --> 01:50:18,844
- Boy, I don't want you to do this.
- Ham!

1783
01:50:21,472 --> 01:50:22,514
Ham!

1784
01:50:27,686 --> 01:50:30,189
- It's like he's taunting us.
- No.

1785
01:50:30,898 --> 01:50:34,193
Not taunting us.
Maybe taunting himself.

1786
01:50:38,364 --> 01:50:40,783
- Go on, Ham!
- Ham!

1787
01:50:44,995 --> 01:50:46,956
Steerforth!

1788
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:52,086
We have to go now!

1789
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:56,006
Steerforth, come to me.

1790
01:50:56,715 --> 01:50:58,175
Give me your hand.

1791
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:01,637
Steerforth!

1792
01:51:06,892 --> 01:51:09,186
He was lost
beneath the rugged foam.

1793
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:12,565
I stood...

1794
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:15,818
...unable to move a step.

1795
01:51:18,487 --> 01:51:21,115
"Does he live?", I asked.

1796
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:31,709
He was everything.

1797
01:51:33,294 --> 01:51:36,005
I wanted him to live, Davy,
whatever he'd done.

1798
01:51:37,756 --> 01:51:41,051
But, by God, I wish to God
you'd never brought him here,

1799
01:51:41,093 --> 01:51:43,095
into our world to ruin it.

1800
01:51:44,388 --> 01:51:48,100
I brought you here. And Emily.
And Mrs Gummidge.

1801
01:51:48,142 --> 01:51:51,228
Now, you have a care, Ham.
This isn't Davy's fault.

1802
01:51:55,065 --> 01:51:56,483
Em.

1803
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,079
No!

1804
01:52:09,872 --> 01:52:13,125
<i>And now
I have nothing left to tell.</i>

1805
01:52:14,251 --> 01:52:15,836
<i>Unless, indeed, I were to confess</i>

1806
01:52:16,545 --> 01:52:19,298
<i>that this narrative is far more
than mere fiction.</i>

1807
01:52:20,758 --> 01:52:23,719
<i>It is, in fact, written memory,</i>

1808
01:52:24,678 --> 01:52:27,348
<i>wherein loss and love</i>

1809
01:52:28,098 --> 01:52:29,767
<i>live forever side by side.</i>

1810
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:36,982
Agnes, sometimes in my writing
I can say things...

1811
01:52:37,024 --> 01:52:38,943
I will love you all my life.

1812
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:46,450
Its people are as real as earth.

1813
01:52:47,743 --> 01:52:49,703
And my truest hope

1814
01:52:49,745 --> 01:52:55,251
is that I might grow half as strong and wise
in the telling of their story

1815
01:52:55,292 --> 01:52:57,336
as they have grown in the living of it.

1816
01:52:59,505 --> 01:53:00,881
Thank you.

1817
01:53:25,531 --> 01:53:29,076
Hello. Hello, you little darling.

1818
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:31,328
- Hello.
- A-boo-boo-boo.

1819
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,123
- Hello.
- A-boo-boo-boo.

1820
01:53:35,791 --> 01:53:37,459
Are you smiling?

1821
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:53,183
"Kite" as a verb. It's very good.

1822
01:53:53,225 --> 01:53:55,394
All right, Master Davy?

1823
01:53:55,436 --> 01:53:59,481
You know, in your book,
you could have made me younger and taller.

1824
01:53:59,523 --> 01:54:01,901
He wrote you as 20
in years and feet.

1825
01:54:01,942 --> 01:54:04,987
- Really?
- He hasn't read it, Davy.

1826
01:54:05,029 --> 01:54:07,907
- But you've lived it, Mr Peggotty.
- That's right.

1827
01:54:08,532 --> 01:54:10,409
- Betsey.
- Oh, Trotwood.

1828
01:54:10,451 --> 01:54:14,121
You've saved my home
and I don't know how to thank you.

1829
01:54:15,956 --> 01:54:18,083
- Oh, donkeys. There's...
- No, no, no.

1830
01:54:18,667 --> 01:54:19,668
No.

1831
01:54:20,502 --> 01:54:23,130
We'll set the donkeys
to one side for now.

1832
01:54:23,714 --> 01:54:26,467
Congratulations on the book.

1833
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:30,512
Odd to think
my words bought this house.

1834
01:54:30,554 --> 01:54:33,599
Fine depiction
of that villain Heep, eh?

1835
01:54:33,641 --> 01:54:38,020
I think we both played a very clever game,
you and I, catching that fellow.

1836
01:54:38,062 --> 01:54:40,231
- Well done, us.
- Aye.

1837
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:44,151
Mrs Micawber.

1838
01:54:44,193 --> 01:54:45,861
Mr Micawber.

1839
01:54:45,903 --> 01:54:47,571
I'm glad you could make it.

1840
01:54:47,613 --> 01:54:50,241
Oh, young David.

1841
01:54:50,282 --> 01:54:54,370
You saved myself, Wilkins,
and our sweet angels from the streets.

1842
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:58,290
No, no. Your presence in my writing
has repaid me many times over.

1843
01:55:01,585 --> 01:55:02,586
Uh...

1844
01:55:03,796 --> 01:55:07,049
Luckily, I find myself between
paid jobs at the present moment

1845
01:55:07,091 --> 01:55:10,803
so that has allowed us the freedom
to travel down to your beautiful home.

1846
01:55:10,844 --> 01:55:14,390
- Coach fare was...
- Well, we barely considered the costs.

1847
01:55:14,431 --> 01:55:15,474
Indeed, we barely...

1848
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,185
There you are, Mr Micawber.

1849
01:55:18,227 --> 01:55:21,021
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

1850
01:55:21,063 --> 01:55:22,982
- An IOU is in order.
- Yes.

1851
01:55:23,023 --> 01:55:24,400
There's no need.

1852
01:55:28,487 --> 01:55:30,322
- From writing?
- Yes

1853
01:56:03,230 --> 01:56:04,648
Don't worry.

1854
01:56:05,524 --> 01:56:06,942
You'll make it through.

1855
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:10,404
And you'll have quite the ride
on the way.

1856
