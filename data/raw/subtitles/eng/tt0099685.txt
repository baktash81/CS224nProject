I first met Jimmy Conway.

169
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,770
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

170
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,480
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild.

171
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,400
He'd give a doorman $100
just for opening the door.

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

173
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,490
The bartender got $100 just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

174
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,740
[JIMMY] The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,580
- [PAUL] Want a drink?
- [JIMMY] Give me a Seven and Seven.

176
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,800
[PAUL] I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

177
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,430
How you doing?

178
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
Thank you.

179
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,220
Keep them coming.

180
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,520
[HENRY] Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

181
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,860
He was first locked up at 11,
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

182
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,480
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

183
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,030
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.

184
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,240
He actually enjoyed it.

185
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,790
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies.

186
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,000
Give me your wallet.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,210
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

188
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,960
[HENRY] He was one of the city's
biggest hijackers...

189
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,470
... of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

190
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,300
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

191
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,720
They went fast.

192
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,730
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

193
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,480
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

194
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,810
[JIMMY] Help the lady.

195
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,270
[HENRY] Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

196
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,860
... about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

197

198

200
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,120
You're going to be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

201
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,210
Jimmy, you got anything good?

202
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,670
[HENRY] When the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

203
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,680
He made them partners.

204
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,680
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

205
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,600
- [HENRY] What do you need?
- [CIGARETTE BUYER #1] Two Luckys.

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,070
How many Pall Malls you need?

211
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,030
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

Here is your graduation present.

224

- [HENRY] Why? I got pinched.
- [JIMMY] Everyone does, but you did it right.

225
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,410
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.

226
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,710
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

227

You took your first pinch like a man...

228

...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

229

230
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,260

[HENRY] By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year in cargo...

247
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,860
... moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

248
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,530
See, we grew up near the airport.

249
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,080
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

250
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,250
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

251
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,340
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

252
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,590
... Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

253
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,760
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge.

254
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,760
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

255
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,310
To us, it was better than Citibank.

worried about bills, were dead.

- [KAREN] I don't want to run.

2117
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:16,250
Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

2118
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:18,840
I don't want to do that.

2119
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:23,220
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

2120
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:29,680
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

2121
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,640
How is he doing?

2122
02:09:35,190 --> 02:09:36,480
He is okay.

2123
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,730
They sobered him up.

2124
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:40,980
Good. Glad to hear it.

2125
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:47,490
What kind of questions they been asking?

2126
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:49,120
[KAREN] I don't know.

2127
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:53,790
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.

2128
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:57,120
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

2129
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:59,170
Tell him he has got to call me.

2130
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,710
As soon as you talk to him,
He has got to call me. It is important.

2131
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:07,430
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It is like he is crazy.

2132
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,760
- Take this. It is a couple thousand.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

2133
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:13,270
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

2134
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:16,520
[JIMMY] I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

2135
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,520
Pick out a few for yourself.

2136
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,520
- [KAREN] For my mom.
- [JIMMY] Yeah, whatever.

2137
02:10:21,610 --> 02:10:24,030
Not here. In the store on the corner.

2138
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,860
It is swag, so I got it down on the corner.

2139
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:34,660
Go ahead, sweetheart, I will see you.

2140
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:36,290
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.

2141
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:39,170
- [KAREN] I will try.
- [JIMMY] He is got to call me.

2142
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:42,880
Over here?

2143
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:44,760
[JIMMY] Right down there.

2144
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,310
[JIMMY] It is over there, on the corner.

2145
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:02,610
Right there.

2146
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:38,810
[JIMMY] No! Go ahead! It is right there!

2147
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,270
[KAREN] No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

2148
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:44,360
My mom is watching the kids!
I got to get home!

2149
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:46,360
I will come back later!

Karen. Karen!

2153
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:16,060
What happened?

2154
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:18,390
[KAREN] [Sobs] Nothing.

2155
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,310
- [HENRY] What happened?
- [KAREN] I just got scared.

2156
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:25,480
[HENRY] Got the keys?

2157
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:28,070
What happened?

2158
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:30,650
[Sobs] I just got scared. It is okay.

2159
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:32,820
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

2160
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:36,780
[Karen Sobs]

2161
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:43,670
[HENRY] If you're part of a crew nobody
ever tells you they're going to kill you.

2162
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:46,000
It doesn't happen that way.

2163
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:49,590
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

2164
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,680
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

2165
02:12:54,090 --> 02:12:56,260
People who cared for you all your life.

2166
02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:01,020
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

2167
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:04,350
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

2168
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:08,360
I got there 15 minutes early
and Jimmy was already there.

2169
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:13,610
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

2170
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:16,370
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

2171
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:19,540
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

2172
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:23,540
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

2173
02:13:23,790 --> 02:13:26,210
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

2174
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:31,130
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

2175
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:36,390
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

2176
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,220
Now you understand?

2177
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:44,600
It is going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.

2178
02:13:47,650 --> 02:13:51,980
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

2179
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:59,200
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

2180
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,870
I know where he is. He is hiding out.

2181
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,580
Know what I'm saying?

2182
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:15,090
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

2183
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:19,260
No, not at all.

2184
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:22,390
That way they got nothing.

2185
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:34,280
[HENRY] Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

2186
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:38,530
But now he is asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

2187
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:49,540
That is when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

2188
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:54,300
[Henry Clears His Throat]

2189
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:06,140
Wherever you move me,
I asked once and I will tell you again...

2190
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:08,640
...I don't want to go any place cold.

2191
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,310
You don't have a choice.

2192
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:14,940
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

2193
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:17,900
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

2194
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:20,240
He has bronchial, that is why.

2195
02:15:20,490 --> 02:15:22,990
If he has bronchial we will consider that.

2196
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:25,080
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

2197
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:28,620
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

2198
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:31,250
What about them?

2199
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:34,750
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

2200
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,630
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

2201
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:39,010
No.

2202
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:43,680
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

2203
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:48,100
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, I can't see them?

2204
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:51,190
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.

2205
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:54,110
If there are extraordinary circumstances...

2206
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:57,280
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

2207
02:15:57,940 --> 02:16:00,030
I can't leave my parents.

2208
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,450
[HENRY] Karen, I told you before.

2209
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:07,910
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

2210
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,710
I can't do it without you.

2211
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:14,590
So you do whatever, but... that is it.

2212
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:20,220
- [KAREN] You need Henry, not me, right?
- [EDWARD] That is right.

2213
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:22,470
I don't care whether you go or not.

2214
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:26,470
If it will make him a better witness,
I want you with him.

2215
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,310
They don't want me.

2216
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:32,310
[EDWARD] Henry will be in the protection
program. They can't get to him.

2217
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,730
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

2218
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:38,280
If he goes into the program
you're in danger.

2219
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:41,070
- [KAREN] I don't know anything.
- [EDWARD] Don't give me...

2220
02:16:41,150 --> 02:16:42,740
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

2221
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:47,160
I've listened to those wiretaps
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

2222
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:51,500
[EDWARD] Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

2223
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,670
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

2224
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:01,590
...or stays on the streets, he is a dead man.

2225
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:04,090
He knows it and you know it.

2226
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:07,810
[HENRY] What about the kids and school?

2227
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,180
[KAREN] I mean, what goes on?

2228
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:12,690
[TUDDY] Go to Wall Street
and get real crooks.

2229
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:15,190
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

2230
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:18,690
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

2231
02:17:19,110 --> 02:17:22,950
We will save your life, his life,
and we will keep you out of jail.

2232
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:29,290
[EDWARD] This morning you told the jury
about your background.

2233
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:31,790
[HENRY] It was easy for us to disappear.

2234
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,380
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.

2235
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:39,960
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

2236
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:42,470
I never voted or paid taxes.

2237
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:46,970
My birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed I was alive.

2238
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:49,510
[EDWARD] Do you see him here
in this courtroom?

2239
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,470
Yes.

2240
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:53,560
[EDWARD] Will you please point him
out for the jury?

2241
02:17:55,560 --> 02:18:00,150
[EDWARD] Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

2242
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:04,320
[EDWARD] Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

2243
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:07,070
- [EDWARD] Is he in the courtroom?
- [HENRY] Yes.

2244
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:09,740
[EDWARD] Can you point him out
for the jury?

2245
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:14,750
[EDWARD] Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

leaving the life.

2248
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,550
I still loved the life.

2249
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:27,640
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle. We had it all.

2250
02:18:28,180 --> 02:18:31,350
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

2251
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:35,180
I had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

2252
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:37,440
I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.

2253
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:41,230
[HAYES] People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

2254
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:43,440
- [EDWARD] Objection!
- [JUDGE] Objection sustained.

2255
02:18:43,530 --> 02:18:47,860
- [HENRY] I know nothing about being a rat.
- [HAYES] You know everything about it!

2256
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:51,620
[HENRY] Anything I wanted was
a phone call away.

Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts
all over the city.

2258
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:57,920
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

2259
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:02,210
... then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

2260
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:03,880
Didn't matter.

2261
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:08,550
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go rob some more.

2262
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:11,140
We ran everything.

2263
02:19:11,470 --> 02:19:15,310
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

2264
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:19,850
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

2265
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,110
And now it is all over.

2266
02:19:23,730 --> 02:19:25,780

Today everything is different.

There is no action. I have to wait around
like everyone else.

Can't even get decent food.

After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

2271
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:41,080
... and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

2272
02:19:41,170 --> 02:19:43,090
