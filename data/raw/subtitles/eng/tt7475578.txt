00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,666
[murmur of conversation]

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,541
[band playing upbeat jazz]

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,541
[cutlery clinking]

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,958
[woman 1] Whoo-hoo!

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,125
- [man] Yeah!
- [woman 1] Whoo-hoo!

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,583
[woman 2] Let's be off, dear.

7
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,666
[humming along to the band]

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,916
Hey, Ian! Are you surviving?

9
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,458
We should have a little bet. Ah!

10
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,458
Can I have some more champagne, please?

11
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,250
- We're not serving any more.
- Oh, come on. Please.

12
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,375
I'm awfully sorry.

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,041
Please. Please!

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,083
I'm very sorry.

15
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,416
Thank you.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,166
[man] What you English
will never understand is...

17
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,708
Is that it is a question of identity.

18
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,625
No, more than identity.

19
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm talking about…

20
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,416
Hugh, wake up!

21
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm talking about a country so...

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,583
I need to sleep.

23
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,208
Are you listening to me at all?

24
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,375
[Hugh] I'm listening.
I'm listening to every word.

25
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,958
You're not listening.

26
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,708
- What are you doing?
- Here is what I am gonna do.

27
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,541
I want to feel something real!

28
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,416
Here is something real!

29
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,166
Yes!

30
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,375
[cheers]

31
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,916
- Bring it over! He's dying! He needs it!
- [band finishes]

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,416
- [laughing]
- [ball-goers cheering]

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,958
- Behold the glassy waters of the Isis!
- [man] Shut up, Paul!

34
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,375
- Love you, too, even you doubters!
- Oh, put a sock in it!

35
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,916
- Paul, come back!
- We make hay today!

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,958
You know, the dream is coming to an end,
and we have to celebrate that!

37
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,750
- We have to celebrate! Come on!
- Oh, thank God. Tell him to get out.

38
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,041
If he wishes to go for a midnight swim,
that's entirely his decision.

39
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,666
[grunts] I don't want to go swimming.

40
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:41,041
I want to throw myself into the water
in despair at our mad generation.

41
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,916
- [chuckles]
- Excellent. Go ahead.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,833
- Ow!
- [both cheer]

43
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,291
Mm. Let me have it.

44
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,000
- [man] Get crazy!
- Mmm.

45
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,500
[Hugh] Oh.

46
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,166
Mmm. I…

47
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,583
Stop drinking.

48
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,875
Mmph.

49
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,916
Please.

50
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,041
[Paul] Mmm.

51
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,125
Pl… please. Ugh.

52
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,041
- [Paul] Mmm!
- Come on! There's three of us here.

53
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,458
- [woman laughs]
- [Paul] Mmm.

54
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,250
Now you're just doing it because I'm here.

55
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,625
Look at this boy.

56
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,250
So English. So English!

57
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,750
- Leave him alone!
- Always this!

58
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,541
- What's wrong with being English?
- This is what I've learned at Oxford.

59
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,541
- We have another lesson.
- The great characteristic of the English…

60
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,041
- [Hugh] Mm-hm?
- …Is distance.

61
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,916
- Hmm.
- Yes!

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Not only from one another
but from feeling.

63
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,000
- Mm. Mm-hm.
- We are nothing but feeling.

64
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,541
- [woman] Mm-hm.
- There's a new age beginning.

65
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,041
[in German] In the New Germany.
You can look forward to that.

66
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,791
The New Germany.

67
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,416
- [in English] Yes.
- It's a bunch of thugs and racists.

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,708
Aaah!

69
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,375
- Germany is the proudest nation on earth.
- [Hugh] Really?

70
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,833
You'll see when you stay with us
in Munich. You'll see.

71
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,416
- Right.
- I'll protect you.

72
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,291
[in German] Give me a cigarette.

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,083
[in English] No. It's my last one.

74
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,333
- We'll have to share.
- I'll take it.

75
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,250
- You're good.
- You can do it.

76
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,625
- Keep it in.
- Mm-hm.

77
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,166
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

78
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,541
- Okay, okay.
- Is it hot?

79
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,541
[ball-goers cheering]

80
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,333
[yells]

81
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,041
[cheering and laughing]

82
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,041
It's our mad generation!

83
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,333
It's our mad generation.

84
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,750
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,166
Mmm.

86
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,583
{\an8}[woman 1 shouting] Gas masks!
Don't you want to come see?

87
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,291
- [man 1] Just hold it steady.
- [woman 1] Gas masks!

88
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,416
- Gas masks! Come and get your masks now!
- [man 1] Will you pull on that rope?

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,583
If you don't know how,
I'll get your mother to show ya!

90
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,708
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

91
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,916
[man 1] Right. Don't...
Just shut it, and get on with it!

92
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,208
Now pull on the left!

93
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,041
That's it, gentle, not too much!

94
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,541
- You need to hold her steady.
- [man 2] Yeah!

95
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,875
[man 1] Yes, that's good. Keep her steady.

96
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,083
That's better, lads. Now we're performing.

97
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,416
No, no, no, look. For God's sake,
she's stuck on the stonework!

98
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,958
- [man 2] Careful!
- [man 1] Just be gentle. Gentle.

99
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,833
- [man 3] Come on!
- What are you doing, wrenching it about?

100
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,458
- [man 3] I'm trying!
- Well, try...

101
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,041
[man 4] This... this side.

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,416
[man 5] Watch out!

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,291
[man 6] Look, at the end of the day...

104
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,458
[woman 2] Is that right?

105
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:55,958
[man 3] Come on, guys.

106
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,666
[woman 3] What's round there?

107
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,750
[man 7] They'll stop anything flying.

108
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,708
[piano playing gentle melody]

109
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,250
[Hugh] I know. I said I'd be on time.

110
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,625
There's no need
for the sackcloth and ashes.

111
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,541
- I was late myself.
- Oh.

112
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,708
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

113
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,208
- What's this?
- It's Arthur's gas mask.

114
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,083
- I've just been to collect it.
- [sighs]

115
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,208
Didn't realise
they made them in children's sizes.

116
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,666
Well, it's new to all of us, isn't it?

117
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,458
Apparently, when the call comes,
I have to put his on first.

118
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,125
- Tests motherly devotion, don't you think?
- Hm.

119
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,375
Can I have a drink? I'm parched.

120
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,625
[sighs]

121
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,250
- Half a bottle of Chablis.
- Certainly, sir.

122
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,791
- Half?
- Work.

123
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,291
- What's going on over there?
- I can't talk about it.

124
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,333
I don't think anyone's listening.

125
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,541
Hitler wants the Sudetenland.

126
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,125
He expected the Czechs to roll over,
but he's underestimated them.

127
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,583
- Yes, I...
- They won't give it up without a fight.

128
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,166
If there's no agreement tomorrow,
Germany will mobilise,

129
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,125
and France and Britain
will be obliged to defend Czechoslovakia.

130
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,750
As soon as that happens...

131
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,041
Thank you.

132
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,500
Remember eating lunch here
the day after the wedding?

133
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,875
Yes, Hugh.
I got poisoned by that dreadful fish.

134
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,166
Yes. Sorry. God!

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
- Sorry, I forgot.
- [laughing] It's all right.

136
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,625
Still, it's one of the best spots
in London.

137
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,750
Mm. Yes.

138
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,583
I wish we could go upstairs,

139
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,041
take a room,
and stay in bed all afternoon.

140
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,833
Well, what's stopping us?

141
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,541
Arthur's with Nanny,
and, well, this place hardly seems full.

142
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,041
[whispers] Why don't you go
and see if you can arrange it?

143
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,375
You know I can't.

144
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,416
- Do I?
- I'm due back at 2:30.

145
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,208
- Why would you ask me...
- You brought it up.

146
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,958
I'm trying to make an effort.
As requested.

147
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,000
I know.

148
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,500
Mr. Legat, Downing Street
is on the line for you.

149
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,791
[groans] Hell.

150
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to take it.

151
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,250
Of course.

152
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,208
- I thought, perhaps, some privacy.
- Thank you.

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,541
This is Legat.

154
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,750
[man] <i>I'm afraid you'll have to come back,</i>
<i>old man. Cleverly's asking for you.</i>

155
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,958
<i>- Looks as though talking's over in Berlin.</i>
- Sh…

156
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,416
<i>Sir Horace Wilson's flying home.</i>

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,875
I'm on my way.

158
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,833
As fast as you can. He'll kill us both.

159
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,333
Shit.

160
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,916
- [wife] 83 Lord North Street, please.
- [man] What surname?

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,333
[sighs]

162
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,000
Lunch at the Imperial Grand
in the middle of an international crisis.

163
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,875
Might be the way things are done
in the Foreign Office...

164
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,666
I apologise, sir. It won't happen again.

165
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,833
No explanation?

166
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,458
It's my wedding anniversary.

167
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:41,791
Congratulations.

168
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,458
There are times when
one's family has to take a back seat.

169
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,666
Now is such a time.

170
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,458
[clock ticking]

171
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,333
- Has Syers filled you in?
- I gather talks have broken down.

172
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,958
All hell's about to break loose.
Hitler intends to mobilise tomorrow.

173
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,250
At six o'clock, the PM
will make a radio broadcast to the nation,

174
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,125
and I'd like you to deal with the BBC.

175
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,125
Has any... Excuse me, sir.
Has anyone spoken to the Czechs?

176
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,916
What?

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,250
- I just thought that bringing the Czech...
- I'm sure the PM

178
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
doesn't require
suggestions from you, Legat.

179
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,583
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,666
[crowd shouting]

181
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:43,666
[man] I have to say,

182
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,458
this comes at the worst possible time
for us, Prime Minister.

183
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,625
Prime Minister, Sir Horace is here.

184
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,708
Well, it would seem
you have some work to do, gentlemen.

185
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,375
- Please don't let me stand in your way.
- Prime Minister.

186
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,875
[sighs]

187
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,000
[protesters yelling in street]

188
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,708
Shall I show him in, sir?

189
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, certainly.

190
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,708
Horace?

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,208
[Wilson] Thank you, Osmund.

192
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,125
- Prime Minister.
- Aah.

193
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,625
I expect you're pleased to be back.

194
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,583
How was it? How did it go?

195
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,625
Ah, well, it started atrociously
and went downhill from there.

196
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,750
Oh.

197
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,708
He won't wait a day longer
before invading.

198
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,916
[sighs]

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,833
I warned him this morning that
if the French fulfil their obligations,

200
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,708
then we'll have to go in with them.

201
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,958
What did he say to that?

202
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,500
- He smiled at me.
- God!

203
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,375
Even more disconcerting
than when he's shouting.

204
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,541
But the message was clear enough.

205
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,708
He's going to mobilise tomorrow.

206
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,416
[in German] Nice dress she's wearing.

207
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,916
[officer 2] For the parade.

208
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,375
[laughter]

209
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
Sir, have you chosen something yet?

210
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,666
- Coffee, black.
- Right away.

211
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,750
Hello.

212
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,083
How did it go?

213
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,083
- Anything for you, sir?
- No, thank you.

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,833
Today, he did nothing but yell at them.

215
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,500
The talks with the English
are over once and for all. He's fed up.

216
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,500
Eventually, Henderson just stayed silent.

217
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,708
Wilson got up and left.
Right to the airport and back to London.

218
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,375
And to prove that he means business,

219
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,708
this madman is now sending
a parade of tanks up Wilhemstraße.

220
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,375
- Straight to the British Embassy.
- So?

221
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,625
So, we'll mobilise tomorrow.

222
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,416
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

223
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,833
Then we only have a few hours left.

224
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,708
[sighs]

225
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,916
Oster is talking to the generals
right now.

226
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,208
We'll meet tonight.

227
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,625
New place, Alt-Berlin. Ten o'clock.

228
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,666
I have to get back.

229
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,708
Damn, I really am scared shitless.

230
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,416
[girl 1] Can we feed the pigeons?

231
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,708
- [girl 2] Yes.
- [man] Oh, they're hungry.

232
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,500
- What's your name?
- [girl 2] Margarete.

233
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,791
- [man] Here.
- [girl 1] Come here.

234
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,375
[man] You're not afraid of me, are you?

235
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,875
[pigeons cooing]

236
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,333
- Frau Limpert?
- Yes?

237
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,916
- I'll take care of it.
- All right.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,041
- Can you tell Herr Plassman, please?
- I will.

239
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:48,916
[sighs]

240
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:55,666
[static humming]

241
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,083
[tuning radio]

242
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,625
[static humming]

243
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,958
- Here, let me.
- I can do it.

244
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,041
- Herr von Hartmann.
- I can do it.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,250
[clang]

246
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,166
[static crackling]

247
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,208
There.

248
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,000
[Big Ben chiming]

249
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,333
May I?

250
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,666
[man sighs]

251
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,750
[Big Ben chimes two o'clock]

[announcer, in English] <i>This is London.</i>

00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,416
<i>the Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain,</i>

<i>Mr. Chamberlain.</i>

260
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,958
I want to say a few words to you,
men and women of Britain and the Empire.

261
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,541
How horrible and fantastic it is

262
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:10,375
that we should be digging trenches
and trying on gas masks here

263
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,708
because of a quarrel in a faraway country

264
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,458
- between people of whom we know nothing.
- [scribbling]

265
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,416
<i>Both Herr Hitler and the Czechs</i>

266
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:26,041
<i>have made their case
regarding the Sudetenland passionately.</i>

267
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,125
<i>Herr Hitler has told me privately,</i>

268
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,333
<i>and last night repeated publicly,</i>

269
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,125
<i>that when this question is settled,</i>

270
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:43,208
<i>it is the end
of Germany's territorial claims in Europe.</i>

271

<i>the events of the next few days.</i>

275
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,666
As long as war has not begun,

276
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,541
there is always hope
that it may be prevented.

277
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,583
And you know
that I am going to work for peace

278
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,291
to the last moment.

279
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,333
Good night.

280
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,291
- And you're off air, Prime Minister.
- Oh, good.

281
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,208
- Well done, sir. No wobbles at all.
- [chuckles]

282
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,541
Uh, photograph.

283
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,291
There we are. As if I'm reading.

284
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,166
Very good. Thank you so much.

285
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,625
- Well navigated, sir.
- Ah.

286
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,208
[chuckles] Thank you.

287
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,041
Do you know, I always think the trick is
to try to imagine I'm just speaking

288
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,541
to one person
sitting at home in an armchair.

289
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,875
Of course,
tonight, it was a little bit harder

290
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,500
because there was somebody else
lurking in the shadows.

291
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,541
Herr Hitler.

292
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,833

295
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,166
[in German] You're taking it
to the Chancellery yourself?

296
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,791
Yes. I'm very curious
to see how Hitler will reply.

297
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,833
- What about after?
- After?

298
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,291
After.

299
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,375
- After, I have an appointment in Mitte.
- I see. An "appointment"?

300
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,333
Yes.

301
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,166
How mysterious.

302
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,583
Well, until next time, Herr von Hartmann.

303
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,291
Mrs. Winter.

304

[door closes]

305
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
- [in English] For goodness' sake!
- All right!

306
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,083
- That should have gone in first.
- Got everything in hand. Cecily?

307
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,458
Yes, that's got to go.

308
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,375
- Where should I sit?
- You off, then, Appleby?

309
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,791
- We are.
- I'll sit in the front.

310
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,291
- Good luck with it.
- Thank you.

311
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,458
- Be well.
- [Cecily] I'll sit in the front, then.

312
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,666

313
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,833
[Appleby] Come along, dear.

314
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,208
[door closes]

315
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,458
Christ!

316
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,500
[sighs heavily]

317
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,416
[running upstairs]

318
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,458
Arthur?

319
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sorry, I... I wasn't expecting…

320
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,833
Hello.

321
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,583
- [sighs]
- [clock chiming]

322
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,208
- What was that?
- [sighs]

323
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,625
- He made me jump.
- He's been waiting for you.

324
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,458
I'm glad you're home.

325
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,250
I have to grab my overnight bag
and get back. I don't have long.

326
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,250
You're staying over?

327
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,041
- Apparently, I'm needed.
- Well, you're needed here too.

328
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,750
- [sighs]
- What's happening?

329
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,375
Pack a week's worth of clothes,
and drive him to your parents' right away.

330
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,500
Can you tell me why?

331
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,166
I need to know you're somewhere safe.

332
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,500
- I won't go without you.
- Oh, Pamela. I'm afraid you have to.

333
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,375
- By tonight, it could be hard to get out.
- Tell them you have a son,

334
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,333
- and we need you tonight!
- I have no power...

335
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,916
- You can go tomorrow.
- Impossible. It's too important.

336
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,958
It's not more important than your family.

337
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,583
[sighs]

338
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,916
- That's very clear.
- Darling, I...

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,958
Get off me!

340
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,708
- You're being unreasonable.
- Right, I'm being unreasonable?

341
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,583
I'm always hysterical
in the face of your fucking calmness!

342
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,791
Do you not think there are things worth...

343
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,541
I mean, this is your marriage.
This is your family!

344
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,166
And I know I'm upset,
and I know how much you hate that,

345
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,333
but your silence is killing me!

346
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,291
[sighs]

347
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,583
We'll be packed and gone in an hour.

348
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,958
[clock ticking]

349
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
No one forced you to marry me, Hugh.

350
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,625
You act like it's a sentence from a judge.

351
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,958
- You chose this.
- I don't...

352
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,666
It is not my fault
that you are disappointed by your life.

353
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,250
- I can't talk about this now.
- Right, yes. Of course you can't.

354
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,333
[walking upstairs]

355
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,958
[sighs]

356
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,791
- [in German] Get that stuff in there.
- We need two people for the couch.

357
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,458
- Pictures.
- I need to do this first.

358
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,250
[woman] Do you need a worker?

359
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Do you need a worker?

360
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,916
HELLO! I AM LOOKING FOR WORK!

361
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,833
Do you need a worker?

362
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,541
Do you need a worker?

363
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,041
Paulie? No way. I can't believe it.

364
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,041
[laughs]

365
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,583
Franz Sauer.

366
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,666
- Little Paulie!
- How are you?

367
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,000
Still busy as a beaver.
How about you? Where are you headed?

368
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,125
Uh…

369
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,250
To the British Embassy.

370
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,416
I'm delivering the official reply
to Chamberlain's radio broadcast.

371
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,833
- Seriously?
- Yes.

372
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,250
[laughs]

373
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,000
No kidding?

374
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,625
Who would've thought
that you'd be delivering messages

375
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,958
between world leaders?

376
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,666
- And I'd be protecting the Führer himself.
- You're with the bodyguard?

377
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,166
Führer Escort Command.

378
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,125
- One of 27.
- Congratulations.

379
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,000
- Paulie, one of just 27.
- Congratulations.

380
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,666
But everyone always knew
that you'd make it to the top one day.

381
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,958
- It baffles me every day that I have.
- Nonsense. We've always been winners.

382
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,291
- Not me.
- Always.

383
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,583
- Back on our soccer team?
- But no thanks to me.

384
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,750
That was you, Franz. Our opposition
peed their pants in fear of you.

385
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,333
Yeah, there was no getting past.
Certainly not past me.

386
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,416
Well, Paul, don't let me keep you.
Hurry along. Duty calls.

387
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,833
I'll see you around, Franz.

388
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,541
Not if I see you first,
Paulie von Hartmann!

389
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,291
[laughs]

390
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,208
[man] Hey! Those aren't your potatoes!

391
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,625
[men talking]

392
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,333
[in English] Hugh! You're to take this
straight upstairs to the PM.

393
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,458
- What is it?
- Reply from Berlin.

394
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,750
- Hurry!
- Oh!

395
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,708
Here. Thank you.

396
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,625
We'd be abandoning
the people of Czechoslovakia to the Nazis.

397
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,250
- We would not be abandoning them.
- Excuse me, sir.

398
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,791
- It's Hitler's reply to your broadcast.
- Ah, good. Good, good, good.

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,541
Ahh.

400
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,375

[muttering]

402
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,083
Well?

403
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,708
[Chamberlain] No.
He's not changing his mind.

404
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,083
You know, we might…

405
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,791
Uh, Legat, would you fetch my copy
of <i>The Times</i> from my office?

406
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,208
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I've got one here.

407
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,083
- Right. Is it today's?
- Yes.

408
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,333
[Chamberlain] Oh, good. Now,
let's see what we've got here.

409
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,541
- Hitler's speech is page 17, sir.
- 17, very good.

410
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,750
There we are. Good. Now, there's…

411
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,416
Something has been niggling at me
since I read this.

412
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,708
"We never found
a single great power in Europe

413
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:25,166
with a man at its head
who has as much understanding

414
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,375
for the distress of our people

415
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,791
as my great friend Benito Mussolini."

416
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,333
- See what I mean?
- Yes.

417
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,708
I'm not sure I do.

418
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,250
If Herr Hitler
is not going to listen to me…

419
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,708
[scribbling]

420
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,000
…maybe he'll listen to his great friend

421
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,958
Benito Mussolini.

422
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:57,083
Now, Legat, I want you to take this
to the cipher room

423
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:01,333
and have it telegraphed immediately
to Jimmy Drummond,

424
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,375
- our ambassador in Rome.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

425
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:07,541
Hadn't you better tell the foreign
secretary you're writing to the Italians?

426
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,916
Oh, damn the foreign secretary.

427
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,541
[laughs]

428
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,041
Oh, Legat, forget you heard that.

Andi, three schnapps.

[Andi] Three schnapps, coming right up.

458
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,125
Go ahead.

459
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:04,000
Everyone was there,
all the top-ranking defence generals.

460
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,833
And they all confirmed again

461
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,833
that there is strong opposition
to a war with the Czechs.

462
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,750
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

463
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:16,875
At two o'clock tomorrow,
when Hitler gives the order to invade,

464
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,416
the Wehrmacht will step in.

465
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,791
- And the three of us are the key.
- What exactly does that mean?

466
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,208
We go to the Chancellery.

467
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,625
We make sure
that all important entry points are clear.

468
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,791
Then we give the signal to step in,
and Hitler will be arrested.

469
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,583
You believe that the Wehrmacht
will take action against him?

470
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,750
War with the Czechs, that's…

471
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,416
That means war with Britain and France.

472
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,208
That's crazy!
It's the last thing the generals want.

473
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,500
Right, Hans.
But still, I don't trust the generals.

474
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,916
They're not opposed to him.

475
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They're just opposed to war
because they're scared they'll lose it.

476
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,916
Is this really the only plan?

477
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,541
[Hans] It's the only plan we have, Erich.

478
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,000
[Erich] It all sounds
so incredibly fragile.

479
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,625
Have you ever wondered if we're wrong?

480
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,083
What if we're mistaken?

481
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,416
What if he's right,
and he's telling the truth

482
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,875
that he just wants to take back
the territories that belong to Germany?

483
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,250
- And he'll stop there?
- Then leave, Erich.

484
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,625
He's a small, vulgar man.
Hitler is like a thug.

485
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,416
He only knows his own personal truth.
He'll keep taking more and more.

486
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,666
- More people will get hurt.
- How do you know?

487
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,875
- He'll never stop!
- It's not the time to argue!

488
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,041
- Tomorrow, tomorrow is the day...

Let's assume
Hitler gets arrested tomorrow.

492
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,916
What happens then?

493
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,750
We shoot the bastard.

494
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,333
If he doesn't surrender.

495
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:01,333
Tomorrow at two o'clock, we will hear
that mobilisation is beginning.

496
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,458
That will be our cue.

When he mobilises tomorrow,
we will stop him.

00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,916
- You want him to mobilise?
- Yes, damn it!

513
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
[whispers] If he doesn't go to war,
you can't stop him.

514
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,583
But, Paul, that means you need this war.
That's totally perverse.

515
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:30,416
Of course that's perverse, Helen.
Without a crime, there can be no arrest.

516
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,625
What?

517
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,458
I'm considering if I should trust you.

518
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,458
Mm-hm?

519
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,583
- You've already trusted me.
- This is something different.

520
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,083
What is it?

521
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:08,250
FOREIGN OFFICE
POLITICAL DEPARTMENT

522
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,541
[exhales]

523
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,833
What's this?

524
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,125
I got it from the Foreign Office.
I took it today.

525
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:21,833
What's this?

526
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,416
This is his true plan for Europe.

527
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,416
PROTOCOL OF THE MEETING IN THE CHANCELLERY
ON NOVEMBER 5, 1937

528
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,541
[sighs]

529
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,375
They'll arrest you for this.

530
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,125
I'm aware.

531
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,583
[Paul sighs]

532
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,875
- This is appalling.
- What are you going to do with it?

533
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,375
What are you going to do with it?

534
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,250
[knocking at door]

535
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:28,708
Come in.

536
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,958
Letting you know I'll be upstairs, sir.
If you need me.

537
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,583
Righto. Oh, you're on tonight, are you?

538
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,208
Yes, sir. I'm here till the morning.

539
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,333
Oh, good. Any reply from Rome?

540
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,375
Not yet, sir.

541
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,333
But, you know, it wasn't built in a day.

542
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,791
Hah! [chuckles]

543
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,541
Far as I can see,
they haven't finished it yet. [chuckles]

544
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,750
Are you an Oxford man?

545
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,041
Yes, Prime Minister.

546
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,291
Aah. Come on in. Close the door a minute.

547
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:58,708
Terribly draughty, this place.

548
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,833
- What did you read at Oxford?
- German.

549
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,708
Did they teach you
to write English as well?

550
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,000
[laughs] Well, they did their best.

551
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,708
I was more of a talker than a writer,
though, sir. Debating was my thing.

552
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,625
- Debating?
- Yes, sir.

553
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,333
Well, you've come to the right place.

554
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,791
It's all anybody seems to do here
is to debate.

555
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,583
Listen, I've got something
I'm going to ask you to do.

556
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,500
It's a little bit impertinent, but this is
my speech for tomorrow to the House.

557
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,166
But I... I feel somehow it doesn't flow,

558
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,583
and maybe... maybe an Oxford man,

559
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:34,791
who… who debates and… and reads German,

560
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,666
might be able to improve it a little.

561
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,750
- Would you mind?
- Of course, Prime Minister.

562
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,416
Thank you so much.

563
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,500
- Very good. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

564
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,208
[murmur of conversation]

565
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,291
- I'm sorry…
- How are you?

566
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,916
- Ah, this looks promising.
- George...

567
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,250
- Make sure you got your camera.
- Ready?

568
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,458
[officer] All right? Okay.

569
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,125
- Yes, sir.
- Just keep an eye on them.

570
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,791
Nothing from Rome, Prime Minister.

571
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,291
Oh. Huh.

572
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:18,166
Still early.
Just have to be patient and wait.

573
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,583
[sighs]

574
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,833
Do you know,

575
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:27,791
I'd gladly stand against that wall
and be shot if it prevented war.

576
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,291
Come here.

577
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,625
I wish you wouldn't say things like that.

578
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,750
- Hmm.
- At least not before lunch.

579
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,666
Right.

580
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,000
Of course, you were too young
to serve in the Great War, Legat.

581
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,625
[sighs]

582
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,083
And I was too old.

583
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Somehow, that made things worse.

584
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,166
It is absolute agony to…

585
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,666
See such suffering and…

586
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,041
Feel so powerless.

587
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,458
Oh. Right.

588
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,833
Now every time I…

589
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,750
Pass a war memorial or…

590
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,791
Visit one of those
vast cemeteries in France,

591
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,791
where so many of my friends lie buried,

592
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:18,458
I vow that if I find myself
in the position

593
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:21,583
where I could prevent
such a catastrophe from happening again,

594
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,750
I shall do anything…

595
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,916
Sacrifice anything…

596
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
To maintain the peace.

597
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,500
This is sacred to me.

598
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,083
I understand.

599
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,291
Ah, it's not that
we're militarily unprepared for war.

600
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,958
That can be remedied, is being remedied.

601
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,125
It's... it is rather that I… I fear for
the spiritual wellbeing of our people

602
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,541
if they don't see their leaders
doing everything, absolutely everything,

603
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,500
to prevent another conflict.

604
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,125
'Cause of one thing, I'm certain.

605
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,250
If it comes,

606
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,250
the next war
will be infinitely worse than the last.

607
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,500
And they will need even greater fortitude
to survive it.

608
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,333
- Neville.
- No.

609
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:19,083
Oh, it's all right. It's all right.

610
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,666
[kisses] Come on. Let's go in.

611
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:34,083
This is Joan, Mr. Legat.
She's our fastest.

612
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,750
Joan, stop what you're doing now.

613
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,375
Mr. Legat needs you
to type up the PM's speech for the House.

614
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,333
- Of course.
- Thank you.

615
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,208
- Thank you for doing this so quickly.
- You're most welcome.

616
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,708
If you could make four copies, please.

617
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,041
These notes in red, these amendments,
if you can put them in where they are.

618
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,458
Absolutely, thank you.

619
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,750
Uh, could you, um… stand
a little further away, please?

620
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,833
Right, sorry.

621
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,166
Sorry, Miss, um…

622
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,875
Joan will be sufficient.

623
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,125
And if you want to know where I'm from…

624
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,458
- [Hugh] I...
- …the answer is Nottingham.

625
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,791
[chuckles]

626
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,083
Yes.

627
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,208
- [knocking at door]
- Yes?

628
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,750
- Sorry for my delay, sir.
- Ah! Legat, good, good.

629
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:28,458
Now, we can't risk
losing the connection to Berlin.

630
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:31,916
Syers has the line to Rome,
so I want you to sit here…

631
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,375
Bring that chair over.

632
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,500
…and keep the line open
and listen out for news.

633
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,125
- Do you think you can manage that?
- Of course, sir.

634
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,666
What exactly am I listening for?

635
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,875
To see whether Mussolini's intervened.

636
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,666
The PM needs to know
before he addresses the House.

637
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,708
Things are getting tight.

638
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:53,291
- Yes. That is painfully obvious.
- [door opens]

639
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,458
- Anything?
- Not yet.

640
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,708
What…

641
00:37:58,791 --> 00:37:59,833
[grunts]

642
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:02,791
[sighs]

643
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,708
- I'm afraid we do need to leave now, sir.
- Yes.

644
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,583
- You address the House in ten minutes.
- Yes, I know.

645
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,583
[sighs]

646
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,083
- Nothing?
- Nothing, sir.

647
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,000
- The line's open?
- The line's open. No reply.

648
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,583
- Sir.
- Yes.

649
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:19,666
Yes, all right!

650
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,416
If news comes
once the PM is speaking, Legat,

651
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,541
- bring it to the chamber immediately.
- Yes, sir.

652
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,041
- Is Anne here?
- She's gone on ahead.

653
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:30,375
She'll be in the gallery, as will I.

654
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,208
- Your hat, sir.
- Thank you so much.

655
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,291
[cheering]

656
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:39,750
- God bless you, Mr. Chamberlain!
- [man] Mr. Chamberlain!

657
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,375
[shouting]

658
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,291
Good luck, sir.

659
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,500
We're all behind you. God bless you.

660
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:54,833
[sighs]

661
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,208
[clock ticking]

662
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,041
[watch ticking]

663
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,083
[ticking grows louder]

664
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,458
[crackling on line]

665
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,375
- Hello?
- [man] <i>This is the ambassador.</i>

666
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:14,791
Mr. Henderson, this is Hugh Legat,
the prime minister's private secretary.

667
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:18,333
<i>I just returned from Herr Hitler.
Where's the PM?</i>

668
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,458
[Chamberlain] <i>For His Majesty's</i>
<i>Government,</i>

669
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:33,000
<i>there were three alternative courses</i>

670
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,041
<i>that might have been adopted.</i>

671
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,416
<i>Either we could have threatened
to go to war with Germany</i>

672
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,583
<i>if it attacked Czechoslovakia,</i>

673
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:49,208
<i>or we could have stood aside
and allowed matters to take their course.</i>

674
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,416
<i>Or finally, we could attempt</i>

675
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,333
<i>a peaceful settlement by way of mediation.</i>

676
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,375
[MPs] <i>Hear, hear.</i>

677
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:03,083
I know very well
that I have opened myself to criticism

678
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,375
- on the grounds that I was detracting…
- It's a message from Berlin.

679
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:10,125
[Chamberlain] …from the dignity
of a British prime minister,

680
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,083
and to disappointment

681
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,666
and perhaps even resentment…

682
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,625
-[murmuring]
…if I failed to deliver

683
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,208
a satisfactory agreement.

684
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,291
- Ahem.
- [MPs whispering and muttering]

685
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,541
[sighs]

686
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,541
[exhales heavily]

687
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,625
[MPs murmuring]

688
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,708
I am…

689
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,750
Able to report to the House

690
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:49,458
that I have just received news from Berlin

691
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,000
that Herr Hitler

692
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,625
has postponed mobilisation.

693
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,458
[cheering]

694
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,375
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

695
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,291
Furthermore,

696
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,291
- he has invited me…
- [man] Very well done, Prime Minister!

697
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,625
…along with Signor Mussolini

698
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,458
and the prime minister of France,
Monsieur Daladier,

699
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:16,083
- to meet him in Munich tomorrow…
- [knocking at door]

700
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,375
…to resolve the Sudetenland issue.

701
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,291
[MPs cheering]

702
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,250
[in German] Gentlemen.

703
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,250
- Is it starting?
- [sighs]

704
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,583
Mussolini talked Hitler into a conference
with Chamberlain and Daladier.

705
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,541
Tomorrow in Munich.

706
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:35,583
They're going to sacrifice the Sudetenland
to prevent war.

707
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:39,416
- Damn it!
- They're doing exactly what he wants.

708
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,250
- Will the Wehrmacht move against him?
- We can forget about that.

709
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,041
- Not a chance.
- So this is it?

710
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,750
- God damn it!
- Honestly, please.

711
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,250
Pardon me.

712
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,041
What do the gentlemen plan on doing?

713
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:04,708
It's as good as decided.
A conference like this is a formality.

714
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,875
You need to find a way
to meet Chamberlain.

715
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,250
You have to prevent this agreement
from being made.

716
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,916
[chuckles]

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,708
Thank God you can still laugh.

718
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,750
Show him the proof.

719
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,666
- What proof?
- That Hitler is bent on a war of conquest.

720
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,916
I am in possession of a document.

721
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,416
What kind of document?

722
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,708
[Paul] Trust me, please.

723
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,041
- Paul.
- Can I just…

724
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,791
Just a moment…

725
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,125
Hugh Legat
is one of Chamberlain's secretaries.

726
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:01,958
Can you arrange for him to come to Munich?
That he's part of the English delegation?

727
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:04,375
Possibly, yes.

728
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,458
- Will he be expecting...
- No.

729
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,333
But he will help us.

730
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,291
All right.

731
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,708
Right, I'll do what I can.

732
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,625
Gentlemen.

733
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,291
[door closes]

734
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,291
And can you get Paul into the conference?

735
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,958
I'll try and add you as an interpreter.

736
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,958
I have to get back.

737
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,083
What's happening here?

738
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,416
Do you think
you can smuggle illegal documents

739
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,583
into an international conference

740
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:00,333
and have a secret meeting
with the British prime minister,

741
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,291
right under the Führer's nose?

742
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,916
- Yes.
- [laughs]

743
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,083
Oh, Paul?

744
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,666
Then you should have this with you.

745
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:35,916
Ever used one?

746
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,250
- As children, we used to shoot rabbits.
- [both laugh]

747
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,375
This is different.

748
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,500
The principle's the same, right?

749
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,583
Thanks.

750
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:52,333
[in English] Sir Alexander?
I got a message you wanted to see me.

751
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,625
[Cadogan] Ah, Legat. Yes.

752
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,041
Close the door.

753
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,083
What's this about, sir?

754
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,250
[Cadogan] This is Colonel Menzies
from MI6.

755
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,041
- Colonel?
- Good evening.

756
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:16,000
I believe the name Paul von Hartmann
is known to you?

757
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,666
[Cadogan] Legat?

758
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:21,625
Yes.

759
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:25,083
Yes, sir. We were at Oxford together.

760
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,208
When did you last see him?

761
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,750
Uh, the summer of '32.
I visited him in Munich.

762
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,500
All roads lead to Munich.

763
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,375
- Any contact since?
- No.

764
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,166
- Why not?
- We had a disagreement.

765
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,875
- What about?
- Politics.

766
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,916
And you haven't communicated since?

767
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:44,875
No, sir.

768
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,958
We're sorry about the questions, Legat,

769
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:52,583
but we need to understand
what sort of relationship you have,

770
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:56,291
or had, with this particular German.

771
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:02,333
It seems your friend is part of
the secret opposition to Hitler.

772
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:08,458
His position inside the Foreign Ministry
gives him access to classified material.

773
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,875
Material he's willing to share with us.

774
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,041
Or, more specifically, with you.

775
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,000
How do you feel about that?

776
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:19,416
Surprised.

777
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,833
[Cadogan] But…

778
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,208
Are you willing to take matters further?

779
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,708
I don't understand.

780
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:31,041
He has a document in his possession,

781
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,750
and we'd very much like to know
what it is.

782
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,583
We'd like you to go to Munich tomorrow,

783
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,333
meet with von Hartmann,
and get the document.

784
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,083
I beg your pardon?

785
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,041
It's not without risk.

786
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:48,083
Technically, it'll be
an act of espionage on foreign soil.

787
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,833
This kind of thing, sir, I...

788
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,875
- I'm not really...
- No one is at first, but you'll do fine.

789
00:46:56,291 --> 00:46:57,875
Duty calls, Legat.

790
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,791
- I'm not sure how Cleverly will feel...
- [Cadogan] Leave Cleverly to us.

791
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,458
Absolutely. We know Oscar.

792
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,500
And the PM doesn't need to know.

793
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,708
Well.

794
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,916
Good luck, Legat.

795
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,916
[sighs]

796
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,041
[crowd shouting in German]

797
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:42,791
[man] <i>The German Reich!</i>
<i>Vote for the German Reich!</i>

798
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,375
{\an8}Which government is in the right?
The answer is…

799
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,000
{\an8}Cast your pivotal vote!

800
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,541
[in English] I was recommended
a bar called "Hubers."

801
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,166
- Yeah, we know it.
- Yeah, we know it.

802
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,916
- What?
- We know Hubers.

803
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,375
- Great!
- Not great.

804
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,375
- [man shouting in German]
- [in English] Yes, great. Ah!

805
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,708
The beer's cheap,
and apparently, they have live music.

806
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,916
Believe me, the music there is awful.

807
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,958
Awful music is my favourite kind of music.

808
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:06,333
- Mine too. Paul.
- Yeah. See?

809
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,208
[in German] It's his vacation.
He's the guest.

810
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:09,583
[in English] Hugh gets to choose.

811
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,541
FOR LIST 2, VOTE NSDAP

812
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,458
- Hubers.
- Hubers.

813
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,375
[in German] Thirsty!

814
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,416
[band plays upbeat jazz]

815
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,500
[Hugh, in English] You can go there.
There is one. He took coffee there.

816
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,166
It's on my little list,
which you all made fun of.

817
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,250
I don't want to go to this... this rally.

818
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,166
Yeah, but I want to go to the rally.

819
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,208
- [in German] You're not going there.
- Pardon?

820
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,833
- You're too drunk, Lena.
- I see. I'm too drunk.

821
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,125
- I'm going.
- Well, I won't come. Not with you two.

822
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:43,916
Okay, then don't.

823
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,583
- [in English] Hugh will come.
- [sighs]

824
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:49,625
Do I have to go?

825
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,833
You have to actually see the man.

826
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,750
If he's so ridiculous,
why not just ignore him?

827
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,166
Ignore him?
We cannot ignore him. He's dangerous!

828
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,750
- No, but this is fuelling the fire, Lena.
- He's...

829
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:03,083
- This is what he wants. Attention.
- He's talking about things that matter!

830
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:05,625
- Oh, come on, Paul.
- There's a reason people attend rallies.

831
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:08,500
- Paul, he's a bigot and a pervert.
- Exactly.

832
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:11,875
The people of a whole country
forgot about what makes them as a nation,

833
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,083
and now that there is someone to lead them

834
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:17,041
and to remind them
of their nation's greatness...

835
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,458
I don't understand
how anyone can vote for this man.

836
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,166
Voting for Hitler
is not voting against Jews.

837
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,000
- Not against Jews?
- It's voting... No!

838
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,500
- It's voting for the future.
- The future?

839
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,083
- [Lena] For the future?
- Yes! Yes!

840
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,208
- What future?
- I'll show you!

841
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,916
[in German] You lot, hey!
Can I ask you something?

842
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,125
- What?
- What do you want?

843
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,916
- Who are you going to vote for?
- Why?

844
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,291
What do you think of Hitler?

845
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:41,125
Hitler makes us proud to be German again!

846
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,291
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Who are you lot going to vote for?

847
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:45,750
- [man] Hitler!
- Thank you.

848
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,041
[in English] See? The future.

849
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,458
[all cheering] Yes!

850
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:51,833
[in English] Now, Paul, you have
to be careful, because people are scared.

851
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,958
Yes, scared of change.

852
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:57,875
[in German] Paul,
people are leaving the country.

853
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:00,791
Families are getting on boats to America.

854
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,208
If that's what they decide,
they are free to do so.

855
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,458
- They don't just decide like that!
- Bullshit!

856
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,375
People don't want to live here any more.

857
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,250
They are scared to live in this country.
That's not just bullshit!

858
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:12,875
[in English] The Germany you're
speaking of is being built

859
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,541
upon the suffering of other people.

860
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,958
You're one to talk
about exploiting others,

861
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,666
- Englishman.
- Oh, all right.

862
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:22,500
I take it. I'm a hypocrite.
But I know fanaticism when I see it.

863
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:25,166
[in German] Fa-na-ti-cal.

864
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:29,916
[in English] You think I'm a fanatic?

865
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,333
I think he's a fanatic,

866
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,708
- and you are defending him.
- You sound like him.

867
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:34,625
[in German] Fuck you!

868
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,958
- [in English] Hey!
- What? You want to say something to me?

869
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:40,541
- I don't like you speaking like that.
- I don't like you talking as if you knew

870
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:43,000
- what any of this feels like!
- I don't think you understand

871
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,416
- this feeling you're...
- No, no, no.

872
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,166
You don't understand anything
about me or about Germany!

873
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,208
- [speaking German]
- You never for a second

874
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,750
ever forget your triumph!

875
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,708
- [man 1, in German] Be quiet!
- [man 2] Exactly!

876
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:56,958
You're talking down to me like a child.
I'm supposed to be grateful for that?

877
00:50:57,041 --> 00:51:00,041
I'm sick of being grateful!
And I'm sick of you too.

878
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,750
Pau...

879
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,583
- [clears throat]
- [in English] I'm... I'm so sorry.

880
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,625
You don't have to be sorry.

881
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,250
[sighs] I don't... I don't understand this.

882
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,958
We always used to enjoy
provoking each other. It...

883
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,541
It was fun, but this is... this is
different. I've not seen him like that.

884
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,208
[sniffling] Me neither.

885
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,708
[sobs] I mean…

886
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:38,583
Shall we…

887
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,125
See some bigots and perverts?

888
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:43,208
[laughs]

889
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,833
Yes.

890
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,541
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

891
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,000
[horn beeps]

892
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,916
- [in German] Well?
- Here are your papers.

893
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,250
They barely got you on the list.

894
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,041
Ready?

895
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,583
Are you coming?

896
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:16,416
Someone needs to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

897
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,458
Go, hurry. See you in Munich.

898
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:34,375
EMIGRATE! GO TO JERUSALEM!

899
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,000
This is your compartment.

900
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:47,750
Thank you.

901
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,250
[train whistle blows]

902
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,875
[announcement over loudspeaker in German]

903
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,958
[footsteps approaching]

904
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,000
- [man 1] Cramped but cosy, huh?
- [man 2] Yeah!

905
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,458
[man 1] Helmut, no visits from women.

906
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:47,833
[Helmut] Of course, you know me.

907
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:49,000
[laughter]

908
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,083
[man 1] This is me.

909
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,750
- There's someone in there already. Hello?
- [Paul] Yes.

910
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,833
[laughter]

911
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:58,500
Paulie?

912
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,458
Hello, Franz.

913
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,958
What are you doing here?

914
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,458
It seems they need my help…

915
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,791
- I see.
- …with interpreting.

916
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:10,000
- No one told me.
- Yes, it was a last-minute decision.

917
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,791
[Franz] Huh.

918
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,250
- Is this your bunk?
- Yes.

919
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,833
Then we're roommates.

920
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:19,916
Yeah.

921
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,250
Like in the old days.

922
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,458
[laughs]

923
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,958
- Like in the old days!
- Yeah, excellent!

924
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:28,375
- Excellent, right?
- Excellent.

925
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,291
[chuckles]

926
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:30,791
Great.

927
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,458
- Okay, may I? One second.
- Yeah.

928
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,125
- See you in a bit, I…
- See you.

929
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,958
[whistling merrily]

930
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,083

[crowd shouting]

933
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,041
Thank you, Legat.

934
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,916
[man] Prime Minister,
don't let us go to war again.

935
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,875
- [man] Good luck, sir.
- Nice of you. I'll make sure we don't.

936
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,166
- [woman] Sir, you can really do this.
- Good morning.

937
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,875
- We should board, Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.

938
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:34,791
[man] Mr. Chamberlain!

939
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:36,666
- Give us a statement!
- [Wilson] Prime Minister?

940
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,333
Sir?

941
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,083
- He'll give us...
- Yes.

942
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,583
- Good luck, sir.
- Yes, indeed.

943
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,041
Prime Minister, please.

944
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,375
- Thank you.
- Thank you. That's enough.

945
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:48,500
- [Chamberlain] I'm going to say a word.
- [Wilson] We should board now, sir.

946
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,708
[clears throat] When I was a boy,

947
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,416
I used to repeat,

948
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,000
"If at first you don't succeed,

949
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:03,125
try, try, try again."

950
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,666
And that's what I'm doing now.

951
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,000
- [cheering]
- [man] Good luck, Mr. Chamberlain!

952
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,333
[woman 1] Safe journey, sir!

953
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,375
[woman 2] Protect us, sir!

954
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,458
[sighs]

955
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,833
[muffled voices in corridor]

956
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,583
[gasps]

957
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,166
[toilet flushes]

958
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,875
[laughs]

959
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:48,500
- [in German] You caught me.
- Can I assist you?

960
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:50,750
I know it looks bad,
but it's nothing personal.

961
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,000
We all have our orders.

962
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,625
I'm relieved to be able to tell you
that everything is in order.

963
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,166
You can put it back now.

964
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,166
Thank you so much.

965
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,916
Come on, Paulie. Are you cross now?

966
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,833
Do I hear you being cross now?
Is Paulie cross?

967
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,208
Cross little Paulie!

968
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,125
[laughs]

969
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,625
Paulie, come on!

970
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,958
[guffawing]

971
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,041
Defend yourself!

972
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,458
Come on, defend yourself!

973
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,750
[laughs]

974
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:22,916
- Von Hartmann?
- I am.

975
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,750
Dr. Schmidt. Head of translation.
Do you have a moment?

976
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,000
- Of course.
- I'm very pleased to meet you.

977
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:31,375
I'm relieved
I don't have to do all of it by myself.

978
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:35,125
When we arrive in Munich,
I will handle the Führer, the Duce,

979
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,416
the Prime Minister,
and the Président du Conseil.

980
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,791
And you can deal with the smaller stuff.

981
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,500
What other languages do you speak?

982
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:45,791
[in each language] French, Italian, and
a little, really just a little bit of Ru…

983
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:48,625
[in German] The Russians aren't invited,
and neither are the Czechs.

984
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:51,125
Don't worry.
I'll brief you on the details later.

985
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,541
Right now, the Führer is waiting
for his foreign press summary.

986
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,000
Can you take care of that?

987
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,458
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

988
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,291
[Paul] Uh…

989
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,750
What do I have to do?

990
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,291
Look him in the eye.

991
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,541
Don't speak
unless you're spoken to directly.

992
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:11,166
And don't smell of smoke.

993
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,041
If you stink of smoke,
he'll throw you out.

994
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,000
[train whistle blows]

995
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,833
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

996
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:29,083
Von Hartmann,
press summary for the Führer.

997
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,333
Who wrote this?

998
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:51,666
That's the editorial
in the <i>London Times,</i> my Führer.

999
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,416
Have you spent time in England?

1000
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,833
I was at Oxford for two years.

1001
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,583
I can hear that.

1002
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,250
Von Hartmann.

1003
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,500
You're ambitious. Good.

1004
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:20,208
You're intelligent. Good.

1005
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,583
Maybe you think
you're more intelligent than me?

1006
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,041
- I...
- I can read people.

1007
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,416
The way professors at those universities
read books.

1008
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,166
[scoffs]

1009
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,291
Oxford.

1010
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:40,333
I see who you are.

1011
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,083
Do you see me?

1012
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:47,500
Yes, my Führer.

1013
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,875
You know the English.
What are they thinking?

1014
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,416
They underestimate you.

1015
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,416
Correct.

1016
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,208
[door opens]

1017
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,375
The maps, my Führer.

1018
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,166
The new course for the border.

1019
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:11,333
We have 40 divisions
to destroy the Czechs with.

1020
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:14,791
We could have it done within a week.

1021
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:15,875
Yes, my Führer.

1022
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,916
The train is heading
in the wrong direction.

1023
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,750
Why these detours?

1024
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:28,708
Good, thank you.

01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:47,708
Oh.

1030
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,833
I have a very sore back.

1031
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,916
[whispering in German]

1032
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,916
- [Chamberlain, in English] Look at this.
- Would you care for something to drink?

1033
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,708
[Chamberlain] Ah… Yes.
A little, ah… whisky and water.

1034
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:00,291
[man] <i>Whisky mit Wasser.</i>

1035
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:02,625
[man, in German] Welcome.

1036
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:05,208
- [in English] A great pleasure.
- [man] Our friend Hermann Göring.

1037
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,333
[in German] Hello.

1038
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,458
Welcome. Pardon me.

1039
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:08,666
[in English] Good morning.

1040
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,291
- [in German] Welcome.
- Hello.

1041
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,500
Attention!

1042
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,916
Ah.

1043
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:31,500
We'll talk upstairs. Tell him that.

1044
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,625
[gasps]

1045
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,083
Just the four of us.
You and one advisor each.

1046
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,291
Yes, my Führer.

1047
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,625
Thank you.

1048
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:40,000
[man 1] …saw him carry himself
with confidence.

1049
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,125
- [man 2] Indeed.
- I'll go give him the rest.

1050
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,583
I require a watch. Lend me yours, please.

1051
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:51,125
He apparently thinks he won't get it back.
He thinks the Führer is a watch thief.

1052
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,416
[Hitler chuckles]

1053
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,708
He thinks he's one of the clever ones.

1054
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,250
Well, let's get it over with.

1055
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,375
[Schmidt] Very well, sir.

1056
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,041
[in English] Rather too strong, this.
I need to... Ah.

1057
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,333
[Schmidt] Excuse me, Your Excellencies.

1058
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:13,291
Prime Minister,
Monsieur le Président du Conseil.

1059
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:17,250
The Führer invites you
to join him in the library…

1060
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,625
- Very good. Come along.
- …In order to begin the talks.

1061
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:23,250
He suggests leaders and one advisor only.

1062
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,625
Ah.

1063
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:31,125
Well. Sorry, Henderson.
Horace, looks it better be you.

1064
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:35,750
[in German] Well,
please excuse me a moment.

1065
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,583
[laughter]

1066
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,750
[murmured conversations in German]

1067
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,375
[rapid typing]

1068
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,416
It was a mistake not to insist
on the Czechs being in the negotiations.

1069
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:26,500
They're carving up the damn country,
and there's no one...

1070
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:30,958
Please try to stop fidgeting, Mr. Legat.
You'll wear that chair down to a splinter.

1071
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,083
[telephone rings]

1072
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:41,083
- Hello.
- Yes, this is Cleverly.

1073
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,250
- Sir, it's Legat.
- Yes. Where's the PM?

1074
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,083
Everyone's been at the conference
for about an hour now, sir.

1075
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,083
Good, good, good.

1076
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,916
Sir Horace asked me to stay here,
but I feel I'd be more...

1077
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,541
Make sure this line remains open.

1078
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:55,291
With respect, I feel I'd be more useful
to the PM if I was at the conference.

1079
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,500
Just do your job, Legat.

1080
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,083
But having come all of this way...

1081
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,458
<i>Absolutely not!</i>

1082
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,500
You stay exactly where you are.

1083
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,500
Hello? Sir?

1084
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:05,458
Sir?

1085
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,458
- [click]
- Hello?

1086
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:09,750
If London calls again,

1087
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,500
I can always tell them you're busy
with the hotel manager.

1088
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,458
They'll believe that, I'm sure.

1089
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,333
Go.

1090
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,791
- [in German] Oh, sorry!
- Watch it!

1091
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,000
[church bell ringing]

1092
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,458
Your ID, please.

1093
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
[conversation and laughter]

1094
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,500
[man] <i>Monsieur.</i>

1095
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,083
- [laughter]
<i>- Bien sûr.</i>

1096
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:03,875
Excuse me. Sir Neville?

1097
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,625
- Yes.
- I'm Hugh Legat.

1098
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:09,750
Ah, Legat. Yes, of course.
What are you doing here?

1099
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:12,000
I had a couple of queries from London.

1100
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:13,708
Is Sir Horace in?

1101
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,250
No. No, he's with the PM
and the other leaders.

1102
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,833
Is there anything you can tell me?

1103
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:20,083
[sighs] Nothing pressing.

1104
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:23,916
[in German] Hartmann, have you noticed
how often Göring changed outfits today?

1105
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,416
This is the third uniform
I've seen him wear today.

1106
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,250
[chuckling]

1107
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:32,083
But don't let that...
Oh, there's Schmidt. He needs you.

1108
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,625
The Führer wishes
for the ambassadors to join now.

1109
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,083
Fetch François-Poncet and Henderson.
Quickly, please.

1110
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,500
- [in English] How's it going?
- Haven't a clue.

1111
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,625
[in French] Mr. Ambassador.

1112
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,791
- [in English] Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

1113
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,125
Tea, if you'd be so kind.

1114
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,708
[woman, in German] Right away.

1115
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:04,083
[in English] Your Excellency,
would you be so good

1116
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,291
as to join the leaders in the library?

1117
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,541
At last.

1118
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:21,750
[in German] I… Follow me
without anyone seeing.

1119
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:48,708
[door opens]

1120
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,708
[soldiers speaking German]

1121
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,208
[in English] Where the hell are you going?

1122
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,583
[tram bell ringing]

1123
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,041
[horn blares]

1124
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,166
[bicycle bell rings]

1125
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:43,625
-[in German[] Hello.

1126
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,916
- Do you happen to have the time?
- No. I'm sorry.

1127
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,041
Thanks anyway.

1128
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:49,625
[in English] Damn it.

1129
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,833
[sighs]

1130
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:06,791
[jazz playing]

1131
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,125
- [in English] Were you followed?
- I don't know.

1132
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,541
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1133
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:45,291
Welcome to the New Germany, Hugh.

1134
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:46,958
Are we safe?

1135
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,041
As safe as anywhere.

1136
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,875
It's fine. I'll order beers.
We'll drink them.

1137
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,958
We'll listen to the music
and speak entirely in German.

1138
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,750
[in German] Excuse me.
Some beer? Two pale lagers.

1139
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,666
You're married?

1140
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,083
Yes.

1141
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,583
Happily?

1142
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:10,541
So-so.

1143
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:12,958
What about you?

1144
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:14,750
No.

1145
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:17,833
You're turning grey.

1146
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,833
And you still don't need to shave.

1147
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:22,166
[chuckles]

1148
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,000
Where's Lena?

1149
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,083
We don't speak any more.

1150
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:34,666
My pleasure. Cheers.

1151
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:43,958
Hugh, we both, you and I,

1152
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,958
are the last hope of stopping Hitler.

1153
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,166
Wh... [laughs]

1154
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,958
They're going to make a deal.
Tomorrow or the day after.

1155
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,958
I know. That's the problem.

1156
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,041
Why?

1157
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:03,083
Make your deal,
and Hitler becomes even more powerful.

1158
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:04,250
We're preventing a war.

1159
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,875
No, you're not. You're not!

1160
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:10,333
I know it's awful for the Czechs
to lose these territories,

1161
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,500
but if you invade tomorrow,

1162
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,166
tens of thousands
of innocent people will die.

1163
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,750
Yes. And if we don't invade tomorrow,
then soon maybe millions will die.

1164
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,000
Millions.

1165
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,708
You have no idea who he is.

1166
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:28,208
If you did, none of you would be here.

1167
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:32,708
What do you want from me?

1168
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:37,291
A meeting with Chamberlain.

1169
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:38,750
Tonight.

1170
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:43,750
Help me. Hugh. You're his secretary.
Secretaries arrange meetings.

1171
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:46,416
- But not secret meetings with you.
- There has to be a way.

1172
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,583
It's impossible.
And what do you want to tell him?

1173
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:50,500
Hm?

1174
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,791
What do you want to tell him?

1175
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:55,083
[in English] That Hitler
is a terrible man?

1176
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:56,875
[in German] Trust me, he knows.

1177
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,083
[whispers] I can prove it.

1178
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,041
[laughs]

1179
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:01,625
Is that amusing to you?

1180
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:04,625
I'd forgotten what you're like.

1181
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:08,375
- You don't want to help me.
- I can't. I can't.

1182
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,958
I can't! Not with a private meeting.

1183
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:14,500
Bu... [sighs]

1184
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:19,333
But if you have information
we should know about,

1185
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:23,333
I can try to arrange
for the prime minister to see it.

1186
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,583
Before he signs anything?

1187
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,708
[sighs]

1188
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,000
I can try.

1189
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,125
Yes.

1190
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:38,791
Excuse me, sir.

1191
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:41,125
If you're done with the <i>Stürmer,</i>
could I have it?

1192
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,000
- Of course.
- [Paul] Yeah? And could I keep it as well?

1193
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,250
- Of course.
- Are you sure?

1194
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,000
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

1195
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,625
[sighs]

1196
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,208
JEW CENTRAL PRAGUE

1197
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:57,500
[in English] Don't look at it.
Just put it under your arm, God damn it.

1198
01:13:57,583 --> 01:14:00,208
- Right. Sorry.
- You make a terrible spy, Hugh.

1199
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:02,375
- Sorry.
- You should be at home with your wife.

1200
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:04,583
It's actually a relief to be away.

1201
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:07,750
Let me guess. She finds you distant.

1202
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:11,875
She says you don't let her in.

1203
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:13,166
[laughs]

1204
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:16,541
That's right.

1205
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,708
Do something about that.

1206
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:20,833
And finish your beer.

1207
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,375
Will I see you again?

1208
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,541
You know,

1209
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:27,875
if you ever needed to get out,
you'd be well looked after in London.

1210
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:30,833
I'll never abandon Germany. Never.

1211
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,166
[barking]

1212
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,000
[Hugh] <i>Top secret.</i>

1213
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,583
<i>Berlin, 10th November 1937.</i>

1214
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:09,916
[whistles]

1215
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,458
<i>The Führer began by explaining
that the question is one of space.</i>

1216
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,666
[men singing in German]

1217
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,833
<i>The German race comprises over 85 million,</i>

1218
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:22,750
<i>and this constitutes a more tightly-packed
racial community than any other country.</i>

1219
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:24,125
[girl speaking German]

1220
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:29,000
<i>The only remedy lies
in the acquisition of living space.</i>

1221
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:32,500
<i>And this will only be solved
by means of force.</i>

1222
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:51,375
[in German] How's your afternoon,
Herr von Hartmann?

1223
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:53,666
Arduous, Frau Winter. And yours?

1224
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,375
Well, I'm hanging in there.

1225
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:59,500
- Did you meet with your English friend?
- I did.

1226
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,416
- And?
- And we'll see.

1227
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:08,083
Did something happen?

1228
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,375
Yes, you could say that.

1229
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,500
We have an agreement.

1230
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,666
An agreement for the immediate handover
of the Sudetenland…

1231
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,791
[in Italian] Congratulations, Schmidt.
Excellent work.

1232
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:18,708
Thank you.

1233
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,125
[in German] …to the German Empire.

1234
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:22,666
We'll get everything we wanted.

1235
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,541
I thought it would take
at least another day.

1236
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:28,041
Yes, it would have
if Chamberlain had had his way.

1237
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:31,041
He wanted to wear down the Führer
with the smallest details.

1238
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:33,708
- The man is a bean counter.
- Have they signed already?

1239
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,583
What? The treaties are being drawn up
right now. They'll sign after dinner.

1240
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:39,333
And straighten your tie.

1241
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:42,500
The two of us have been invited
to the dining room with the Führer.

1242
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,833
- Oh, God.
- What, "Oh, God"? Von Hartmann.

1243
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,833
Herr von Hartmann, that's a great honour.

1244
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:48,666
- Yes.
- Quite right, Fräulein…

1245
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,666
- Frau Winter.
- Frau Winter.

1246
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:54,333
Anyway, the English and the French
aren't staying for dinner.

1247
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,833
They've lost their appetite.

1248
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,458
- So we were asked to fill the ranks.
- [man] Dr. Schmidt!

1249
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:01,708
Well, looks like I'm needed again.

1250
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:18,875
- [in English] A narrow escape.
- Thank you.

1251
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:22,291
The Führer is vegetarian.
Insists on meat not being served anywhere.

1252
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,708
- Does he?
- Yes.

1253
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:26,708
When I was at lunch at the Chancellery
with all the high command,

1254
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:29,000
- they served <i>Sellerieschnitzel.</i>
- [snorts]

1255
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:29,916
[man laughs]

1256
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,833
- Musso will have enjoyed that.
- Yes, wouldn't he just?

1257
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:36,583
And afterward, I'm telling you,
I went to a butcher's shop nearby.

1258
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:38,458
- Ordered two huge sausages.
- Could be <i>Wurst.</i>

1259
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,916
Yes. And I was just leaving
the butcher's shop,

1260
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,541
when who should be coming in
but Hermann Göring,

1261
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,458
- with a hungry look on his face?
- [laughing]

1262
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,208
- He was as famished as I was.
- Sir, I...

1263
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,583
Yes, not now, Legat.

1264
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:58,125
[in German] Don't drink too much,
von Hartmann. Just wet your lips.

1265
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,083
We still have a lot of work ahead of us.

1266
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,875
Tomorrow, the world will watch Munich
and our translations.

1267
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,041
Of course.

1268
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:07,833
We can't afford any mistakes.

1269
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:11,708
…he has some skill.
He's not a bad negotiator.

1270
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:14,375
[Henderson, in English] Prime Minister,
tomorrow morning,

1271
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:17,208
millions of mothers will be blessing you

1272
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,875
for having saved their sons
from the horror of war.

1273
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:22,166
Oh…

1274
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,833
- Prime Minister.
- [Chamberlain] Too kind.

1275
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:25,125
- Can I have a word?
- Not now.

1276
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,750
- It's rather urgent.
- Legat!

1277
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:28,000
[laughter]

1278
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:31,083
You really should go and rest
before the signing, Neville.

1279
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,333
I think I will take forty winks.

1280
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:36,208
- I sent a sandwich up to your room.
- Thanks so much, Horace.

1281
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,166
Legat. Will you just
give the man a moment to breathe?

1282
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,416
- Yes.
- He's very tired.

1283
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,291
He's been up for 15 hours or more.

1284
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:46,500
Yes, sir. Sorry.

1285
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:48,958
Join us for supper.

1286
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:51,041
All right.

1287
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,083
- [in German] Excuse me.
- Von Hartmann?

1288
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,583
Where are you going?

1289
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:11,958
[sighs]

1290
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,041
[silence falls]

1291
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:20,333
Excuse me, my Führer. I'm needed
for the translation of the agreement.

1292
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:21,916
Come here.

1293
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,625
I never forget a personal obligation.

1294
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:50,125
For Germany,

1295
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:53,833
I am prepared to be dishonest
a thousand times over.

1296
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,833
For myself, never.

1297
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,708
I'm no watch thief.

1298
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,125
[laughs]

1299
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,916
[loud laughter]

1300
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,583
Thank you, my Führer.

1301
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:16,875
[conversation resumes]

1302
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,125
[knife taps on glass]

1303
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:28,041
[Himmler] To the good health
of our dear Italian friends.

1304
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:29,750
And to the Führer.

1305
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,041
[all] To the Führer.

1306
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,708
[Wilson, in English]
One of the Italian delegates

1307
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:35,166
was saying how good the kitchen is.

1308
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,000
- [Henderson] Yes, indeed, yes.
- [Wilson] What do you recommend?

1309
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:41,500
- [Henderson] I recommend the <i>Hachsen.</i>
- [Wilson] What is that?

1310
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:43,833
[Henderson] It's a pork knuckle.
Very crispy.

1311
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:45,333
- Sir Horace!
- Yes?

1312
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:47,333
Would you mind
if I joined you in a moment?

1313
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:48,500
Yes, of course.

1314
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:54,833
[bell rings]

1315
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:56,875
- Have you read it?
- It's classified.

1316
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:58,833
- If they find…
- Have you spoken to Chamberlain?

1317
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:01,000
- Have you spoken to Chamberlain?
- Keep your voice down!

1318
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:03,083
- Thre's no linen. No linen.
- [Hugh] Not yet.

1319
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:05,000
You know they're about to sign?

1320
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:08,250
It isn't an easy thing to raise with him.

1321
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,250
- [sighs]
- Hmm.

1322
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:16,416
- Then I'll do it.
- Oh, for God's sake! Don't be stupid.

1323
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,750
This is the last moment.
Do you understand?

1324
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:21,166
I won't have it on my conscience
that I did nothing!

1325
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,166
- I feel the same. As soon as I can...
- No, no.

1326
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,541
- I'll talk to him.
- Not soon, now!

1327
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:25,750
- Let's do it together.
- No!

1328
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:28,458
- Why not? We are on the edge.
- Do you have any idea...

1329
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,333
We are right on the edge.

1330
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,291
Paul.

1331
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,708
- I'm sorry.
- What's happened to you?

1332
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,750
We have to try, Hugh.

1333
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:43,833
Please, we have to try.

1334
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:49,708
[sighs]

1335
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,625
This'll be the end of my career.

1336
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,416
Where's the document?

1337
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,666
In my room.

1338
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,833
Come on.

1339
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:08,375
[secretary] Is there another hotel nearby?

1340
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:10,958
Downtown. I will call it. I will call.

1341
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,916
Thank you, that would be great.

1342
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,041
In the meantime, if we can get some linen
so we can have a shower,

1343
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,125
that would be amazing.

1344
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,583
Listen.

1345
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,791
He's old, and he's exhausted.

1346
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,583
I'll give him the document,
and if he agrees to see you,

1347
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:39,333
for God's sake,
don't give him a moral lecture.

1348
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,375
- Just the facts.
- All right.

1349
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:42,875
Wait here.

1350
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,041
[door closes]

1351
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:02,791
[taps on door]

1352
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,583
Oh, sorry, Prime Minister.

1353
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:08,458
No, no, no, no. Come on in, Legat.
Just having my blood pressure checked.

1354
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,250
[groans]

1355
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:13,250
Fortunately, it looks
as if I'll live another day.

1356
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,000
- Good night.
- Good night, Joseph. Thank you.

1357
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:20,166
[sighs]

1358
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:24,458
So what is it that can't wait? Hm?

1359
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:30,208
We've come into possession
of a significant document.

1360
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:31,416
And who is "we"?

1361
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:34,375
I have come into possession of a document.

1362
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:38,416
What is it?

1363
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,000
The minutes of a meeting that Hitler held
with his senior commanders last November.

1364
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,041
Mm-hm.

1365
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,291
A meeting in which he explicitly
commits himself to a war of conquest.

1366
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,250
Obviously, it's all in German,

1367
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:50,625
but I believe it to be legitimate
and truthful.

1368
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:52,583
And how did this document come to us?

1369
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:56,416
A friend gave it to me
in strict confidence.

1370
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,250
- Friend?
- A German diplomat.

1371
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,541
Why does he wish us to have it?

1372
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:05,916
I think he should explain that himself.
He's waiting outside.

1373
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,083
- Does Sir Horace know about this?
- No, sir.

1374
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:12,416
Nobody knows.

1375
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,583
You're exceeding your authority,
young man.

1376
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,250
[scoffs] I can't possibly meet
with a German diplomat.

1377
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:24,208
I understand,
but he is risking his life to see you.

1378
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:25,375
No…

1379
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,833
This is… most improper.

1380
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:30,791
I'm aware, sir.

1381
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,291
Right.

1382
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,958
Three minutes. Not a moment longer.

1383
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,583
[door opens]

1384
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,666
You've got three minutes.

1385
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:51,875
This is Paul von Hartmann
of the German Foreign Ministry.

1386
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,791
- How do you do?
- Thank you for seeing me.

1387
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:56,916
I'm not sure it's very wise.
For either of us.

1388
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:00,375
Take a seat. Close the door, Legat.

1389
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,208
Ah, ah.

1390
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,208
You better come and join us, Legat.
Come on.

1391
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,250
So, get on with it.

1392
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:22,666
That document is proof
that Hitler is lying

1393
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,875
when he claims to have
no further territorial demands.

1394
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:30,083
On the contrary,
he wants to expand the country,

1395
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,125
and he will keep on expanding.

1396
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:35,958
Therefore, I beg you
not to sign the agreement tonight.

1397
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:37,250
[laughing] What?

1398
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,250
Prime Minister.

1399
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:43,625
Adolf Hitler is a monster.

1400
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:46,333
He is a madman.

1401
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:50,250
You cannot give him what he wants.
He'll take more and more land.

1402
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,416
More and more people will suffer.

1403
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:54,375
That is the proof.

1404
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,833
I applaud your courage, young man.

1405
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,958
But I have to give you
a lesson in political reality.

1406
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:20,000
The people of Great Britain will never
take up arms over a local border dispute.

1407
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:24,333
- It's so much more than a local border...
- As for what Hitler may do

1408
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:27,291
or may not do in the future,
well, we shall have to wait and see.

1409
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:30,375
- Wait and see is not...
- My sole objective here

1410
01:26:30,458 --> 01:26:33,291
is to avert war in the immediate term,

1411
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:36,500
so I can begin to build a lasting peace.

1412
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:40,083
- There will be no lasting peace.
- But I have to try!

1413
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:44,833
Look, the worst thing I could do
is to walk away from this conference.

1414
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:50,041
If you do, there are people waiting,
high up in the military,

1415
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:53,291
a resistance, to bring him down.

1416
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,875
- Well, why haven't they done so already?
- They will if...

1417
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,958
I can't rely on some resistance

1418
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:02,666
you may believe exists in the German army.

1419
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,000
I mean… [laughs]

1420
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:08,416
Well, I…

1421
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:10,875
Think you should…

1422
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:15,250
Take this back to wherever it came from.

1423
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:20,666
No.

1424
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:24,791
Keep it. Study it.

1425
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,833
That is the political reality.

1426
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:29,083
Now you're being impertinent.

1427
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:33,250
And you are shaking hands with a man
who hates everything you stand for!

1428
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,041
He is lying to you.
He will go further and further.

1429
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,083
He will not stop, sir. He will never sto...

1430
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,708
Thank you for your time.

1431
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,000
Please don't sign the agreement.

1432
01:27:58,666 --> 01:27:59,875
Get rid of this.

1433
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,041
I have to say, Legat,

1434
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:12,250
I'm extremely disappointed in you.

1435
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:23,583
[door closes]

1436
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,291
[sighs]

1437
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:08,625
<i>Oui, bien sûr.</i>

1438
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,250
[in French] Mr. President
of the Council.

1439
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:12,000
- Yes?
- Thank you for your cooperation.

1440
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,250
I think we have come
to a very good agreement.

1441
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:15,750
<i>Merci beaucoup. Monsieur.</i>

1442
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:18,333
- [in English] Prime Minister.
- [Chamberlain] Ah. Nice to see you.

1443
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:21,333
Oh, Monsieur Daladier.
Did you get some dinner?

1444
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,250
[in German] There they are.

1445
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,000
…the Czechs aren't here,
given the circumstances.

1446
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:37,208
Um… Oh, there's Monsieur Daladier.
I want to...

1447
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,458
[in French] Mr. Daladier,
how was your dinner?

1448
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:46,000
- [in English] Sorry, we we both speaking.
- [Chamberlain] Um, um… <i>un sandwich?</i>

1449
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,791
<i>- Oh, c'est nécessaire.</i>
- [Daladier] <i>Monsieur.</i>

1450
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:49,750
<i>- À tout à I'heure.</i>
- [man] It is very exciting…

1451
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:51,958
[man] <i>On va trouver quelque chose? Du vin?</i>

1452
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:53,541
[Chamberlain] <i>Du vin? Une bonne idée!</i>

1453
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:54,625
[Franz] Psst, psst!

1454
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,750
[in German] Are you looking for someone?

1455
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,833
Yes, thank you.
About the arrangements for the press?

1456
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,541
Who's responsible for that?

1457
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:08,291
Enjoy the rest of your stay
in Munich, Mr. Legat.

1458
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,958
[in English] Oh bloody hell.

1459
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:13,666
[in German] What did you want from him?

1460
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,166
Can a British photographer
be at the signing?

1461
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,375
No chance.

1462
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:20,708
Only the Führer's personal photographer
has permission to take pictures.

1463
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,125
[in English] I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you tonight.

1464
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,333
I'm the one who should apologise.

1465
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,375
What have you done with the document?

1466
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:33,125
I will take it to London,
find a more responsive audience.

1467
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,000
It won't be a waste.

1468
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:38,083
- [man, in German] Gentlemen!
- We should stop talking.

1469
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,166
<i>Unser wunderbarer Führer</i>

1470
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,125
<i>ist außerordentlich erfreut,</i>

1471
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:46,708
<i>Sie für diese festliche Unterzeichnung</i>

1472
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,541
<i>wieder in der Bibliothek
begrüßen zu dürfen.</i>

1473
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,041
[Schmidt, in English]
The Führer is pleased

1474
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:55,583
to invite you back to the library
for the signing ceremony.

1475
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,500
- Prime Minister.
- [Chamberlain] Good.

1476
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:02,000
Duce, Monsieur Président du Conseil,
Excellencies, gentlemen.

1477
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:04,791
Please, this way.

1478
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:08,125
[applause]

1479
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,208
[knocking at door]

1480
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:20,125
[sighs]

1481
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:23,583
[knocking]

1482
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:25,625
Who's there?

1483
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,375
[Paul] Open the door.

1484
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:37,083
I want to show you something.

1485
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:38,500
Now?

1486
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,833
It's the only time we have.

1487
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:42,666
Give me two minutes.

1488
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:47,250
[engine idling]

1489
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:58,583
[brakes squeal]

1490
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,375
[men laughing and speaking German]

1491
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,583
[gentle snoring]

1492
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,666
[Paul] You can talk to her.

1493
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,208
She won't respond, but maybe she can hear.

1494
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,083
[patients snoring and grunting]

1495
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:19,541
Lena?

1496
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:21,500
[Lena whimpers]

1497
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:23,833
[in German] It's me, Hugh.

1498
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:33,125
[Lena breathing]

1499
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,500
[patients snoring]

1500
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:45,791
[in English] What happened?

1501
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:48,666
We split up.

1502
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:51,791
After your trip to Munich.

1503
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:54,166
[sighs]

1504
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:05,625
How did she end up here?

1505
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,333
She was arrested at a protest in '35

1506
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:13,625
and sent to Moringen, the women's camp.

1507
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:17,208
When they discovered she was Jewish…

1508
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,583
They were rough.

1509
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,208
[scoffs]

1510
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:38,416
They said she fell out of a window.

1511
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,416
I'm sure she did.

1512
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:47,041
But not before
they carved a Star of David onto her back.

1513
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,291
I knew he was racist.

1514
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:57,625
All the awful Jewish stuff,
I thought it could be put to one side.

1515
01:35:57,708 --> 01:35:58,541
How?

1516
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:00,791
But you can't put it aside.

1517
01:36:08,291 --> 01:36:12,416
If they are capable of that,
they are capable of anything.

1518
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:17,041
Lena knew that.

1519
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,000
Yes, she did.

1520
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:33,208
May I?

1521
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,708
Shall we share?

1522
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,208
[Paul coughs]

1523
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,458
What will you do?

1524
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,041
Carry on.

1525
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,375
In a few hours, I have to present
a press summary to Hitler.

1526
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,791
I'm told he's taken a shine to me.

1527
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,708
[laughs]

1528
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:26,166
Maybe it's a chance
to really do something.

1529
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:27,875
What do you…

1530
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:33,583
- How?
- It would solve everything.

1531
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:37,333
They'd kill you
for even thinking about it.

1532
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,333
I have a pistol.

1533
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:43,125
I might get a moment alone with him.

1534
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:44,166
Stop it!

1535
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,166
Don't be stupid.

1536
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:50,041
I'll take the document to London.
It will make a difference.

1537
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:52,041
Probably more talking, yes.

1538
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:54,041
- Yes, more talking.
- I have to fight.

1539
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:55,333
You don't have to fight!

1540
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,458
We don't choose the times we live in.

1541
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:01,041
The only choice we have is how we respond.

1542
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,666
- You don't have to fight, Paul! We don't.
- I have to fight.

1543
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,083
- We need to talk! We need to...
- I… have to fight!

1544
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:09,625
- No, you don't! No!
- No! It's my responsibility! Understand?

1545
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:12,250
- Your responsibility?
- Or I may as well blow my brains out.

1546
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:14,666
There are other ways of doing things!
Talk, discussion...

1547
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:17,250
- There's no other things, no.
- There's always hope!

1548
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:21,250
[sighs] Hoping is waiting
for someone else to do it.

1549
01:38:21,333 --> 01:38:23,833
We'd all be much better off without it.

1550
01:38:24,416 --> 01:38:25,458
[both sigh]

1551
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:36,583
[birdsong]

1552
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:38,666
[women laughing and speaking German]

1553
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,541
I'd miss you.

1554
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:51,625
Goodbye.

1555
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,208
Goodbye.

1556
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:50,916
REGINA PALACE HOTEL

1557
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

1558
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,416
Bit early for a walk.

1559
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,416
Yes.

1560
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:11,250
I... I couldn't sleep.
I had to clear my head.

1561
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:14,583
Are you all right?

1562
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:22,833
- Why are you standing out here?
- I'm looking for you.

1563
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:24,958
The PM's awake, and he wants to see you.

1564
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,000
[taps on door]

1565
01:40:29,083 --> 01:40:32,041
- I heard you were looking for me, sir.
- Ah! Legat. Good morning.

1566
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:35,583
Don't suppose
you brought that copy of <i>The Times</i> with…

1567
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,750
With Hitler's speech in it, did you?

1568
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:39,708
Yes, sir. I put it in your box, sir.

1569
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:41,750
Oh, good man. Can you find it for me?

1570
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,125
Had a word with him last night.

1571
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:48,875
Asked if I might see him again
this morning before we fly back.

1572
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,875
- [Hugh] Asked who, sir?
- Herr Hitler.

1573
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:54,208
Did... did he agree?

1574
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:56,166
[chuckles] Couldn't really refuse.

1575
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:04,000
Must say, that was a remarkably rude young
man you brought to see me last night.

1576
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:09,500
- I really am sorry about that, sir.
- Ah, thank you.

1577
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,833
- Have you told anyone about it?
- No.

1578
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:15,875
Good. Neither have I.

1579
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,041
His arguments were naive,

1580
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:24,166
but… they were not ineffective.

1581
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,250
Now, here we are.

1582
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:28,916
Listen, I'd like you
to take this to Wilson.

1583
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:33,583
Ask him to turn it
into a short statement of intent.

1584
01:41:33,666 --> 01:41:35,416
Just from there to there.

1585
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,916
Sir, I don't follow.

1586
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,958
Well, on Monday night,
Hitler publicly declared his desire

1587
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:44,583
for a permanent peace
between Germany and Great Britain.

1588
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:47,916
- Yes.
- Well, I'd like his undertaking redrafted.

1589
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:51,333
- In the form of a joint statement.
- A joint statement?

1590
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:54,708
To which both he and I
can put our names this morning.

1591
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:57,375
Oh, get on with it. Go on. Get it done.

1592
01:41:57,458 --> 01:42:00,125
And get yourself a coffee.
You're half awake.

1593
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:03,541
"We regard the agreement signed last night

1594
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:07,416
as symbolic of the desire
of our two peoples

1595
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,416
never to go to war
with one another again."

1596
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,541
I hope the PM realises
this has no legal force whatsoever.

1597
01:42:13,625 --> 01:42:16,208
- The man's not a fool.
- What the hell's he playing at?

1598
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:18,958
I've no idea.
First I heard of it was half an hour ago.

1599
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:22,541
- Do you have it?
- [Wilson] Yes.

1600
01:42:22,625 --> 01:42:24,208
- Good.
- It may be a little long.

1601
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:26,458
Hmm.

1602
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:28,291
[mumbles]

1603
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:30,833
- What if he refuses to sign it?
- [Chamberlain] Why should he?

1604
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,500
These are all statements
he's made already.

1605
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,750
[Wilson] It doesn't mean
he's going to stick with them.

1606
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:38,625
It's symbolic, Horace.

1607
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:44,666
Last night's agreement
only settles a tiny dispute.

1608
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,375
There will be others.

1609
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:51,333
And I want him
to publicly commit himself to peace.

1610
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,958
Oh, Legat, make sure
there's a car available at 11:00.

1611
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,375
To the Führerbau?

1612
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:59,333
No. Ah, you've put my name before his.
It should be the other way around.

1613
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:00,500
Otherwise, good.

1614
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:02,791
Yes, I wanted to have
a private meeting with him.

1615
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,750
Man to man, no officials.

1616
01:43:05,333 --> 01:43:07,625
- He invited me to his apartment.
- What?

1617
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:09,291
- No officials?
- Not even you, Horace.

1618
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:12,500
Oh, for God's sake. You can't go
and see Hitler entirely on your own.

1619
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:14,750
Can and will.

1620
01:43:15,625 --> 01:43:19,125
Gentlemen, we must rise
to the level of events.

1621
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,250
[sighs]

1622
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,166
What? Hey!

1623
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,708
[in German] What are you doing here?

1624
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:57,625
I mean, what the hell
are you doing here in Munich?

1625
01:43:57,708 --> 01:44:00,208
What are you doing here in Munich?
What's going on here?

1626
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:04,125
What is going on here? Talk to me!

1627
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:05,500
I don't know...

1628
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,791
Now, let's talk. Come on. Talk to me!

1629
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:25,875
- [Hugh yells]
- [Franz gasps]

1630
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:34,666
[groans]

1631
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,583
[sighs]

1632
01:44:37,416 --> 01:44:38,833
[panting]

1633
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:45,875
I would suggest you go back
where you came from.

1634
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:47,791
Legat. [spits]

1635
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:49,416
[gasping]

1636
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:12,375
[groans]

1637
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:13,958
[panting]

1638
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:17,208
Paul.

1639
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,250
[coughs]

1640
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,125
[Chamberlain] It was a specific point.

1641
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,625
A bit of an embarrassment.
Well, why was there…

1642
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:37,458
[Wilson] With respect to... There just is.
I can't explain it any more.

1643
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:38,875
- Prime Minister?
- Yes?

1644
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,666
- I should accompany you to the meeting.
- No.

1645
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:45,000
I thought I had made this perfectly clear.
No officials.

1646
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:47,416
Not as an official, sir. As a translator.

1647
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,750
No, I want him to feel
this is a personal meeting.

1648
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:52,625
You need someone there to make sure
your words are accurately reported.

1649
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:54,583
- I...
- Remember what happened at Berchtesgaden

1650
01:45:54,666 --> 01:45:56,458
- when he refused to give us a copy…
- No, that...

1651
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,250
You can't trust Schmidt to have your back.

1652
01:45:58,333 --> 01:46:00,166
I think a translator could be useful.

1653
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,833
- I'm the only one who speaks German.
- All right, all right, all right!

1654
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:06,708
[sighs]

1655
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:09,291
You can come, but be discreet.

1656
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:12,333
Keep out of his eyeline. And mine.

1657
01:46:16,666 --> 01:46:18,583
- [reporters clamouring]
<i>- Mr. Chamberlain!</i>

1658
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:22,000
- Mr. Chamberlain!
- Mr. Chamberlain!

1659
01:46:52,041 --> 01:46:53,541
[knock at door]

1660
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,541
[man] Good morning, Prime Minister.

1661
01:46:57,625 --> 01:46:58,875
- This way, sir.
- Morning.

1662
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:03,916
[clears throat]

1663
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:08,791
- [officer] Your wardrobe.
- [whispers] They have the document.

1664
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:18,041
- [Schmidt] Good morning.
- [Chamberlain] Good morning.

1665
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:20,416
- [Schmidt] Did you sleep well?
- [Chamberlain] Very well.

1666
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,208
[Schmidt] I'm pleased to hear that, sir.

1667
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:26,666
[knocking]

1668
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,666
[scribbling]

1669
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:37,458
[Chamberlain] <i>We, the German Führer</i>
<i>and British Prime Minister,</i>

1670
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:41,916
<i>are agreed in respect of the future

1671
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,958
<i>We regard the agreement signed last night</i>

1672
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:51,000
<i>as symbolic of the desire

<i>never to go to war with one another again.</i>

1674
01:47:55,458 --> 01:48:00,833
<i>We are determined to continue
to remove possible sources of difference</i>

1675
01:48:01,416 --> 01:48:04,375
<i>and to contribute to the peace of Europe.</i>

1676
01:48:05,833 --> 01:48:07,500
[Hitler] <i>Herr Premierminister?</i>

1677
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:12,291
<i>Ich möchte Ihnen ganz ausdrücklich danken.</i>

1678
01:48:13,125 --> 01:48:15,958
[in English] Prime Minister,
I would like to thank you explicitly.

1679
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:19,583
<i>Dr. Schmidt wird Sie zurück
ins Hotel begleiten.</i>

1680
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:22,333
[Schmidt, in English]
I will accompany you back to your hotel.

1681
01:48:22,416 --> 01:48:24,125
Thank you, Herr Hitler.

1682
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,750
And may I add

1683
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:30,375
that there was never a doubt
in my mind, sir,

1684
01:48:30,458 --> 01:48:33,916
as to the lengths to which you would go
to protect Germany.

1685
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,583
<i>Ich möchte dem hinzufügen,
ich habe nie daran gezweifelt,</i>

1686
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:40,583
<i>zu was Sie alles bereit wären,
um Deutschland zu schützen.</i>

1687
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:54,083
[officer, in German]
The foreign press summary!

1688
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:02,875
[in English] Thank you. Come along, Legat.

1689
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:28,000
[teacup clinking]

1690
01:49:51,416 --> 01:49:52,416
[knocking at door]

1691
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:57,375
[man, in German]
The Reichsführer is arriving.

1692
01:50:00,291 --> 01:50:01,958
Please excuse me, my Führer.

1693
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:17,166
[Hitler] "The cheers for Hitler
were mechanical and polite."

1694
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:20,708
"For Chamberlain, they were ecstatic."

1695
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,125
[chuckles]

1696
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:29,625
You, as an educated German,
what do you think? Are they right?

1697
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:34,875
I do not wish to be followed mechanically!

1698
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:38,458
I gave Germany back its dignity.

1699
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:41,208
Is it too much
to ask for a little gratitude?

1700
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:44,500
"Mechanical."

1701
01:50:45,416 --> 01:50:48,166
They're grateful
to this arsehole Chamberlain!

1702
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:56,666
Am I the only one who realises
that we have a historic task ahead of us?

1703
01:50:57,708 --> 01:51:01,500
That this is the moment
for Germany to fulfil its destiny?

1704
01:51:08,791 --> 01:51:10,833
Speak. I want you to answer me.

1705
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:13,291
Why aren't they grateful?

1706
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:18,166
The people don't want a war.
They're afraid.

1707
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,041
The people don't know what they want.

1708
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:22,125
They're children.

1709
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:26,083
But you're right. They are afraid.

1710
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:27,916
I am surrounded by cowardice.

1711
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:29,875
Yes, my Führer.

1712
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:47,416
I told you, I can read people.

1713
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:52,041
You say yes,

1714
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,375
but your eyes…

1715
01:51:57,625 --> 01:51:58,666
Are saying no.

1716
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:05,583
It's just you and I here.

1717
01:52:05,666 --> 01:52:06,750
So…

1718
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:10,041
What are you thinking, von Hartmann?

1719
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,625
What do you…

1720
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:18,041
Want to say to me?

1721
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:23,750
Nothing.

1722
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:28,125
[knock at door]

1723
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,791
Heil, my Führer.

1724
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:35,833
I'm told you've signed another agreement
with Chamberlain?

1725
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:39,541
Don't take that so seriously.
That piece of paper is of no significance.

1726
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:43,916
The problem lies here,
with the German people.

1727
01:52:46,583 --> 01:52:47,416
Anything else?

1728
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
[clicks heels]

1729
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,333
Thank you.

1730
01:52:58,875 --> 01:52:59,833
For…

1731
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:01,750
This.

1732
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:11,208
[shuddering]

1733
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:34,250
Thank you.

1734
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:43,708
[in English] I hope you don't mind. They
asked me to share a ride to the airport.

1735
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:50,250
I'm glad to have a moment alone with you.

1736
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:52,833
I haven't been
altogether straight with you.

1737
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:55,125
No?

1738
01:53:55,208 --> 01:53:58,625
No. I'm actually something
of a guardian angel.

1739
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:03,250
What on earth are you talking about?

1740
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:05,375
In London, you asked my surname.

1741
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,416
<i>It's Menzies.</i>

1742
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:11,041
<i>I think you know my uncle.
He's a colonel in the Foreign Office.</i>

1743
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:14,208
<i>Well, he asked me
to keep an eye on you out here.</i>

1744
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:16,375
<i>Thank goodness I did.</i>

1745
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:26,166
I took it from your room last night
when you went off with your friend.

1746
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:29,041
I think other parties
were trying to find it this morning?

1747
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,458
[in German] I assume
you're waiting for me?

1748
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:40,583
No, actually.

1749
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:42,708
No?

1750
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:47,166
Not today, Paulie.
Not today, but soon. Very soon.

1751
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,208
Well, then.

1752
01:54:51,333 --> 01:54:52,666
- My regards...
- Get out.

1753
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,583
[in English] Thank you.

1754
01:54:58,416 --> 01:54:59,708
Thank you, thank you.

1755
01:55:00,875 --> 01:55:03,083
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1756
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:04,416
- Thank...
- Enough!

1757
01:55:06,375 --> 01:55:07,541
Smoke?

1758
01:55:09,458 --> 01:55:10,291
Yes.

1759
01:55:28,666 --> 01:55:29,583
[Wilson] Sir.

1760
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:32,875
Sir, we'll be on the ground
in half an hour.

1761
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:35,416
My God, I… fell asleep. Ooh.

1762
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,208
Apparently, there's quite a crowd.

1763
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:41,541
The King has asked you
to go direct to Buckingham Palace

1764
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:44,416
so their Majesties
can thank you in person.

1765
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,416
Oh, God.

1766
01:55:48,708 --> 01:55:50,541
I shall have to speak to the cameras.

1767
01:55:51,708 --> 01:55:55,125
The world doesn't yet know
about our joint statement.

1768
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,583
Prime Minister, I urge you

1769
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,833
to treat the undertaking given by Hitler

1770
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:01,750
with the utmost caution.

1771
01:56:01,833 --> 01:56:03,291
- Ah…
- The agreement on the Sudetenland

1772
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:06,750
- is one thing, but this other document...
- Yes, I know. Horace, look.

1773
01:56:06,833 --> 01:56:11,208
If there's one thing I've learned
from my dealings with Mr. Hitler,

1774
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:14,541
it's that you can't play poker
with a gangster

1775
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:16,125
without any cards up your sleeve.

1776
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:18,625
What if he breaks his word?
You'll look like a fool.

1777
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:22,083
Well, if he breaks his word, the world
will see him for who he truly is!

1778
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:26,125
And it'll unite the Allies.
Might even bring the Americans on board.

1779
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:29,291
And if I'm made to look a fool,
well, it's a small price to pay.

1780
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:31,041
[Wilson sighs]

1781
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:38,250
Horace, I can only play the game
with the cards I've been dealt.

1782
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:40,333
[sighs]

1783
01:56:40,416 --> 01:56:44,208
What do you think, Legat?
Do you think this will change the game?

1784
01:56:50,333 --> 01:56:52,375
I think there's a chance, Prime Minister.

1785
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:54,375
So do I.

1786
01:57:10,666 --> 01:57:12,666
[cheering and applause]

1787
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:19,875
[man] Whoo!

1788
01:57:22,583 --> 01:57:24,583
[Chamberlain] Thank you so much.
How are you?

1789
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:26,458
[Wilson] Look at that, Legat.

1790
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:30,041
You'd think we won a war
rather than avoided one.

1791
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:34,125
There are thousands of people
gathering on the Mall.

1792
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:35,833
Welcome back, sir. Congratulations.

1793
01:57:35,916 --> 01:57:38,208
[Wilson] The King intends
to take him out onto the balcony.

1794
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:41,250
The settlement
of the Czechoslovakian problem,

1795
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:43,958
which has been achieved…

1796
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:45,541
[cheering]

1797
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:49,000
…uh, is in my mind

1798
01:57:50,333 --> 01:57:54,875
merely a prelude to a larger settlement,

1799
01:57:55,833 --> 01:57:59,208
which, for all Europe,

1800
01:57:59,750 --> 01:58:02,375
may bring peace.

1801
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:04,458
[cheering and applause]

1802
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:13,541
For this morning…

1803
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:19,000
This morning I had another talk…

1804
01:58:19,083 --> 01:58:20,541
[thunder rumbling]

1805
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:22,958
…with the German Chancellor Herr Hitler.

1806
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:25,208
Here is the paper

1807
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,916
which bears his name upon it
as well as mine.

1808
01:58:30,416 --> 01:58:31,666
- Hello.
- [sighs]

1809
01:58:35,125 --> 01:58:36,958
[Pamela sighs]

1810
01:58:43,166 --> 01:58:44,916
- Hello.
- Hello.

1811
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,708
Where's Arthur?

1812
01:58:49,791 --> 01:58:52,375
[sniffles] He's in the garden.
He'll be happy to see you.

1813
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54,166
[birdsong]

1814
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:56,000
I'm sorry for the way I left.

1815
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:57,041
And, uh…

1816
01:58:58,333 --> 01:58:59,583
I wanted to say…

1817
01:59:01,791 --> 01:59:02,791
You were right.

1818
01:59:04,458 --> 01:59:05,958
I have felt disappointed.

1819
01:59:06,916 --> 01:59:08,750
And it's my fault, not yours.

1820
01:59:09,541 --> 01:59:12,041
But there are some things
I want to change.

1821
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:13,750
[clock ticking]

1822
01:59:15,375 --> 01:59:17,208
I think I might resign from the service.

1823
01:59:18,416 --> 01:59:19,250
And do what?

1824
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:22,916
When war comes, I need to be…

1825
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:25,000
Useful.

1826
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:28,000
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

1827
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:30,541
Don't laugh,
but I think I might join the RAF.

1828
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:31,541
[chuckles]

1829
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:35,041
What about the treaty?
I thought he just said that...

1830
01:59:35,125 --> 01:59:38,958
Just a delay. The PM's given us a chance
of winning the damn thing when it happens.

1831
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:42,000
It's quite some service
when you think about it.

1832
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,166
But it's coming.

1833
01:59:46,375 --> 01:59:47,458
Sooner or later.

1834
01:59:48,625 --> 01:59:51,875
One day soon, we will have to fight.
And we will have to win.

1835
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:54,083
There must be something else
that you can do.

1836
01:59:54,166 --> 01:59:55,000
It's the...

1837
01:59:55,083 --> 01:59:57,250
- More talks, negotiations...
- There's no other way.

1838
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:00,916
Don't say that.

1839
02:00:04,041 --> 02:00:05,125
There's always hope.

1840
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:07,666
Yes.

1841
02:00:09,916 --> 02:00:12,208
And we'd all be
much better off without it.

1842
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:15,916
- [running]
- [Arthur] Daddy!

1843
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,916
[Pamela laughs]

1844
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,458
[Arthur giggles]

1845
02:00:19,541 --> 02:00:21,375
Here. Come here. Up a squeak.

1846
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:23,416
[sighs]

1847
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:24,833
Oh, I've missed you.

1848
02:00:28,375 --> 02:00:30,291
[in German] I could have shot Hitler.

1849
02:00:34,166 --> 02:00:35,541
[sniffles]

1850
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:37,791
I was so close to him,
I could smell his breath.

1851
02:00:42,541 --> 02:00:44,583
I could feel the gun in my hand.

1852
02:00:51,208 --> 02:00:52,583
[sobs]

1853
02:00:54,708 --> 02:00:56,666
But my hand wouldn't move.

1854
02:00:58,208 --> 02:00:59,333
Do you know why?

1855
02:01:03,875 --> 02:01:05,041
[sighs]

1856
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,541
What would give me the right?

1857
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,416
Do you want to keep going?

1858
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:25,250
What other choice do we have?

1859
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:27,708
They'll hang you for that one day.

1860
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:33,625
I know.
