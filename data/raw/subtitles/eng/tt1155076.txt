00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,669
Dre, you're killing me.

24
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:18,550
Mom, look, in China everything is
old. There's old houses, old parks...

25
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:24,305
old people...Look, this guy is
at least four-hundred years old.

26
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,727
Dre, please focus. Okay?

27
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,106
What's your name?

28
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,108
You need to practice.
Yeah, you need to try.

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,984

- Ask him. Go ahead.
- No, mom.

32
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:50,206
Ask him "what's your name"
and "how are you". Do it, now.

33
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,511
Dude, I'm from Detroit.

34
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,478
What's up?

35
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,468
It's said to meet her at number five.

36
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,722
Mrs. Packer?

37
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:38,231
- Hi. It's Parker.
- Oh, apologies, Mrs. Parker. Welcome to Beijing.

38
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:04,341
Look! There is Omatek
village. Isn't it beautiful?

39
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:11,473
Yes. I guess there's nothing
old in China, huh Dre?

40
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,493
Look at that, Dre. Beverly Hills.

41
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,120
We've always talked
about living there, huh?

42
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,916
I think we have talked
about the other one, mom.

43
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:43,171
I got a good feeling about this.

44
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,802
Oh, yeah. You must be the
new dude in 305. I'm Harry.

45
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,596
- Hey, what's up? I'm Dre.

46
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,849
Thanks, man.

47
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,770
- Welcome to the building, Dre.
- Thanks.

48
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:08,405
Can you please explain this electricity card,
because we-we don't have these in America.

49
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:13,034
- Know any Chinese?
- Nah.

50
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,540
This is China. Might not be a bad idea.

51
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,459
Oh, that's our park. You should come.

52
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,672
Look at you. Making friends already.

53
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,882
- Hi, I'm Dre's mother.
- Nice to meet you.

54
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,093
Nice to meet you too. You
can call me Miss Sherry.

55
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,138
- I'm Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

56
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,515
- So, I guess, I'll see you later, then?
- Maybe.

57
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,561
Okay, cool. See you.

58
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,904
Ok, this is your rental
agreement in English.

59
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:55,118
So the landlady is Mrs. Wong.
Her English is not good.

60
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,787
But if something goes
wrong, you go to Mr. Han.

61
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,873
- His English is very good.
- Okay.

62
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,835
Okay. So, welcome to Beijing, Mrs.
Parker. Um, so I see you tomorrow, okay?

63
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,756
Okay, sure! Thank you. Oh, wait, wait!

/Um, you mentioned
/something about going...

65
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,399
Oh, this is perfect, Dre. Everything
we need is in walking distance.

66
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,401
Oh, you know what, we
can have lunch together

67
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,403
every day at your
school, if you wanted to.

68
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,741
Negative! Not a chance.

69
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:41,998
Dre, we are not doing this in Beijing.

70
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,542
Dre, pick up your jacket!

71
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:50,799
Mom, I'm tired, okay?
I have airplane lag.

72
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,845
Airplane...

73
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,641
It's jet lag.

74
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:04,270
I know baby, I got it too.

75
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:15,740
But, we can't go to sleep. Cause then we'll
be up at 2 A.M. You have school tomorrow.

76
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,542
/Dre, can you please go
/find the maintenance man?!

77
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,211
/I need to take a shower,
/and the hot water is broken!

78
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,588
Yes.

79
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,299
Excuse me.

80
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:38,638
Um, the maintenance man? Mr. Han?

81
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,892
Thanks.

82
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,615

83
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:05,415
Me and my mom, we just moved in.

84
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,251
Mr. Han?

85
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:18,219
Okay. Alright I just

86
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:27,062
Or you can just show me how to do
it so, I can get out of your hair.

87
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:49,751
Um, I can always come
back if this is bad time.

88
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,086
- Hey man, you made it. Welcome.
- Thanks.

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:36,441
You want me to play? You know I

97
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,444
Back where I come from they call
me "Ping Pong Dre", alright?

98
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:44,783
I'm going to take it easy on you.

99
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,813
Come on, man. I'm twelve.

100
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,157
He is really good. I've never
seen him lose to anybody.

101
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,702
Yeah.

102
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,374
- Dude. You're gonna talk to her or what?
- To who?

103
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,586
- To her. The girl you've been staring at.
- I wasn't staring at her, dude.

104
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,132
Yeah, you were.

105
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,178
- You should go talk to her, unless you're scared?
- I'm not scared of anything.

106
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,599
Then do it. Go. Come on.

107
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,769
Right now.

00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,171
What language was that?

111
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,216
You speak English? Me too.

112
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,512
- So, what are you listening to?
- Bach.

113
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:39,647
Bach, I listen to them all the time. They
are tight. Have you ever heard of this?

114
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:47,072
Oh yeah, you like it huh, right?!

115
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,711
Great move, one over here.

116
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:08,635
- Wait, wait it's coming back.
- May I touch your hair?

117
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,264
You want to touch my hair?

118
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,810
Um...Sure.

You shoud be practicing.

120
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,574
I'm practicing.

121
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,035
- What you're doing, you won't be needing these.
- What's your problem?

122
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,996
Leave it.

123
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,548
Come on, dude.

124
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,178
I said, leave it.

125
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:16,453
You want to fight?

126
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,431
- Are you okay?
- Leave me alone.

127
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,392
I'm fine.

128
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,024
- Dre, dude...
- Leave me alone.

129
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,607
Dre, are you ready? Cause we got
to be there in like 20 minutes.

130
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,818
I know, mom.

131
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,404
- And you have your uniform on, right?
- Yes, mom.

132
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,574
Don't break any rules on the first day.

133
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:42,122
Okay, come on, I'm waiting for you.

134
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,297
Wait, you don't have to comin',
I mean... I can handle it.

135
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,550
Dre, don't be silly,
it's your first day.

136
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,761
Plus, we both have to meet the
assist principal Mrs. Pong.

137
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,098
I can find her. You need
to get to work, right?!

138
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,477
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, mom.

139
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,522
Mrs. Pong. Hi, Mrs. Pong.

140
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,859
- Mrs. Parker, we've been waiting.
- I'm so sorry we are late...

141
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,736
We just flew from Detroit last night...

142
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,947
- And this is my son Dre.
- Hello.

143
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,702
- We only wear uniforms on Uniform day.
- Oh, that's my fault.

144
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:26,041
I didn't have a chance to read the school
packages sent to me. Will be better tomorrow.

145
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:32,380
- And hats are not permitted.
- Yeah, I should've read up on the dress code.

146
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:37,344
- Dre, is that make-up? What is that?
- Mom, I ran into a pole.

147
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:42,349
- No, you have a black eye. You've got into a fight?
- Fighting is not tolerated here.

148
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,852
You heard him, he ran into
a pole. Come here, Dre.

149
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,812
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?

150
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,940
Nobody mom, I ran into a pole. I ain't tell
you cause I know you would react like this.

151
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,943
Dre, you know I don't play, if
somebody hit my baby, I would tear...

152
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,946
I know mom, that's why
I don't tell you stuff.

153
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:04,454
- Just relax, I just ran into a...
- Yeah, yeah, you ran into a pole.

154
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:10,377
Alright Dre, alright, alright. Look, go to class,

You know, we only wear
uniforms on Uniform day.

00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:02,178
Oh yeah, I still got that one.

162
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,142
Thanks.

163
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,313

00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,787
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No.

167
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:33,001
- Our parents are very close.
- He definitely likes you.

168
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:37,756
- I have to go practice.
- Wait...

169
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,217
- You eat and practice at the same time?
- Yes.

170
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:46,264
But, my mom says if you eat
standing up, it gives you gas.

171
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,601
You're funny.

172
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:34,771
- Come to fix the hot water.
- It's in there.

173
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:00,547
Kid? Kid?!

174
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:21,151
Did you just hit me in my
neck with a toothpaste cap?!

175
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,737
Hot water fine. Flip switch.

176
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:28,241
Wait half hour, take
shower, flip switch off.

177
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,785
Why don't you just leave it on?

178
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:34,539
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.

179
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,960
Get switch, Save planet.

180
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:44,174
- What happened to your eye?
- I ran into a pole.

181
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,177
Interesting pole.

182
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,722
- Dre?! I'm back.
- That's my mom.

183
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,599
End it, do the handle, it's messed up.

184
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,604
/- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah.

185
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:07,030
- Hey, let me help you.
- They have your favorite cereal here, I found it.

186
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:15,372
Dre, for the one hundredth time,
can you please pick up your jacket?

187
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:19,668
- One second, mom.
- No! Not in one second, now!

188
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,086
This programme is about to be
over. Give me two minutes.

189
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,172
Dre, I don't care! Come
and pick it up now.

190
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,884
- God, how many times do I have to ask you?
- Once.

191
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,679
- That's right. Make it happen.
- "What's with you and the jacket?!"

192
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,389
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.

193
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,850
Okay, just what I thought... Nothing.

194
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,895
Thank you.

195
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,853
From the top again.

196
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:33,009
Okay. It's enough please. You are
rushing it. You must play the pauses.

197
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:38,932
Do you know how important this is for your
family? What it will mean for your life?

198
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:46,272
We have to work this weekend.
I'm calling you father.

199
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:50,527
We continue.

200
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,914
- How that sound?
- Almost like a Chinese.

201
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:08,003
Yeah, I'm fluent. And I don't know about that guy
was talking about? I thought you sounded great.

202
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,047
Thank you.

203
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:25,937
- So, you are practicing for anything? Like a show?
- Yes, I have an audition next month...

204
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:32,736
- For the Beijing Academy of Music.
- Beijing Academy of Music. Sounds important.

205
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:38,283
You know, their initials spell BAM.

206
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,206
What?

207
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,003
I gotta go.

208
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:15,570
Can I touch your hair?

209
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:24,287
You're gonna do something?

210
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,040
Just stay away from us.

211
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,085
All of us.

212
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,233
Baby?!

213
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,613
Dre, are you sleeping?

214
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,855
- Um, can you sign this?
- For the Forbidden City?!

215
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:36,985
I think it's funny that you have to give
my permission to go to the Forbidden City.

216
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,613
- Pole in Beijing.
- Not funny, mom.

217
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,824
Oh, cut it out, grumpy.

218
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm serious, Dre. This ice cream,
I don't know what they do it,

219
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,788
but it's more flavoristic. What?

220
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,085
Mom, this is you. "Oh my Godness, this ice cream
here is so good, and everything in China...

221
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,088
is so much better than everything
else..." Aw, mom c'mon...

222
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,552
First of all, I don't sound like
that, and I don't move all like that.

223
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,055
You should get some ice cream, sweetie.

224
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:09,142
- Mom, mom, c'mon.
- Dre! Wait!

225
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:14,773
Boy, you won't get running from me?!

226
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,443
Kung Fu.

227
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,363
What do we learn here?

228
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:08,493
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!

229
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,794
Begin!

230
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,847
- Mom, mom, c'mon, let's go. C'mon, mom!
- What? Dre, we just got here.

231
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:33,226
- Dre, what's going on?
- Nothing.

232
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,521
- Dre, what happened?
- Nothing happened.

233
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:40,900
What is it, you don't want to take that
class? Whatever Dre, What happened?

234
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:46,948
We moved to China! That's what happened!

235
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,006
Okay, stop.

236
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,178
Don't be like that, Dre.

237
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,014
What do you want me to do?

238
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:15,185
- We've been here less than a week...
- I feel like it's a year!

239
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,730
I hate it here.

240
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,529
Dre, please let me help you.

241
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:30,367
I can't help you if you don't tell
me what's wrong?! Oh, please.

242
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,494
You don't care what's wrong!

243
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:36,122
All you care about is how happy
I am and how great ice cream is.

244
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:41,169
I'm not happy. I hate it here!

245
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,056
I want to go home!

246
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:59,729
Dre, we can't go home. Okay? There
is nothing left for us in Detroit.

247
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:04,025
This is what we've got.

248
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,362
This is home.

249
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,973
/Gather on here.

250
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:38,768
/Welcome to one of the most
/popular landmarks in all over China.

251
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,980
/It is visited by millions
/of people every year.

252
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:46,026
/The Forbidden City.

253
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:27,942
You plaster on for good luck.

254
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,798
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.

255
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,385
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.

256
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,721
Thanks a lot.

257
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:09,067
/The walls of the palace were
/reinforced with the bricks, 15 layers deep,

258
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:14,489
/to prevent anyone from coming in.

259
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:22,205
- Mr. Parker... Is everything okay?
- Oh yes?

260
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:26,251
Um...Yes, thank you.

261
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,335
Get him.

262
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:39,259
Come on.

263
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:20,026
You're fast.

264
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:24,781
But not fast enough.

265
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,173
He's had enough.

266
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,633
Don't you remember what we learned?

267
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:47,595
No weakness. No pain.

268
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,557
No mercy!

269
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,057
Go home.

270
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:25,670
- What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?
- Shh!

271
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:02,374
I thought you are just
a maintenance man?

272
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:09,005
You've seen only with your
eyes, so you are easy to fool.

273
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,132
It doesn't hurt.

274
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:14,219
Chauva. Ancient Chinese healing.

275
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,808
How did you do that up there? You like even
didn't punch them. They...beat each other up.

276
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:22,268
When fighting angry, blind men...

277
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:27,607
best we just stay out of the way.

278
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:31,778
- So, where did you learn Kung Fu?
- From father.

279
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,489
Have you ever taught anybody?

280
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,825
No.

281
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,495
Would you?

282
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,206
- Depends.
- On what?

283
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:49,838
- Reason.
- What about to kick somebody's ass?

284
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:54,009
The best fights are the ones we avoid.

285
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,469
What if I wanna avoid
getting my ass kicked?

286
00:43:56,511 --> 00:44:01,391
- Stop saying "ass".
- Sorry.

287
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,188
Kung Fu is for knowledge, defense.

288
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,400
Not to make war, but to create peace.

289
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,111
That's not definitely
what they're taught.

290
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:17,323
No such thing as bad
student, only bad teacher.

291
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:23,288
That's great. I guess we'll just stroll in
their school and talk to their teacher.

292
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,582
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.

293
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:30,587
If I go in there, I get my ass kick...

294
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:37,135
- I'll get beat up.
- You got beat up anyway.

295
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,515
Would you go with me?

296
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:45,560
No, sorry.

297
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:49,689
- But you said it was a good idea.
- For you, bad idea for me.

298
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:54,277
C'mon, it's not like you should be busy
or anything...I don't even speak Chinese.

299
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,405
Very sorry.

300
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:05,330
Okay...Whatever.

301
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,765
Wait!

302
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:07,642
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

303
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,395
Finish!

304
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:19,946
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get out of here.

305
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,909
We do not stop when our enemy is down!

306
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:26,578
No mercy.

307
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,580
No mercy in the studio.

308
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,334
No mercy in life.

309
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,631
What are you looking at?

310
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:43,678
He's the one that attacked me.

311
00:46:54,564 --> 00:46:58,818
We are here to make peace.

312
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,280
Let your little thing mind himself.

313
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:09,204
One to one, no problem...Six to
one, too much to ask of anyone.

314
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:11,790
I see.

315
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:15,627
Prepare for match!

316
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:22,550
Whoa Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?

317
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:27,097
We are not here to fight.

318
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:34,062
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

319
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:38,817
You want to leave? Not so easy.

320
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,070
Master Li...

321
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,033
You both came here.

322
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:51,287
One of you fights now.

323
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:59,629
The boy will fight there.

324
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:06,344
OPEN KUNG FU TOURNAMENT

325
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:15,979
We accept your challenge.

326
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:23,319
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

327
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:26,364
Attention!

328
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:31,119
From now on the little
thing is to be left alone...

329
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:33,204
until the tournament.

330
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:37,334
- Understood?!
- Yes!

331
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:45,508
If he does not show up
for the competition...

332
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:50,847
I will bring pain to him and you.

333
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:04,444
So, that go pretty much
how you planned it?

334
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,363
There's good news and bad news.

335
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:09,699
The good news is they
promised to leave you alone.

336
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:13,828
- Really?
- While you prepare.

337
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,373
Prepare for what?

338
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:21,461
The tournament. You'll
fight them all, one by one.

339
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:23,922
Huh?

340
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:28,510
So the bad news is now they
get to beat me up in public.

341
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:31,930
- Yes.
- Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

342
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:35,058
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their Kung Fu.

343
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,853
That's not Kung Fu. That
does not represent China.

344
00:49:38,895 --> 00:49:45,985
That bad man teach them really
bad things that hurt, a lot.

345
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:52,617
More good news. I will
teach you real Kung Fu.

346
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:55,995
Yes.

347
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:09,509
- See you later, mom.
- Hey, wait. This is early for you for a Saturday.

348
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:12,637
- Mr. Han will teach me Kung Fu.
- The maintenance man?

349
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,098
It's China mom, everybody knows Kung Fu.

350
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,641
Dre, you know how do I
feel about your fighting.

351
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:20,186
Kung Fu is not fight mom, it's
about making peace with your enemy.

352
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:24,816
- Be careful, Dre.
- Yeah.

353
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,564
Mr. Han?

354
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,756
- Mr. Han?
- Back here.

355
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:37,639
You know you have a car in
your living room, Mr. Han?

356
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:42,102
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday. I know I
was kinda freaking out about the tournament...

357
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:44,646
but I realized something last night.

358
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:50,485
I'm an athlete. My number
one asset is I'm fast, okay?!

359
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:55,490
I'm quick. I'm quick.
Got the speed. Cat speed.

360
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,119
You see? I'm quick yeah, you see? In
the US, I used to take gymnastic at PAL,

361
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,248
that's Police Athletic
League, to check it, right?

362
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:07,210
Boom. You see that?

363
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:12,716
My Uncle Reymi used to date that
Brazilian girl and he learned Jiu-Jitsu.

364
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:15,844
And he taught some of it to me. As like,
locks and holds and stuff, it's okay.

365
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:18,888
Attack me.

366
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,438
You see that? Feel that? I can break it.

367
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:29,566
I'm choosing not to. To press
your luck. It's dangerous.

368
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:32,360
And he also taught me Capoeira so...

369
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:37,407
Can't touch me. Can't touch...

370
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:43,038
Was that antique?

371
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,083
Pick up your jacket.

372
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:51,504
So basically Mr. Han, what
I'm trying to say is...

373
00:52:51,546 --> 00:52:55,925
I got a good foundation here. You
know, like I said. I'm just...

374
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:59,095
Might not be as hard to teach
me as other people, you know.

375
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,973
- Hang it up.
- Okay.

376
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:06,811
- Happy now?
- Take it down.

377
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:13,568
- You just...
- Take it down.

378
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:18,114
Put it on.

379
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,496
Take it off.

380
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:26,706
- I already did all of this.
- Take it off.

381
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:28,166
Can you just tell me,
why I'm doing this?

382
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,419
Take it off.

383
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:36,341
Hang it up.

384
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:41,971
Take it down.

385
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:45,600
Put it on the ground.

386
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,728
Pick it up.

387
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:51,272
Hang up.

388
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:54,609
Take it down.

389
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:58,655
Put it on.

390
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:01,866
Take it off.

391
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:04,494
Put it on the ground.

392
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,247
Pick it up.

393
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:09,916
Hang it up.

394
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:14,337
Take it down. Put it on.

395
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,133
Take it off.

396
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:21,261
Hang it up.

397
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:34,524
Mr. Han, why do you have
a car in your living room?

398
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:38,361
No street parking.

399
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,786
Hey!

400
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,082
So how did it go? What you learned?

401
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,918
Nothing.

402
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:31,414
Uniform on Uniform day.

403
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:36,419
- You're fighting in the tournament?
- Yeah, how did you hear?

404
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:40,048
Everybody knows.

405
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:47,305
- I hope you have a good teacher.
- Yeah, me too.

406
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,933
He's a maintenance man.

407
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,936
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

408
00:55:52,977 --> 00:55:58,692
Well, I know you're practicing, and I think I'm
practicing, I mean, I don't know what I'm doing...

409
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:05,240
- But, we both kind of practicing, you know and...
- Are you going to that Shi-Shi festival?

410
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:13,581
Yeah, I mean, I've missed the Shi-Di
Festival since I've been in China.

411
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:20,422
- Go to the Shaolin theater.
- Okay. You want me to meet you?

412
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:28,471
Oh, oh, so like Shaolin theater, okay Shi-Fi-Shi
festival. Shaolin theater, okay. Cool.

413
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:31,641
- When is it again?
- Tomorrow. The show starts at seven.

414
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:36,980
Okay. So tomorrow, Shaolin theater.
Shi-Shi festival at seven.

415
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:39,983
- See you tomorrow.
- Shi-Shi festival.

416
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:46,740
- Festival. - Shi-Shi festival.
- Okay. - Okay.

417
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:08,011
Mr. Han?

418
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:14,434
- Mr. Han, can I come in?
- You may come in.

419
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:21,274
Where's your jacket?

420
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:25,153
- I thought, I was warmin' up without it.
- Go get it.

421
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,447
You want me to go all
way back, just to get it?

422
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:33,495
Yes, all the way back where you hide it.

423
00:57:56,601 --> 00:58:02,816
- This is not right.
- What? I'm doing it.

424
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,485
No.

425
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:12,033
- Something is missing.
- Nothing is missing.

426
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:20,041
You forgot, this.

427
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:24,087
Attitude.

428
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:27,424
Shake it off.

429
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:34,597
Attitude. Yes, that's it.

430
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:39,352
Okay, Mr. Han. I get it. I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have treated my mom like that.

431
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:42,689
You're right.

432
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:49,612
- Put it on the ground.
- Hello.

433
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:54,075
Ow, hey mom. Um, did
you get the tickets?

434
00:58:54,117 --> 00:59:00,206
Yes, I got the tickets, and I
got an extra one for Mr. Han.

435
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:04,044
- But I didn't say...
- Dre, stop it.

436
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:07,839
Mr. Han, would you like to go
with us to the Shi-Shi festival?

437
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:11,092
No, thank you. Too many people.

438
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:15,472
- Yeah, mom. Way too many people.
- Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.

439
00:59:15,513 --> 00:59:18,350
- I don't go...
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

440
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:21,269
You'll have fun. You need
to get out the house, okay?

441
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:28,902
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.

442
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,987
Dre...

443
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:35,033
Pick up your jacket!

444
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:50,090
You were right Mr. Han, there
are a lot of people here.

445
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:54,511
Chinese Valentine's Day.

446
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:10,944
Yeah, Mom. I'm going to go get something
to eat, then going to go to the bathroom.

447
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:15,115
Be back, right here, in 20 minutes.

448
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:18,368
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful. 20 minutes.

449
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,705
- 20.
- Okay.

450
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:16,760
I got this, and this for you.

451
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:21,556
I downloaded this. It has a very
cool violins stuff, and I...

452
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:25,685
I thought maybe you could play along
and... It's not like Bach and...

453
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:31,816
but, I thought maybe
you'd like it and...

454
01:01:54,673 --> 01:02:00,387
- So, um, do you have any kids?
- No.

455
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:04,766
Oh, how's Dre doing?

456
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:08,728
- Um, Shao Dre making a progress.
- Shao Dre?

457
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,857
Yes, Chinese pollito.

458
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:17,779
So, um, how many students do you have?

459
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:21,199
- Including Shao Dre?
- Yeah.

460
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,660
One.

461
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:34,129
So, what's the show about?

462
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,840
It's the story of the Goddess...

463
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,634
and a boy she loves.

464
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:43,471
I love this story.

465
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:48,435
Her mother does not approve of him.

466
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:55,817
So, she cuts a wide river in the
sky to separate them forever.

467
01:02:55,859 --> 01:03:00,947
But once a year, all
the birds in the sky...

468
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:07,162
felt sad for them, and
they form a bridge.

469
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:14,586
So the two of them may be
together for a single night.

470
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,805
I'll be there at you audition,
if you come to my tournament.

471
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:30,727
- Okay, I'll be there.
- Pinky swear.

472
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,688
See, you wrap your hands like this.

473
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:38,860
I swear that I'll be there at your
audition, no matter what happens.

474
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:46,910
And I promise to cheer bigger
than anyone else when you win.

475
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:25,615
What up, Mr. Han?

476
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:28,243
Did I say come in?

477
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:33,289
Um, I think you did. I mean...

478
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:41,798
- Mr. Han, can I please come in?
- Yes.

479
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:47,929
- So, what we are doing today?
- Same.

480
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:40,690
Mr. Han, I told you. I get it,
okay? Be respectful! I got it!

481
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:45,528
I put my jacket on a thousand times, and
I took it off a thousand times, okay?

482
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,281
This is stupid. I'm done!

483
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:51,951
Let them beat me up, if they want to.

484
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:56,623
You know why you only have one student?
'Cause you don't know Kung Fu.

485
01:05:56,664 --> 01:06:00,585
- Shao Dre!
- What?

486
01:06:05,173 --> 01:06:08,176
Come here.

487
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:22,107
- Jacket on!
- Mr. Han, I already...- Jacket on!

488
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:35,745
- Jacket on!
- I don't have a jacket...- Jacket on!

489
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,460
Be strong.

490
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:45,338
Jacket on.

491
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,882
Firm.

492
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:51,720
Jacket off.

493
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:54,305
Remember...

494
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:59,144
always strong... Jacket off.

495
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,650
Strong.

496
01:07:05,775 --> 01:07:08,611
Left foot back. Right foot back.

497
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:12,490
Left foot back. Pick up your jacket!

498
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:15,618
- Whoa, Mr. ...- Focus!
- Okay. - Always concentrate.

499
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:20,123
Left back. Right foot
back. Pick up your jacket!

500
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,667
Stay.

501
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:28,506
Pick up your jacket.

502
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,469
Strong.

503
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,471
Hang it up.

504
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:37,307
Hang it up.

505
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:40,268
And attitude!

506
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:42,437
Strike!

507
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:44,856
Hang up and attitude!

508
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:48,401
Harder. Harder.

509
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:54,199
Good, but no face.

510
01:07:54,824 --> 01:07:57,911
Jacket off!

511
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:23,103
Kung Fu lives in everything
we do, Shao Dre.

512
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:28,400
It lives in how we put on a jacket,
and how we take off the jacket.

513
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:33,154
It lives in how we treat people.

514
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:37,409
Everything is Kung Fu.

515
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:27,876
- So, why do not we take the Shiroko?
- I don't drive the Shiroko.

516
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:33,006
- Do you have a license?
- Yes.

517
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:40,513
So you have a license and a
car and we're in the train?

518
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:44,059
- Please, be quiet.
- I'm just sayin'...

519
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:49,606
seems like we could've saved a
lot of money, don't you think?

520
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:55,945
- Do you always ask these many questions?
- I'm sorry.

521
01:09:55,987 --> 01:10:00,158
So, what we are learning today?

522
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,619
Chi.

523
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:08,667
Eternal Energy. The essence of life.

524
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:14,005
It moves inside of us,
flows through our bodies.

525
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:18,635
Give us power from within.

526
01:10:21,846 --> 01:10:26,142
I get it, like the
"Force" from Star Wars.

527
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:32,691
You're Yoda, and I'm
like... I'm like a Jedi.

528
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:09,144
- Is this where you learned Kung Fu?
- Yes.

529
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:12,230
Everything good about me was born here.

530
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:16,067
So Dre, you gotta leave your
backpack and skateboard here.

531
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:19,571
- So, where are we going?
- The journey to the top of the mountain.

532
01:11:19,612 --> 01:11:23,992
Tomb of the Dragon Well.

533
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:31,666
Dragon Well? It's probably, closer
than it is, I'm looking at it.

534
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,294
Right?

535
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:06,409
- Are we there yet?
- Soon.

536
01:12:07,952 --> 01:12:11,831
- How do you say water in Chinese?
- Shui.

537
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:14,751
I need some shui.

538
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:18,713
I'm really thirsty.

539
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:29,808
- I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.
- Water on top of the mountain.

540
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:47,821
Shao Dre.

541
01:14:56,204 --> 01:15:00,583
The journey is complete.

542
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:06,631
- This is the Dragon Well?
- Yes.

543
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:16,808
I stood here with my
father, when I was your age.

544
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:23,064
He told me that's the
magic Kung Fu water.

545
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:35,994
You drink and nothing can defeat you.

546
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:50,884
It's the best water I've ever tasted.

547
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:54,763
- Did you see the lady with the snake?
- Yes.

548
01:15:54,804 --> 01:15:57,515
She was doing the Cobra
thing. She was like...

549
01:15:57,557 --> 01:16:03,396
copying the snake. And it was like...
right here, and she was like...

550
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:07,359
You did not watch
closely enough, Shao Dre.

551
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,570
The snake was copying the woman.

552
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:14,699
What? I don't get it.

553
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,626
Look.

554
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:31,758
- What do you see?
- Me, well my reflection. - Yes.

555
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:37,430
- Now, what do you see?
- It's blurry. - Yes.

556
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:42,644
That woman was sliced
through water quiet and calm.

557
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:46,189
In here and in here.

558
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:52,195
So, the snake reflects her
action, like still water.

559
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:56,533
- Like a mirror?
- Yes.

560
01:16:56,574 --> 01:17:02,414
So, she controlled a
snake by doing nothing?

561
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:10,547
Being still and doing nothing,
are two very different things.

562
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:14,467
- She used her Chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.

563
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:18,263
You gotta teach me that.
How to control people.

564
01:17:18,304 --> 01:17:25,895
There is only one person you
need to learn how to control.

565
01:17:25,937 --> 01:17:28,356
Who?

566
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:32,694
Empty your mind. Flow with my movement.

567
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:35,697
Connect to the energy, around you.

568
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:40,618
- I kinda just want to learn the cobra thing.
- Cobra takes a lifetime.

569
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:47,667
- Requires great focus.
- But I have great focus?!

570
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:51,004
- Oh my God. Mr. Han...
- Your focus,

571
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:56,259
- needs more focus.
- Mr. Han...

572
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:37,342
Thank you, Mr. Han.

573
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,990
There's no such thing as
fortune cookies in China.

574
01:19:01,032 --> 01:19:03,576
Dre, please be careful
crossing the street.

575
01:19:03,618 --> 01:19:13,044
You just scared the life out of me, the
other day. They have the "right-of-way".

576
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,839
And the symbols. I can't get the
symbols right on the bathrooms.

577
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,550
And I'm still walkin'
into the men's restroom.

578
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:21,553
The other day I walked in, there
was this 90 years old Chinese man,

579
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:23,513
he thought he was
getting a little treat.

580
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:31,771
Dre, please stop that! You look
crazy! Here, eat your noodles!

581
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:55,420
Mr. Han, what's goin' on?

582
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:58,798
Anticipation.

583
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,508
I can't see...

584
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:02,969
Don't see it, feel it.

585
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:05,221
Dammit, Mr. Han!

586
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:08,850
I felt that one!

587
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:14,105
- Mr. Han.
- What?

588
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:25,533
- Concentrate, okay?
- Okay. Do I get the stick now?

589
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:48,848
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay.

590
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:53,978
What's up Mr. Han, what time
we are trainin' tomorrow?

591
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,190
Shao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.

592
01:20:57,232 --> 01:21:00,026
Why not?

593
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:03,113
- Wu chi pi fan
- Wu chi pi fan?

594
01:21:03,154 --> 01:21:06,491
It means: "Too much of
something is not good."

595
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:09,160
You train a lot, you need to rest.

596
01:21:09,202 --> 01:21:14,040
A day off? Yes, Mr. Han! Yes!

597
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:18,378
Shao Dre needs to rest. Yes, Mr. Han.

598
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:24,634
You rest, too. I love
you, Mr. Han. Peace!

599
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,485
Are you okay?

600
01:21:42,527 --> 01:21:47,115
- My audition is tomorrow at a six.
- Isn't it what you've been practicing for?

601
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:52,120
- Yes, of course.
- Don't worry, you got it.

602
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:56,875
What if they don't pick me?

603
01:21:57,542 --> 01:22:00,879
Meiying, wait!

604
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,131
First of all, I'm going
to be there with you.

605
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:07,469
And B, all you have to do is what
your teacher says. Play the pauses.

606
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,222
It's easy, watch.

607
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:14,559
You see?

608
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:19,356
- I have to practice.
- Wait.

609
01:22:19,397 --> 01:22:20,899
Wu gi bi fan.

610
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,983
What?

611
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:23,985
I'm sorry, I don't think
you don't speak Chinese.

612
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:29,574
Wu gi bi fan. Too much of
good stuff is a bad stuff?

613
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:31,868
Ow...Wu chi pi fan.

614
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:35,830
Yeah. Wu gi bi FUN.

615
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:39,000
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

616
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,545
Have you ever been to the gym? C'mon,
we are going to have some fun.

617
01:22:42,587 --> 01:22:49,094
Come on, I know you want
to go have some fun!

618
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:20,750
Okay, that's going to give
you some serious gas.

619
01:23:31,845 --> 01:23:35,223
- What do you see?
- Me.

620
01:23:35,265 --> 01:23:40,145
- Now, what do you see?
- Me.

621
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:09,841
Go, come on.

622
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:15,889
/You're dancing machine.
/That was pretty good!<i/>

623
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:20,643
/Here comes, round two.<i/>

624
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:14,531
/You're hot.<i/>

625
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:23,081
-That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group. -No.

626
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:32,215
With like, other people in it dancing
behind you, doin' the same stuff.

627
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:44,477
- The audition, it was changed to today.
- But they said, it's tomorrow.

628
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:47,355
Something happened. It is in 20 minutes.

629
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:52,402
My father is coming to get me.

630
01:28:52,832 --> 01:29:02,425
Hey, she's like totally going to get
it, right, because that was just great.

631
01:29:31,454 --> 01:29:34,749
Hey! That was fantastic.

632
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:39,587
That was... You just... You
played so beautifully, and...

633
01:29:39,629 --> 01:29:42,799
We can no longer be friends.

634
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:47,220
You are bad for my life.

635
01:29:58,898 --> 01:30:02,318
See you at the tournament.

636
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:06,656
Don't be late for that.

637
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:53,870
Mr. Han! Mr. Han!

638
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:02,420
We'll not train today.

639
01:31:15,642 --> 01:31:21,439
- What are you doing?
- It's July 8th.

640
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:37,349
Why did you wreck the car?

641
01:32:54,074 --> 01:32:57,452
His name was Kang Kang.

642
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:01,206
Shao Dre, how old are you?

643
01:33:01,247 --> 01:33:03,667
Twelve.

644
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:06,795
He was ten.

645
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:11,633
He was so beautiful.

646
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:16,846
Her name was Xiang.

647
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:20,934
She was a singer.

648
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:26,731
Not professional.

649
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:31,695
She sang only for me.

650
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:11,568
What happened?

651
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:21,703
There was a steep hill.

652
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:25,040
Lots of rain.

653
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:29,336
The car, it just...

654
01:34:30,503 --> 01:34:33,590
I was driving.

655
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:38,219
We argued about something.

656
01:34:38,428 --> 01:34:40,889
I was so angry.

657
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,767
I lost control.

658
01:34:43,808 --> 01:34:47,437
I try to remember...

659
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:51,900
but I can not remember
what we're argued about.

660
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:57,322
I hope it was something important.

661
01:34:58,448 --> 01:35:03,036
Every year, I fix the car.

662
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:08,083
But still fix nothing.

663
01:39:57,455 --> 01:40:00,250
Mr. Han!

664
01:41:50,568 --> 01:41:56,574
Win or lose, doesn't matter. Fight hard.

665
01:41:58,076 --> 01:42:03,957
Earn respect. The boys leave you alone.

666
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:10,171
I have a present for you.

667
01:42:13,842 --> 01:42:17,012
Oh! Mr. Han.

668
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:19,389
This is the one Bruce Lee had.

669
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:21,725
Great.

670
01:42:21,766 --> 01:42:24,769
Thank you.

671
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:32,444
You have taught me a very
important lesson, Shao Dre.

672
01:42:32,485 --> 01:42:41,995
Life will knock us down, but we can
choose, whether or not, to get back up.

673
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:49,919
You're the best friend
I've ever had, Mr. Han.

674
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:06,519
Okay.

675
01:43:09,773 --> 01:43:15,487
Wait! Can you help me with something?

676
01:43:17,947 --> 01:43:19,616
Dre?

677
01:43:19,657 --> 01:43:23,370
Is your dad home?

678
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:28,917
Sir...

679
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:31,711
My name is Dre Parker.

680
01:43:31,753 --> 01:43:38,551
My actions have brought
dishonor to your family.

681
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:44,391
Your daughter has been
a great friend to me.

682
01:43:44,432 --> 01:43:48,103
And from her I have learned...

683
01:43:48,144 --> 01:43:50,438
...that a true friend...

684
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:53,692
...is a person who
makes your life better.

685
01:43:53,733 --> 01:43:58,780
But, if you give me a second chance...

686
01:43:58,822 --> 01:44:02,575
...I promise that I will be...

687
01:44:02,617 --> 01:44:09,207
...the best friend your
daughter has ever had.

688
01:44:13,545 --> 01:44:16,548
That's it.

689
01:44:30,895 --> 01:44:36,651
My daughter told me that she made
a promise to be at your tournament.

690
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:43,074
In our family, we do
not break our promises.

691
01:44:44,367 --> 01:44:47,370
Good luck!

692
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:51,291
Thank you.

693
01:44:57,213 --> 01:45:00,633
Rock and roll.

694
01:45:23,823 --> 01:45:28,328
Let the tournament begin!

695
01:46:00,318 --> 01:46:04,322
Shao Dre, you're up.

696
01:46:04,572 --> 01:46:07,450
- What's that?
- The rule book.

697
01:46:07,492 --> 01:46:11,079
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules, it's simple.

698
01:46:11,121 --> 01:46:13,456
You hit him, and don't let him hit you.

699
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:15,333
What?

700
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:19,587
Mr. Han, they're going to kill me.

701
01:46:19,629 --> 01:46:27,012
Two points to win. Win it
two times. Go. Focus. Focus.

702
01:46:55,665 --> 01:46:57,876
That's a warning. You
cannot run off the mat.

703
01:46:57,917 --> 01:47:00,962
Next time you lose a point. Go.

704
01:47:01,004 --> 01:47:05,800
- Be strong.
- Come on, Dre.

705
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:42,170
- Good job. Next time, no face.
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

706
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:44,464
The next point winner.

707
01:47:44,506 --> 01:47:47,926
Come on, baby.

708
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:39,264
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

709
01:50:39,305 --> 01:50:43,309
From now on, the semi-final
matches, three points to win.

710
01:50:43,351 --> 01:50:45,311
Be kinda hot if I won
this thing, huh, Mr. Han?

711
01:50:45,353 --> 01:50:52,944
- Be kinda hot if you focused.
- Yeah, well, after that.

712
01:50:58,783 --> 01:51:03,621
/And now the 1st
/semi-final of the evening.

713
01:51:03,663 --> 01:51:05,707
TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS SEMI-FINAL

714
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:10,837
First round: Cheng Vs. Wu Ping.

715
01:52:46,057 --> 01:52:50,437
Cheng advances to final.

716
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:08,455
Next semi-final: Introducing
Fighting Dragon Liang...

717
01:53:08,496 --> 01:53:14,794
...and the surprising
finalist, Dre Parker.

718
01:53:21,009 --> 01:53:25,305
Empty your mind. Focus.

719
01:54:22,445 --> 01:54:26,449
You're disqualified!

720
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:35,375
Are you okay?

721
01:54:49,889 --> 01:54:52,726
He's done.

722
01:54:52,767 --> 01:55:00,316
I'm sorry, you should not continue.
You've brought honor to your family.

723
01:55:00,358 --> 01:55:05,447
The doctor says, you did great.

724
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:19,336
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

725
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:23,423
Dre Parker has 2 minutes
to return to the match.

726
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:26,259
If he's unable to return...

727
01:55:26,301 --> 01:55:32,182
...the Fighting Dragons win by default.

728
01:55:32,307 --> 01:55:35,894
Can you guys give us a second?

729
01:55:35,935 --> 01:55:42,025
Yeah, okay. Sure baby,
whatever you need.

730
01:55:48,865 --> 01:55:52,160
Do you think I could have won?

731
01:55:52,202 --> 01:55:55,955
Win or lose doesn't matter, Shao Dre.

732
01:55:55,997 --> 01:56:01,211
You know that's not what I mean.

733
01:56:02,295 --> 01:56:07,801
Yes, I think you had a good chance.

734
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:14,933
So, let's do the fiery cup thing.

735
01:56:15,225 --> 01:56:20,397
You don't need to fight anymore. You have
proven everything you need to prove.

736
01:56:20,438 --> 01:56:23,942
What, that I can get beat
up easy, and then quit?

737
01:56:23,983 --> 01:56:27,070
That's not balance,
that's not real Kung Fu.

738
01:56:27,112 --> 01:56:33,118
You said, when life knocks you down, you
could choose whether or not to get back up.

739
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:39,708
Well, I'm tryin' to get back
up. And why won't you help me?

740
01:56:39,749 --> 01:56:41,501
Because...

741
01:56:41,543 --> 01:56:47,132
I cannot watch you get hurt anymore.

742
01:56:48,508 --> 01:56:52,887
Please, Mr. Han. Please.

743
01:56:53,930 --> 01:57:01,938
Just tell me, Shao Dre. Why? Why you
need to go back out there so badly?

744
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:06,484
Because I'm still scared.

745
01:57:08,403 --> 01:57:13,241
No matter what happens
tonight when I leave...

746
01:57:13,283 --> 01:57:18,997
...I don't want to be scared anymore.

747
01:57:27,797 --> 01:57:34,596
Since Dre Parker has not
returned to the ring...

748
01:57:52,781 --> 01:57:56,993
Dre Parker will fight!

749
01:59:48,855 --> 01:59:51,775
Shao Dre?

750
02:00:07,582 --> 02:00:13,088
Come on, Dre. You can do this, Dre.

751
02:01:49,434 --> 02:01:54,230
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

752
02:01:55,357 --> 02:01:58,276
No mercy.

753
02:03:07,262 --> 02:03:13,143
The score is tied. The next point wins!

754
02:06:03,229 --> 02:06:07,233
I'm so proud of you.
