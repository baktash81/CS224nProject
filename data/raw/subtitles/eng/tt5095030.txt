00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,638
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I still think about the night</i></font>

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,473
<font color="#00ffff"><i>your mother and I had to leave you.</i></font>

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,318
Hopefully, it's not for long,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,779
but I'll call you
when we get settled, ok.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,656
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Mommy?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,873
Jellybean.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,267
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,983
so, Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,357
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,359
It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,140
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,736
eyes...

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,454
Goodbye, sweetheart.

15
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,927
Alright, we'll see you soon.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Ok.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,578
Janet, we got to go.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,756
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I wish we could have
put down our bags,</i></font>

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,991
<font color="#00ffff"><i>tucked you back into your bed,</i></font>

20
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:59,433
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but too many lives were at stake.</i></font>

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,540
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,139
They've already launched.

23
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:08,716
We have to stop it.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,891
Come on.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,472
<font color="#00ffff"><i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it,</i></font>

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,048
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but the plating was too thick.</i></font>

27
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:27,965
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i></font>

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
I can't get through.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,059
Hank.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,257
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i></font>

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,190
<font color="#00ffff"><i>there is no coming back.</i></font>

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,294
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It should have been me,</i></font>

33
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,493
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but my regulator was damaged.</i></font>

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,009
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Your mother's wasn't.</i></font>

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,899
Tell Hope I love her.

36
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:53,572
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She turned it off.</i></font>

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,075
Janet. No!

38
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,580
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i></font>

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,999
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day,</i></font>

40
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:09,911
<font color="#00ffff"><i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i></font>

41
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,412
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Alone.</i></font>

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Afraid.</i></font>

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,139
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Gone forever.</i></font>

44
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,359
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home,</i></font>

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,294
<font color="#00ffff"><i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i></font>

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,393
But then Scott showed up.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,793
Or should I say, broke into our house.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,130
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i></font>

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,986
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and came back.</i></font>

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,994
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Everything changed.</i></font>

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,601
I started to wonder,

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,636
could your mother still be alive?

53
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,315
So, I dusted off some old plans.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,697
Dad, what are you saying?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,976
I think it's possible to bring her back.

56
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,577
Ok. We're in.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,757
This place is a maze.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
Where's that map?

59
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,499
We're definitely close.

60
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,650
You ready?
I'm ready, Daddy.

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,439
Are you sure?
Because once we're inside,

62
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:23,775
you show any hesitation or fear,
we're done.

63
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,024
I eat fear for breakfast.

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,369
That is super cool.

65
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:29,655
Come on.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,821
Look! It's Anton.

67
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,182
He'll show us the way.

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,198
Anton, which way do we go?

69
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,911
Anton, which way do we go?

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,093
Thanks, Anton!

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,639
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,219
Oh no, lasers!

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,777
I think I got lased!

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,156
The secret vault.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,117
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,032
Yup.

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,189
Perfect! Right there.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,350
There! It's the micro-treasure!

79
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,707
My trophy?

80
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:26,961
It looks like treasure.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
Oh it is to me.

82
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:29,949
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh no, you can't do that.

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,055
You can't.

85
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:34,319
It never leaves the house.
It's too important.

86
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,495
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,432
I'm so touched you think I'm
the world's greatest grandma.

88
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,252
It was the only one they had.

89
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,034
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

90
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,470
Oh no, the fuzz!

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,471
Hey Scotty,

92
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,033
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings,

93
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,834
and I think we have way too many
security cameras, don't we?

94
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,189
No, no, not at all.

95
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:55,746
I mean, because it's a lot
of security cameras.

96
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:56,945
I know what he needs.

97
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,597
Who's the security expert
in our business?

98
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,262
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

99
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:01,976
And if we overquote him
he's gonna go somewhere else.

100
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:02,958
I mean, we got to land this bird.

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,275
He aingt going anywhere.

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,656
And the expression is land this fish.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,114
No, it's land the bird.

104
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,314
Just like you land the plane.

105
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:09,624
You got to land the plane
to be in business.

106
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,445
I know it's silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things, but I do.

107
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:13,839
How am I gonna land a fish?

108
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:16,132
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore,

109
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:17,348
and it battled a hawk,

110
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,331
who's gonna win?

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,875
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,448
It's ok.

113
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,753
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

114
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,949
Now, if you just excuse me,

115
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,769
I'm in the middle of trying to
steal something with my daughter.

116
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:27,980
I'm gonna go recheck it.

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,395
To the escape ant!

118
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,314
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,247
The po-po?

120
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:36,917
How do you even know that?

121
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,780
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

122
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,796
Crash landing!

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,322
I wish we could shrink for real.

124
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,938
That is pretty cool.

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,536
And sorry about freaking out earlier,
you know.

127
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:04,083
But I feel like I'm way better.

128
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:06,212
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

129
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,250
And my hands are shaking.

130
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:08,428
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

131
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,874
It's gonna be great, Luis!

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
You got nothing to worry about!

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,309
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,176
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,694
Daddy!

136
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Come on.
I've got three days left.

137
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:26,337
Why would I try to escape?

138
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,008
Sorry Scott, but rules are rules.

139
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,942
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

140
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:31,432
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

141
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:33,429
Thank you.

142
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,663
It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

143
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,994
Our flying ant crashed.

144
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,836
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10 year old,

145
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:40,850
you can't leave the house.

146
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,371
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

147
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:45,475
Close-up magic.

148
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:49,923
I learned that.

149
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,428
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

150
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:54,956
Cassie.

151
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,215
This must all seem like a bunch
of confusing grown-up stuff to you?

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,213
Well, think of it this way.

153
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,099
Your school has rules, right?

154
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,214
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

155
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,272
Well, your daddy went to Germany

156
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,317
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

157
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,773
And that was a violation of Article 16,

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,792
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

159
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:15,975
Now, as a part of his joint plea

160
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,351
deal with Homeland Security
and the German government,

161
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,160
he was allowed to return to the U.S

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,810
provided he serve two years
under house arrest

163
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,531
followed by three years of probation.

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,719
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology,

165
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,299
or contact with any former
associates who were,

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,332
or currently are in violation
of said Accords.

167
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,800
Or any related statutes.

168
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,198
Ok sweetie?

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,910
You're really great with kids.

170
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,658
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

171
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,637
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot,

172
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
but you haven't had any contact

173
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,815
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne,
have you?

174
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,526
No.

175
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,505
You sure?

176
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,536
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,115
It was their tech,
so they violated the Accords, too.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,374
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,157
And, I don't need to remind you that,

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,551
any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison.

181
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:03,238
Minimum.

182
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,657
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

183
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,056
They hate his guts.

184
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Thanks, peanut.

185
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
How'd you do it, Scott?

186
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,716
Do what?

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,232
The card trick.

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,470
Seriously?

189
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,588
Oh my God!

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,963
You people can't just show up here

191
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,759
whenever you want
and search the place.

192
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,056
Actually, they can.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,163
You need a warrant.

194
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,201
Actually, they don't.

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,142
Really?

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,109
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,617
Yeah.
Alright.

198
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,467
Next time I see you
will be on the outside.

199
00:09:36,469 --> 00:09:37,469
Alright.

200
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,439
Get on the inside of this.

201
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,834
Hey, three days. Seriously

202
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,256
I'm proud of you, bud.
Thank you.

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,776
You know what?
Give me another one.

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,084
Me too! Gosh!

205
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,074
Freedom!

206
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,635
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,393
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

208
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,572
Me too, peanut.
But just wait till next weekend.

209
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,056
Once I'm outta here you and I
are gonna go paint this town red.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,657
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

211
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,230
You're getting good at that.

212
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,435
How'd you do that?

213
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:11,677
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

214
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,039
Bye.
Bye.

215
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,054
Three days.

216
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,001
Easy-peasy.

217
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,201
<i>Snap your fingers.
That gets them to look over there.</i>

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,158
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

219
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
♪ <i>We had a dream</i> ♪

220
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:41,965
♪ <i>We'd go traveling together</i> ♪

221
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,198
♪ <i>We'd spread a little loving ♪
♪ then we'd keep moving on</i> ♪

222
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,839
Easy-peasy.

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,834
<i>Where are you?</i>

224
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:35,742
<i>Everything that you know</i>

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,515
<i>Lost</i>

226
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,876
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,294
<i>What?</i>

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,231
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,294
I found you!

230
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:05,159
You always find me, Mommy.

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,481
<i>What the hell?</i>

232
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,998
Hey, Hank!

233
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,560
It's been a while.

234
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,160
I don't even know if this is your number...

235
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,171
anymore.

236
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:32,239
And I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from, but...

237
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,556
I just had a really weird dream.

238
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,836
And I know that doesn't...

239
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,438
sound like an emergency
or anything but...

240
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:39,699
it just felt...

241
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,940
very real.

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,138
I was back in the quantum realm and...

243
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:46,848
I...

244
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:48,605
think I saw your wife.

245
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,073
And then I was your wife.

246
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,427
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,289
You know,

248
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,506
hearing this out loud, I'm thinking...

249
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,269
it's not an emergency.

250
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,972
I'm sorry to bother you.

251
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,316
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

252
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,397
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail</i>

253
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:24,395
<i>Could be one, little, tiny universe.</i>

254
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Hope?

255
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,561
Is this another dream?

256
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,335
Do you think it was a dream
or is it possible

257
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:07,017
that you really saw
my mom down there?

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,280
I'm not sure.

259
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,133
I can't be here!

260
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,983
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

261
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,074
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,305
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

263
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:44,226
Relax. As far as your nanny cops
know you're still at home.

264
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,999
Scotty?

265
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,496
He's programmed
to replicate your daily routine.

266
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:02,874
Nine hours in bed.

267
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,158
Five hours in front of the TV.

268
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,277
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

269
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,974
That's totally inaccurate.

270
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

271
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,959
Are you spying on me?

272
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,855
We keep tabs on all
security threats, alright?

273
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:14,837
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

274
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,127
I'm sorry about Germany.

275
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,394
They just showed up.

276
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,892
They said, it was a matter
of national security.

277
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:23,939
That Cap needed help, so

278
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,969
Cap?

279
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,908
Tain America. Captain.

280
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:28,977
Cap.

281
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,918
It's what we call him.

282
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,463
If you're a friend.

283
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,411
I'm not saying I'm a friend of
a little, I know him.

284
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,449
He's nice. Whatever.

285
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,358
I'm sorry! Alright?
I. I didn't think I'd get caught.

286
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
You didn't think about a lot of things.

287
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,420
How's Hank?

288
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,875
We're still running.
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

289
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,062
How do you think he is?

290
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,132
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

291
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,948
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

292
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,722
The only reason
why we're even talking is,

293
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:53,317
because we need what's in your head.

294
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,452
Is this where you're living?

295
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,539
If...

296
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:38,519
you need help or money
or something, maybe I can

297
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,574
We're fine.

298
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,861
Hey, Hank.

299
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,664
Look, I just wanna...
Save it!

300
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,907
Can we start?
Yeah.

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,331
So, while you were relaxing at home,

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,956
we were building this.

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,931
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

304
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,029
To my mom.

305
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,626
We think she might still be down there.

306
00:17:58,628 --> 00:17:59,628
We just don't know where.

307
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:00,771
What?

308
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,172
If we can pinpoint my mom's location,

309
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,036
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

310
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,656
You built all this
and you don't even know

311
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:07,884
if she's alive?

312
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,952
It's called a hypothesis.

313
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,881
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

314
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,867
It was overloaded and it shut down.

315
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,379
But for a split second,

316
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:18,814
the doorway to the quantum realm,

317
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:19,966
was opened.

318
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,680
And?

319
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,819
And five minutes later you called,

320
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,008
talking about Mom.

321
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:26,742
We think when you were down there,

322
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:28,399
you may have entangled with her.

323
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:30,478
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

324
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:32,966
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,521
We think she might have put some

326
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,013
kind of a message in your head.

327
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,613
Hopefully a location.

328
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,513
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

329
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,833
Your mom put a message in my head?
Come on.

330
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,158
That's insane.

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,196
No, Scott.

332
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,379
Insane,

333
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,770
is going to Germany without telling us,

334
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,167
and fighting the Avengers.

335
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,338
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

336
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,281
Tell me you really destroyed it.

337
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,656
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

338
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,122
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

339
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,319
That was my life's work!

340
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,709
What was I supposed to do?

341
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,334
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

342
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,887
I'm sorry, Hank!

343
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,143
I'm sorry I took the suit.

344
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,048
I'm sorry that I called last night.

345
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,967
I. I.. I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

346
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:15,035
I wish that I did.

347
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
I just had a dream about her
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

348
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
What?

349
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,406
You... I had a dream.

350
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:27,879
She was playing
hide-and-seek with a...

351
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:28,628
little...

352
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,038
girl, Cassie and I do it all the time.

353
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:32,323
Doesn't mean anything.

354
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,517
But was it Cassie in the dream?

355
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:35,750
No.

356
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,036
Where was she hiding?

357
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,788
What?
The little girl.

358
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,827
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

359
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,118
No, it was in a tall dresser.

360
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,356
You mean a wardrobe.

361
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,636
Is that what that's called?

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
What color was it?

363
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,011
Red.

364
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,800
Were there horses on it?

365
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,232
Boy.

366
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,513
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

367
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,117
It doesn't sound like
you really got the gist of the game.

368
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,277
She's alive.

369
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:09,802
I knew it.

370
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,188
I knew it!

371
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,184
We need to get that part.

372
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,334
Ok.

373
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:19,918
The sooner we get the tunnel working

374
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,536
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

375
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,476
Does Burch have it?

376
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:24,116
Yeah. Let's go.
What part?

377
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:26,319
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

378
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,663
We need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again.

379
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,414
I grabbed your clothes.

380
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:33,874
You might want to change.

381
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,112
Look, I'd really like to help you

382
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,777
but if I'm not at home when they
come to take off my ankle monitor

383
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,134
then I'm going away forever.

384
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:52,318
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel

385
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,280
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

386
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,295
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

387
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:57,781
You owe us.

388
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,448
Alright, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

389
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,753
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

390
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,114
Let's go.

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,484
We good?

392
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:32,518
Yeah.

393
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,534
I'll be right back.

394
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,607
Can I have one of these?

395
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:43,300
No.

396
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,897
Susan!

397
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,319
Welcome to Oui!

398
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,225
Sonny!

399
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:04,412
Oui is French for yes.

400
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,924
As in yes to farm-to-table,

401
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,344
yes to locally sourced,

402
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,995
and yes to planet before profit.

403
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,838
Well, let's hope it also means yes

404
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,474
to do you have the component
I ordered?

405
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

406
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:20,480
Have a seat.

407
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
No, I'm good. Thank you.

408
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,660
Who is this guy?

409
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:23,978
Sonny Burch.

410
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,129
He traffics in black market technology.

411
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,760
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

412
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,195
Could I just have one

413
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,460
No.

414
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,653
You know, I have...

415
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:38,132
a special friend at the FBI.

416
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,767
And I say special because...

417
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:43,399
well he tells me things
that I didn't previously know.

418
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,279
For example...

419
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,838
your name isn't Susan.

420
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,940
It's Hope Van Dyne.

421
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,500
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

422
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,734
That's not good, Hank.
No shit.

423
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:05,315
What do you want?

424
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,671
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

425
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,738
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

426
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,810
Our relationship?

427
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,234
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

428
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,903
Hell, S.H.I.E.I.D. and HYDRA don't even
exist anymore but now, Hank Pym

429
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,196
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

430
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,430
Do you have a point?

431
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,652
You think that I don't know
what you've been building,

432
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,040
with all this?

433
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,328
Quantum technology.

434
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,692
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget...

435
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,878
AI, forget cryptocurrency.

436
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,439
Quantum energy is the future.

437
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,413
It's the next gold rush.

438
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,229
Is that so?

439
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:38,564
I want in, Hope.

440
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,669
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty,

441
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,911
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

442
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,571
Starting bid,

443
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,201
one billion dollars.

444
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,049
Thank you, Sonny really.

445
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,516
But my father and I have something

446
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,030
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

447
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,921
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

448
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,586
My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

449
00:24:02,078 --> 00:24:03,900
So, we are either in business together,

450
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,289
or we aren't in business together.

451
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,344
Then I guess we aren't.

452
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,614
You can go.

453
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,717
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

454
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

455
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:21,472
Listen, Sonny.

456
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,614
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

457
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,172
if you just give me that component.

458
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,196
Darling, the only thing
you're taking from here,

459
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:29,497
is my heart,

460
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,528
but it will mend in time.

461
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,670
Ok.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,139
So, now what?

463
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,577
You'll see.

464
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,587
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

465
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:49,936
I want to know what it is

466
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,176
because if they're not working
with us,

467
00:24:51,178 --> 00:24:52,341
they're working with somebody.

468
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:53,967
So find out.
I want some names

469
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,283
Hold on, you gave her wings?

470
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:07,745
Get her.

471
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,757
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

472
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,155
Stop firing!

473
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,837
Stop!

474
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Alright, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go, go!

475
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:38,730
Go!

476
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,299
Wings and blasters.

477
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,776
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

478
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
No, I did.

479
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:50,878
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

480
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,709
Our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

481
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,553
I can assure you of that!

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,678
What in the hell is that?

483
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,194
Dad, are you seeing this?

484
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,320
Hope, get out of there!

485
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,414
I got to do something.
Wait!

486
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,093
It is still a work in progress.

487
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:00,096
You taught me that kick.
Remember?

488
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,315
Yeah, great form.

489
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,416
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

490
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:04,618
Not the time, Scott.

491
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,076
Damn it, where'd it go?

492
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:09,947
I've lost it.

493
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,230
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

494
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,445
<i>Try looking</i>

495
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Dad?

496
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,078
Give me that.

497
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Now.

498
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
Are you ok?
No!

499
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,335
He got the lab.

500
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,197
No.

501
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,221
Come on!

502
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,956
What was that?

503
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,435
I don't know.

504
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,566
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

505
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,952
and figure out where the lab is.

506
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,309
So, where to now?

507
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,019
How about my house?

508
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,616
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

509
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,816
and Woo could walk in any second.

510
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,271
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

511
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,635
What about your house?

512
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,619
Sorry.

513
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, there is one place I can think of.

514
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:01,978
No.

515
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,651
No, no, no, no!

516
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:07,720
No!

517
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:12,215
Dr. Pym,

518
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,498
like, like who would have thought that,
once again,

519
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:15,768
in your hour of need that,

520
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,298
you would turn to us, you know?

521
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:18,912
Not me.

522
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:20,726
Help yourself.

523
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,296
Hey, what's up with the fancy pastry?

524
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
We got to keep the food budget down.

525
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,556
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

526
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:26,881
The oatmeal packets.

527
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,334
Oatmeal packets.

528
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,186
It's insult.
Why is it an insult?

529
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,878
Because it tastes like sand.
You know why?

530
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,996
It's because it's organic.

531
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,374
It's not organic, it's sand.

532
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:35,512
It's the most important meal
of the day.

533
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:36,638
Hey you know what,
you can get creative with it.

534
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,419
Break teeth.

535
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:39,392
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

536
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:40,336
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want

537
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:42,122
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

538
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:43,363
Come on, man.

539
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,039
We got bigger fish to fry.

540
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,474
Is that my desk?

541
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:47,348
Yeah.

542
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,638
What?

543
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,158
Why do I have such a small desk?

544
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,650
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

545
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You snooze, you lose.

546
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,940
Well, I was under house arrest.

547
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:54,548
Yeah.

548
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:56,016
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

549
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,038
This is garbage.

550
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,798
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

551
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,995
I got it at a rummage sale.

552
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,798
So, you save money on my desk?

553
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,501
Guys.

554
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:06,028
Hope, please,
we need to focus, alright?

555
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,171
We got to find that lab already.
Jeez.

556
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,887
You know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.

557
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,432
Like this crazy, creepy cat,
who walks through walls and stuff.

558
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:15,873
Like, like a ghost.

559
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,560
Like Baba Yaga.

560
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,700
Baba Yaga, the witch.

561
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,730
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

562
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:28,767
You know Baba Yaga?

563
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,152
Whoever stole it,

564
00:30:31,502 --> 00:30:32,700
we need to find it.

565
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,804
You don't find someone like that.

566
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:36,301
They find you.

567
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:38,031
Like Baba Yaga.

568
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,037
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

569
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,326
Didn't you put some kind
of LoJack on your lab?

570
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,670
Because if you didn't,

571
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:46,786
we have a variety of affordable options.

572
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,745
Of course I did, Luis.

573
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,395
It was disabled.

574
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,319
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

575
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,232
They also looked like
they were phasing.

576
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,309
Phasing?

577
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,159
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

578
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,521
through different states of matter.

579
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,473
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

580
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:02,870
The lab emits radiation.

581
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

582
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,297
That could work yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

583
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,254
Where else can
we find that equipment?

584
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:13,982
Well, there is one person.

585
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:16,435
Bill Foster.

586
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,414
Great!

587
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,780
Who's Bill Foster?

588
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,467
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.I.D.

589
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,194
They had a falling out years ago.

590
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,197
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

591
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:27,387
It's probably just a waste of time.

592
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,680
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

593
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,688
Don't you think we should check?

594
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,024
We need to find out who took the lab.

595
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,573
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.

596
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,774
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

597
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,096
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

598
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
That's not a disguise, Hank.

599
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,238
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

600
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,258
In an isolated system,

601
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,312
particles co-exist,

602
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:45,249
in a stable phase relationship.

603
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:47,239
If the system is interfered with,

604
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,499
that stability becomes chaos.

605
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,166
Unpredictable.

606
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,926
Dangerous.

607
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,068
Beautiful.

608
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,936
Isolated completely a quantum system

609
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,258
would revert back
to separate states of matter

610
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,990
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

611
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,338
In other words,

612
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:08,588
the object in question would be
both in and out of phase,

613
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,908
with multiple parallel realities.

614
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

615
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,358
I am noticing an unusually high number

616
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,570
of glazed eyes out there among you.

617
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:29,414
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

618
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,030
That'll be enough for today.

619
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,785
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

620
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,955
It's incredible.

621
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,658
You're linked to Janet.

622
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,760
It's quantum entanglement,

623
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:42,424
between the quantum states of
Posner molecules in your brains.

624
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,240
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

625
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,647
Do you guys just put the word
quantum in front of everything?

626
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,139
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

627
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,750
Hope, I'd love to help you but
I don't have anything like the

628
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:52,559
equipment you're describing.

629
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,680
I told you this is a waste of time.
Come on, let's go.

630
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,092
Don't condescend, Hank.

631
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:58,112
You're the one
who's on the run from the FBI.

632
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,184
All because you had to grow to a size

633
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,054
that finally fit your ego.

634
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,191
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

635
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:06,727
Really?

636
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,071
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

637
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:12,632
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

638
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:13,750
Actually, I do.

639
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,872
Back in the day I was,

640
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:17,325
Hank's partner
on a project called Goliath.

641
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,150
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

642
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,197
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,

643
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,358
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

644
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,259
Right

645
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,250
I don't know.

646
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,284
How big did you get?

647
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:30,180
My record?

648
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,272
21 feet.

649
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,034
Not bad.
You?

650
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,431
I don't

651
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
No, really, I'm curious.

652
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,516
65 feet.

653
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:38,457
Yeah.

654
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,879
Huge.
65.

655
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,240
If you two are finished comparing sizes

656
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,407
we need to figure out
a way to track down,

657
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,221
the lab.

658
00:34:45,323 --> 00:34:48,217
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

659
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,359
Strange.

660
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,834
You had all the answers
back in the day.

661
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:53,259
That's why I left the project.

662
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,160
Left?

663
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,880
I fired you.
Best decision I ever made.

664
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,017
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental,

665
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,951
stubborn, impatient.

666
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:03,355
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

667
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:04,711
Just the mediocrities.

668
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,235
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

669
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,518
and chose to stick it out.

670
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,431
Watch it, Bill.

671
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:11,065
She paid the price, though didn't she?

672
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,210
You son of a bitch.

673
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,576
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

674
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,311
I'm trying to save my mother.

675
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,381
Now, which office would you say?

676
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:20,464
It's Woo.

677
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,557
Someone must have seen me.

678
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:24,172
Relax. If this is about you,

679
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:25,572
they'd be in your house by now.

680
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,621
What are you, 15?
Come on.

681
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,059
We got to go right now.
Wait.

682
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,273
You might be able
to improvise that tracker,

683
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,763
if you modify the diffraction units
on one of your regulators.

684
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:39,134
That could work.
I don't know what that means.

685
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,201
Thank you.

686
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,537
Thank you.

687
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:52,814
But Doctor,

688
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:56,038
campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

689
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,536
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

690
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,517
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

691
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,876
I can assure you I'm the last person
he would want to visit.

692
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,200
Come on, you expect us to...
Hey, hey.

693
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,590
Why is that?

694
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,953
Simple.

695
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:08,599
We hate each other's guts.

696
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
So I'm a terrible partner?

697
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,250
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea
in his unremarkable career.

698
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:17,517
But his idea about
the diffractors could work, right?

699
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,997
Fine, one decent idea.

700
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,882
Except, I eliminated the diffractors
when I upgraded the suits.

701
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,691
So, if we had an old suit,

702
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:30,077
we might be able
to track down the lab?

703
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
Yes, but we don't.

704
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,980
What if we did?

705
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:36,014
What do you mean?

706
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,995
I mean...

707
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,436
life's funny.

708
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,952
Oh my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

709
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,851
What?

710
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,838
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

711
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,459
I couldn't destroy that.

712
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,476
Before I turned myself in,
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

713
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,910
You sent my suit through the mail?

714
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,351
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

715
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,658
You know,
they do tracking numbers now.

716
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,501
Like UPS.

717
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Where is it?

718
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:03,230
It's in a very safe place, alright?
Don't worry.

719
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,699
What, the trophy?

720
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,339
No, it's not here.

721
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,676
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?

722
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,095
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

723
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,496
Hey, get away from the plant.

724
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

725
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,037
Show-and-tell.

726
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,228
Scotty?

727
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
No, stop!

728
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,169
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

729
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,296
Whenever you go back to school

730
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:32,154
isn't everything supposed
to look so much smaller?

731
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,634
This place seems huge.

732
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>What is it?</i>

733
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,096
It's the new regulator.

734
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,032
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

735
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,673
How much of a work
in progress is this?

736
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,892
No, no, no.

737
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,758
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just

738
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,451
Ok, ok.

739
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,907
<i>What do you see?</i>

740
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,138
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

741
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,194
Just let me

742
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,230
Sorry.
It's alright.

743
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,236
Ok.
Alright.

744
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:20,154
Try that.

745
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:25,233
Sorry.

746
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,166
What?

747
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:32,200
Awesome.

748
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,377
If only Cap could see you now.

749
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,432
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

750
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,916
Hey!

751
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,148
Where's your hall pass?

752
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:53,633
Hey, I'm talking to you.

753
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:55,944
Hey!

754
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:58,540
Hey.

755
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:25,272
You can do it.

756
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,571
You almost got it.

757
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,273
Peanut.

758
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,834
Ok, let's go.

759
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,853
Hiya champ, how was school today?

760
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,793
Alright, get your jokes out now.

761
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:17,738
Can you fix the suit?

762
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:19,296
So cranky.

763
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,821
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

764
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,837
Do you really have that?

765
00:40:33,802 --> 00:40:35,475
Let's see if Foster was right.

766
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,303
This has got to be the lab.

767
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,190
Let's go get it.

768
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah.

769
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,074
This seems right.

770
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,798
Look at us,

771
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,761
teaming up twice in one day.

772
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,098
Makes you think?

773
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,516
About what?

774
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,518
Germany.

775
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,372
What do you mean?

776
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:18,982
We were working together,

777
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,658
training together and...

778
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,835
other stuffing together.

779
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:25,289
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

780
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,979
I guess we'll never know.

781
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:28,654
But I do know one thing.

782
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,771
What?

783
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,169
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

784
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,333
Hey, Scott.

785
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,478
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

786
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
long enough to get my lab?

787
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,905
Yes, sir.

788
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,976
Thank you.

789
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,942
Ok, you're transmitting.

790
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:56,653
What took you so long?

791
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:58,516
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

792
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,396
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

793
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:02,840
You like it?

794
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,141
Hilarious.

795
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:06,918
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

796
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:07,914
Some kind of...

797
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,449
electronic disturbance.

798
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,431
<i>Be careful.</i>

799
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,943
You know me, Hank.
I'm always care...

800
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,136
It's ok.
It's just the suit.

801
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,560
How do you know?
Look.

802
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,714
That's Ghost?

803
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,155
What is she doing?

804
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,273
Do you think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?

805
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,196
Let's just get outta here
before she wakes up.

806
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,548
Hope, look!

807
00:42:29,885 --> 00:42:30,990
There's the lab.

808
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,639
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

809
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,536
and not somebody else's, right?

810
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,500
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we got to be fast.

811
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:44,437
I'll get it.

812
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,086
Shit

813
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:01,516
Hope. Hope! Hank.

814
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:03,284
Guys.

815
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,816
I don't think they can hear you.

816
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,692
Hi.

817
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,834
I'm Ava.

818
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,408
Scott.

819
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,057
So...

820
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,913
you don't need the suit to...

821
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:19,053
you know...

822
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,162
go through things.

823
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,268
No.

824
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:24,950
It just

825
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,294
helps me control it.

826
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,329
And the pain,

827
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:32,024
supposedly.

828
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:38,630
You're not gonna reach into my chest

829
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:39,929
and crush my heart, are you?

830
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,954
You're funny.

831
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,039
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

832
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,073
I need...

833
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,132
what's in your head.

834
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,279
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

835
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,560
and get this over with, shall we?

836
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,089
Get up!

837
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,025
Come on!

838
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,328
Dad?

839
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,054
Don't ever touch him again.

840
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,540
Now, now, Hope.

841
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,715
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your father, all things considered.

842
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,439
What the hell are you talking about?

843
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,537
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

844
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Bill.

845
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,899
What have you done?

846
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,200
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

847
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,655
You're with her?

848
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:54,271
Man. I thought you were cool.

849
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,233
What the hell is going on here?

850
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,971
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

851
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,072
Why would he?

852
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,551
Elihas Starr.

853
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,281
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.I.D.

854
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,196
Quantum research.

855
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,154
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

856
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,868
You had him fired.

857
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:17,766
And discredited for good measure.

858
00:45:20,857 --> 00:45:24,719
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

859
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,959
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

860
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:30,214
No, no, no!

861
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Too many.

862
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,957
Until something went wrong.

863
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,762
He told us to run.

864
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,871
Elihas, what's happening?

865
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,440
Just go. Go!

866
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,631
Daddy! Daddy!

867
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,975
I could tell he was scared.

868
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,811
Daddy!

869
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,702
Ava, no!

870
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,698
I didn't want him to be alone.

871
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,755
No! No!

872
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,571
When I woke up,
my parents were dead.

873
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,238
I wasn't so lucky.

874
00:46:19,357 --> 00:46:22,104
They call it molecular disequilibrium.

875
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,758
A rather dull name, I think.

876
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,119
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

877
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,483
Every cell in my body is torn apart

878
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,399
and stitched back together.

879
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,993
Over and over.

880
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,302
Every day.

881
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,260
I was still at S.H.I.E.I.D.
when I got the call about a...

882
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:44,724
quantum anomaly in Argentina.

883
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:48,941
Hello, Ava.

884
00:46:50,204 --> 00:46:51,220
My name's Bill.

885
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,258
I was a friend of your father's.

886
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,695
I brought you something.

887
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,539
It's alright.
Try again.

888
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,969
That's it.

889
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,814
Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.

890
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,280
But others at S.H.I.E.I.D.

891
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,622
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

892
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,833
They built me a containment suit,

893
00:47:19,835 --> 00:47:21,530
so I could control my phasing.

894
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,459
And trained me to be
a stealth operative.

895
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,525
They weaponized me.

896
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,462
I stole for them.
Spied for them.

897
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,042
Killed for them.

898
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,118
And in exchange for my soul,

899
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,033
they were going to cure me.

900
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,380
They lied.

901
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,423
When S.H.I.E.I.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

902
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,319
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

903
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,439
but her condition was progressive.

904
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,760
I didn't know how to cure it.

905
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,514
She wanted to kill you Hank,
but I told her no,

906
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,216
and that she should watch
you instead.

907
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,004
And sure enough,

908
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:59,120
she discovered that you
were building the tunnel.

909
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:02,996
Then, she told me about Lang.

910
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:05,945
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

911
00:48:05,947 --> 00:48:07,312
that's when I...

912
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:08,448
Christ's sake!

913
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,838
That's me. I'm sorry.

914
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,508
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

915
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,393
Cassie, 911.

916
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,272
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

917
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:17,959
No, that's not happening.

918
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,112
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

919
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,759
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

920
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,917
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

921
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,878
Ok, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

922
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,364
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

923
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,038
Cassie, are you ok?
What's the emergency?

924
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,919
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

925
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,031
What?

926
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,339
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

927
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,789
<i>Hey Scott, I know that they're there.</i>

928
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:41,198
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

929
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,600
No, I can't do that right now.

930
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,467
<i>Why not?</i>

931
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:44,614
Because I'm sick.

932
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,156
<i>Hey, can you just maybe look around
later then and call me back?</i>

933
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,399
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

934
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:49,772
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

935
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:51,678
Bye, peanut!
<i>Feel better!</i>

936
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,817
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

937
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:55,064
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

938
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,653
Ava, I want to help you.

939
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,820
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

940
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,282
Really? How?

941
00:49:01,517 --> 00:49:02,217
Janet.

942
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,159
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.

943
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:06,576
We can extract that energy.

944
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,090
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure

945
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,991
Extract it?

946
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:11,432
Yes.
Are you insane?

947
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:12,943
That would rip Janet apart.

948
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:14,035
You don't know that.

949
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:16,018
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

950
00:49:16,446 --> 00:49:19,038
When Janet's location pops into
Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me

951
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,896
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

952
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,672
What?

953
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:23,799
You are gonna stay here,

954
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,552
just in case I need your help.

955
00:49:26,784 --> 00:49:28,338
Like hell I would help you!

956
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,598
You'll do whatever I say.

957
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,799
You're gonna kill Janet!

958
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,632
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

959
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,969
Goddamn it, Bill!

960
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:37,343
Dad?
Calm down, Hank.

961
00:49:37,714 --> 00:49:39,164
So help me God.

962
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,752
The pills.

963
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,556
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

964
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,886
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

965
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,124
He could die!

966
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:49,162
Come on!

967
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Help him!

968
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
Dad, just hang on, alright?

969
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,710
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

970
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:54,964
Help him, man! Come on!

971
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,358
The Altoid tin!

972
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Wait!

973
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Thanks, guys.

974
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Hank!

975
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,755
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

976
00:50:21,176 --> 00:50:24,356
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

977
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:26,876
Now, bring it down.
Alright, lock it in.

978
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:27,723
No, no, no.

979
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:29,719
The bolt is on the other side.

980
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,514
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

981
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Good job.

982
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:34,994
It'll work.

983
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,232
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

984
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,675
Look, we'll adjust the relays

985
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:40,517
while you go reprogram
the settings, alright?

986
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,723
It's going to be fine.

987
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,011
So, this is it.

988
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,029
Yeah.

989
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,702
You'd think with all this time
to prepare I'd be more ready.

990
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:55,375
Going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

991
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,510
It kind of melts your mind.

992
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,358
I mean seeing my mom again.

993
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,711
What if she's a completely
different person?

994
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,315
Yeah, like, George Washington.

995
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,946
I'm serious, Scott.

996
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,973
Or George Jefferson.

997
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,957
What if she's forgotten about me?

998
00:51:17,263 --> 00:51:18,620
When I was in prison,

999
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,380
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

1000
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,739
I could have been locked up
for 100 years,

1001
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,994
I never would have forgotten her.

1002
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,072
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

1003
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,517
until she can see you again.

1004
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,770
Thank you.

1005
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,237
Hey.

1006
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,420
We got a big problem.

1007
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,856
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.

1008
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,420
No.

1009
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,994
And they're on the proposal,

1010
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,696
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

1011
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,811
Yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

1012
00:51:55,314 --> 00:51:56,976
Look, maybe I could stop
by tomorrow, take a look at it.

1013
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,195
No. No, no, no, no.

1014
00:51:58,197 --> 00:51:59,439
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

1015
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:00,680
You got to come right now and fix it.

1016
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:03,139
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.

1017
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:04,324
You know what, I'm coming to you.

1018
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:05,466
I'll just bring the plans.

1019
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:06,891
They're on the laptop.

1020
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,075
And you can fix them there.

1021
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,591
Just tell me where you are, ok?

1022
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
It's complicated.

1023
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,040
What do you mean it's complicated?

1024
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,017
As you can see, sir,

1025
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,371
this system is state of the art.

1026
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,755
Security of tomorrow, today.

1027
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:24,078
That's so good!

1028
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,639
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicing.

1029
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:28,016
Hey, I just got to drive up to Scotty's,
so we can fix the plans.

1030
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,636
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1031
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,014
As you can see.

1032
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,377
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1033
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:36,089
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1034
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:37,550
You sprung for
the undercarriage wash?

1035
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,909
Well, you said get the works.

1036
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,296
That's a scam, bro.
We live in California, not Minnesota.

1037
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,315
He's right.

1038
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:44,848
The undercarriage wash,

1039
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,140
that's for cleaning off road salt,

1040
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,714
laid down in our more
snow-laden sister states.

1041
00:52:50,262 --> 00:52:52,652
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?

1042
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,159
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1043
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,109
And I do my research, Luis.

1044
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,777
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine,

1045
00:53:02,866 --> 00:53:06,199
at the FBI that you are
a known associate of Scott Lang.

1046
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,453
A known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned,

1047
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,620
has a portable shrinking laboratory,

1048
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,236
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1049
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,930
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1050
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,380
Well, I hate to break it to you but...

1051
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:20,822
I don't know what you're talking about.

1052
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,335
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1053
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,479
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1054
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,056
So, I'm gonna introduce you,

1055
00:53:30,058 --> 00:53:31,692
to my good friend, Uzman.

1056
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,188
Now,

1057
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:35,417
Uzman is a master,

1058
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:39,939
at extracting information from the
unwilling through psychoactive means.

1059
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:43,106
Is that truth serum?

1060
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,812
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1061
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,481
That's just nonsense from TV.

1062
00:53:48,022 --> 00:53:48,945
Well, what is it then?

1063
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,534
It's a little concoction,

1064
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:53,428
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1065
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,699
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1066
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,896
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1067
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,725
No, it's not.

1068
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,778
No offensing,

1069
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,999
but they sound like truth serum to me.

1070
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,076
Right?
It's not a truth serum.

1071
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:05,576
Ok. Hey, I believe you.

1072
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,000
It's not a truth serum.

1073
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:10,261
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks

1074
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,590
The truth serum.

1075
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,650
Well, I have a lot of allergies so...

1076
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:15,465
you might wanna think about that.

1077
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,113
We've got to get that lab back.

1078
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,480
What?

1079
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,710
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1080
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,810
How long have I got?

1081
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,959
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1082
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,251
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1083
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
How?

1084
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,292
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1085
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:44,478
You can't mean that.

1086
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,447
Ava!

1087
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,839
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there

1088
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,672
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1089
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,193
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1090
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,396
I am!

1091
00:54:56,956 --> 00:54:58,913
You said you could fix me!

1092
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,833
You promised.

1093
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,332
I know. I will.

1094
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:06,960
But not like that.

1095
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,177
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1096
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,292
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1097
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,973
Fine.

1098
00:55:22,654 --> 00:55:24,125
There are other options.

1099
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,622
You know what? You're right.

1100
00:55:39,624 --> 00:55:40,677
This isn't truth serum.

1101
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,040
Because I don't feel anything.

1102
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,719
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1103
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
This is truth serum!

1104
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:46,231
There's no such thing!

1105
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,178
Ok.

1106
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,323
Ok, ok.

1107
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,935
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1108
00:55:52,937 --> 00:55:53,647
Ok.

1109
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,312
Where is Scott Lang?

1110
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,920
Well see, that's complicated.

1111
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,876
Because when I first met Scotty,
he was in a bad place.

1112
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,520
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I'm not talking about cell block D.</i></font>

1113
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,986
<font color="#00ffff"><i>His wife had just filed for divorce,</i></font>

1114
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:08,320
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and I was like damn, homie.
She dumped you when you're on lockup?</i></font>

1115
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,376
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he was like, Yeah I know.</i></font>

1116
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:10,619
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I thought I was gonna be
with her forever, </i></font>

1117
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,543
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but now I'm all alone.</i></font>

1118
00:56:11,544 --> 00:56:12,816
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I was like, Damn homie.
You know what?</i></font>

1119
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,216
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You got to chin up,
because you'll find a new partner.</i></font>

1120
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,569
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But you know what? I'm Luis.</i></font>

1121
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,456
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he says, you know what?</i></font>

1122
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:17,915
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm Scotty and we're gonna be
best friends.</i></font>

1123
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,056
Ok, hold on, hold on.

1124
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,776
I like a good story
as much as the next person

1125
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,016
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1126
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,080
with where Scott Lang is?

1127
00:56:23,082 --> 00:56:24,197
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1128
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:27,056
You put a dime in him,
you got to let the whole song play out.

1129
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,799
He like human jukebox.

1130
00:56:29,283 --> 00:56:30,740
My abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1131
00:56:30,964 --> 00:56:32,242
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i></font>

1132
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,626
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And if anybody ever complained,
she'd be like,</i></font>

1133
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:35,845
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Oh, ¿no te gusta Moz.</i></font>

1134
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:37,412
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know Chicanos,
we call him Moz.</i></font>

1135
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,327
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Then adios!</i></font>

1136
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,209
What can I say? We relate to his
melancholy ballads, you know?

1137
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,999
Lang!
Right, right, right, right, right.

1138
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,216
So anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,
and he starts working for Hank.

1139
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,209
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That's when he met Hope.</i></font>

1140
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,914
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And Hope's all like,
I want nothing to do with you.</i></font>

1141
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,395
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Look at my hairdo, I'm all business.</i></font>

1142
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:50,401
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then Scotty's like,</i></font>

1143
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:51,976
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i></font>

1144
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,096
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I'll probably never find love again,</i></font>

1145
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,376
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but damn if I want to kiss you!</i></font>

1146
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,576
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But then you fast forward and
they're all into each other, right?</i></font>

1147
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,431
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1148
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,936
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know what?
I can't tell you this</i></font>

1149
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,799
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America.</i></font>

1150
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:02,936
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then she said, I can't
believe you split like that!</i></font>

1151
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:04,034
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Smell you later, dummy.</i></font>

1152
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,616
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1153
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,256
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all like,</i></font>

1154
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,553
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Damn! I thought Hope coulda been
my new true partner, but I blew it!</i></font>

1155
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,900
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But fate brought them back together.</i></font>

1156
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:12,998
And then Hope's heart is all

1157
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,706
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm worried that I can't trust him</i></font>

1158
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,496
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!</i></font>

1159
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
And then my heart is all like,

1160
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,966
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i></font>

1161
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:21,254
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and we're days away from
going out of business.</i></font>

1162
00:57:21,711 --> 00:57:22,542
Out of business?

1163
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,518
Days away?

1164
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:24,720
Damn truth serum!

1165
00:57:24,722 --> 00:57:26,194
And you know,
I was trying to protect you guys.

1166
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:26,876
I swear to God.

1167
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,960
And you know, I was trying to be
a good boss but we're broke!

1168
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1169
00:57:30,122 --> 00:57:31,096
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1170
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,444
That's terrible bossing!

1171
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:33,400
Damn, bro!

1172
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,590
That's on me! That's on me!
Hey!

1173
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,799
Enough.

1174
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,228
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1175
00:57:42,865 --> 00:57:44,034
Where is Scott Lang?

1176
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,376
I've been trying to tell you, he's in
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1177
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,420
Emotionally speaking.

1178
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,918
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1179
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,280
The woods.
The woods?

1180
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,280
Baba Yaga!

1181
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,159
What do you mean, the woods?

1182
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,484
The Muir Woods, the second fire road
off the Panoramic Highway!

1183
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,716
For God's sake!

1184
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,399
♪ <i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i> ♪

1185
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,791
♪ <i>Little children, sleepy tight</i> ♪

1186
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,420
Damn it!

1187
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,068
If that freak gets Pym's tech
I'm never gonna see it.

1188
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,343
So, what do we do now?

1189
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,960
It's easier to steal it from the Feds
than from the boogeyman.

1190
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,997
Hey, it's me.

1191
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:27,353
How'd you like to get a promotion?

1192
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,230
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1193
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,096
But you gonna have
to take them down now,

1194
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,673
because they aingt gonna be
there for long.

1195
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,090
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1196
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,893
Understood.

1197
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,914
Good news, gentlemen.

1198
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:44,334
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1199
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,209
What are you looking at?
Change my tires!

1200
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Right.

1201
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,009
Sir.

1202
00:58:51,276 --> 00:58:52,442
Can you knock?

1203
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,467
Sorry, sir.

1204
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:55,958
But I just got a lead.

1205
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,700
I love leads.

1206
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,040
System's in the green.

1207
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,593
Priming the coils.

1208
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,124
Full charge.

1209
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,496
As soon as the tunnel's open
let us know if you get anything

1210
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,616
that could be a part of her message.

1211
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,860
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1212
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,234
Ok, then.

1213
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:24,396
Here it goes.

1214
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,753
We did it!

1215
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,794
You got anything?

1216
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nothing.

1217
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,490
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could

1218
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,174
No.

1219
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,341
No, no, no, no!

1220
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
What's happening?

1221
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,399
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1222
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:58,758
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1223
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,816
Then what else could it be?

1224
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,061
I don't know!

1225
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:09,350
Scott, what are you doing?
Scott, get away from that!

1226
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,240
Scott, you can't...

1227
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,040
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1228
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,491
I need to fix the algorithm.

1229
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,670
Trust me, after 30 years down here,

1230
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,513
I've thought about it a lot.

1231
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,196
Janet?

1232
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,240
Hi, honey.

1233
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,200
Jellybean.

1234
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,055
Mom?

1235
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,799
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1236
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,313
It's all so rushed.

1237
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,890
You two have done such great work.

1238
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,017
You just need a little...

1239
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,795
nudge.

1240
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,955
Janet, how is this possible?

1241
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:08,368
It wasn't a message you put
in Scott's head.

1242
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,308
It was an antenna.

1243
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,739
Clever girl.

1244
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:12,717
I'm so proud of you.

1245
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,285
Honey, tell us where you are.

1246
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,059
Tell us how to find you.

1247
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,048
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1248
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,625
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1249
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,240
You have to follow my voice.

1250
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,623
Of course!

1251
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,398
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1252
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,178
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies,

1253
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,116
between point two and point nine.

1254
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,694
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1255
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,256
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1256
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,773
Look at us squabbling again.

1257
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,435
Fine. Alright, between three and seven.

1258
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,864
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1259
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:04,566
Bullseye.

1260
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:05,875
Source lock.

1261
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:07,290
It's you.

1262
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:09,727
We got it!

1263
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,471
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1264
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,855
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1265
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,470
It's very dangerous,

1266
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:18,646
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1267
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,360
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1268
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,780
You have two hours.

1269
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,896
After that, the probability fields will
shift and it'll be another century

1270
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,354
before they align like this again.

1271
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:28,805
We'll find you.

1272
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,695
I know you will, Jellybean.

1273
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
Nope.

1274
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,521
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1275
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:47,928
Perfect.

1276
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,686
How did we get up here?

1277
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,716
Alright, first you're gonna see
all kinds of lights,

1278
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,136
and it's gonna get really trippy,

1279
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,986
but then it's gonna turn
black and silent.

1280
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:02,079
Really silent.

1281
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,565
Scott, I'll be fine.

1282
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,052
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1283
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:06,340
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1284
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,712
Sorry.
I have to take this.

1285
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

1286
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,140
No, I'm not, but you know what?
Ghost is.

1287
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,333
And you know what? The Feds,

1288
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,281
they know where you are.

1289
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,709
What?
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1290
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:21,256
They gave me some truth serum.

1291
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,218
And then all of a sudden
I started talking all honestly.

1292
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,076
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1293
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,429
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

1294
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:27,527
<i>But you need to go home,</i>

1295
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,016
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1296
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,181
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, ok?

1297
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,201
They don't go there!

1298
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,720
I feel like such a jerk.

1299
01:03:43,924 --> 01:03:46,451
You're gonna be really mad.
We got to go now.

1300
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:47,685
What?

1301
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,879
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1302
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:50,950
How?

1303
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,974
I told Luis where we are.
You what?

1304
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,278
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1305
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,540
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1306
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:56,612
Oh, my God!

1307
01:03:57,484 --> 01:03:59,060
Look, we need to land that account.

1308
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:00,160
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1309
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,557
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons
to find work these days?

1310
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,859
Jesus, Scott!

1311
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:06,981
Shit.

1312
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,760
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1313
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,876
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1314
01:04:16,878 --> 01:04:17,595
I know!

1315
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,059
I'm really sorry but the...

1316
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,139
FBI is coming to my place so...

1317
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,860
I have to go.

1318
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,599
Can I borrow the suit?

1319
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,660
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

1320
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,354
<i>Powering on.</i>

1321
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,238
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1322
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,877
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1323
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,599
Don't bother.
What?

1324
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:39,860
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1325
01:04:39,862 --> 01:04:41,062
as soon as we've found my mom.

1326
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,925
Hope
Scott, just go!

1327
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,678
Scott?
Daddy?

1328
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,750
It's us, buddy!

1329
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,271
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1330
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,676
He must be resting.

1331
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,110
Honey, why don't you go upstairs
and look under your bed?

1332
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,231
Daddy, you upstairs?

1333
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,633
Daddy?

1334
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
What the...

1335
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:21,251
He really lives like a pig these days.

1336
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,295
Daddy?

1337
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,068
Spread out!

1338
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,038
Again?

1339
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,660
You people have no shame!

1340
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,496
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1341
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1342
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:45,449
Cassie, let the man get by!

1343
01:05:45,523 --> 01:05:46,982
But Daddy's super sick!

1344
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:47,984
I'll see about that!

1345
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,102
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1346
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:51,724
Well, I'll take my chances sweetie.

1347
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:54,349
He barfed. Like a lot.

1348
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:55,918
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1349
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,412
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1350
01:05:59,098 --> 01:05:59,878
Like, a lot a lot?

1351
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,932
Yes!
Forget it, move aside!

1352
01:06:02,149 --> 01:06:03,149
No!

1353
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:10,904
What are you doing here?

1354
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:12,326
Scott.

1355
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:15,999
Sor... I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1356
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:17,819
I told you.

1357
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,251
Excuse me.

1358
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:21,122
Sometimes you got to just get it out.
You know?

1359
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:22,616
Sorry.

1360
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,197
I'll start the van.

1361
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,059
You get the lab.

1362
01:06:36,382 --> 01:06:38,460
<i>Freeze!
You're surrounded!</i>

1363
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:41,122
<i>Don't move.</i>

1364
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,414
Hank Pym.

1365
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,187
Hope Van Dyne.

1366
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,537
You're under arrest.

1367
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
This is harassment!

1368
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,796
Actually, it's not.

1369
01:07:01,015 --> 01:07:02,652
What does the FBI even stand for

1370
01:07:02,654 --> 01:07:05,010
Forever Bothering Individuals?

1371
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,547
His monitor check out?
Of course it does.

1372
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,157
Damn it!

1373
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:12,645
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1374
01:07:13,286 --> 01:07:15,583
We got them sir.
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1375
01:07:15,872 --> 01:07:17,772
Seriously? Yes!

1376
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:20,637
I'm sorry, Scott.

1377
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,398
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1378
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,820
I just really needed a win, you know?

1379
01:07:25,143 --> 01:07:26,719
Anyway, I'll be back later

1380
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,375
for the official end of your sentence!

1381
01:07:28,437 --> 01:07:30,147
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1382
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,017
You should feel great about yourself!

1383
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,967
What is it?

1384
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,104
We have a man down.
And Pym's lab is gone.

1385
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:08,732
Hey.

1386
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,558
Thanks for covering for me.

1387
01:08:12,781 --> 01:08:13,681
Sure.

1388
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
So...

1389
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,548
How long have you been
Ant-Man again?

1390
01:08:24,879 --> 01:08:26,013
Not long.

1391
01:08:26,712 --> 01:08:28,185
It just sort of happened.

1392
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,382
I'm sorry for lying to you,

1393
01:08:30,384 --> 01:08:32,194
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1394
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:33,304
Daddy, it's ok.

1395
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:34,307
It's not.

1396
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:37,030
I do some dumb things,

1397
01:08:37,032 --> 01:08:39,543
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1398
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:40,724
Mainly you.

1399
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,491
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1400
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:43,868
Well.

1401
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,237
I screw it up just about every time.

1402
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:50,338
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back,

1403
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:52,120
like a partner.

1404
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,896
Well, she's made it clear
that's about the last thing she wants.

1405
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,651
Who?

1406
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:56,868
Hope.

1407
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:01,438
Wait, who did you think?

1408
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,300
Me.

1409
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:03,472
You?

1410
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,472
Don't laugh.

1411
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:07,450
I'd be a great partner.

1412
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:09,029
Peanut.

1413
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:11,561
You would be awesome.

1414
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,431
And if I let you,
I would be a terrible dad.

1415
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:17,260
Fine.

1416
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,460
Then have Hope be your partner.
She's smart.

1417
01:09:22,334 --> 01:09:23,893
She reminds me of you.

1418
01:09:24,675 --> 01:09:26,032
You gonna go help her?

1419
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,316
I think you should help her.

1420
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,092
I wish I could but...

1421
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:33,999
I don't know how I could help her
without hurting you.

1422
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,246
You can do it.

1423
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,394
You can do anything.

1424
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,546
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1425
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,331
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1426
01:09:54,445 --> 01:09:56,690
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1427
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,662
You got somewhere else to be?

1428
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:09,004
Now, that's my girl.

1429
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,011
Alright, what's our plan?

1430
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,579
To shrink that wall.

1431
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,407
It looks load-bearing.

1432
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:23,758
The ceiling could collapse.

1433
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,084
Then we run like hell.

1434
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:27,796
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1435
01:10:27,798 --> 01:10:29,718
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1436
01:10:29,822 --> 01:10:31,142
They're all heavily armed.

1437
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:32,317
Not great odds.

1438
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,196
You got any better ideas?

1439
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,217
Nope.

1440
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,633
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1441
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,033
She'd be so proud of you.

1442
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,540
Ok.

1443
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,860
One.

1444
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,480
Two.

1445
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
Scott?

1446
01:10:57,151 --> 01:10:58,736
<i>What're you two
just standing around for?</i>

1447
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,194
We got to go find that lab.

1448
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,255
What about me?

1449
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:04,715
Perfect.

1450
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,640
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1451
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,434
Ok, now what?

1452
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,921
You're asking me?

1453
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,950
Get in!

1454
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,235
Hi.

1455
01:11:34,092 --> 01:11:34,947
Hi.

1456
01:11:37,907 --> 01:11:40,782
Excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon

1457
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:42,680
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other,

1458
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:44,617
until they start shooting at us?

1459
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,983
Yeah.

1460
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:52,863
Hey, Burch.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1461
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:53,917
Yeah, they're out.

1462
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,274
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1463
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
Her suit is missing and so is the van.

1464
01:12:01,602 --> 01:12:02,752
How could this happen?

1465
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:04,124
I mean, what the dickens?

1466
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:08,157
Thank you.

1467
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:10,438
You're welcome.

1468
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,295
So, how do we find the lab?

1469
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,320
After we lost it the first time,

1470
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:18,358
I put on a new tracker...

1471
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,793
of sorts.

1472
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,040
That'll work.

1473
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,359
Is it ready or not?

1474
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,395
We can begin
the extraction process now.

1475
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
Listen, Ava.

1476
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,659
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1477
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,800
Maybe. Maybe we should

1478
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,040
Maybe we should what?

1479
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:10,794
Wait?

1480
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,757
I've got days until I'm dead.

1481
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,433
We're doing this Bill.

1482
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:17,554
Now.

1483
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,592
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1484
01:13:23,658 --> 01:13:26,291
We don't have much time before
Mom's location shifts and we lose her.

1485
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,152
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1486
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,296
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1487
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,296
If you want to do something
right, you make a list.

1488
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,470
So, we should do that.

1489
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,791
One, we have to break into that lab.

1490
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,524
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1491
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,717
Three, we're gonna have
to fight Ghost.

1492
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,611
That seems like it should be part of 2.

1493
01:13:42,636 --> 01:13:44,994
2-A, alright?
Let's call it 2-A.

1494
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,514
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1495
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,656
Also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1496
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,080
is fully grown for you to come back.

1497
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:51,292
Otherwise, we're screwed.
Scott!

1498
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:52,716
You want me to start again?
I'll start again.

1499
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,359
I'm going to dive.

1500
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:58,760
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here,

1501
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,024
together,

1502
01:14:00,432 --> 01:14:01,847
protecting the tunnel.

1503
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,650
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1504
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,711
Let me get her.

1505
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,097
I think he's right.

1506
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,211
Whassup?

1507
01:14:23,478 --> 01:14:25,530
You don't remember,
that beloved commercial?

1508
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:27,932
Whassup?

1509
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,353
I had him follow us.

1510
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,599
I thought we could use some help.

1511
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:36,472
Alright.
I'm in position.

1512
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:37,869
The ants are headed in.

1513
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,039
<i>Copy that.</i>

1514
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,440
<i>Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.</i>

1515
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,136
Do you want Pez?
No.

1516
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,479
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1517
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,977
By the way, I love that suit!

1518
01:14:48,465 --> 01:14:49,538
Thanks, man.

1519
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,075
I wish I had a suit.

1520
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,876
I would even, I would even like,

1521
01:14:54,878 --> 01:14:57,160
a suit with minimal powers, you know?

1522
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,074
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1523
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,500
What is it?

1524
01:15:18,325 --> 01:15:19,437
Don't know.

1525
01:15:24,046 --> 01:15:25,162
It's them!

1526
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,180
They can't be far.

1527
01:15:50,623 --> 01:15:52,285
Hank. Hank?

1528
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,674
Dad, what's your status?

1529
01:15:57,036 --> 01:15:58,752
Foster's taken care of.

1530
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,479
Suiting up now.

1531
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,633
I just wanted to save Ava.

1532
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,540
She's facing death
or something far more terrible.

1533
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,734
She's afraid.

1534
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:14,253
I'll help you find a cure when I get back.

1535
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,770
I promise.

1536
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,695
Together, we'll figure something out.

1537
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,313
Good luck, Hank.

1538
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,439
Thanks, Bill.

1539
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,625
Now, I'm gonna need you to step back.

1540
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,711
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

1541
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,580
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

1542
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1543
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,076
No, nothing yet.

1544
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,032
Ava!

1545
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:06,148
Call off the ants, Scott.

1546
01:17:06,486 --> 01:17:07,197
Boy!

1547
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:32,073
Can I get a status report?

1548
01:17:32,075 --> 01:17:34,033
Because I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1549
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,020
Damn!

1550
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,592
Ready to dive.

1551
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:47,075
In case I don't make it
<i>Don't.</i>

1552
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,754
Don't say that.

1553
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,912
<i>I can't lose you too.</i>

1554
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,795
I love you Hope.

1555
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,738
Guys, everything's bad over here, please

1556
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,740
Now.

1557
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,889
Misdirection.

1558
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,782
One of the first things they teach you

1559
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,940
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1560
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:32,080
No!

1561
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,954
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1562
01:18:37,648 --> 01:18:39,216
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

1563
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,560
Ok, on my way!

1564
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:41,720
No.

1565
01:18:45,604 --> 01:18:46,400
Really?

1566
01:18:46,871 --> 01:18:47,998
This guy again?

1567
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:48,813
Who?

1568
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:51,054
I told you our business wasn't over.

1569
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:54,410
Change of plans.

1570
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Hang on.

1571
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,452
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1572
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Hold on.

1573
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,633
That undercarriage is filthy!

1574
01:19:37,023 --> 01:19:38,406
They got bigger problems.

1575
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,816
Hope, what're you doing?

1576
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,246
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1577
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,639
<i>Don't worry, I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.</i>

1578
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:49,644
Wait, what're you...

1579
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1580
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,634
We're gonna die!

1581
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,233
<i>Signal lost.</i>

1582
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,270
What the hell are they doing up there?

1583
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,974
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1584
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,898
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1585
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,183
You never said it was so beautiful, Scott.

1586
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,595
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1587
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,557
Ok, any time now.

1588
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,457
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1589
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,479
<i>Recalibrating.</i>
Come on.

1590
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,790
<i>Signal restored.</i>

1591
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,114
Bikes, it's all you.

1592
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,473
Take the wheel.
What? Wait!

1593
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,600
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1594
01:21:52,927 --> 01:21:54,234
Be careful up there!

1595
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,571
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1596
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,674
You got pezed!

1597
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
Up here!

1598
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:35,442
That's not good.

1599
01:22:39,698 --> 01:22:40,393
Hope!

1600
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,420
No!
No!

1601
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,220
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1602
01:22:53,222 --> 01:22:54,596
Get... Get, get the lab!

1603
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,811
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1604
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:10,264
Hope! Wait!

1605
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:12,240
Hey, what about me?

1606
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,515
We got you now, Ava!

1607
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,314
Not again!

1608
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,400
Piece of junk!

1609
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:58,466
Yes!

1610
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,233
Go, go, go, go, go!

1611
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:06,331
Burch got the lab.

1612
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,899
I'm going after him.

1613
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,820
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1614
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,892
Work in progress, my ass

1615
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,216
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

1616
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:41,848
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

1617
01:24:41,850 --> 01:24:42,655
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!

1618
01:24:42,657 --> 01:24:44,096
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

1619
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,720
<i>Warning, approaching quantum void.</i>

1620
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,952
I'm coming to you, honey.

1621
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,625
Guys.

1622
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,808
Don't you need the remote to the lab?

1623
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:09,257
I just found it.

1624
01:26:09,354 --> 01:26:10,570
We can't grow the lab without it.

1625
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,830
Get it to us fast.

1626
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,120
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1627
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,056
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1628
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
What?

1629
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,457
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1630
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,619
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1631
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:28,747
<i>You got to check the van!</i>

1632
01:26:37,173 --> 01:26:38,173
Awesome!

1633
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,336
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1634
01:27:06,338 --> 01:27:07,640
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

1635
01:27:07,735 --> 01:27:08,805
I'm on my way.

1636
01:27:08,858 --> 01:27:10,594
Luis. I'll get the lab.

1637
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,120
Hi.

1638
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,156
That's badass!

1639
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,995
Nice.

1640
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Doink!

1641
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,512
Come here, you little weasel!

1642
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,203
No, you don't!

1643
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,331
I guess maybe you do.

1644
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,176
Come on!

1645
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,154
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1646
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,996
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1647
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,120
Would you just one time,

1648
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,410
please work!

1649
01:28:21,507 --> 01:28:21,944
Yes!

1650
01:28:22,891 --> 01:28:24,007
Alright, I need help.

1651
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:25,986
Yes!

1652
01:28:27,973 --> 01:28:28,651
Sorry.

1653
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,361
Somebody!

1654
01:28:31,555 --> 01:28:31,928
Hey!

1655
01:28:32,296 --> 01:28:33,526
Come on, man!

1656
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:35,376
Not cool!

1657
01:28:36,035 --> 01:28:36,891
Murderers!

1658
01:28:38,985 --> 01:28:39,946
Yes, yes!

1659
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:45,078
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas!

1660
01:28:45,431 --> 01:28:46,751
You're a badass!

1661
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,565
Yes!

1662
01:28:51,148 --> 01:28:52,146
No, no, no!

1663
01:28:52,148 --> 01:28:54,000
Ant-onio!

1664
01:28:56,022 --> 01:28:57,678
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

1665
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,732
<i>dip in here to the San Francisco Bay</i>

1666
01:28:59,842 --> 01:29:01,785
<i>for a little leisure and a little breeding.</i>

1667
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,015
Listen Uzman

1668
01:29:03,117 --> 01:29:03,944
Just a...

1669
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:06,969
Just meet me at the waterfront.

1670
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:08,639
In three hours.

1671
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,758
<i>We've barely left the dock but
it looks like we got some company.</i>

1672
01:29:14,878 --> 01:29:16,441
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

1673
01:29:16,443 --> 01:29:18,236
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

1674
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,387
What the...

1675
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,089
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1676
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,151
It's ok. It's ok!

1677
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,507
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1678
01:29:33,648 --> 01:29:36,110
Hey! That doesn't belong to you!

1679
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:37,913
No, no! No, no!

1680
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:39,119
You're embarrassing yourself now.

1681
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,794
Come on. Let go.
No!

1682
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
Thank you.

1683
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,019
I'll take this now.

1684
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,319
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

1685
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,680
<i>A message in your head.</i>

1686
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,190
<i>I had a dream.</i>

1687
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,033
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

1688
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,776
<i>It's where I hid every time
that we played.</i>

1689
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,836
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

1690
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,635
Daddy?

1691
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,435
Daddy?

1692
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,279
Dad?
What's going on?

1693
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,893
Why haven't you found Mom?

1694
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,160
You look lost, Hank.

1695
01:30:50,585 --> 01:30:51,693
Are you alright?

1696
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,004
Still think you have all the answers, Hank?

1697
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,098
It's me.

1698
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,676
I'm so sorry

1699
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:12,701
it took so long.

1700
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,542
No.

1701
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,552
No.

1702
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,734
You're here now.

1703
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,545
Let's go home.

1704
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,480
I thought I was gone.

1705
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:28,989
But that energy from your hands

1706
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,834
how did you do that?

1707
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:36,460
I'm not the same woman
I was 30 years ago, Henry.

1708
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,880
This place...

1709
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,957
it changes you.

1710
01:32:42,907 --> 01:32:44,570
Adaptation is part of it but,

1711
01:32:44,728 --> 01:32:45,804
some of it is...

1712
01:32:46,518 --> 01:32:47,524
evolution.

1713
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,161
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

1714
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,915
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

1715
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,112
I should probably tell you
what we're dealing with up there.

1716
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,821
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1717
01:33:02,823 --> 01:33:05,289
Move.
Move.

1718
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,012
Move!

1719
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,032
Get out of the way.

1720
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,690
Let's go.

1721
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,070
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

1722
01:33:22,131 --> 01:33:24,965
<i>It's got to be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

1723
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,235
Get out of the way!

1724
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:34,514
I got the lab.

1725
01:33:34,515 --> 01:33:35,390
The lab.

1726
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:39,318
The air feels chunky.

1727
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,879
No. He's too big.

1728
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,679
Scotty!

1729
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:46,808
Scott!

1730
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,832
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1731
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,727
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1732
01:33:52,164 --> 01:33:53,678
I just need five minutes.

1733
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,036
Five minutes!

1734
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,535
You get the lab somewhere safe.

1735
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,046
Scott's air won't last.

1736
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:06,965
Ok.

1737
01:34:22,344 --> 01:34:23,032
Move!

1738
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:23,883
Move!

1739
01:34:24,322 --> 01:34:24,999
Move!

1740
01:34:28,051 --> 01:34:29,051
No, wait!

1741
01:34:40,437 --> 01:34:42,276
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

1742
01:34:42,603 --> 01:34:43,334
They did it.

1743
01:34:43,336 --> 01:34:44,616
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

1744
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,339
Let's go see our daughter.

1745
01:35:08,778 --> 01:35:09,627
Scott!

1746
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,265
Scott!

1747
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:14,771
Scott, come on, wake up!

1748
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:29,809
Come on.

1749
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:31,459
Come on, where are you Scott?

1750
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,114
Gotcha.

1751
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,106
Scott?

1752
01:35:47,153 --> 01:35:47,840
Hey.
Hey.

1753
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,014
Hey, Scotty!

1754
01:35:52,243 --> 01:35:53,253
Hope, come in.

1755
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,332
Did you get crushed by the building?

1756
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:58,437
Scot...

1757
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,240
Where's the remote, Luis?

1758
01:36:01,021 --> 01:36:02,424
It's probably in there.

1759
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,540
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1760
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,639
I guess this is where we say...

1761
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,470
Adiós, amigo.

1762
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,219
No, no, no, no!

1763
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:15,359
Thanks, guys.

1764
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
Ava?

1765
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,400
Ava!

1766
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,126
Ava!

1767
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,919
Almost ready for extraction.

1768
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,151
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1769
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,935
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1770
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,372
What if Hank is right?

1771
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,199
What if this process kills Janet?

1772
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:40,938
What, you're worried about her?

1773
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,415
All I'm saying is that
she is a brilliant scientist.

1774
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:44,478
She may be able to help.

1775
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:45,661
She will help now.

1776
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:46,852
Right now!

1777
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,912
And if she dies, she dies!

1778
01:36:48,913 --> 01:36:50,007
No. No.

1779
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:51,924
I'm sorry, we can't do this.

1780
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,152
We have to find another way.

1781
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,812
This is the way.

1782
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,158
Janet!

1783
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,660
She started the extraction.

1784
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,393
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1785
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,758
No!

1786
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:20,990
Hope!

1787
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,510
Are you ok?

1788
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,233
Mom?

1789
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,360
Oh, my God.

1790
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,873
We found you.

1791
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,873
I missed you so much.

1792
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,594
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1793
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,480
It's ok.

1794
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,431
I'm... I'm here now.

1795
01:39:26,706 --> 01:39:27,947
We have time.

1796
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,711
No more last-minute business trips, ok?

1797
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,056
I promise.

1798
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,460
No, it's ok!

1799
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,393
It's alright.
Just don't worry about me.

1800
01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:39,071
I'll be fine.
Dad.

1801
01:39:44,476 --> 01:39:45,290
Scott.

1802
01:39:46,205 --> 01:39:47,343
Miss Van Dyne.

1803
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,355
It's nice to...

1804
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:52,592
Well, I guess we've already met.

1805
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,478
Yeah.

1806
01:39:54,003 --> 01:39:55,004
I guess we have.

1807
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,280
No wait.

1808
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,994
Your pain.

1809
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,100
I can feel it.

1810
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,935
It hurts.

1811
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,078
It always hurts.

1812
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,274
I'm sorry.

1813
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,071
I think I can help you.

1814
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,463
Did you know she could do that?

1815
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,315
It's ok.

1816
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,500
Guys, the cops are coming!

1817
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,257
The cops are coming.

1818
01:41:19,482 --> 01:41:20,898
Like, all of them!

1819
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:23,322
I got to go.
We got to go!

1820
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,609
What about them?

1821
01:41:29,426 --> 01:41:30,317
Hands in the air!

1822
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,816
No! No, no, no.
We are going to our jobs.

1823
01:41:32,818 --> 01:41:34,894
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1824
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,597
So, so we apprehended them.

1825
01:41:36,739 --> 01:41:38,236
For you. You're welcome.

1826
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,472
We traffic in stolen technology.

1827
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,518
And we have killed many,
many people.

1828
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,160
He's in charge.

1829
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,454
That's true, I am.

1830
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,343
I've also committed numerous health
code violations in my restaurant.

1831
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,355
Some of them would shock you.

1832
01:41:55,018 --> 01:41:56,813
It is truth serum.

1833
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,693
We got to get outta here.

1834
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:03,884
Fast.

1835
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,799
I have an idea.

1836
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,668
<i>Giant figure, now spotted
at the intersection of</i>

1837
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:10,474
<i>Broadway and Laguna.</i>

1838
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,556
<i>All units move in.</i>

1839
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,760
Go, go!

1840
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,551
There he is!

1841
01:42:23,043 --> 01:42:24,180
It's over, Scotty!

1842
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,057
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

1843
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,210
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1844
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,502
There's nowhere to hide.

1845
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,538
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's ok!

1846
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,629
Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself!

1847
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:46,876
Magic.

1848
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,720
Damn it!

1849
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,133
Get to Lang's, now!

1850
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,602
Well done, honey.

1851
01:43:01,453 --> 01:43:02,435
Let's go!

1852
01:43:10,752 --> 01:43:11,932
Leave me here.

1853
01:43:12,037 --> 01:43:13,053
We can make it.

1854
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,437
You said it yourself.

1855
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,072
I've hurt people.

1856
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,307
But you haven't.

1857
01:43:19,796 --> 01:43:21,058
Go. Please!

1858
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,775
We can make it, Ava.

1859
01:43:23,255 --> 01:43:24,126
Bill.

1860
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,739
I'm not leaving you.

1861
01:44:10,862 --> 01:44:11,644
Hey, guys.

1862
01:44:12,533 --> 01:44:14,018
Are my two years up already?

1863
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,435
What's it like out there?

1864
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:23,934
I mean,

1865
01:44:24,746 --> 01:44:25,920
do people still dance?

1866
01:44:26,704 --> 01:44:28,211
Are food trucks still a thing?

1867
01:44:28,898 --> 01:44:31,227
Well, you got away with it
this time Scott but...

1868
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:33,263
I'll be seeing you again.

1869
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:34,962
Where?

1870
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:38,861
Where will you be seeing me again?

1871
01:44:39,851 --> 01:44:40,491
Like...

1872
01:44:41,549 --> 01:44:44,217
in general or see like
the next time you...

1873
01:44:44,242 --> 01:44:46,106
do something bad I'll be there

1874
01:44:46,679 --> 01:44:47,233
to catch you.

1875
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,819
You'll be watching in...
Yes.

1876
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:49,788
Yes.

1877
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:51,320
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1878
01:44:52,344 --> 01:44:53,649
Why would I do that?

1879
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:55,978
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that? Like a...

1880
01:44:56,175 --> 01:44:58,118
Like a party or like,
dinner or something?

1881
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,199
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1882
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,536
No I meant I'll arrest you

1883
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,840
I'll arrest you later again.

1884
01:45:02,842 --> 01:45:03,840
Take it easy, Jimmy.
Ok.

1885
01:45:06,019 --> 01:45:07,336
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1886
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,211
I mean, because I'm free...

1887
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,700
Yeah. Come on.

1888
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,351
You ready?

1889
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,520
Yeah!

1890
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,198
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

1891
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,458
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1892
01:45:32,642 --> 01:45:33,642
X-Con Security.

1893
01:45:35,061 --> 01:45:36,061
Mr. Karapetyan?

1894
01:45:36,868 --> 01:45:37,868
Yeah, you saw that?

1895
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:41,814
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1896
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,478
I'll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM. Ok.

1897
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,200
Yeah!

1898
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,831
That's how you close a deal!

1899
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,819
This is awesome.

1900
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,040
So Cassie,

1901
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,993
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1902
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,932
I wanna help people,

1903
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,656
like my dad.

1904
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,560
Really?

1905
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,559
I wanted to be his partner.

1906
01:46:31,853 --> 01:46:33,412
But he said he wants you.

1907
01:46:34,335 --> 01:46:35,530
Is that so?

1908
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,354
Daddy!

1909
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Hold on.

1910
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,158
Move, get outta here!

1911
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,160
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1912
01:46:51,256 --> 01:46:51,961
Gross!

1913
01:46:52,457 --> 01:46:54,733
I hate that moth dust!

1914
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:55,723
Go!

1915
01:46:59,488 --> 01:47:01,976
By <font color="#ff80ff">L</font><font color="#ff6aff">E</font><font color="#ff5bff">S</font><font color="#ff3cff">A</font><font color="#ff15ff">I</font><font color="#f200f2">G</font><font color="#e100e1">N</font><font color="#cc00cc">E</font><font color="#bb00bb">U</font><font color="#ae00ae">R</font>
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections May 2020</i></font>

1916
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,357
I used to be a respected scientist.

1917
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,134
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1918
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,036
Now, I got this.

1919
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,959
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1920
01:49:16,532 --> 01:49:17,397
This is...

1921
01:49:18,111 --> 01:49:19,077
smaller.

1922
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,127
Sorry.

1923
01:49:22,655 --> 01:49:23,303
My bad.

1924
01:49:24,402 --> 01:49:25,701
I think it has flair.

1925
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,438
Alright. Control's online.

1926
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,351
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1927
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,415
It should automatically start
absorbing quantum healing particles.

1928
01:49:38,748 --> 01:49:41,440
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1929
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,960
They're cute, but they'll eat you.

1930
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:45,272
And don't get sucked into a time vortex.

1931
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,820
We won't be able to save you.

1932
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,320
Ok.

1933
01:49:51,917 --> 01:49:53,571
Going subatomic in five.

1934
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,380
Four.

1935
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,840
Three.

1936
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,380
Two.

1937
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,020
One.

1938
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,500
Alright Scott, this is a mic check.

1939
01:50:10,612 --> 01:50:12,888
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

1940
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,469
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

1941
01:50:15,471 --> 01:50:16,734
Scott, we read you.

1942
01:50:16,741 --> 01:50:18,426
I just wanna make sure.

1943
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,156
Ok.

1944
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,174
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1945
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,016
<i>Great.</i>

1946
01:50:29,196 --> 01:50:30,700
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

1947
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,760
<i>five, four, three</i>

1948
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,128
Hello?

1949
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,667
Very funny.

1950
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,234
Hank, quit screwing around.

1951
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,456
You told me yourself
