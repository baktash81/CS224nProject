185
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:52,129
What this book presupposes is...
maybe he didn't.

186
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,399
Let me ask you something.

187
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,498
Why would a review
make the point of saying

188
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,701
someone's not a genius?

189
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,974

not a genius?

00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,538

00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,016
You didn't even have
to think about it, did you?

192
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,543
Well, l just don't use
that word lightly.

194

206
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,185
You need to eat something.

207
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,593
May l make you dinner?

208
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,597
No, thank you.

she was a smoker, which she
had been since the age of12.

230
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,731
My goodness.

231
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,569

regarding l.40
slash l.9 adjustments...

273
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:14,199

( calculator clicking )

278
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:27,243
lt would probably be
advantageous

279
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,248
for your marital status

280
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,783
to be legally established
as single

281
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:33,250
in light of the circumstances.

What do you mean?

283
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:36,455
l mean for tax purposes.

284
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,456
But l thought...

285
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,253
.Etheline...
.Yes?

286
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,986

she had had many suitors...

293
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:04,510
...but had not considered
a single one until this moment.

294
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,145
This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

295
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:11,350
That's true, uh...

296
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,223
l don't know why
l put it that way.

297
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,053

298
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:26,196

Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

306
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:46,889
Who is it, Frederick?

307

309
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,598
What do you got?

310
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,569
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

311
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:01,531
No shit?

312
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,337
What did Ethel say?

313
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,776
She think about it.

314
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,775
l don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

315
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,842
l mean... Lord knows

316
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:17,617
l've had my share
of infidelities

317
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,091
but she's still my wife.

318
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,856
And no damn two.bit,

320
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:37,239
Hi.

321
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:45,078
Hey, Pagoda,

322
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,244

Chas?

326
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,028
What's going on?

327
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,628
We got locked out
of our apartment.

328
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,003
Did you call a locksmith?

329
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,167
Uh.huh.

330
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,574
Well, l don't understand.

331
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,976
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

332
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:15,139
or how did you...?

333
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,672
lt's not safe over there.

334
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,811
Excuse me for a moment.

335
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,886
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:25,913
The apartment.

337
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,823
l have to get
some new sprinklers

338
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,124
and a backup
security system installed.

339
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,325
But there are
no sprinklers here, either.

340
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:36,426
Well, we might have
to do something about that, too.

341
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:42,568
Okay.

342
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,701

00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,742
Feels like we're camping.

When are we going home?

346
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,582
Huh?

347
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,583

You know what?

360
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,102
l think l'm going
to sleep in here with you.

361
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,373
That way...

362
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,404
( grunts )

363
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,814

* Oh. *

367
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,701
What kind of side effects
can be expected?

368
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,669
Well, there are
a number of possibilities.

369
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,603
Severe nausea and dizziness
are standard.

370
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,540
A certain percentage of patients
may also experience seizure.

371
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:52,408
You mean, like flopping around
on the floor and everything?

372
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,242
ln some cases.

373

375
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,584
You have a visitor, my darling.

MARGOT:
Who is it?

377
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:06,148
lt's me, sweetie.

Raleigh says you've been
spending six hours a day

380
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,807
locked in here,
watching television

381
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,206
and soaking in the tub.

382
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,870
l doubt that.

383
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,936
l don't think that's
very healthy, do you?

384
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,743
Nor do l think
it's very intelligent

385
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:32,546
to keep an electrical gadget
on the edge of the bathtub.

386
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,382
l tie it to the radiator.

387
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,684
Well, it can't be very good
for your eyes, anyway.

388
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:52,032
Chas came home.

389
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,471
What do you mean?

390
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:56,873
He and Ari and Uzi
are going to stay

391
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,207
with me for a little while.

392
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,908
Why are they allowed
to do that?

393
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,575
l don't know exactly

394
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,484
but l think he's been
very depressed.

395
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,112
So am l.

396
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,486
So are you, what?

397
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:13,549
But why is this necessary?

398
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:16,823
'Cause l'm in a rut,
and l need a change.

399
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:19,023
Hang on.

552

553
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,148
My wife.

554
00:28:58,183 --> 00:28:59,445
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

555
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,611
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

556
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:10,121
Uh, l'll be right back.

557
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:11,220

558
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:14,354
Chas.

559
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,193
Can l see my grandsons?

560
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,861
Why?

561
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:23,136
Because l finally want
to meet them.

562
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,540
( sighing )

563
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,373
Don't give me that guff.

564
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,581
l think we'll pass.

565
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,453
Pagoda...

566
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,459
where's my Havelina?

567
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:45,487
l'll say good.night
to you now, children.

568
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,895
Dad.

569
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,997

grizzly bear.

574
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,252
Hello, Ethel.

575
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,590
Good evening, sir.

576
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:18,562
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

577
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,155
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

578
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:21,392
Hey, lay it on me, man.

579
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:22,457
How do you do?

580
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,526
Not too well. l'm dying.

581

( upbeat music playing

582
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:28,266
How's Richie?

583
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,068
l don't know.

584
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,803
l can't tell.

585
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,367
Yeah, me neither.

586
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:35,379
He wrote me a letter.

587
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,643
He says he's
in love with you.

588
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,377
What are you talking about?

589
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,909
That's what he said.

590
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:46,151
l don't know how
we're supposed to take it.

591
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,283
Hang on.

592
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:50,384

MAN:
Hello.

595
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,698
Sugar, it's Eli.

596
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,226
Hey, baby, give me a second.

597
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,000
What are we doing, Eli?

598
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,269
Oh, l just got to pick
something up.

599
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,168
Don't repeat that, by the way.

600
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:08,236
About Richie.

601
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,716
lt was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

602
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,744
( lock buzzes )

603
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,050
Good.

604
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,490
Now just remove the loose soil

605
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:25,428
and note the
decomposition levels.

606
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,397
l'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

607
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,593
Don't be silly.

608
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,261
Come on.

609
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,897
l just want to apologize
for the other day

610
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,406
when l proposed to you.

611
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,407
Why?

612
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,806
l thought it was very sweet.

613
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:40,606
l know l'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

614
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,135
you've been involved with.

615
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,013
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright,

616
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,381
and your ex.husband.

617
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:47,715
Oh, that's ridiculous.

618
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,413
But, but, l feel...

619
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:52,287
l can offer
just as much as them.

620
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,917
l know l went about it
backwards, but...

621
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,452
Henry, l have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

622
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,293
or Doug Cartwright..
l never did..

623
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,094
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

624
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,567
Henry?

625
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,004
Henry, are you all right?

626
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,031
Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine.

627
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:14,534
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

628
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,514
Henry, wait a second.

629
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,508
l'm sorry, l'm very nervous.

630
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:23,282
Th.That's okay.

631
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,716
Oh, thank you.

632
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,252
Why are you so nervous?

633
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,231
Well, to tell you the truth

634
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:39,601
l haven't slept
with a man in 18 years.

635
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:41,629
* Dah.dah.dum *

636
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,136
* Dah.dah, dah.dah, dah,

637
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:56,310

00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:16,736
* Lah.dah.dah.dah.dah,

642
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,242

643
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,975
* Dah.dah, dah.dah.dah.dah... *

644
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:30,281
* Dah, dah.dah.dah,

645
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:41,526

646
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:42,931
* Dah.dah, dah.dah... *

647
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,595
That's a hell of an old
hound dog you got there.

648
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,695
What's he go by?

649
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,103
Buckley.

650
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,970
Buckley, sit.

651
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,503
You know who l am?

652
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:57,605
l'm Royal.

653
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,207
Have you heard of me?

654
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,182
l'm very sorry for your loss.

655
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:05,917
Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

656
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,083
Thank you.

657
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,990
Which one are you?

658
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,221
Ari.

659
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:11,956
Uzi, l'm your granddad.

660
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,224
Hello.

661
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,892
l'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

662
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,993
l don't get invited around
very much.

663
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:20,334
What do you think of that,
by the way?

664
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,634
Oh, you...

665
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,732
you don't have to say anything.

666
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:27,142
lt's kind of a ''fuck you''
to the old man, l guess.

667
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,543
How's your daddy?

668
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,547
Fine.

669
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:30,548
You think so, huh?

670
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,413
How often has he got you
working out?

671
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,350
16 times a week.

672
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,454
Do me a favor.

673
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,012
Tell him you want to meet me.

674
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,614
But we just met.

675
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,681
No, we didn't.

676
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,250
Look, l'd like us to have
a relationship

677
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:46,695
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

678
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:49,928
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

679
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,095
ARl:
Well, l bet
Mom would have wanted us

680
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,570
to meet him before he died.

681
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:54,697
Wouldn't she?

682
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,138
Don't you think?

683
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,780
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

684
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,157
l wouldn't know.

685
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:17,718
Excuse me. Come on.

686
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:18,854
Oh, that's right.

687
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,865
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

688
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:21,888
Uh, hold on.

689
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,203
Take some of these.

690
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:29,435
Come on.

691
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,773
So what do you think
of this big, old black buck

692
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:36,872
moving in up there?

693
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,507
Who?

694
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,744
Henry Sherman.

695
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:40,944
You know him?

696
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,384
Yeah.

697
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,251
ls he worth a damn?

698
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,987
l believe so.

699
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,262
What happened to your finger?

700
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,267
Uzi, shh.

701
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,268
lt's okay, l'll tell you.

702
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:58,733
l'm adopted. Did you know that?

703
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,338
Well, l am.

704
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:04,637
When l was 14, l went to find
my real family.

705
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,904
They live in lndiana.

706
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:08,777
All right, now, just set one
of them hickory trunks

707
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,781
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

708
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,749
( gasps )

709
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,151
Did you try to sew it back on?

710
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,753
Wasn't worth it.

711
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:34,202
Hell of a damn grave.

712
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,731
Wish it were mine.

713
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,106
lt's a shame, isn't it?

714
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,440
What?

715
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:43,072
Well, you probably had another
good two or three years

716
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,581
of competitive play in you.

717
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,776
Probably.

718
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,412
l had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

719
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:51,718
Financially and personally.

720
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:55,817
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

l don't know, Jim.

728
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,772
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

729
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,043
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

730
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:19,913
and... actually,
l think he's crying.

731
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,646
COMMENTATOR:
l think you're right.

732
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,211
Who's he looking at
in the friends' box, Tex?

733
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,155
HAYWARD:
That's his sister, Margot

734
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,181
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

735
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:30,194
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

736
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,752
COMMENTATOR:
Oh, yes.

737
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:34,591
( crowd reacts )

738
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:40,166
COMMENTATOR:
l've never seen anything
like this.

739
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,104
HAYWARD:
Neither have l.

740
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,473
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

741
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,070
l kind of disappeared
after that, didn't l?

742
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:50,080
Yeah.

743
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:53,083
But l understood.

744
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,382
l know you're not very good
with disappointment.

745
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:04,160
You still got that little BB

746
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,460
in your hand, Chassie?

747
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,365
( chuckling softly )

748
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,629
Why did you shoot me?

749
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:17,538
lt was the object
of the game, wasn't it?

750
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,872
No.

751
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,378
We were on the same team.

752
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,471
Were we?

753
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:26,745
Well... you sued me.

754
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,809
Twice. Got me disbarred.

755
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:31,720
l don't hold it
against you, do l?

756
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:32,780
And how is it possible

757
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,758
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

758
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,419
without your written
authorization?

759
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,951
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, l...

760
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:40,021
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

761
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:42,225
Because l started the
corporation when l was a minor.

762
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,892
So, my father
was the primary signatory

763
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,232
on most of my accounts.

764
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,361
He also stole bonds

765
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,929
out of my safety deposit box
when l was 14.

766
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,169
( chuckles uncomfortably )

767
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:55,338
You think you could
start forgiving me?

768
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:02,314
Why should l?

769
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,321
Because you're hurting me.

770
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,421
Come on.

771
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,092
Were you in prison?

772
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,097
Kind of.

773
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,689
Minimum security.

774
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:17,200
l got jacked by the lRS.

775
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:18,532
Should we split?

776
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:19,536
Yes, sir.

777
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,197
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

778
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,536
Okay.

779
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,201
No, l'm kidding; call me Pappy.

780
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,870
Okay.

781
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:30,574
Come on, let's shag ass.

782
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,048
Well, just let me know

783
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,551
if you need somebody
to talk to, okay?

784
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:36,143
l like Raleigh very much.

785
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,519
l know he's a lot older
than you are

786
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,888
and you two are having
some problems

787
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:42,984
but... anyway,
maybe l can help.

788
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:44,756
Okay. Thanks.

789
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:47,663
Hey, Baumer! All right!

790
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,762
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

791
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:56,137
By the way, l heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

792
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,913
You dropped some cigarettes.

793
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,246
Those aren't mine.

794
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:09,717
They just fell
out of your pocket.

795
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,658
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

796
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,403
Come in.

797
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,469
Did you tell Margot

798
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:38,744
about that letter
l wrote to you?

799
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:40,944
Why? Did she mention it?

800
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,545
( sighing )

801
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:46,250
Yes, l did.

802
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,157
Why would she
have repeated that, l wonder?

803
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:51,923
Well, l would ask you
the same question.

804
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:54,989
Rightly so.

805
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,341
What'd you say?

806
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,003
Hmm?

807
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:08,409
What?

808
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,812
l didn't say anything.

809
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,975
When? Right now?

810
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,589
l'm sorry; don't listen to me.

811
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:20,921
l'm on mescaline.

812
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,926
l've been spaced out all day.

813
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,928
( cork pops )

814
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:26,987
Did you say you're on mescaline?

815
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:28,965
l did, indeed.

816
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,195
Very much so.

817
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,635
How often do you, uh...?

818
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,400
l'm worried about you, Richie.

819
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,373
Why?

820
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:40,275
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

821
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:41,676
But l did find it odd

822
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,442
when you said
you were in love with her.

823
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:49,547
She's married, you know.

824
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,282
Yeah.

825
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:53,721
And she's your sister.

826
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:56,192
Adopted.

827
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,601
Where are my encyclopedias?

828
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,004
They've been placed in storage.

829
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,906
Well, damn you.
You're taking my encyclopedias.

830
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,570
.Th.this is humiliating.
.l'm sorry.

831
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,602
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

832
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:16,772
Where am l supposed to go?

833
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,247
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

834
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,214
l'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

835
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,912
.at another hotel.
.You son of a bitch.

836
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,250
Frederick.

837
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,254
Hello there, Dusty.

838
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,915
Hello.

839
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,754
Could you spot me a quarter?

840
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,589
Of course.

841
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,926
Richie? Hi.

842
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,057
lt's your dad.

843
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,427
l think he's very lonely...

844
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:42,268
lonelier than he lets on

845
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,104
maybe lonelier
than he even realizes.

846
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:47,906
Have you spoken
to him about this?

847
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,072
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

848
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:52,480
l'm sorry, maybe l'm
a little confused here.

849
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:53,813
What are you suggesting?

850
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:56,149
That he come here
and stay in my room.

851
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:58,712
Are you out of your mind?

852
00:42:58,756 --> 00:43:00,121
No, l'm not.
Anyway, l think that

853
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:02,352
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

854
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,325
Who gives a shit?

855
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:04,988
l do.

856
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:06,223
You poor sucker.

857
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,596
You poor, washed.up papa's boy.

858
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:10,123
SHERMAN:
All right, let's not
get out of hand.

859
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,658
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

860
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:13,829
This is a family matter.

861
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,032
Don't talk to him like that.

862
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:17,768
.Call me Henry.
.l prefer Mr. Sherman.

863
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:19,366
Call him Henry.

864
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,809
Why? l don't know him
that well.

865
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:22,176
You've known him for ten years.

866
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:23,874
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

867
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:25,212
Where are you going to sleep?

868
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,910
l'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

869
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:28,350
We brought our sleeping bag...

870
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,353
Uzi!

871
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:30,752
ARl:
We don't mind, Dad.

872
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:31,755
We like him.

873
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:32,778
UZl:
Who, Pappy?

874
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:33,790
''Pappy''?

875
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,689
He can sleep in
the room above us.

876
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,250
Ari, it's not your decision.

877
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,592
Nor is it yours.

878
00:43:38,629 --> 00:43:40,324
Well, he's already up there.

879
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,428
What?!

880
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:45,696
l think he's asleep

881
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:47,863
because of the medication
he's on

882
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:51,705
but l... l guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

883
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:54,939
if Mom says it's okay.

884
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,405
( monitorbeeping )

885
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,015
Get out.

886
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,114
( grunting ):
All right.

887
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,785
Let me just collect my things.

888
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:10,794
( groans )

889
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:13,490
Would you mind handing me
my cane, Richie?

890
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:15,226
Let me see,
where's my suitcases?

891
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,630
l'll get 'em.

892
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:17,895
Oh, thanks.

893
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,562
( grunting ):
Oh!

894
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:20,797
Dad!

895
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,135
( groans )

896
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,140
Mom!

897
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,972
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

898
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,807
Are you okay?

899
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,779
What the fuck you care?

900
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:31,714
ETHELlNE:
Oh, my goodness.

901
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:33,808
ROYAL:
Pagoda?

902
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,250
Call Doctor McClure.

903
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:37,583
( monitor flatlines )

904
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,952
( moans )

905
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,958
Take a breath and hold it.

906
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,256
( inhales )

907
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:44,259
Now cough.

908
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:46,694
( coughs weakly )

909
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:50,127
His condition is stable.

910
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:52,533
The attack was
just a side effect.

911
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,562
l recommend you push fluids

912
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:58,006
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

913
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,033
( pagerbeeping )

914
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:06,146
CHAS:
Can we move him?

915
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,151
Absolutely not.

916
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:10,312
For how long?

917
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,185
We'll have to wait and see.

918
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:14,054
ls he going to be all right?

919
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,082
That depends. ls he a fighter?

920
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:17,617
Yeah.

921
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,458
Then that's the best we've got.

922
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:24,525
Pagoda's in possession

923
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,661
of a parcel containing
my will

924
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,105
and some instructions
for the funeral

925
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,234
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

926
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:33,573
Proofread it for me

927
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,943
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

928
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,641
Okay.

929
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:41,139
l never did stop loving you,
by the way.

930
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,447
Do you believe that?

931
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:44,078
Not really.

932
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,681
You look terrific.

933
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:48,453
That dress is stunning.

934
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,483
Thanks.

935
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:12,773
( acoustic guitarplays
soft, slow melody )

936
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:15,615
* Tears that angels cry... *

937
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,348
( loud slurping )

938
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:21,051
* And the dark
and all the sky... *

939
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,458
Lights out, old man.

940
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:27,021
l thought l'd read
for a while, Chas.

941
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,862
Sorry. 1 1 :30. Lights out.

942
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,834
l'm right in the middle
of a sentence.

943
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,202
Well, you'll have to finish it
in the morning.

944
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:36,399
Them's the rules.

945
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,408
Chas?

946
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:42,211
Good night, my boy.

947
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,409
* When the one you love
says good.bye *

948
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:51,717
* Sing a lullaby *

949
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:55,589
* Dee.dee.dee,
dee.dee, dee.dee *

950
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:59,926
* Dee.dee.dee, dee.dee,
dee.dee... *

951
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:02,728
Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?

952
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:05,735
He's your dad, too, Chas.

953
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:07,327
.No, he's not.
.Yes, he is.

954
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:09,202
You really hate me,
don't you?

955
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,832
No. l don't. l love you.

956
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,501
Well, l don't know
what you think

957
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,479
you're going to get out of this

958
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:19,642
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

959
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:23,984
Chas...

960
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:26,182
l don't want to hurt you.

961
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:28,885
l know what you and the boys
have been through.

962
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:30,860
You're my brother,
and l love you.

963
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,692
Stop saying that!

964
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:50,644
What's that jackass doing?

965
00:47:54,418 --> 00:47:56,909
l know you, asshole!

966
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:10,365
Did Eli send you that?

967
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:12,198
Mm.hmm.

968
00:48:12,236 --> 00:48:15,205
He always sends me
his clippings.

969
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:18,037
What for?

970
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,305
l think he just likes
the encouragement.

971
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:21,675
He's done it for years.

972
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:24,044
He used to send me
his grades in college.

973
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:25,207
( sighs )

974
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:26,876
That's ridiculous.

975
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,249
( tapping )

976
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:37,720
How long do you intend
to stay here?

977
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:40,059
l don't know.

978
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:43,225
Are you ever coming home?

979
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:47,067
Maybe not.

980
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,572
You're joking.

981
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,599
No.

982
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:57,273
Well, l want to die.

983
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:04,011
Raleigh, please...

984
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:06,215
Have you met someone else?

985
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,360
l couldn't even begin
to think about

986
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:13,386
knowing how to answer
that question.

987
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:22,133
ROYAL:
l don't like the way
you're treating Raleigh.

988
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,210
What are you talking about?

989
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:28,734
You don't even know him.

990
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,679
Well, l've met him,
and l don't think he deserves...

991
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,774
Stay out of it.

992
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:36,877
You're two.timing him
with that bloodsucker

993
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,821
Eli Cash.

994
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:42,826
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

995
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,919
You used to be a genius.

996
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:50,131
No, l didn't.

997
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,999
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

998
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:03,703
RALElGH:
Richard, l know you're
terribly close to Margot

999
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:05,942
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

1000
00:50:05,983 --> 00:50:08,952
May l confide in you?

1001
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:12,080
( sighs )

1002
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:15,751
Okay.

1003
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,284
l believe
she's having an affair.

1004
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:21,761
l'm utterly devastated.

1005
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:25,428
l... don't know
where else to turn.

1006
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,597
Will you advise me?

1007
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:29,765
l don't know.

1008
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,104
What do you want to do?

1009
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,267
l don't know.

1010
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:33,435
Perhaps, uh...

1011
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:34,944
Find the guy and get him?

1012
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,673
Well, no,
l thought we could...

1013
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:43,116
Who do you think it might be?

1014
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:46,486
l don't know at the moment.

1015
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,985
CHAS:
Let's look
at the actuals, okay?

1016
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,053
l agree with you
a hundred percent.

1017
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:55,292
That's why we have
marketing grids.

1018
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:56,890
ROYAL:
Hey.

1019
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:58,799
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokyo

1020
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,394
and get some fireworks?

1021
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:02,234
What do you need?

1022
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,500
Nothing.

1023
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,941
l see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

1024
00:51:06,977 --> 00:51:10,572
Please don't
come in this room.

1025
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,104
Chas has those boys cooped up

1026
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:14,083
like a pair ofjackrabbits,
Etheline.

1027
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:15,585
He has his reasons.

1028
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:16,916
Oh, l know that

1029
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:20,253
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

1030
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:23,588
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

1031
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:27,256
l think that's terrible advice.

1032
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:31,256
No, you don't.

1033
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,735
ARl:
We take boxing
and self.defense classes.

1034
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:35,830
l'm not talking
about dance lessons.

1035
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,738
l'm talking about
putting a brick

1036
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,766
through the other guy's
windshield.

1037
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:44,076
l'm talking about taking it out
and chopping it up.

1038
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:45,843
What do you mean?

1039
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:47,282
* The mama pajama
rolled out of bed *

1040
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:48,443
( all yelling )

1041
00:51:48,485 --> 00:51:50,009
* And she ran
to the police station *

1042
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:54,114
* When the papa found out,
he began to shout *

1043
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:56,854
* And he started
the investigation *

1044
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,020
* lt's against the law *

1045
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,187
Go!

1046
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:00,287
* lt was against the law *

1047
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,695
( all laughing )

1048
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:04,360
* What the mama saw,
it was against the law *

1049
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,528
( chuckling )

1050
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,334
* The mama looked down
and spit on the ground *

1051
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:11,864
* Ev'ry time my name
gets mentioned *

1052
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:14,343
* The papa said,
''Oy, if l get that boy *

1053
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,506
* l'm gonna stick him
in the house of detention'' *

1054
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:19,641
* Well, l'm on my way *

1055
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:22,117
* l don't know where l'm goin' *

1056
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:23,847
* l'm on my way *

* But l don't know where *

1059
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:30,759
* Goodbye to Rosie,
the Queen of Corona... *

1060
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,421
Come here.

1061
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:33,930
* See you, me and Julio *
.That's it! Run!

1062
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:35,761
* Down by the schoolyard *

1063
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:39,792
* See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard. *

1064
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:43,973

1066
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,445
( giggling )

1067
00:52:58,489 --> 00:52:59,956
Whoo.hoo!

1068
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,685
Yippee!

1069
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,721
He saved my life, you know.

1070
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:09,391
30 years ago, l was
knifed in a bazaar
in Calcutta.

1071
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:12,061
He carried me
to the hospital on his back.

1072
00:53:12,102 --> 00:53:13,228
( chuckling )

1073
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,238
Who stabbed you?

1074
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:16,398
He did.

1075
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,237
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

1076
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:21,403
and he was a hired assassin.

1077
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:24,903
Stuck me right in the gut
with that. Shoot.

1078
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:26,245
( all yelling )

1079
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:29,252
( dogs barking, snarling )

1080
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,755
CHAS:
Hey!

1081
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:38,283
What?

1082
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,260
Where have you been?

1083
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:43,960
Uh, we just stepped out
to get some air.

1084
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,599
What's that?

1085
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:47,763
Holy shit.

1086
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,271
That's not...?

1087
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:51,604
What is that?

1088
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,110
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

1089
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,441
Come here.

1090
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:56,673
What?

1091
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,052
You stay away from my children.

1092
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:04,383
Do you understand?

1093
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:06,321
My God, l haven't been
in here for years.

1094
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:07,880
Hey! Are you listening to me!

1095
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,415
( yelling ):
Yes, l am!

1096
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:12,019
l think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

1097
00:54:12,062 --> 00:54:13,723
l don't think you recovered

1098
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:15,061
from Rachael's death.

1099
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:16,588
l...

1100
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:20,593
( doorslams )

1101
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:30,269
There you are.

1102
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:34,948
( chuckling )

1103
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:44,257
How are you feeling?

1104
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:46,091
l'm having a ball.

1105
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:49,428
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

1106
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:52,128
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

1107
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:56,606
l want to thank you
for raising our children

1108
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,608
by the way.

1109
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:00,769
Okay.

1110
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:03,041
l'm not kidding.

1111
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,048
You always put them first,
didn't you?

1112
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:06,709
l tried to.

1113
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,719
Lately l feel like maybe
l didn't do such a great job.

1114
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,221
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

1115
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:14,187
l'm the one that failed them.

1116
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,215
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

1117
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:17,726
Plus, that.. it doesn't...

1118
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:20,730
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

1119
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:23,733
Why didn't you care?

1120
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,064
l don't know.

1121
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,764
l'm ashamed of myself.

1122
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:33,235
l'll tell you
one thing, though...

1123
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:36,245
you got more grit, fire and guts

1124
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:39,248
than any woman
l have ever met.

1125
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:41,409
What... what are you
smiling about?

1126
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:42,918
Nothing.

1127
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,420
No, wha... what's so funny?

1128
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:45,580
Nothing.

1129
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:48,090
lt's these little
expressions of yours.

1130
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,252
l don't know
what you're talking about

1131
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:52,625
but l'll take it
as a compliment.

1132
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:57,096
You're true blue, Ethel.

1133
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,295
You really are.

1134
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,037
How's your love life?

1135
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:06,702
None of your business.

1136
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:09,234
( chuckling )

1137
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:14,706
( hoots )

1138
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,221
l'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

1139
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:19,620
if you don't mind.

1140
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:23,387
l don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

1141
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:24,894
Well, l'd agree

1142
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:28,056
if l thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

1143
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:30,089
but l don't.

1144
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:34,168
Well, l hope you're right.

1145
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:39,904
Actually, l don't believe
l'll join you tonight.

1146
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:42,935
l'll call you in the morning.

1147
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,817
She said that?

1148
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:54,085
( chuckling )

1149
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:56,422
Great.

1150
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,089
Got the sucker on the ropes.

1151
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,428
( Royal chuckles softly )

1152
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:19,354
Can l ask you something, Hank?

1153
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:25,830
Okay.

1154
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:29,441
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

1155
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:32,606
l beg your pardon?

1156
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:34,636
You heard me, Coltrane.

1157
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:36,615
Coltrane?

1158
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:38,344
What?

1159
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:40,181
Did you just call me ''Coltrane''?

1160
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,447
No.

1161
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:42,579
You didn't?

1162
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:44,852
No.

1163
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:47,086
Okay.

1164
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:48,991
( clears throat )

1165
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:50,689
But if l did...

1166
00:57:52,331 --> 00:57:55,300
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

1167
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:56,995
You don't think so?

1168
00:57:57,036 --> 00:57:58,526
No, l don't.

1169
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,765
Listen, Royal

1170
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,500
if you think
you can march in here...

1171
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:02,803
You want to talk some jive?

1172
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:05,174
l'll talk some jive.

1173
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,838
l'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

1174
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:08,244
.Oh, yeah?
.Right on!

1175
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:09,839
.Sit down.
.What?!

1176
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:10,849
Wh.what did you say?

1177
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:11,941
l said sit down, goddamn it!

1178
00:58:11,984 --> 00:58:13,713
Oh, l heard you!
l want you out of my house!

1179
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:14,878
This is not your house!

1180
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,286
l want your raggedy ass out!

1181
00:58:16,322 --> 00:58:17,584
Don't talk semantics with me.

1182
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:18,590
Oh, this is not your...

1183
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:20,387
What's going on here?

1184
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,417
Nothing.

1185
00:58:25,665 --> 00:58:28,225
Mmm.

1186
00:58:36,609 --> 00:58:39,772
( whirring andpumping )

1187
00:58:43,716 --> 00:58:46,048
( no audio )

1188
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:49,316
Hello, l'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure.. yes..

1189
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:51,152
at Colby General.

1190
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,681
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

1191
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:55,694
Hmm...

1192
00:58:55,728 --> 00:58:59,755
ls that a Tic.Tac?

1193
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:04,064
( foreboding organ music plays )

1194
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:05,570
( knock on door)

1195
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:09,473
( recorded sitarmusic playing )

1196
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:12,273
How much is he paying you?

1197
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:16,247
l don't know what
you're talking about.

1198
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:19,012
Well, l grew up with the
Tenenbaum family, you know.

1199
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:20,075
Right.

1200
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,245
Across the street.

1201
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:22,515
Mm.hmm.

1202
00:59:22,555 --> 00:59:24,716
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

1203
00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:26,691
l can't say no.

1204
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:28,387
This is bullshit.

1205
00:59:28,427 --> 00:59:29,724
Change it, huh?

1206
00:59:32,165 --> 00:59:34,429
What did you do to your hand?

1207
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:37,368
Uh, nothing.

1208
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:41,632
ROYAL:
Can we get somebody over here

1209
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:43,835
to kill these mice for us?

1210
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:45,901
No. They belong to Chas.

1211
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:48,607
Or anyway, he invented them.

1212
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:51,048
Well, get him to stick them
in a fucking cage

1213
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,551
or something.

1214
00:59:53,586 --> 00:59:56,987
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

1215
00:59:57,023 --> 00:59:59,548
What's cooking, Pops?

1216
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:01,753
You'll see.

1217
01:00:01,828 --> 01:00:02,624
Now, your previous novel...

1218
01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:03,959
Yes. Wildcat.

1219
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:04,985
Right.

1220
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:07,295
Not a success.

1221
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:08,960
Why?

1222
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:17,704
Well, Wildcatwas written
in a kind of obsolete

1223
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,801
vernacular...

1224
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:25,280
( whispers ):
Wildcat...

1225
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:27,980
Wild... cat...

1226
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:32,881
( quietly imitates gunshots )

1227
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:34,893
Wildcat...

1228
01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:38,160
l'm going to go.

1229
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:40,427
l'm taking this off
and l'm going.

1230
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:41,728
Stepping out.

1231
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:44,600
What the hell
kind of way to act is that?

1232
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:46,002
ELl:
Open the door.

1233
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:47,130
He's on drugs.

1234
01:00:47,173 --> 01:00:50,336
l'll be right back.

1235
01:00:52,478 --> 01:00:53,740
James Bradley...

1236
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,711
Hold on a minute, please.

1237
01:00:55,748 --> 01:00:56,942
What's going on?

1238
01:00:56,983 --> 01:00:59,451
Pagoda has something to say.

1239
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:06,617
He has a cancer.

1240
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:08,957
No, he doesn't.

1241
01:01:08,995 --> 01:01:11,020
l know what stomach cancer
looks like.

1242
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:12,655
l've seen it.

1243
01:01:12,698 --> 01:01:15,064
And you don't eat

1244
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:18,628
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

1245
01:01:18,671 --> 01:01:20,002
The pain is excruciating.

1246
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,973
How would you know?

1247
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:23,999
My wife had it.

1248
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:28,343
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure at Colby General

1249
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:30,508
there is no Colby General.

1250
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:33,074
lt closed in 1974.

1251
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,677
Aw, shit, man.

1252
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,711
Oh, shit, man.

1253
01:01:39,759 --> 01:01:41,522
( Chas grunts )

1254
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,621
( dialing rotaryphone )

1255
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:48,830
Yes, can you send a taxi

1256
01:01:48,868 --> 01:01:50,597
to 1 1 1 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

1257
01:01:50,636 --> 01:01:51,603
Thank you.

1258
01:01:51,637 --> 01:01:52,695
( slams receiver)

1259
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:03,139
l guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

1260
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,480
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

1261
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:07,076
Of course he was.

1262
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,552
No, well, yeah, he was

1263
01:02:08,587 --> 01:02:10,953
but, l mean,
he wasn't that involved.

1264
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:13,788
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

1265
01:02:13,826 --> 01:02:16,351
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favor.

1266
01:02:16,395 --> 01:02:20,161
l did some malpractice work
for him.

1267
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:23,100
l do have
high blood pressure, though.

1268
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:29,206
Look, l know l'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

1269
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:32,608
But l just want to say,
the last six days have been

1270
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:35,546
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

1271
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:37,947
NARRATOR:
lmmediately after
making this statement

1272
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:40,475
Royal realized
that it was true.

1273
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:48,994
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1274
01:02:49,028 --> 01:02:52,293
What was the point?

1275
01:02:52,331 --> 01:02:54,595
l thought l could win you back.

1276
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:58,569
And then l thought l could
get rid of Henry...

1277
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:01,198
and at least keep
the status quo.

1278
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,901
But we hadn't spoken
in seven years.

1279
01:03:02,942 --> 01:03:04,273
l know.

1280
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:07,943
Plus, uh...

1281
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,312
l was broke.

1282
01:03:11,717 --> 01:03:14,151
And l got kicked out
of my hotel.

1283
01:03:14,186 --> 01:03:16,984
You're a bastard.

1284
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:19,685
Good.bye, Royal.

1285
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:35,297
Take it easy
on those boys, Chassie.

1286
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,333
l don't want this
to happen to you.

1287
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,518
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

1288
01:03:50,556 --> 01:03:52,524
has had a profound effect
on me.

1289
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:55,493
l.l feel like a different
person, l really do.

1290
01:03:55,528 --> 01:04:00,124
Dad, you were never dying.

1291
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:04,299
But l'm going to live.

1292
01:04:14,513 --> 01:04:17,311
He's not your father.

1293
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:20,216
Neither are you.

1294
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:42,230
( taxi engine idling )

1295
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:47,505
( dropping bags )

1296
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:54,613
You son of a bitch!

1297
01:04:54,653 --> 01:04:56,985
God.... damn...

1298
01:04:59,758 --> 01:05:02,124
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

1299
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:08,930
( groans )

1300
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:15,797
The 375th Street Y, please.

1301
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:19,534
( grunts )

1302
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:33,416
Everyone's against me.

1303
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:35,393
lt's your fault, man.

1304
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:39,158
Yeah, l know, but damn it,
l want this family to love me.

1305
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,392
How much money you got?

1306
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:41,694
l don't have.

1307
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,530
What, you're broke?

1308
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,969
You got to be kidding me.

1309
01:05:46,005 --> 01:05:48,098
How are we going to pay
for this room?

1310
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:53,368
All right,
we'll think of something.

1311
01:05:55,314 --> 01:05:56,872
Ow.

1312
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:09,085
( singing quietly )

1313
01:06:12,464 --> 01:06:14,261
( sighing )

1314
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,896
l'm not in love
with you anymore.

1315
01:06:18,938 --> 01:06:21,532
l didn't know you ever were.

1316
01:06:21,574 --> 01:06:23,201
Let's not make this
any more difficult

1317
01:06:23,242 --> 01:06:25,005
than it already is.

1318
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:29,843
Okay.

1319
01:06:29,882 --> 01:06:32,680
Okay, what?

1320
01:06:32,718 --> 01:06:36,677
Okay, l'm not in love
with you, either.

1321
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:40,419
Yes, l know;
you're in love with Richie

1322
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:42,757
which is sick and gross.

1323
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:50,361
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

1324
01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:52,632
and your grades from college?

1325
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,701
Please stop belittling me.

1326
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:08,311
You never gave me
the time of day

1327
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:10,720
till l started getting
good reviews.

1328
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:13,725
Your reviews aren't that good.

1329
01:07:13,792 --> 01:07:16,090
But the sales are.

1330
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,430
( shutter clicks )

1331
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:27,368
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

1332
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:30,432
Very little, l'm afraid.

1333
01:07:30,476 --> 01:07:32,410
Would you like
to examine the report?

1334
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:34,912
Yes.

1335
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:45,886

She smokes.

1359

Yes.

1360
01:09:05,304 --> 01:09:06,464
All right, well.

1361
01:09:06,505 --> 01:09:08,700
Everything seems
to be in order.

1362
01:09:08,741 --> 01:09:11,710
l'll contact you
in the next 24 hours.

1363
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,244
l appreciate that.

1364
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:16,645
Uh, which way are you leaning,
by the way?

1365
01:09:16,682 --> 01:09:18,047
l'll inform you of my decision

1366
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,209
at the appropriate time.

1367
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:20,616
l get it.

1368
01:09:20,652 --> 01:09:23,052
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word
for us, will you?

1369
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:24,487
l already did.

1370
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:31,921
You want to play some word games

1371
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,728
or do some experiments
on me or anything?

1372
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,758
No.

01:09:38,904 --> 01:09:40,735

Dudley, where is he?

1404
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,129
Who?

1405
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:55,335
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

1406
01:11:55,374 --> 01:11:57,706
and then l'll come back
to check on him.

1407
01:11:57,743 --> 01:11:59,074
All right?

1408
01:12:03,081 --> 01:12:05,606
How are you feeling?

1409
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:07,312
Fine, thanks.

1410
01:12:07,352 --> 01:12:09,786
Are you in any pain?

1411
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:11,152
Not really.

1412
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:12,486
Why'd you try
to kill yourself?

1413
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:14,151
Don't press him right now.

1414
01:12:14,192 --> 01:12:16,490
l wrote a suicide note.

1415
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:17,927
You did?

1416
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:19,260
Yeah.

1417
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,290
Right after l regained
consciousness.

1418
01:12:24,202 --> 01:12:25,965
Can we read it?

1419
01:12:26,004 --> 01:12:27,164
No.

1420
01:12:27,205 --> 01:12:30,333
Can you paraphrase it for us?

1421
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,969
l don't think so.

1422
01:12:33,011 --> 01:12:35,104
ls it dark?

1423
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:36,512
Of course it's dark.

1424
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:37,947
lt's a suicide note.

1425
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:39,473
All right, that's enough.

1426
01:12:39,518 --> 01:12:41,315
Doctor said to let him sleep.

1427
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,715
What?!

1428
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:52,697
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?

1429
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:54,358
Yes. Yes, Royal.

1430
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:09,143
You've made a cuckold of me.

l'm sorry.

1434
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:21,822
And you nearly killed
your poor brother.

1435
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,988
ETHELlNE:
What's he talking about?

1436
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:27,658
lt doesn't matter.

1437
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:30,827
She's balling Eli Cash.

1438

ETHELlNE:
Oh, my goodness.

1439
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:38,509
May l have a cigarette?

1440
01:13:38,543 --> 01:13:41,671
What?

1441
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:45,171
Shall l repeat the question?

1442
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,344
You don't smoke.

1443
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,377
l know that.

1444
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,222
( sighs )

1445
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:03,329
And a light.

1446
01:14:10,942 --> 01:14:13,001
Au revoir.

1447
01:14:22,354 --> 01:14:26,154
ETHELlNE:
How long have you been
a smoker?

1448
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:28,751
22 years.

1449
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:32,263
Well, l think you should quit.

1450
01:14:36,868 --> 01:14:38,802
( door opens )

1451
01:14:41,473 --> 01:14:43,703
How can l help?

1452
01:14:45,544 --> 01:14:48,707
Let me look at these forms.

1453
01:15:01,226 --> 01:15:03,160
Oh, Henry.

1454
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:12,469
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1455
01:15:12,504 --> 01:15:13,630
NURSE:
Your name?

1456
01:15:13,672 --> 01:15:14,798
Royal Tenenbaum.

1457
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,968
l'm afraid visiting hours
are over, sir.

1458
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,876
Wh.Wh.What does it say there..
they don't want me?

1459
01:15:20,912 --> 01:15:22,072
l.l'm sorry.

1460
01:15:22,114 --> 01:15:23,479
l have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

1461
01:15:23,515 --> 01:15:25,779
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

1462
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:28,915
( mumbles )

1463
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:41,489
We could shimmy up
that gutter

1464
01:15:41,533 --> 01:15:43,467
jump over that window ledge

1465
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:46,665
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

1466
01:15:46,705 --> 01:15:48,502
There he is.

1467
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,802
Richie!

1468
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,544
Richie.

1469
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,174
Where's he going?

1470
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:01,883
Richie!

1471
01:16:12,164 --> 01:16:13,756
Well, l have to say

1472
01:16:13,799 --> 01:16:16,791
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

1473
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:20,134
Attempted, anyway.

1474
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,662
Thanks.

1475
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,641
* Please *

1476
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:27,167
* Give me second grace *

1477
01:16:31,116 --> 01:16:33,050
* Please *

1478
01:16:33,084 --> 01:16:35,917
* Give me a second face *

1479
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:42,823
* l've fallen far down *

1480
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:47,059
* The first time around *

1481
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:51,501
* Now l just sit on the ground
in your way *

1482
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:02,703
( on recordplayer):
* Now *

1483
01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:04,977
* lf it's time
for recompense *

1484
01:17:05,016 --> 01:17:06,347
* For what's done... *

1485
01:17:06,384 --> 01:17:08,352
MARGOT:
Who's there?

1486
01:17:08,386 --> 01:17:10,718
* Come *

1487
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:14,019
* Come sit down
on the fence in the sun... *

1488
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:15,458
Hello?

1489
01:17:16,494 --> 01:17:21,158
* And the clouds will roll by *

1490
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,861
* And we'll never deny.. *

1491
01:17:23,902 --> 01:17:26,564
( needle lifts from record )

1492
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:28,596
( tent flap opens )

1493
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:35,012
W.What are you doing in my tent?

1494
01:17:35,046 --> 01:17:38,277
Just listening to some records.

1495
01:17:38,316 --> 01:17:41,046
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

1496
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:43,281
l checked myself out.

1497
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:58,870
( rock intro playing
on organ )

1498
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,710
How many stitches did you get?

1499
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:10,542
l don't know.

1500
01:18:10,582 --> 01:18:12,209
You want to see?

1501
01:18:14,286 --> 01:18:18,518
* They seem to stay
for day after day *

1502
01:18:18,556 --> 01:18:19,648
* And won't disappear... *

1503
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:20,919
Jesus.

1504
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:22,927
* l tried every way... *

1505
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:26,954
Richie, that looks horrible.

1506
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:30,627
l heard about your ex.husband.

1507
01:18:30,669 --> 01:18:31,693
Desmond?

1508
01:18:31,736 --> 01:18:32,725
l guess so.

1509
01:18:32,837 --> 01:18:34,702
l didn't get his name.

1510
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:36,070
Yeah.

1511
01:18:36,107 --> 01:18:38,541
l met him in the ocean.

1512
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:39,736
l was swimming

1513
01:18:39,811 --> 01:18:42,678
and he came out to me
in a canoe.

1514
01:18:42,714 --> 01:18:44,909
We were only married
nine days.

1515
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,713
And l heard about Eli.

1516
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:48,013
l know.

1517
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:52,717
Poor Eli.

1518
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:56,124
Anyway, they mostly
just talked about you.

1519
01:18:56,161 --> 01:18:58,925
They did?

1520
01:18:58,964 --> 01:19:01,728
Yeah.

1521
01:19:01,766 --> 01:19:06,863
l guess that was the attraction,
if you know what l mean.

1522
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:11,001
* She smiled sweetly *

1523
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:14,102
* She smiled sweetly *

1524
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,511
* And says don't worry... *

1525
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:18,675
l have to tell you something.

1526
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:20,685
What's that?

1527
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,381
l love you.

1528
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:30,221
l love you, too.

1529
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:36,731
* There's no use tryin' *

1530
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:39,361
* You're here *

1531
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:43,738
* Begin again *

1532
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:46,107
* And o'er again *

1533
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:53,206
* That's what she said
so softly... *

1534
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:55,879
l can't stop thinking
about you.

1535
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,185
l went away for a year,
and it only got worse

1536
01:19:59,224 --> 01:20:01,215
and l don't know
what to do.

1537
01:20:01,259 --> 01:20:05,218
Let's lie down for a minute.

1538
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:09,667
( sighs )

1539
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:11,692
* She smiled sweetly *

1540
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,170
* She smiled sweetly... *

1541
01:20:14,205 --> 01:20:16,366
This is the sleeping bag

1542
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:19,343
we took to the museum,
isn't it.

1543
01:20:19,377 --> 01:20:22,346
Mm.hmm.

1544
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,678
* Oh, no, no, no... *

1545
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:26,684
Why'd you do it?

1546
01:20:26,718 --> 01:20:29,516
Because of me?

1547
01:20:29,554 --> 01:20:32,717
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

1548
01:20:35,393 --> 01:20:37,361
( song ends )

1549
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:41,195
You're not going
to do it again, are you?

1550
01:20:41,232 --> 01:20:42,859
l doubt it.

1551
01:20:44,669 --> 01:20:47,399
* She would never say *

1552
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:50,169
* Where she came from... *

1553
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:53,735
( crying quietly )

1554
01:20:53,778 --> 01:20:57,270
* Yesterday don't matter *

1555
01:20:57,315 --> 01:20:59,613
* lf it's gone *

1556
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:05,489
* While the sun is bright *

1557
01:21:07,358 --> 01:21:10,327
* Or in the darkest night *

1558
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:12,158
* No one knows... *

1559
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:14,062
l think we're just going
to have to be

1560
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:15,691
secretly in love with each other

1561
01:21:15,767 --> 01:21:17,291
and leave it at that, Richie.

1562
01:21:21,806 --> 01:21:25,572
* Good.bye, Ruby Tuesday *

1563
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:30,343
* Who could hang a name
on you? *

1564
01:21:30,381 --> 01:21:34,841
* When you change
with every new day *

1565
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:37,912
* Still l'm gonna miss you... *

1566
01:21:37,956 --> 01:21:40,015
Lobby floor.

1567
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:43,186
( song continues
softly in background )

1568
01:21:43,228 --> 01:21:44,217
Thank you, sir.

1569
01:21:50,235 --> 01:21:52,032
Going up?

1570
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,367
Yeah.

1571
01:21:53,404 --> 01:21:54,701
What floor, sir?

1572
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:56,730
Doesn't matter.

1573
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:06,140
So, you're
elevator operators now?

1574
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:07,344
Yeah, just started.

1575
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:09,353
We'll get a bump as soon
as we join the union.

1576
01:22:09,387 --> 01:22:10,979
( song fades out )

1577
01:22:11,022 --> 01:22:13,320
What made you decide
to do that?

1578
01:22:13,358 --> 01:22:15,053
We're broke.

1579
01:22:15,093 --> 01:22:18,187
But in answer to your question

1580
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:19,287
l wanted to prove

1581
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,820
l could pay my dues,
and whatnot.

1582
01:22:20,865 --> 01:22:24,357
l just hope
somebody notices.

1583
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:30,000
You asked me
why l choked out there that day.

1584
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:31,531
l think l may know the answer

1585
01:22:31,576 --> 01:22:32,975
and l wanted your advice.

1586
01:22:34,012 --> 01:22:36,412
Sure.

1587
01:22:43,888 --> 01:22:45,515
Margot Tenenbaum?

1588
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:46,524
Yeah.

1589
01:22:46,558 --> 01:22:48,526
Well, since when?

1590
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,358
Since always.

1591
01:22:51,396 --> 01:22:52,522
Does she know?

1592
01:22:52,564 --> 01:22:54,031
Uh.huh.

1593
01:22:54,065 --> 01:22:57,364
Well, what does she feel
about that?

1594
01:22:57,402 --> 01:22:59,029
l think she feels confused.

1595
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:00,196
Well, l can understand that.

1596
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:01,705
lt's probably illegal.

1597
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:03,070
l don't think so.

1598
01:23:03,107 --> 01:23:05,302
We're not related by blood.

1599
01:23:05,343 --> 01:23:07,140
That's true.

1600
01:23:07,178 --> 01:23:09,305
Still frowned upon.

1601
01:23:09,347 --> 01:23:12,510
But then, what isn't
these days, right?

1602
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:23,258
l don't know, maybe it works.

1603
01:23:23,294 --> 01:23:24,488
Why not, what the hell.

1604
01:23:24,529 --> 01:23:25,996
You love each other.

1605
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:29,124
Nobody knows
what's going to happen, so...

1606
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,634
You know something.

1607
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:34,497
Don't listen to me.

1608
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:36,564
l never understood her myself.

1609
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,599
l never understood any of us.

1610
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:40,338
l wish l could tell you
what to do

1611
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:42,539
but l just can't.

1612
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:45,239
That's okay.

1613
01:23:45,283 --> 01:23:48,514
No, it's not.

1614
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:51,852
You still consider me
your father?

1615
01:23:51,889 --> 01:23:55,518
Sure, l do.

1616
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,360
l wish l had more to offer
in that department.

1617
01:23:59,397 --> 01:24:02,389
l know you do, Pop.

1618
01:24:08,172 --> 01:24:10,163
l don't blame you, by the way.

1619
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:12,506
Uh, she's a
great.looking girl

1620
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:13,976
and smart as a whip.

1621
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,445
Mordecai.

1622
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:23,319
* Stephanie says
that she wants to know *

1623
01:24:23,354 --> 01:24:27,814
* Why she's given
half her life *

1624
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:32,091
* To people she hates now... *

1625
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,325
Holy shit.

1626
01:24:34,365 --> 01:24:37,334
You came back.

1627
01:24:37,368 --> 01:24:38,528
Jiminy crickets.

1628
01:24:38,569 --> 01:24:41,834
That damn bird must
have radar in its brain.

1629
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:43,170
ls that true, Mordecai?

1630
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:45,175
l.l'm not so sure
this is Mordecai.

1631
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:46,335
What do you mean?

1632
01:24:46,377 --> 01:24:47,674
He flew right in here.

1633
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:50,078
This bird has much more
white feathers on him.

1634
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:55,948
Oh, the son of a bitch
must be molting.

1635
01:24:55,987 --> 01:24:58,683
Oh. l need your help
with something else.

1636
01:24:58,723 --> 01:25:00,384
You got it.
What's the situation?

1637
01:25:00,425 --> 01:25:02,120
Well, um, l think Eli maybe...

1638
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,650
Hold it.

1639
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:06,286
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.

1640
01:25:06,331 --> 01:25:07,593
Let's hit it.

1641
01:25:07,632 --> 01:25:09,657
( shoves lever,
elevatorspeeds up )

1642
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:12,930
l didn't mean right this second,
but... that's okay.

1643
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:15,632
l don't think it was Ramses.

1644
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:17,038
l believe
it was Tootinkamen.

1645
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:18,201
Tutankhamen.

1646
01:25:18,242 --> 01:25:19,470
Tutankhamen?

1647
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,670
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1648
01:25:20,712 --> 01:25:22,680
( knock at door)

1649
01:25:22,714 --> 01:25:25,478
( ''Rock the Casbah''
playing in background )

1650
01:25:25,516 --> 01:25:27,677
Yes?

1651
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:34,058
Hey, Richie.

1652
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:43,898
We want to take you
to get some help.

1653
01:25:45,837 --> 01:25:47,828
ls it just you guys?

1654
01:25:47,872 --> 01:25:50,102
ROYAL:
Would you

1655
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:51,233
excuse us, please?

1656
01:25:53,711 --> 01:25:55,804
Okay.

1657
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:04,246
( turns music off)

1658
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,313
Are we still friends?

1659
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,285
What do you think?

1660
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:10,453
Are we?

1661
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:11,621
Of course.

1662
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:13,630
How can you even ask me that?

1663
01:26:13,664 --> 01:26:15,063
Well, it doesn't matter.

1664
01:26:15,099 --> 01:26:16,225
lt doesn't matter?

1665
01:26:16,267 --> 01:26:17,393
lt does matter.

1666
01:26:17,435 --> 01:26:19,903
l heard about you and Margot.

1667
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:31,677
l'm sorry.

1668
01:26:31,716 --> 01:26:32,978
l don't know what to say.

1669
01:26:33,017 --> 01:26:34,985
You don't have to say anything.

1670
01:26:35,019 --> 01:26:39,513
l always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1671
01:26:39,557 --> 01:26:41,047
Me, too.

1672
01:26:41,092 --> 01:26:42,218
Me, too.

1673
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,490
ELl:
'Cause it doesn't mean

1674
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:47,327
what it used to though, does it?

1675
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:49,890
l wish he'd done this for me
when l was a kid.

1676
01:26:52,103 --> 01:26:54,469
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

1677
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,700
Yeah, but it would've meant
a lot to me.

1678
01:26:58,776 --> 01:27:00,710
Anyway, l'm glad
you're here now.

1679
01:27:00,812 --> 01:27:04,304
l recognize
that l have a problem...

1680
01:27:04,348 --> 01:27:07,784
and l want to get better.

1681
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:11,912
l'll just grab my stuff.

1682
01:27:21,933 --> 01:27:23,924
There he goes.

1683
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:25,265
What?!

1684
01:27:25,303 --> 01:27:26,270
There he goes.

1685
01:27:26,304 --> 01:27:27,635
Tucker!

1686
01:27:27,672 --> 01:27:29,367
Skiddly, skiddly.

1687
01:27:29,407 --> 01:27:31,875
( mumbles incoherently )

1688
01:27:31,909 --> 01:27:36,243
(''Christmas Time is Here''
playing )

1689
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,683
* Christmastime is here *

1690
01:27:40,718 --> 01:27:43,118
* Happiness and cheer... *

1691
01:27:43,154 --> 01:27:46,453
l'd like to order some ice cream
for my daughter, please.

1692
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:47,753
What would you like, Margot?

1693
01:27:47,825 --> 01:27:50,692
Nothing. l told you
l have to go in five minutes.

1694
01:27:50,728 --> 01:27:52,855
Oh.

1695
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:55,388
( quiet sigh )

1696
01:27:55,433 --> 01:27:58,231
l'll have a butterscotch sundae,
l guess.

1697
01:28:04,175 --> 01:28:06,905
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

1698
01:28:06,944 --> 01:28:10,141
Well, so am l, but l'm not going
to discuss it with you.

1699
01:28:11,716 --> 01:28:13,843
Oh...

1700
01:28:13,885 --> 01:28:15,853
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

1701
01:28:15,887 --> 01:28:17,184
and try to repair the damage?

1702
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:20,657
l.l mean, l think people want
to hear that.

1703
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:21,658
Do they?

1704
01:28:21,692 --> 01:28:22,659
Mmm.

1705
01:28:22,693 --> 01:28:24,627
You probably don't even know

1706
01:28:24,662 --> 01:28:26,653
my middle name.

1707
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:32,669
That's a trick question.

1708
01:28:32,703 --> 01:28:34,102
You don't have one.

1709
01:28:34,138 --> 01:28:35,366
Helen.

1710
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:38,466
That was my mother's name.

1711
01:28:38,509 --> 01:28:41,478
l know it was.

1712
01:28:55,493 --> 01:28:58,121
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

1713
01:28:58,162 --> 01:29:00,153
and hitting the cemetery?

1714
01:29:08,706 --> 01:29:11,038
( solemn organ music plays )

1715
01:29:17,515 --> 01:29:19,506
( Royal whistles )

1716
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:24,283
l got something for you, Ethel.

1717
01:29:24,322 --> 01:29:25,721
Actually, l made it.

1718
01:29:25,823 --> 01:29:27,222
What's this?

1719
01:29:27,258 --> 01:29:28,520
lt's a divorce.

1720
01:29:28,559 --> 01:29:30,322
From you?

1721
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:31,521
Yes.

1722
01:29:31,562 --> 01:29:32,688
This is Sanchez.

1723
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:33,856
He's a notary public.

1724
01:29:33,898 --> 01:29:35,024
.Hello.
.Hello, sir.

1725
01:29:35,066 --> 01:29:36,294
You just sign here

1726
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:38,461
and initial here
and sign there.

1727
01:29:40,871 --> 01:29:43,305
You own this building,
don't you, Henry?

1728
01:29:43,341 --> 01:29:45,332
Hmm.

1729
01:29:45,376 --> 01:29:48,038
lt's magnificent.

1730
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:49,979
l used to be a homeowner myself

1731
01:29:50,014 --> 01:29:52,346
until our son expropriated it
from me.

1732
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:54,715
l got to catch my bus.

1733
01:29:54,752 --> 01:29:55,912
Thanks, Sanchez.

1734
01:29:55,953 --> 01:29:57,079
You're welcome.

1735
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:59,089
ETHELlNE:
Are we divorced?

1736
01:29:59,123 --> 01:30:00,249
Almost.

1737
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:02,555
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

1738
01:30:02,593 --> 01:30:03,958
l love you, Etheline.

1739
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:06,623
Congratulations to both of you.

1740
01:30:06,664 --> 01:30:08,632
l didn't think so much
of him at first.

1741
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:09,860
But now l get it.

1742
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,891
He's everything that l'm not.

1743
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:16,097
( chuckles )

1744
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,870
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1745
01:30:18,909 --> 01:30:20,843
( bus drives off)

1746
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:28,875
( string quartet tuning )

1747
01:30:31,088 --> 01:30:34,148
( playing classical music )

1748
01:30:52,576 --> 01:30:54,043
Uh, slightly uneven.

1749
01:30:54,078 --> 01:30:55,978
Looks okay. You're just nervous.

1750
01:30:56,013 --> 01:30:57,446
( knocking )

1751
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:58,971
Henry?

1752
01:30:59,016 --> 01:31:00,108
Hello, Richie.

1753
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:01,345
Hi.

1754
01:31:01,385 --> 01:31:03,319

1755
01:31:03,354 --> 01:31:06,152
Hi, Walter. Nice to meet you.

1756
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:07,418
Nice to meet you.

1757
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:08,686
Henry's your dad?

1758
01:31:08,726 --> 01:31:11,092
Yes.

1759
01:31:11,128 --> 01:31:13,119
So you've been married before.

1760
01:31:13,164 --> 01:31:15,997
Yes. l'm a widower.

1761
01:31:16,033 --> 01:31:18,058
Oh, yeah.

1762
01:31:18,102 --> 01:31:20,627
l forgot.

1763
01:31:23,107 --> 01:31:25,940
You know, l'm a widower myself.

1764
01:31:28,946 --> 01:31:31,642
l know you are, Chas.

1765
01:31:31,682 --> 01:31:34,378
( plastic rattling
against teeth )

1766
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:36,716
What are you chewing on?

1767
01:31:36,754 --> 01:31:38,381
My nicotine inhaler.

1768
01:31:38,422 --> 01:31:40,390
lt's supposed to help me quit.

1769
01:31:40,424 --> 01:31:43,018
ls it working?

1770
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:45,961
Not really.

1771
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,297
Well, of course,
l'm half Hebrew

1772
01:31:51,335 --> 01:31:53,860
but the children are
three.quarters Mick Catholic.

1773
01:31:53,904 --> 01:31:56,099
So they were raised
in the church?

1774
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,165
l believe so.

1775
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:00,040
l really don't know.

1776
01:32:00,077 --> 01:32:02,170
( tires squealing )

1777
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:04,044
( engine roaring )

1778
01:32:09,787 --> 01:32:11,914
Here l come.

1779
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:16,849
Boys!

1780
01:32:16,894 --> 01:32:18,361
( scream and crash )

1781
01:32:18,395 --> 01:32:20,090
What was that?

1782
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:23,595
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

1783
01:32:23,634 --> 01:32:24,931
Oh, my God.

1784
01:32:35,212 --> 01:32:37,578
Where's my shoe?

1785
01:32:40,651 --> 01:32:42,846
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1786
01:32:42,887 --> 01:32:44,184
They're okay, Chas.

1787
01:32:44,221 --> 01:32:45,518
lt's okay. They're safe.

1788
01:32:45,556 --> 01:32:46,989
They're safe.

1789
01:32:47,024 --> 01:32:48,150
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

1790
01:32:48,192 --> 01:32:49,159
What?

1791
01:32:49,193 --> 01:32:50,888
Yeah, l think we lost Buckley.

1792
01:32:50,928 --> 01:32:52,088
He saved them.

1793
01:32:52,129 --> 01:32:53,255
Who?

1794
01:32:53,297 --> 01:32:55,288
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

1795
01:32:55,332 --> 01:32:57,323
You did?

1796
01:32:58,669 --> 01:33:00,261
Did l hit anyone?

1797
01:33:00,304 --> 01:33:03,205
ls everybody okay?

1798
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:12,682
Eli!

1799
01:33:12,783 --> 01:33:13,943
What's going on?

1800
01:33:13,984 --> 01:33:15,246
( mumbles )

1801
01:33:20,758 --> 01:33:22,692
( yells )

1802
01:33:22,793 --> 01:33:25,159
CHAS:
Eli!

1803
01:33:25,196 --> 01:33:27,187
What?

1804
01:33:28,432 --> 01:33:29,956
Hey, man.

1805
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,900
You should try this.
lt's very tasty.

1806
01:33:37,775 --> 01:33:39,834
( screaming )

1807
01:33:42,213 --> 01:33:44,477
( groaning )

1808
01:33:45,749 --> 01:33:47,740
( groaning )

1809
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:52,956
( screaming )

1810
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:54,389
ELl:
Tenenbaum!

1811
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:56,586
( gasping )

1812
01:33:56,627 --> 01:33:58,618
Chas?

1813
01:34:08,472 --> 01:34:10,463
( grunts )

1814
01:34:22,953 --> 01:34:25,046
Did l hit the dog?

1815
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:27,080
Yeah.

1816
01:34:29,894 --> 01:34:31,953
ls he dead?

1817
01:34:31,996 --> 01:34:34,089
Yeah.

1818
01:34:37,334 --> 01:34:39,359
l need help.

1819
01:34:39,403 --> 01:34:42,895
So do l.

1820
01:34:47,912 --> 01:34:50,676
Go around to the other side.

1821
01:34:50,714 --> 01:34:52,113
ROYAL:
You kids stay there.

1822
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:53,241
We'll be right back.

1823
01:34:53,284 --> 01:34:55,275
HENRY:
Yeah.

1824
01:34:57,054 --> 01:34:58,612
Can l say something
to you, Henry?

1825
01:34:58,656 --> 01:34:59,816
Okay.

1826
01:34:59,857 --> 01:35:01,484
l've always been considered
an asshole

1827
01:35:01,525 --> 01:35:03,015
for about as long
as l can remember.

1828
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,425
That's just my style.

1829
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:05,519
But l'd really feel blue

1830
01:35:05,562 --> 01:35:07,655
if l didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

1831
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:11,098
l don't think
you're an asshole, Royal.

1832
01:35:11,135 --> 01:35:13,968
l just think you're kind
of a son of a bitch.

1833
01:35:14,004 --> 01:35:16,404
Well, l really
appreciate that.

1834
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,670
( sirens approaching )

1835
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:20,677
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

1836
01:35:20,711 --> 01:35:22,679
We've got a couple boys
back there.

1837
01:35:22,713 --> 01:35:24,681
l think you may
have broken an ankle.

1838
01:35:24,782 --> 01:35:27,512
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

1839
01:35:27,551 --> 01:35:29,883
Do you have an alternate?

1840
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,148
No.

1841
01:35:31,188 --> 01:35:32,780
Ready?

1842
01:35:32,823 --> 01:35:34,688
Are there priests on call?

1843
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:36,885
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

1844
01:35:36,927 --> 01:35:40,226
At which point, l apparently
lost control of the vehicle

1845
01:35:40,264 --> 01:35:42,994
smashed it into the house,
and killed that poor dog.

1846
01:35:43,033 --> 01:35:44,694
You're Eli Cash.

1847
01:35:44,768 --> 01:35:46,395
Yes indeed, l am.

1848
01:35:46,437 --> 01:35:47,870
l love your work.

1849
01:35:47,905 --> 01:35:49,668
Oh, how sweet of you to say.

1850
01:35:49,707 --> 01:35:51,572
DlSPATCHER ( on radio ):
78.35, Code Six.

1851
01:35:51,608 --> 01:35:53,542
105 North Sandler...

1852
01:35:53,577 --> 01:35:55,875
ROYAL:
l think he's part mutt.

1853
01:35:55,913 --> 01:35:59,474
What kind of papers
do you have for him?

1854
01:35:59,516 --> 01:36:01,677
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

1855
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:04,279
Good boy.

1856
01:36:06,857 --> 01:36:09,917
Put this on.

1857
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,928
( laughs )

1858
01:36:11,962 --> 01:36:13,156
What's so funny, Dudley?

1859
01:36:13,197 --> 01:36:15,165
You look great.

1860
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:16,757
( laughing )

1861
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,392
DUSTY:
Can you see out of it?

1862
01:36:18,435 --> 01:36:19,561
Not really.

1863
01:36:19,603 --> 01:36:21,764
Uh.huh. Minor corneal damage.

1864
01:36:21,805 --> 01:36:24,103
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

1865
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:25,403
( sirens approaching )

1866
01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:26,568
Who do l make it out to?

1867
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:28,373
Alex? Okay.

1868
01:36:28,412 --> 01:36:29,902
( fire engine horn blasting )

1869
01:36:29,947 --> 01:36:32,347
But these aren't structure.
bearing elements, Dad.

1870
01:36:32,383 --> 01:36:33,782
lt doesn't matter.

1871
01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:35,682
lt's still best
to file another force majeure

1872
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:37,050
and recoup the deductible.

1873
01:36:37,087 --> 01:36:39,078
( horn blasting )

1874
01:36:39,123 --> 01:36:42,217
( background radio
communication )

1875
01:36:42,259 --> 01:36:44,523
You boys come up here with me.

1876
01:36:44,561 --> 01:36:46,552
But Buckley's
still under there.

1877
01:36:46,597 --> 01:36:51,557
l know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

1878
01:36:51,602 --> 01:36:53,593
( quietly ):
Come on.

1879
01:36:57,107 --> 01:36:59,541
l got you a new dog
for the boys.

1880
01:36:59,576 --> 01:37:01,544
l just bought him.

1881
01:37:01,578 --> 01:37:03,705
You did?

1882
01:37:03,814 --> 01:37:06,044
Sorry l let you down, Chas.

1883
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:08,108
All of you.

1884
01:37:08,152 --> 01:37:10,780
l been trying
to make it up to you.

1885
01:37:17,194 --> 01:37:19,253
What's his name?

1886
01:37:19,296 --> 01:37:21,287
Spark Plug.

1887
01:37:24,168 --> 01:37:26,136
Thank you.

1888
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:28,263
You're welcome.

1889
01:37:30,841 --> 01:37:32,900
l've had a rough year, Dad.

1890
01:37:32,943 --> 01:37:35,207
l know you have, Chassie.

1891
01:37:42,352 --> 01:37:44,343
Hey.

1892
01:37:57,301 --> 01:37:58,563
( fluttering )

1893
01:37:58,602 --> 01:37:59,967
( soft chirping )

1894
01:38:04,908 --> 01:38:06,170
RlCHlE:
See, now he has

1895
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:08,075
more white feathers
on his neck.

1896
01:38:10,948 --> 01:38:13,382
l wonder
what happened to him?

1897
01:38:13,417 --> 01:38:14,975
l don't know.

1898
01:38:15,018 --> 01:38:18,044
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

1899
01:38:18,088 --> 01:38:19,612
their hair turns white.

1900
01:38:21,258 --> 01:38:23,556
Well, l'm sure
he'll get over it.

1901
01:38:40,144 --> 01:38:43,204
This was one
of my first hiding places.

1902
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,014
How old do you think those are?

1903
01:38:50,888 --> 01:38:52,856
l'd say about ten years.

1904
01:38:55,292 --> 01:38:57,260
Come here.

1905
01:38:59,763 --> 01:39:01,754
( soft chirping )

1906
01:39:21,318 --> 01:39:24,310
( gentle melodyplays
on acoustic guitar)

1907
01:39:31,195 --> 01:39:34,528
NARRATOR:
Royal dug a hole forBuckley
behind the garden shed

1908
01:39:34,565 --> 01:39:36,692
and buried him
in a canvas duffel bag.

1909
01:39:36,733 --> 01:39:38,132
All right, boys.

1910
01:39:38,168 --> 01:39:39,294
Say a prayer.

1911
01:39:39,336 --> 01:39:40,826
Dear Heavenly Father...

1912
01:39:40,871 --> 01:39:42,202
l do.

1913
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:45,003
Etheline and Henry were married

1914
01:39:45,042 --> 01:39:47,510
48 hours later
injudge's chambers.

1915
01:39:47,544 --> 01:39:53,540
Margot's newplay was produced
at the Cavendish Theatre.

1916
01:39:53,584 --> 01:39:56,917
This is my adopted daughter,
Elaine Levinson.

1917
01:39:57,921 --> 01:39:59,445
( chuckling )

1918
01:39:59,489 --> 01:40:03,789
lt ran forjust under two weeks
and received mixed reviews.

1919
01:40:03,827 --> 01:40:07,092
Yes, can the boy tell time?

1920
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:08,791
Oh, my Lord, no.

1921
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,390
No. No.

1922
01:40:10,434 --> 01:40:12,561
Raleigh and Dudley
went on a lecture tour

1923
01:40:12,603 --> 01:40:13,661
to 11 universities

1924
01:40:13,704 --> 01:40:15,467
in the promotion
oftheirnew book.

1925
01:40:15,505 --> 01:40:19,464
( audience applause )

1926
01:40:19,509 --> 01:40:21,841
Eli checked himselfinto
a rehabilitation hospital

1927
01:40:21,878 --> 01:40:23,539
in North Dakota.

1928
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,983
Oh, hey, this is my sponsor,
Runs With Two Horses.

1929
01:40:28,018 --> 01:40:30,714
Wind's blowing up
a gale today.

1930
01:40:30,754 --> 01:40:32,654
This is the grip
that Rod Laver used.

1931
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:34,156
Are you familiar with Laver?

1932
01:40:34,191 --> 01:40:35,954
Richie started a program

1933
01:40:35,993 --> 01:40:39,827
teaching competitive tennis
to eight-to-12 year olds

1934
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:41,831
at the 375th Street Y.

1935
01:40:41,865 --> 01:40:44,561
Game. Change sides.

1936
01:40:48,438 --> 01:40:50,770
( hooting, hollering,
and laughing )

1937
01:40:54,945 --> 01:40:57,846
Royal had a heart attack
at the age of68.

1938
01:41:01,785 --> 01:41:03,776
Chas rode with him
in the ambulance

1939
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:06,653
and was the only witness
to his father's death.

1940
01:41:10,427 --> 01:41:12,588
ln his will, he stipulated

1941
01:41:12,629 --> 01:41:15,689
that his funeral
take place at dusk.

1942
01:41:29,513 --> 01:41:31,378
( music ends )

1943
01:41:48,832 --> 01:41:52,461
Among the fewpossessions
he left to his heirs

1944
01:41:52,502 --> 01:41:55,369
was a set
ofEncyclopedia Britannica

1945
01:41:55,405 --> 01:41:58,568
in storage
at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

1946
01:41:58,608 --> 01:42:01,634
under the names
Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.

1947
01:42:01,678 --> 01:42:04,306
No one spoke at the funeral

1948
01:42:04,348 --> 01:42:09,081
and FatherPetersen's leg
had not yet mended...

1949
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:10,984
but it was agreed among them

1950
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:13,512
that Royal
would have found the event

1951
01:42:13,557 --> 01:42:15,218
to be most satisfactory.

1952
01:42:18,595 --> 01:42:19,857
Fire!

1953
01:42:22,265 --> 01:42:23,789
Fire!

1954
01:42:25,702 --> 01:42:27,670

* By the winding stream *

1967
01:43:31,968 --> 01:43:36,405
* We shall lay and dream *

1968
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,968
* And these dreams come true *

1969
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:45,505
* lf we want them to *

1970
01:43:45,549 --> 01:43:50,077
* Yes, all will come *

1971
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:54,648
* Playing pipes and drum *

1972
01:43:54,691 --> 01:43:59,151
* Sing a happy song *

1973
01:43:59,196 --> 01:44:03,565
* Yeah, we'll sing along *

1974
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,060
* Everyone, everyone,

* Smile at passersby *

1983
01:45:14,371 --> 01:45:18,933
* And we'll softly sigh *

1984
01:45:18,975 --> 01:45:23,241
* Ai.yi.yi.yi.
yi.yi.yi.yi.yi.yi.yi *

1985
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:27,876
* Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone *

1986
01:45:27,918 --> 01:45:33,823
* Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone *

1987
01:45:36,126 --> 01:45:40,495
( scatting )

1988
01:45:49,306 --> 01:45:54,243
* Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah. *

1989
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:04,687
( gentle acoustic music
continues )

1991
01:46:43,793 --> 01:46:46,091

1997
01:48:46,783 --> 01:48:49,377
