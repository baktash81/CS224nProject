2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,190
Far in the dim past. . .

3
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:29,361
when myth and history
merged into mystery

4
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:33,845
and the gods of fable
and the primitive beliefs of man

5
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,139
dwelt on ancient
Mount Olympus,

6
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,225
in antique Greece

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,813
a legendary hero walked
godlike upon the earth. . .

8
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,586
sometimes.

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,463
Man: Why can't I go?

10
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,861
Because your place
is here with the rest of us.

11
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:51,468
- You let Mars travel.
- That's his job.

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,118
Until mankind learns to dispense
with his services

13
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,768
and lives in peace,
Mars must go where he's called.

14
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,166
I only want
to browse around.

15
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,773
You'd only get into trouble.

16
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,963
I have been here
thousands of years.

17
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:09,300
- I am bored.
- Don't interrupt your father!

18
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,324
Besides. . .

19
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,931
these mortals are
bedeviled by

20
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,121
as aggravating a collection
of annoyances

21
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,353
as it is possible for one
to imagine.

22
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:23,377
It may not be entirely
without merit,

23
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:26,610
- but you wouldn't like it there.
- Let me be the judge of that.

24
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:31,094
I am tired of the same old faces,
the same old things.

25
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:33,909
Tired or not,
you're staying here!

26
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,257
Woman: Zeus, I beg of you,

27
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,864
Hercules is only hotheaded.

28
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,784
He does not mean to oppose
your wishes.

29
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:51,765
Mind your own business,
Venus.

30
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,538
He has grown insufferable.

31
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:57,292
I will not be bearded to my face
by this insolent young whelp.

32
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,961
He's only a demigod.

33
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:02,298
He gives himself airs
his mortal birth does not warrant.

34
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,843
My mother may have been a mortal,
but you, Zeus, my father,

35
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,511
are a god.

36
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,806
I will discuss this
no further.

37
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,995
Does this mean I have
Zeus' permission to leave?

38
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,977
It means you will stay.

39
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,479
I don't wish to hear
another word on the subject.

40
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,148
I won't stay.

41
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,546
You are trying my patience,
Hercules.

42
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:23,362
- You are trying mine.
- Heed my words!

43
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,742
Nobody will stop me.

44
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:30,348
How dare you address
such remarks to your father!

45
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,913
It's easy.

46
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:35,041
Why you offensive puppy!

47
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:39,004
Perhaps this will teach you
respect for your elders!

48
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,009
Venus: Zeus,
Hercules is half mortal.

49
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,137
- He may be killed.
- He's only a spoiled youth.

50
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:48,284
Save him.

51
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:51,204
Hercules is your son.
Forgive him!

52
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,627
If I had known how much trouble
it would cause me,

53
00:04:56,731 --> 00:05:01,215
I'd have thought twice when I met
his mother on vacation.

54
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:14,980
Aahh!

55
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,298
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I just saw a man.

56
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,573
Yes, my dear, that's not unusual.
There are men on this airplane.

57
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:27,076
No, outside!

58
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,996
- He was flying.
- Outside?

59
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,081
Yes, he just passed my window.

60
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,437
Stewardess!

61
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,357
And he was. . .
he was naked!

62
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:39,589
And he was just going down,
flying.

63
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,301
- And he. . .
- We're traveling at 30,000 feet.

64
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,490
No man,
nude or otherwise,

65
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,097
could possibly be flying
outside a jet plane.

66
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:49,079
Oh, he was very handsome.

67
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,060
And he had big muscles.

68
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,146
And he was practically naked.

69
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,170
Oh, dear.
Oh, my.

70
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,715
I shouldn't have taken Agatha
to see all those Greek statues.

71
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:02,114
She's so impressionable.

72
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:06,493
We throw ourselves
at Zeus' feet.

73
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,162
Woman: Get up,
you stupid creatures.

74
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:12,124
Let Hercules suffer the consequences
of his own obstinacy.

75
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,400
J uno has hated Hercules
ever since the day of his birth.

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,007
All right! Do not be
disrespectful to my wife.

77
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,969
Let us see what
he is doing now.

78
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,429
( claps hands )

79
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,164
He's in the sea now.
He will drown!

80
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,833
Save him, Great Zeus.

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,231
It will take more than Neptune
or any of his creatures

82
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:37,047
- to overcome a son of Zeus.
- Save him, Zeus!

83
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,507
Save Hercules!

84
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:40,384
All right, all right.

85
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,408
I have done so.

86
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:47,162
Behold, coming over
the horizon of the sea.

87
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,087
( ship's horn blows )

88
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,344
What were you doing
out in the water?

89
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:04,263
- Swimming.
- A hundred miles from land?

90
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,245
I fell.

91
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,122
- Fell?
- Yes.

92
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:09,686
How did that happen?

93
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,501
- There was an explosion.
- Oh?

94
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,274
- What ship?
- Ship?

95
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:15,943
From which you
were blown overboard.

96
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,403
Olympus.

97
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,322
There's a Greek freighter
by that name.

98
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,659
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

99
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:26,162
- Greek, huh?
- Very old family.

100
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,248
Sir?

101
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:30,020
It's all right,
I'm democratic.

102
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,044
You're addressing the captain
of this ship. Say ''sir'' to me.

103
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:35,130
- I am Hercules.
- So you told me.

104
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,007
No man is superior
to Hercules.

105
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,780
Begging the captain's
pardon,

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,742
but an immersion in the water
can put a man off his head.

107
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,306
H uh.

108
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,956
- What's your berth?
- I am the son of Zeus.

109
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,667
I'm referring to your rating,
not your family tree.

110
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,170
What's your rating
when you ship out to sea?

111
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,488
What's your second name?
Hercules what?

112
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:02,034
As I have told you,
I am Hercules, son of Zeus.

113
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,641
I don't think he means
any disrespect.

114
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,726
He probably loses it
in the translation.

115
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,708
All right, sign him on
as Hercules Zeus,

116
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,732
since that's his father name,
and get him an O.S. rating.

117
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:13,192
Aye, aye, sir.

118
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,424
Get him what clothes
you can that might fit him.

119
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:17,988
Come with me.

120
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,269
- Where's this ship bound for?
- New York.

121
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,034
Carstairs!

122
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:58,657
Carstairs!

123
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,055
Stop that fight!

124
00:09:09,502 --> 00:09:12,317
Okay, I'm with you, boy.
Better forget it.

125
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:15,967
Oh no, you don't. No, no.
I'm your friend.

126
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,887
Bosun,
what's the meaning of this?

127
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,892
Well, he refused to work, sir.

128
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,499
And when I tried
to persuade him, well, he. . .

129
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,253
He's a foreigner.

130
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,547
Perhaps he didn't
understand you.

131
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,216
I understood him.

132
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,614
He's most disagreeable
and he has irritated me.

133
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,590
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ashore.

134
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,032
- The captain give you permission?
- Hercules goes where he wishes.

135
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,430
Not on this ship, you don't.
Get your carcass below.

136
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,890
Get yours!

137
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,815
Yo, Hercules!
Come back here!

138
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,925
Stop him!
Somebody grab him!

139
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,385
Get him!

140
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,636
Alex!

141
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,850
Hey, you guys!

142
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,727
20 bucks for the first man
that flattens him.

143
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:55,657
Man: Come on! Come on!

144
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:11,508
Oooh!

145
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:19,537
Come on, push him.
That's it.

146
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,732
Come on!

147
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:47,067
Come on, push it!

148
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,837
Come on, let's get him!

149
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,460
You'd better get out of here.
They're gonna kill you!

150
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:26,171
Come on,
we'll get a cab.

151
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:30,446
Here!

152
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,949
Go ahead!

153
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,340
What's the matter with you?!
Let go!

154
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,890
Fine chariot,
but where are the horses?

155
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,663
Let go of that!
What's the matter?

156
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,749
Hey, let go of that!

157
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:25,923
Where to?

158
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,217
Uptown.
And step on it!

159
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:32,701
Boy, that was close.

160
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,786
What was close?

161
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:36,976
They almost nailed you!

162
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,853
What did you do?
J ump ship?

163
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,147
No, I walked off.

164
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,024
You walked off.

165
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,006
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

166
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,195
Oh. Mine is Pretzi.

167
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:49,594
They call me Pretzi,
because, you see,

168
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:52,096
I sell pretzels
on the waterfront.

169
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,121
- Where you from?
- Greece.

170
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,623
Oh! I used to know
a Greek guy.

171
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,439
He ran a beanery
down in the Village.

172
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,524
His name was Apollo.

173
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,923
I never found out
what his second name was.

174
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:07,217
- I know Apollo.
- You do?

175
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:11,909
Well, is this a small world?
You know Apollo. Gee.

176
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,682
I wonder where Apollo is now.

177
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,976
I haven't seen him
in two or three years.

178
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:18,270
- He's back home.
- He went home, huh?

179
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,920
He was all the time talking about
how homesick he was.

180
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,006
So he finally went home.

181
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,883
He was a real nice guy.

182
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:29,950
Conceited. He thinks there's
nobody handsomer in the world.

183
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,722
Handsome? Apollo?

184
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:35,268
You must be kidding.
Come on, say you're kidding.

185
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:39,022
Handsome? With that big black
wart on his nose?

186
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,733
And those
little beady crossed eyes?

187
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:42,776
( laughing )

188
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,966
He must have been in disguise.

189
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,573
I wonder if Apollo
ever got married.

190
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:50,492
He was all the time
looking for a wife.

191
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:53,725
Maybe that's why he went home,
to find a wife.

192
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:57,062
Diana and Terpsichore
are in love with him.

193
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,565
I think Hebe is attracted, too.

194
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,233
No kidding.

195
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:04,049
It shows you how desperate
some women could be.

196
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,134
That is really amazing.

197
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,324
You hungry?
Wait a minute.

198
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,992
Here, here.

199
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,557
Go ahead, help yourself.

200
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,581
- I'm grateful.
- Think nothing of it.

201
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,126
Good, huh?

202
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,212
Food for the gods.

203
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:23,132
Well, I get them
from a bakery in Brooklyn

204
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,217
called
''Food For the Gods Bakery.''

205
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:27,928
Where you guys wanna go?

206
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:33,559
Hey, what do you know?
Central Park.

207
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,332
This is good enough.

208
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,522
It's fine.

209
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,220
Here we are
in Central Park.

210
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,931
I'll go get my bag.

211
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,059
- That'll be two bucks.
- Big city, New York.

212
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,292
Bigger than Athens.

213
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:59,003
Bigger than Rome.

214
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:00,672
Bigger than Carthage.

215
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,862
I'd say New York is the biggest
place there is.

216
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,260
- Pay the cabbie.
- Pay him?

217
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,701
- What?
- For the ride, two bucks.

218
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,891
Bucks?

219
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,394
The bread, the shekels,

220
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:16,001
you know, the long green,
the money, two bucks!

221
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:19,233
He wants to be paid for driving
Hercules in the chariot?

222
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:20,902
That's the idea, mack.

223
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,779
My name is Hercules.

224
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,490
Hercules, Schmurcules,
give me the dough.

225
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:31,121
Bucks? Doe? What's all this talk
about male and female animals?

226
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,667
This guy got all his marbles?

227
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:37,065
He's just come over
from the old country.

228
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,629
Look, Herc, it's money.

229
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,610
You know, drachmas.

230
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,070
Money?

231
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,469
I don't have any money.

232
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:47,076
You don't have any money?

233
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:49,370
Holy moley.
He ain't got no money.

234
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:52,185
Hercules doesn't need
any money.

235
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,750
What?

236
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,774
That's the stupidest thing
I've heard in my whole life.

237
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:58,963
A couple of deadbeats, huh?

238
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,049
Pretzi: Look, buddy,
you see. . .

239
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,030
There's been a little mistake.

240
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:06,263
Well, now,
ain't that something.

241
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,827
A mistake.

242
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,121
Well, what do you know. . .

243
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,685
a mistake.

244
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,188
Last time, you gonna give up
the dough or ain't you?

245
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:17,316
Isn't it enough since Hercules
rode in your chariot?

246
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:18,985
You've been immortalized.

247
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:20,862
I've been who?

248
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:23,260
You heard him,
you've been immortalized.

249
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,867
- Driver: Are you nuts?
- Well, you see. . .

250
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:28,996
- It's like this--
- Driver: Like what?

251
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,081
Well, you see. . .
uh, we, I--

252
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,167
Okay, call the cops.

253
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:36,087
Not before I have some fun
by taking it out of your hides.

254
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:38,381
- Run, Herc!
- You deadbeat!

255
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,988
How dare you
touch Hercules?!

256
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:00,761
Brad says we've got the best
all around team we've ever had,

257
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,368
a cinch to win first place
in the intercollegiate meet.

258
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:05,245
I should hope so.

259
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,956
I know Rod, for one,
has worked very hard,

260
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,876
even to the point
of neglecting you, I'm afraid.

261
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:13,900
I don't mind, Dad.
I want him to succeed.

262
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,985
I'm sure he will,
darling.

263
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,635
You know what pleases me most,
Helen, about these boys?

264
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:23,285
J udging from their classroom work,
they apparently have brains

265
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,536
as well as brawn.

266
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,675
How are those men
over there?

267
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,761
They're just athletes
training.

268
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,742
- Athletes?
- College guys.

269
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:42,785
Hmmph. . .

270
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,288
What do you mean?
You think you could do better?

271
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,226
( snorts )

272
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,667
What do you mean?
These guys happen to be champions.

273
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,710
Ha!

274
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,213
- Nobody can beat them.
- Ha!

275
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:55,194
Wait!
Where are you going?

276
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,175
- Over there.
- What for?

277
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,365
To show them how
to throw the discus.

278
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,285
No, no.
You've gotta stay here.

279
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,162
You can't go
buttin' in there.

280
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,143
They would not like me
to instruct them?

281
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,063
No, it's just for college guys.
No outsiders allowed.

282
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,732
I am Hercules.

283
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:20,534
Put that discus down!
You have no business out here.

284
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,828
Those men do not throw it
far enough.

285
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,018
- You don't say.
- I do say.

286
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,814
- What is it, Helen?
- That man with the discus,

287
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,109
the coach seems to be
arguing with him.

288
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,090
These boys are
record holders.

289
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,384
Then they should
be better.

290
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,991
I suppose you believe
that you're better.

291
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:42,641
I once showed them in the
Olympics in Greece how to do it.

292
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,622
They profited by
my instruction.

293
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:48,480
You showed us in
the Greek Olympics, huh?

294
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,609
- What year was that?
- That was the year. . .

295
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:54,424
Hey, coach.
Let him show us, coach.

296
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:56,823
Maybe there is something
we could learn.

297
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,325
Well,
it's always possible.

298
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,932
All right, go ahead.
Show us.

299
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:02,871
Thank you.

300
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,718
What else do you do?

301
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:37,387
I ncredible.

302
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,037
Okay, Tom.

303
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:45,938
( cheers and applause )

304
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:50,422
Great throw, Tom!
Great throw!

305
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,716
Okay, let's see you
beat that.

306
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,219
A very good throw
for the earthbound.

307
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,868
Skip the wisecracks.
Put your money where your mouth is.

308
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:00,641
I do not have any money.

309
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:06,168
I mean, stop talking. . .

310
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,836
demonstrate.

311
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:08,983
All right.

312
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,879
Wow.

313
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,007
That's my buddy.

314
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:54,136
He's a Greek fella.

315
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:56,847
He just come over. . .
from Greece.

316
00:22:58,098 --> 00:23:00,184
- Dawson.
- Coach.

317
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:02,478
You're our anchorman here.

318
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,606
- Show this fella something.
- Yes, sir, coach.

319
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:09,986
Fifty bucks says my pal beats
that guy about to jump now.

320
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,280
I'll take that.
It's a bet.

321
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,887
- This fella can hold the money.
- No, that's all right.

322
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,077
I trust ya, buddy.

323
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,254
All right, Mister.
Let's see you top that.

324
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,652
Certainly,
if you wish me to.

325
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,780
Wish you?
Brother, I'm begging you.

326
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,794
- I beg your pardon?
- Why, what's the matter?

327
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:06,818
- Did I do something wrong?
- My name is Professor Camden.

328
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:10,051
- How do you do?
- And this is my daughter, Helen.

329
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,345
Here's our card.

330
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:14,013
I wonder if you'd
do me a favor.

331
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:15,577
Sure, spill it.

332
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,037
Have tea
with my daughter and me.

333
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:19,019
Shh! Not so loud!

334
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:22,564
You never know when one of them
narcotics cops is around.

335
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,858
Tea, the conventional
social drink.

336
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,631
You mean the drinking stuff?

337
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,716
Of course! What else?

338
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:29,968
Wait a minute.

339
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,992
You want to get together
just to drink tea?

340
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:35,807
Do you find that
so uncommon?

341
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,789
Well, no, but eh. . .

342
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,855
it's just that nobody's ever invited
me to do that with them before.

343
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:43,628
Well, around 4:00, then.

344
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,088
Hm?

345
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,235
Great.

346
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:48,321
And bring your friend along.

347
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,222
Hey, Herc!

348
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:55,516
( doorbell rings )

349
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,797
Please go into the library.

350
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,882
I'll tell the professor
you're here.

351
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:42,858
Hercules: Ha, ha.
Pan.

352
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,882
It's a funny one.

353
00:25:45,987 --> 00:25:47,968
I must tell him about this.

354
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:50,575
Yeah, you must do that.
Yeah.

355
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,268
Helen: Hello!

356
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,022
How do you do?
How do you do?

357
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:01,107
I'm so happy you both
could be here.

358
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:07,468
Hey, cut that out!

359
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:09,449
- Won't you be seated?
- Thank you.

360
00:26:10,596 --> 00:26:12,578
My father should be here
any minute.

361
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,650
- Is anything wrong?
- What could be wrong?

362
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:24,883
It's just that you're looking
at me so strangely

363
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:27,594
I feel my hair may be out of place
or something of the sort.

364
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:29,679
Everything's perfect.

365
00:26:29,784 --> 00:26:31,556
Everything's in its place.

366
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:34,685
- You remind me of someone.
- Really? Someone you know?

367
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:36,875
- A goddess.
- A goddess?

368
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,107
I remind you of a goddess?

369
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:42,089
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

370
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:44,800
If the sun comes out,
it will be a beautiful day.

371
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,554
You and she do have
a lot in common.

372
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:51,474
It's kind of you to be
so complimentary, but. . .

373
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:55,123
I must say it's the first time
anyone's been quite so. . .

374
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:58,565
so extravagant with his comparisons
where I'm concerned.

375
00:26:58,565 --> 00:26:59,503
( doorbell rings )

376
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:02,006
Excuse me,
that must be my other guest.

377
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,655
What's the matter with you?

378
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:08,680
Now you cut that out!
Talking that way to that dame.

379
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:12,746
You're acting like some kind
of a bull in a ten-cent store.

380
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:15,041
You just got here,
and right away you're on the make.

381
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,126
- What am I making?
- J ust cut it out.

382
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,107
That's no way to talk
to a dame.

383
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:21,089
I don't understand.

384
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,738
Maybe I'm being
a little rough on you.

385
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,928
Maybe you do things differently
where you come from,

386
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:30,891
but that's not the way we talk
to a dame here, that's all.

387
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:33,081
What did I say
that was wrong?

388
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,958
J ust cut it out!
That's all!

389
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:37,565
That's not the way to talk
to a broad, understand?

390
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:39,650
I guess you all
know each other.

391
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:41,840
- Hi, fellas.
- How do you do?

392
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,300
How are you doing?

393
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:45,386
- Hey, what's happening?
- Is he your lover?

394
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,054
My what?

395
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:49,035
Hey, Mister,
watch your talk!

396
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,225
I can hear my talk.
I cannot watch it.

397
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:54,562
You won't hear it much longer
if you don't apologize to her.

398
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,586
Apologize for paying
her a tribute?

399
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,942
A tribute?

400
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,653
- I nsulting her.
- A beautiful woman

401
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:04,677
with a handsome man for a friend,
they must be lovers.

402
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:05,928
Herc, you cool it!

403
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:08,431
I find it unnatural
if they're not.

404
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,100
All right,
you asked for it!

405
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:11,664
( thud )

406
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:16,461
Ughh!

407
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,650
You have struck Hercules.

408
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,092
Come off that rap. Keep that up,
and you'll have to be taken away.

409
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:24,073
What kind of chicken fat
you got in your head?

410
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:25,011
I am Hercules.

411
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:28,244
You're Hercules, I'm Rod Nelson.
Now what? Outside?

412
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:31,060
I can do it just as well
in here.

413
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,458
No, no.
You. . . you put him down!

414
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:36,169
- Helen: Really, you're crazy!
- Herc!

415
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:37,629
Will you put him down!

416
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,549
Please, Mr. Hercules.
Please put him down.

417
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,634
His first name is Hercules.

418
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,763
His last name is Zeus.
It rhymes with ''booze.''

419
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:50,351
I don't care what his name is.
Tell him to put Mr. Nelson down.

420
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,541
Herc, you heard
what the lady said.

421
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,731
Put the guy down.
What's the matter with you?

422
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,816
Pretzi: Put him down
on his feet!

423
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:58,798
Put him down!
Turn him loose!

424
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,570
Helen: Put him down!

425
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,386
- Put him down!
- Tea is served.

426
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:05,576
Well, I knew it.

427
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:08,495
Doesn't surprise me a bit.

428
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,894
Wherever he goes--
trouble.

429
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,274
What am I gonna do
with the young fool?

430
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:16,942
( sniffles )

431
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,635
Amusing situation with that fellow,
Hercules, wasn't it?

432
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,493
Amusing?
That man must be crazy!

433
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,474
- Original.
- Primitive.

434
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:30,707
- I find him refreshing.
- You must be kidding!

435
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:31,854
No.

436
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:35,295
He almost killed Rod Nelson.
He had to have some ribs taped.

437
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,006
Nevertheless,
Mr. Zeus interests me.

438
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,926
I'd like to get to know him better.
Study him more closely.

439
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,324
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

440
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:47,079
He had the effrontery to ask if
I'd have dinner with him tonight.

441
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:49,060
Well, of course you told him. . .

442
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,458
- I would.
- Naturally.

443
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,298
( animal growls and screeches )

444
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:09,394
( growling )

445
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:19,718
Oh, it was a
wonderful evening.

446
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:22,950
- Thank you so much
- I enjoyed it, too.

447
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,827
Are you homesick?

448
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:27,226
I'm having too much fun.

449
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,833
( hooves clipping )

450
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:40,052
( gorilla panting )

451
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:04,245
What's it like back there,
where you come from?

452
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,704
Didn't you tell me Athens?

453
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,207
A seaport?

454
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,335
- We have a fine ocean view.
- Oh, that's nice.

455
00:31:11,231 --> 00:31:13,525
Have any brothers
and sisters there?

456
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:16,237
Lots, half brothers
and half sisters.

457
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,573
What does your father do?
What business is he in?

458
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,598
Ha! He's a deity.

459
00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:25,726
I suppose he must miss you.

460
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,020
He didn't want
to see me leave.

461
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,314
I n fact, he was most upset.

462
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:31,670
Of course.

463
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,590
But a young man must see
the world, so they say.

464
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,571
This is what I told him.

465
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:39,595
Do you have a girl
back home?

466
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,453
You know how it is.

467
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:45,122
No, I don't.
( giggling )

468
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:50,440
Radio: All Central Park units.
All Central Park units.

469
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,090
Escaped from zoo,
one 600 lb. grizzly bear.

470
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:57,948
Take caution with animal,
known to be surly and dangerous.

471
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,972
( sirens wailing )

472
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,480
( growling )

473
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:14,841
( sirens approaching )

474
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,742
I would really like
to see Greece one day.

475
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,932
I've heard
it's a beautiful country.

476
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:24,330
Perhaps you will
see it one day.

477
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,103
Will you
show me around?

478
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:28,502
You like
to climb mountains?

479
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:30,483
Well,
I've never done any, um. . .

480
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:34,237
Have you ever been
on Mt. Olympus?

481
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:36,635
- I know it very well.
- No kidding!

482
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,408
I'm not kidding.

483
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:41,432
When I was a little girl,
I used to read all about it,

484
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:44,560
and the gods and goddesses who
were supposed to live on top of it,

485
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,125
and I believed it!

486
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:48,732
It's one of the joys
of being really young.

487
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,400
( growling )

488
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,023
( Helen screaming )

489
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:10,421
Ooh!

490
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,403
( whinnying )

491
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,740
Ooh!
Aaahh!

492
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,494
( Helen screaming )

493
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,788
Hercules!

494
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,395
Beat him up!

495
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:36,178
Aaahh!

496
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:38,160
Oh, Hercules!

497
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,686
Ooh!

498
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,919
Well, beat him!

499
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:28,735
- Wrestling?
- We gotta get money somehow.

500
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,072
Using our muscles is one
of the few ways I could think of

501
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,949
for us to get some dough.

502
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,390
U nless you've got a better idea
on how we're gonna pay the bills

503
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,684
that you've been running up
here at the hotel?

504
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,665
Yes, sir, gents. . .

505
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:45,211
the wrassling game is. . .
lucrative.

506
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,486
Mr. Dugan promotes the wrestling
matches at the Armory.

507
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,425
Right.

508
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,031
- He saw your picture in the paper.
- Right.

509
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:56,264
He read about what you'd done
to that bear.

510
00:34:56,264 --> 00:35:10,967
And he brought us a proposition.

511
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:13,366
I'm your new partner.

512
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,077
I saw your boy Hercules
wrestle last night.

513
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,058
and he's gonna go places.

514
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,101
Yeah.

515
00:35:19,205 --> 00:35:22,021
Dugan tells me
you're easy to deal with.

516
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:24,002
And I hope so,

517
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:27,339
because here's my contract
to replace yours.

518
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:30,050
All you gotta do is
sign your name. . .

519
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:33,179
and here's the dough.

520
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:37,871
I don't have any contracts
with Hercules.

521
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,748
He's my buddy. . .

522
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:42,042
we just got each others' word.

523
00:35:42,147 --> 00:35:44,024
It makes it all the easier.

524
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,005
Cuts the red tape.

525
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:47,361
Sign your name.

526
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:50,385
Fat Lips, Nitro and me
will take care of everything.

527
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:51,532
Yeah.

528
00:35:52,574 --> 00:35:53,513
No.

529
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,181
I ain't gonna do that.

530
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:58,727
Hercules is my friend.
I ain't gonna sell him to nobody.

531
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,751
Not to you, or him,
or him!

532
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,566
Look, that boy of yours
is a comer.

533
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:06,965
With my connections,
that boy's gonna be

534
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,259
world champ in no time.

535
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:11,866
What's a little runt like you
gonna do for him,

536
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:15,099
except stand in his way?
And that don't fit in with my plans.

537
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:16,141
Yeah.

538
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,417
No,
I ain't gonna do it.

539
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:24,692
Now, look. . .

540
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,802
I'd like to do everything
nice and easy and legal.

541
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:32,200
But if you wanna get tough,

542
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,807
we can oblige you,
can't we, fellas?

543
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:36,789
Yeah.

544
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:01,294
Tell your boy
I'll be seeing him.

545
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:08,802
( door closes )

546
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,877
''Hercules. . .

547
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:42,275
half god, half man,

548
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,987
was the son of J upiter,
or Zeus--

549
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:47,176
as he was known
to the Greeks--

550
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:50,305
and a mortal mother
named Alcmene.

551
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,182
As J uno,
Zeus' wife,

552
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,040
was always hostile to
the offspring of her husband,

553
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,917
by mortal mothers,

554
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:01,463
she declared war against
Hercules from his birth.

555
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:04,382
She sent two serpents
to destroy him

556
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:06,468
as he lay in his cradle.

557
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:10,326
But Hercules strangled them
with his hands.''

558
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:12,412
Holy moley!

559
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,356
I would speak with Nemesis.

560
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:11,851
My son, Hercules,
who has set himself against me. . .

561
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:16,126
is out in the world bringing
disrepute to his name.

562
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,316
He has no business there.

563
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,297
And where he is
is no place for him.

564
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:22,278
I hear, Great Zeus.

565
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:27,284
I charge you with a mission,

566
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:30,412
as she who is the avenger
of my displeasures.

567
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,602
I n all things, I obey.

568
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,418
Go down to that continent
known as North America,

569
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,920
to that city
known as New York.

570
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,797
Take with you my wish

571
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:42,821
that Hercules be punished
for setting himself against me,

572
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:46,262
for demeaning that part
of him which is divine

573
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,746
in rioting among the mortals
of that benighted place.

574
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:51,685
Great Zeus,

575
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:55,439
I beg you, hold your anger
against Hercules.

576
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:57,420
He means no harm.

577
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,506
He is simple,
and a bit childish.

578
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,383
Give him a chance.

579
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,615
Send me down there first
to persuade him to come back to us,

580
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,222
before you give Nemesis
her task.

581
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:11,394
- Yes, O Zeus.
- Heed Mercury's plea.

582
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:13,271
Send Mercury for Hercules

583
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,295
before you charge that dread
Nemesis with her mission.

584
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,570
Venus also adds her voice
in asking Zeus to be patient

585
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:23,281
and merciful.

586
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:25,784
I don't wish to be
unduly harsh.

587
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:29,329
But Hercules has been trying
my patience for centuries.

588
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,415
Woman: Yet be indulgent,
Great Zeus.

589
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:34,231
Send Mercury
to bring back Hercules.

590
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:37,985
- Give him this chance.
- Let him stay down there.

591
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:41,009
He's been an annoyance
from his cradle on.

592
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:44,763
We all know why
you don't like Hercules.

593
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:48,412
But surely, Great Zeus will not let
his judgement be affected

594
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:51,124
- by J uno's malice.
- Malice!?

595
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:53,105
- How dare you?
- All right. . .

596
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:55,086
I don't want any arguments.

597
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:59,153
So be it.

598
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:04,158
- Mercury. . .
- Great Zeus.

599
00:41:04,158 --> 00:41:06,557
Tell Hercules it is
my wish

600
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:09,372
he return to Olympus
without delay.

601
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:11,249
Do not fail.

602
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,856
- Now be gone.
- As Great Zeus commands.

603
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:23,033
Is it wise, O Zeus,
to do this thing?

604
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,725
If Hercules no longer finds
Olympus to his taste,

605
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:30,437
then let him stay
where he is.

606
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:34,191
Those down there will punish him
more than you ever would.

607
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:37,736
They resent one who is different
from themselves.

608
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,386
They will always try to
destroy him because of it.

609
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:44,097
It is the habit
with these unhappy mortals.

610
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:47,121
Hercules is my son,
not yours.

611
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,832
I know you hate him, J uno,

612
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:52,648
but we do not punish
in hate,

613
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:54,629
only in sorrow.

614
00:41:57,132 --> 00:41:58,800
I have spoken.

615
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:10,792
Oh look, you're famous.

616
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,816
That is not Hercules.
And who is that monster

617
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:16,841
who looks as if he came from
the kingdom of the underworld?

618
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:18,092
Oh, no.

619
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:20,282
This is a motion picture,
a play.

620
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:22,784
You mustn't take yourself
so seriously.

621
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:25,496
He doesn't even look like me.
Look.

622
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:29,041
What are you doing?

623
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:30,710
Oh, wow!

624
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:34,776
Does he?

625
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:35,924
Listen. . .
I really. . .

626
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:38,948
- Does he?
- I wish you'd put your shirt on.

627
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:40,929
It isn't supposed
to look like anyone

628
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:43,223
except the actor
who plays the part!

629
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:45,204
What is the name
of that imitator?

630
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:48,333
Who gave him permission
to pretend to be Hercules?

631
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,731
Listen.
Stop joking.

632
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,025
I think. . .
I think we ought to go.

633
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:54,798
I nsolence.

634
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:03,349
( church bell chimes )

635
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,314
Hercules: What is that?

636
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:31,191
It's Atlas
holding up the world.

637
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:34,528
According to Greek mythology,
he was the one who. . .

638
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:36,614
Atlas?

639
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,116
- Yeah.
- Poor likeness.

640
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,036
You have the oddest
sense of humor.

641
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,164
Half the time I don't know
whether you're joking or not.

642
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,188
Did your mother drop you
on your head as a baby?

643
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,127
What happened?

644
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,942
Once I strangled two serpents
in the cradle.

645
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:53,715
Oh. . .

646
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:57,886
Come along.
I'll show you more of our city.

647
00:43:57,991 --> 00:44:00,598
First, let's take a picture
of Atlas.

648
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:01,953
Okay.

649
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,333
( shutter clicks )

650
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,983
And now of you.

651
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:14,988
Smile.

652
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:27,814
This fine food for only
a few small coins?

653
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:32,090
They who run this place must be
public benefactors.

654
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:33,967
Let's go and get a table.

655
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,058
Very pretty.
I like New York very much.

656
00:44:41,162 --> 00:44:42,830
I'm glad.

657
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,750
Perhaps you'll stay here longer
than you thought you might.

658
00:44:45,854 --> 00:44:46,793
Well,

659
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:50,130
another hundred years,
at least.

660
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,903
( giggling )

661
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,117
- Greetings, Hercules.
- Mercury.

662
00:46:15,117 --> 00:46:17,724
- What brings you down here?
- You.

663
00:46:17,828 --> 00:46:21,061
- Zeus, he sent you?
- I am here at his command.

664
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:22,416
Why?

665
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:26,066
To ask you in Zeus' name
to return to Olympus with me.

666
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:28,152
I don't wish to return yet.

667
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,237
Zeus insists on it.

668
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:31,801
I like it down here.

669
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:34,513
Do not defy Zeus.
You can only suffer by it.

670
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:36,598
He's all the time
nagging me.

671
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:38,997
Mercury: It is out of the love
he bears you.

672
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:41,186
When did you see
my father last?

673
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,751
About five minutes ago.

674
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:45,149
How did you leave things
in Olympus?

675
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:47,965
About the same.
Everybody misses you.

676
00:46:47,965 --> 00:46:49,946
Hercules: J uno, too?

677
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,448
Well, you know J uno
and her jealousy

678
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:54,951
of every woman
Zeus looks twice at.

679
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:58,080
Venus especially asked me
to give you her best wishes.

680
00:46:57,975 --> 00:47:00,165
Tell Zeus I'll come back
when I'm ready.

681
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:03,085
I wouldn't want to do that.
You know how handy he is

682
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:05,066
in throwing those thunderbolts
when he's angry.

683
00:47:05,066 --> 00:47:08,090
I'm not worried about
Zeus' thunderbolts down here.

684
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:11,740
Zeus has another instrument
to punish those who offend him. . .

685
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,679
Nemesis.

686
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,285
He wouldn't send her
after me.

687
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,892
It was only at the solicitation
of your friends

688
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:21,334
that he sent me in her place
to make this plea for your return.

689
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,149
Why can't the old man
let me alone?

690
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:26,339
For the first time
in 2,000 years

691
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,154
I'm enjoying myself
and he's trying to spoil it.

692
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:31,553
This is no place for you.

693
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:33,534
Everything is changing.

694
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:36,975
Mortal man has no more belief
in the old ways.

695
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:39,165
I'm enjoying myself,
just the same.

696
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:42,294
- You are living a fallacy.
- It doesn't hurt me.

697
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,796
Such overconfidence
could be ruinous.

698
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:49,489
I'm going
to take a shower.

699
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:52,200
Please, Hercules,
come back to Olympus.

700
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:57,310
Now you're reasonable,
Mercury.

701
00:47:57,414 --> 00:47:59,812
And you're also
my half brother.

702
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:01,898
What harm am I doing
down here?

703
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:04,713
- You could do great harm.
- Harm to whom?

704
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:07,529
- Yourself.
- What are you talking about?

705
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:10,344
Hercules can only be
Hercules.

706
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:14,099
You are confusing these mortals
with your behavior.

707
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,080
Hercules: Ha!
I know a theater

708
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,165
on the street named
Broadway.

709
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:20,459
There's a man
who plays me so well.

710
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:22,232
They shower money on him.

711
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,214
It proves they know me.

712
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,133
I must get back to Olympus.
I cannot delay.

713
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:30,157
Zeus would hold it against me.
Are you coming back or not?

714
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,409
No.

715
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:34,120
Is that the message you would
have me deliver to Zeus?

716
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,457
I will come sometime,
but not right now.

717
00:48:38,604 --> 00:48:40,481
Then I fear for you,
Hercules.

718
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:44,026
Such obstinacy can have
only grave consequences.

719
00:48:44,131 --> 00:48:46,112
Give my regards to Venus.

720
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:47,050
Right.

721
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:50,596
She will be distressed to know
that you are defying your father.

722
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:54,350
I'm not defying him. I just want
to stay here for a while.

723
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:55,393
Farewell, then.

724
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:59,355
I carry your words back
to Olympus with a heavy heart.

725
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:04,256
If you will not take
my advice,

726
00:49:04,256 --> 00:49:07,176
then heed my caution:
beware of Nemesis.

727
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,096
Goodbye, my half brother.

728
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,075
I'm sure he meant well.

729
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,265
But, but. . .
he. . .

730
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:33,350
( stammering )

731
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:34,914
Ooohh!

732
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:03,591
Helen: You know what
I think?

733
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:06,198
I think he's slightly
demented.

734
00:50:06,198 --> 00:50:09,535
Either that, or he's the world's
most dedicated joker.

735
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,037
Perhaps he's suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

736
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,791
His name is Hercules,
so he thinks he's Hercules.

737
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,773
What's so terrible about that?

738
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,754
We've heard of people
who think they're Napoleon.

739
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:20,797
U h-huh.

740
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,091
But they're in institutions.

741
00:50:23,195 --> 00:50:26,532
The young man's aberration
may be a mild megalomania.

742
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:28,201
I don't care.

743
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,808
I like him.
Even if he is a bit crazy.

744
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:34,353
So do I , even if he did
crack two of my ribs.

745
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:37,898
A Greek peasant with delusions
of mythological divinity.

746
00:50:37,898 --> 00:50:39,254
Fascinating.

747
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:40,505
( doorbell rings )

748
00:50:42,278 --> 00:50:45,719
Open it up. . .
I've seen it, I've seen it.

749
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:46,971
He opens up. . .

750
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:51,246
I seen it!
I seen it!

751
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,436
- I seen it.
- Pretzi, how are you?

752
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,939
I seen it.
I seen it.

753
00:50:55,939 --> 00:50:58,441
He. . . he. . .
he flung himself

754
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:00,840
right out the window--
head first--

755
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,698
from the 23rd floor!
And then he fell straight up!

756
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,575
What are you talking about,
Pretzi?

757
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:08,556
I seen it
with my own eyes.

758
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,642
What did you see, Pretzi?

759
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,832
He called him, ''Mercury.''

760
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:15,752
They were talking
about his old man.

761
00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:18,359
Seems he come over here
to get him to come home.

762
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:20,444
But he don't wanna come home,

763
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:23,260
so Mercury throws himself
out the window,

764
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,137
straight up into the sky!

765
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,326
Take it easy, Pretzi.

766
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,829
- Get him a drink, Helen.
- No, please, no.

767
00:51:29,933 --> 00:51:32,853
No booze, no.
I think that's what did it.

768
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:36,294
I don't know. I seen it. . .
clear as daylight.

769
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:38,901
- A cup of coffee may help.
- Right, I'll get it.

770
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:42,551
Now, Pretzi, I presume
you are talking about Hercules.

771
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:44,324
Yeah, Hercules.
Right.

772
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:46,409
Did you have anything
to drink?

773
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:47,765
Well, I . . .

774
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,955
I might have had a couple
of snorts.

775
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:52,562
And how much is a couple?

776
00:51:52,562 --> 00:51:53,917
A pint.

777
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:55,586
A pint?

778
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,463
Well. . .
a fifth.

779
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,032
Relax. A cup of black coffee,
and everything will be fine.

780
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:06,431
Holy moley!
I tell ya. . .

781
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:09,872
I've never seen anything
like this before in my whole life.

782
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:12,479
( thunder )

783
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:20,613
That was the answer Hercules
gave you to bring to me?

784
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:23,533
It was not so insolent
as Zeus imagines.

785
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:25,722
I n fact, Hercules spoke of you
with affection.

786
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:28,746
- Yet he defied my command.
- But not in so many words.

787
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,145
He said he would come back,
but not just yet.

788
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:33,960
He dares to temporize with me!

789
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,359
I'll blast him!

790
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:37,610
Nemesis. . .

791
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:40,426
come here!

792
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:51,062
Nemesis. . .

793
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:54,712
Can I talk with you
a moment, Nemesis?

794
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:58,362
Make it brief, O wife to Zeus.
I am on a mission.

795
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:04,201
What punishment did my
husband decree for Hercules?

796
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,164
It is for him to tell you,
not I .

797
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,084
It is for you to tell me
when I ask!

798
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,065
Am I not wife to Zeus?

799
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,463
I order you!

800
00:53:15,463 --> 00:53:19,739
I am to convey Hercules to
the underworld kingdom of Pluto

801
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:23,076
where he is to remain
for a hundred years.

802
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,621
What kind of a punishment
is that?

803
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,707
Hercules will have
the time of his life

804
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:32,669
roistering about
with that lecher.

805
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:35,485
Pluto is the king
of all evil pleasures.

806
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:40,803
If it is Zeus' thought that
Hercules should reside in hell. . .

807
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:44,870
I have a keener one for him.

808
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:47,894
Let him stay where he is.

809
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:50,709
But Earth is where
Hercules wishes to be.

810
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:51,856
Yes. . .

811
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:54,151
but as Hercules.

812
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:57,800
- I don't understand.
- With all his great strength,

813
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:01,241
it sets him apart
from other mortals.

814
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,057
They might even make
him king because of it.

815
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:06,664
They have no kings
where Hercules is.

816
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,645
They're called ''presidents.''

817
00:54:09,897 --> 00:54:11,774
A king by any other name,

818
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:15,215
in his heart still thinks
of himself as king.

819
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,926
J uno delays me.
I must leave.

820
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:20,324
What does she have in mind?

821
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:24,808
Hercules' divinity.

822
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,998
His divinity?

823
00:54:27,103 --> 00:54:31,065
Since he seems to like it so well
where he presently is,

824
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:34,193
I shall give him a taste
of what it truly means.

825
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:37,009
He shall become one of
those wretched mortals

826
00:54:37,113 --> 00:54:40,137
he finds it so fascinating
to be among.

827
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:43,266
But Hercules is a demigod.

828
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:46,707
Thanks to my husband's
philanderings.

829
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:50,565
I can't take away Hercules'
divinity permanently. . .

830
00:54:51,712 --> 00:54:55,362
but I can make him
as other men for a while. . .

831
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,202
as long as the effects from
the powder in this ring last.

832
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:04,121
Hope for the best.

833
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,771
Open the face of this ring.

834
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:11,004
Pour the powder within
into Hercules' drink.

835
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:14,132
Then he will become
as other men,

836
00:55:14,236 --> 00:55:16,322
no better,

837
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,242
and as vulnerable
as any of them.

838
00:55:19,242 --> 00:55:21,119
It could mean that
Hercules could. . .

839
00:55:21,327 --> 00:55:23,413
- Yes.
- He could get killed.

840
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:25,186
It might.

841
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:28,835
J uno, I dare not.

842
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,338
I cannot take part
in undermining. . .

843
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:34,884
the will of the gods.

844
00:55:34,884 --> 00:55:36,656
Do my bidding. . .

845
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:41,870
or when I have Zeus
here in private

846
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,894
I might tell him
a few things about you.

847
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:55,322
And one more thing. . .

848
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:59,597
on your way back,
make a little detour.

849
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:01,787
Go see Pluto.

850
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:03,873
I have a message for him.

851
00:56:38,181 --> 00:56:40,787
Pluto: Forgive the barking.
It's only Cerberus.

852
00:56:40,787 --> 00:56:42,977
Nemesis: Seems to have
quite an argument.

853
00:56:42,977 --> 00:56:45,689
He does that sometimes
when he's angry at himself.

854
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:47,357
It's those three heads,
you know.

855
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:49,755
How have you been,
Pluto?

856
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:52,362
Pretty nifty, except it's been
a hell of a day.

857
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:55,804
A new shipload.
Ha! Look who's here.

858
00:56:55,804 --> 00:56:57,889
I'd ask you in,
but it's a mess.

859
00:56:57,993 --> 00:57:00,600
Thanks, but I wouldn't
have time for just a visit.

860
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,772
You say that Hercules
is the same as

861
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:07,587
all those foolish mortals
he finds himself among?

862
00:57:07,587 --> 00:57:09,568
Temporarily.

863
00:57:09,568 --> 00:57:12,488
Zeus has decreed
that Hercules should spend

864
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:15,616
the next hundred years
down here.

865
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:18,432
There has been an argument
between the two of them.

866
00:57:18,432 --> 00:57:20,309
And so J uno, um. . .

867
00:57:20,413 --> 00:57:25,106
wants you to have the opportunity
to make the most of this.

868
00:57:25,002 --> 00:57:28,026
What a triumph! What a coup!
What a feather in my cap!

869
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:30,424
To snatch the soul
of a demigod!

870
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:33,448
- When can I expect Hercules?
- That's the problem.

871
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:35,117
He refuses to obey Zeus.

872
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:36,994
Then he won't come.
Drat!

873
00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:38,662
Not voluntarily.

874
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:41,790
He must bring him
involuntarily.

875
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,667
And J uno has. . .

876
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:45,857
facilitated matters.

877
00:57:45,857 --> 00:57:48,568
Surely J uno realizes
that I am no murderer.

878
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:51,280
- I only punish.
- She understands that,

879
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,948
of course.

880
00:57:54,617 --> 00:57:58,266
But she also knows
that you are ingenious.

881
00:57:58,162 --> 00:58:01,186
And what she can't
accomplish by one means,

882
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:05,253
she is sure that you are
likely to achieve by another.

883
00:58:05,253 --> 00:58:06,817
You know, that is true.

884
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:09,528
I always thought of myself
as a god of ideas.

885
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,553
Then I'll leave the matter
in your hands.

886
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,117
Goodbye.

887
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,994
Goodbye.

888
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,160
Pluto: I didn't mind climbing
all those stairs to get here,

889
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,245
but heights make me dizzy.

890
00:58:56,349 --> 00:58:59,269
I'm not accustomed
to the altitude.

891
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,521
( chuckles )

892
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,876
Have you decided?

893
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:05,109
I don't care what Zeus
has decreed.

894
00:59:05,213 --> 00:59:07,090
I'm not coming with you.

895
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,010
- Some other century, perhaps?
- It'll be safer for you.

896
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:13,555
Safer? Hercules is a god,
and safe wherever he goes.

897
00:59:13,555 --> 00:59:15,328
Things can change.

898
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:17,831
You're being ridiculous.

899
00:59:19,812 --> 00:59:21,793
J ust listen to me for a minute.

900
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:24,817
You'll enjoy yourself.
You'll have a hell of a time.

901
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:28,050
I don't know what the occasion was
that prompted this influx of. . .

902
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,553
beautiful women. . .
- Go away.

903
00:59:30,553 --> 00:59:32,430
- You bother me.
- J ust listen.

904
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,932
I n this briefcase
I happen to have a contract

905
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:37,539
that was drawn up by the best
legal minds in the world,

906
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:41,606
who at the moment are involuntarily
the recipients of my hospitality.

907
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:42,962
What is it to me?

908
00:59:42,962 --> 00:59:45,360
I mean if you play
your cards right

909
00:59:45,465 --> 00:59:48,384
I can see that you can get
any one of those dames, women,

910
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,887
who might tickle your,
eh, fancy.

911
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,660
So just sign
on the dotted line,

912
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,537
and I'll take care of
everything else.

913
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:56,727
Why don't you
go back to hell!

914
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:59,021
You've been away
too long already.

915
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,002
Who is taking care of things?

916
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:03,192
Who is feeding Cerberus?

917
01:00:03,192 --> 01:00:06,737
How did you get here?
You always shun the light.

918
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:10,074
Nosy parker.
Did you notice how dark it was?

919
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:13,516
- So this is your doing?
- Um-hmm.

920
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:17,270
How about signing
on the dotted line?

921
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,085
No. If you don't stop
annoying me, I . . .

922
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:21,649
Listen, I'm not. . .

923
01:00:21,754 --> 01:00:23,318
I'm not afraid of you.

924
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,342
Hey, that's terrific,

925
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:28,427
but I'm also a god.

926
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:31,764
- I can try.
- You can try? Listen.

927
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,310
I'll see you later.

928
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,708
We'll be in touch.

929
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:39,481
You're gonna. . .
hear from me.

930
01:00:41,149 --> 01:00:43,861
I'll see you again sometime. . .

931
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:47,823
when you're run down.

932
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:04,612
Said on the phone
he'd meet us here.

933
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:08,053
Said we'd recognize him
by the briefcase he'd be carrying.

934
01:01:08,053 --> 01:01:09,930
Here he comes.

935
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:22,756
You weren't kidding about what
you said on the phone, were ya?

936
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:24,112
Certainly not.

937
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,700
Sure you'll be able
to handle it?

938
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:30,786
Man: Twenty thousand dollars?

939
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:31,933
5 to 1 .

940
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,085
Okay, pal, it's a bet.

941
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:40,588
You're laying 20 grand
at 5 to 1

942
01:01:40,692 --> 01:01:42,569
on Hercules to lose?

943
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,267
The money.

944
01:01:54,874 --> 01:01:56,960
What's your name?

945
01:01:57,064 --> 01:01:58,211
Where do you hang out?
Where can I reach you?

946
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,652
Don't worry about that.
All in good time.

947
01:02:01,548 --> 01:02:04,051
We shall meet again.

948
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:06,449
Mmmmm. . .
Be assured of that.

949
01:02:06,553 --> 01:02:08,847
Well, goodbye. . .

950
01:02:08,952 --> 01:02:10,829
for the present.

951
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,479
Till next time.

952
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:24,281
I don't like
that guy's looks.

953
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:26,992
He gives me the creeps.

954
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,765
He's dangerous.

955
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:31,163
I wouldn't welsh on him
if I was you.

956
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,500
What's to welsh?

957
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:37,211
Hercules is a cinch to win,
right?

958
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:40,965
If you say so.

959
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,885
He'll walk into a room
he won't walk out of

960
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,866
if he don't come through
for me.

961
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,308
Twenty grand, huh?

962
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:51,602
That's a lot of dough.

963
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,626
Figure this guy knows
something we don't know?

964
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:57,441
What could he know?

965
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,840
He's a long shot plunger!

966
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:00,987
( laughing )

967
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:28,933
- Disturbing you?
- No, dear, come in.

968
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,227
Did you see
today's newspaper?

969
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:33,834
Not yet.
Anything of special interest?

970
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:35,920
An item
in Wesley Watkins' column.

971
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,171
Listen. . .

972
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,778
''New Yorkers are talking
about the claim

973
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:42,177
of champion wrestling contender,
Hercules the Great

974
01:03:42,177 --> 01:03:44,471
that he's the strongest man
in the world.''

975
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:46,556
I wouldn't be inclined
to dispute that.

976
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,121
Someone does. Listen.

977
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,936
''Foremost among those
to dispute this statement

978
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,543
is circus strongman,
Monstro the Magnificent.

979
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:56,046
He declares himself
as willing to put up

980
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,800
$1 0,000 on the outcome
of a weightlifting contest.''

981
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:02,511
There's a man with
his work cut out for him.

982
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:05,327
''Broadway scuttlebutt has it

983
01:04:05,327 --> 01:04:07,099
that the matter
may be settled

984
01:04:07,308 --> 01:04:09,706
on a national variety
television program.''

985
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:13,252
I personally have no doubt
as to the outcome.

986
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:16,693
Hi!
Came to wish you luck.

987
01:04:16,693 --> 01:04:17,736
Thank you.

988
01:04:17,736 --> 01:04:19,717
Father's out front
rooting for you, too.

989
01:04:19,717 --> 01:04:21,490
I'm glad for it.

990
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:23,262
Man: How's it going, pal?

991
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:26,495
- Greetings.
- All set for the big match?

992
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,623
- It doesn't bother me.
- You'll take him, all right.

993
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,960
- What can stop me?
- Glad to hear you say that.

994
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,297
I got a lot of dough spread out
on those muscles of yours.

995
01:04:36,297 --> 01:04:39,217
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worrying.

996
01:04:39,217 --> 01:04:42,658
J ust reminding you that if
anything goes wrong,

997
01:04:42,658 --> 01:04:45,787
I'm not gonna like losing
all that money,

998
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,872
and you won't like it,
either.

999
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:50,479
I understand. It is not pleasant
to lose money

1000
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:52,773
once one becomes
accustomed to its use.

1001
01:04:52,773 --> 01:04:55,172
Yeah. I don't back losers. . .

1002
01:04:55,172 --> 01:04:56,632
ever!

1003
01:04:56,632 --> 01:04:58,091
Very practical.

1004
01:04:58,196 --> 01:05:00,490
So don't lose.

1005
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:06,225
Who was that?

1006
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,875
I believe
he was threatening you.

1007
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:12,169
- He was?
- Yes!

1008
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:15,193
If you don't win,
he means to harm you.

1009
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:17,487
Who can harm Hercules?

1010
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:19,677
He's a bad guy, Herc.
Gee. . .

1011
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:23,118
I wish we didn't have nothing
to do with him.

1012
01:05:23,118 --> 01:05:24,995
You're okay, ain't you?

1013
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:26,247
I'm fine.

1014
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:28,541
PA: Hercules the Great
on stage!

1015
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,418
Well, that's you.

1016
01:05:30,418 --> 01:05:32,399
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

1017
01:05:32,503 --> 01:05:34,485
Thanks a lot.
Okay, Herc,

1018
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:37,300
you're all ready.
Remember everything I told you.

1019
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,533
You won't forget. Whatever you do,
don't get nervous.

1020
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:42,514
I mean, just. . . just. . .
keep calm.

1021
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:45,330
Don't strain yourself because
you could get a hernia.

1022
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:48,458
Whatever you do, Herc,
just stay calm.

1023
01:05:48,562 --> 01:05:50,648
And listen, Herc,

1024
01:05:50,752 --> 01:05:53,255
watch out for Monstro. . .

1025
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,174
Wasn't he something,
folks?

1026
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:59,824
And now we have a special
treat for all you girls and guys.

1027
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,953
An exhibition of
the defense of manly art.

1028
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:05,872
Speculation throughout
the city has been rife.

1029
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:09,314
Who is the strongest?
Monstro the Magnificent?

1030
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:11,399
( cheers and applause )

1031
01:06:14,006 --> 01:06:15,466
Ooh, hey!

1032
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:19,116
Or Hercules the Great?
Let's bring Herc on.

1033
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:21,306
You go out there
and get him.

1034
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,017
Remember what I taught you.
Don't forget, now.

1035
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,126
There he goes.
Very glad to have you on the show.

1036
01:06:30,274 --> 01:06:31,316
Whew!

1037
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,653
Now this contest of strength
will begin with the challenger,

1038
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:37,886
Monstro the Magnificent,
who will snatch, press. . .

1039
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,389
- That's ''clean and jerk.''
- I'm sorry.

1040
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:43,517
Who will clean and jerk
barbells weighing. . .

1041
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:44,977
- 500 pounds?
- 500.

1042
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:46,645
500 pounds!

1043
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,209
( applause )

1044
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:56,447
( drum roll )

1045
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,790
Host: Let's give him
a great big hand!

1046
01:07:04,894 --> 01:07:06,667
Monstro the Magnificent.

1047
01:07:06,771 --> 01:07:08,439
( applause )

1048
01:07:10,212 --> 01:07:13,236
And now Hercules the Great.
500 pounds.

1049
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:15,009
( applause )

1050
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,263
( applause )

1051
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,998
And now,
item number two.

1052
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:46,084
7 50 pounds.

1053
01:07:46,084 --> 01:07:49,317
Monstro the Magnificent.
Let's give him a hand.

1054
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:52,028
( applause )

1055
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,659
( drum roll )

1056
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,627
Not now, dum-dum.

1057
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:08,191
Wonderful.

1058
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,589
And now, Hercules the Great.

1059
01:08:10,589 --> 01:08:12,988
7 50 pounds.

1060
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,865
( applause )

1061
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:49,068
For Hercules, 7 50 pounds,
ladies and gentlemen.

1062
01:08:49,068 --> 01:08:51,049
( applause )

1063
01:08:51,154 --> 01:08:55,429
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in this struggle of the titans,

1064
01:08:55,325 --> 01:08:57,932
One thousand pounds!

1065
01:08:58,036 --> 01:09:00,435
Monstro the Magnificent.

1066
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,416
Let's hear it for Monstro!

1067
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:04,189
( applause )

1068
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:20,039
Host: Ladies and gentlemen,
Monstro the Magnificent!

1069
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:22,333
( applause )

1070
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,485
Whoa, look at that!
Look at that!

1071
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:31,822
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Monstro the Magnificent!

1072
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:34,742
Host: And now,
Hercules the Great.

1073
01:09:34,846 --> 01:09:37,036
One thousand pounds.

1074
01:10:01,437 --> 01:10:02,480
Double cross.

1075
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:19,790
( groaning )

1076
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:25,421
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a hand for Hercules.

1077
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:30,010
A real effort.
A real effort.

1078
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,930
Host: And now the winner,
Monstro the Magnificent!

1079
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,456
But, but what happened?

1080
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:41,376
I don't know!
I could not lift it.

1081
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:44,400
My strength,
it seemed to have gone.

1082
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,381
Come on,
we gotta get out of here!

1083
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,197
There's no time to get dressed.
We'll go this way.

1084
01:10:49,197 --> 01:10:50,553
Down the fire escape!

1085
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:54,202
Let's hear it,
ladies and gentlemen. Come on!

1086
01:10:54,098 --> 01:10:55,975
Let's hear it for Monstro!

1087
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:57,956
( applause )

1088
01:10:58,895 --> 01:11:01,293
Father, this is terrible.
We've got to go!

1089
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:02,440
Why, Helen?

1090
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:04,526
- Come on.
- What's happened?

1091
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,237
Hercules is in trouble.

1092
01:11:07,237 --> 01:11:10,887
Although that represents
no novelty, I find it forbidding.

1093
01:11:10,991 --> 01:11:12,868
He brought it on himself.

1094
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,726
One thing
I do not understand. . .

1095
01:11:16,726 --> 01:11:21,315
I did not decree that Hercules
should be bereft of his divinity.

1096
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,339
It was my edict that
he be sent to Pluto's kingdom

1097
01:11:24,339 --> 01:11:26,633
for a hundred years.

1098
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:29,553
How, then, has this
other thing happened?

1099
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,620
Can nobody tell me?

1100
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:38,521
- Eros!
- Yes, sir, Zeus.

1101
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:45,403
Find Nemesis.
Bring her to me.

1102
01:11:45,299 --> 01:11:47,176
At once,
my liege Zeus.

1103
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,419
He should have been
back here by now.

1104
01:12:00,523 --> 01:12:02,922
His duds are here.

1105
01:12:02,922 --> 01:12:06,467
Which means he ain't
coming back here!

1106
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:09,074
Outside!
Get the boys!

1107
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,430
Get the boys.

1108
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,098
Get the boys.

1109
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,267
There goes the dame.

1110
01:12:33,371 --> 01:12:36,187
The big phony and the runt
must be inside. Let's go.

1111
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:38,064
They're probably on the floor.

1112
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:52,975
Follow them.
Don't lose them.

1113
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:07,053
She left without
saying goodbye.

1114
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:09,139
But don't you see
what she's doing?

1115
01:13:09,243 --> 01:13:12,997
She trying to draw them away
so we can escape.

1116
01:13:12,997 --> 01:13:14,978
You said those men
were dangerous.

1117
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:17,168
Dangerous!
Boy, I'll say.

1118
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,922
- H urry!
- Where you going?

1119
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:23,633
We have to stop those men.

1120
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:26,240
On foot? You're gonna
chase them on foot?

1121
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,743
- With the chariot.
- Chariot? What chariot?

1122
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:30,933
That's not a chariot.
What are you doing?

1123
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,711
Now he's done it!

1124
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:40,944
Man: Hey, come back
with my chariot!

1125
01:13:46,992 --> 01:13:49,599
Hey, Mister!
Wait for your sauerkraut!

1126
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:07,222
Man: Hey ''Muscles,'' that ain't
the way to Disneyland!

1127
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,655
( cars honking )

1128
01:14:43,406 --> 01:14:45,492
We'll make mincemeat
out of those guys.

1129
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:48,516
- Coming up to a red light.
- Forget about the light.

1130
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:16,880
Cut them off at the zoo.

1131
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,757
Don't let those punks
get away.

1132
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:11,522
Where is everybody?

1133
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,391
( car honking )

1134
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:28,271
Where did that monster go
with my chariot?!

1135
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,252
I want my chariot.

1136
01:17:36,404 --> 01:17:38,907
Helen: We're out of gas!

1137
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:47,354
Let's get in there!

1138
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:49,335
Hercules doesn't flee
from anybody.

1139
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:51,316
Come on, Herc!
No time to argue!

1140
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:04,247
Zeus sent for me?

1141
01:18:04,455 --> 01:18:07,792
When I ordered you
down to Earth,

1142
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:09,773
did I not charge you to see
that Hercules

1143
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,338
was delivered
to the realm of Pluto?

1144
01:18:11,546 --> 01:18:15,092
- It is as Zeus says.
- Then, what happened?

1145
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:18,741
How is it that Hercules was
instead deprived of his divinity,

1146
01:18:18,846 --> 01:18:19,993
his strength,

1147
01:18:20,097 --> 01:18:23,017
and finds himself in his
present mortal predicament?

1148
01:18:24,685 --> 01:18:25,624
Well. . .?

1149
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:29,169
Well!?

1150
01:18:30,316 --> 01:18:33,862
I was sent on another mission.
The substitute.

1151
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:36,886
Who gave you another mission
to supersede that of mine?

1152
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:41,683
Speak up, or I will blast you
where you stand!

1153
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:51,589
( tires squeal )

1154
01:18:52,736 --> 01:18:54,822
Here comes Tony.

1155
01:18:54,822 --> 01:18:57,012
- Where's all the other guys?
- I n the other cars.

1156
01:18:57,116 --> 01:18:59,201
Okay, you take a couple of boys
and go in that door,

1157
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,808
all the other guys,
come with me.

1158
01:19:14,635 --> 01:19:16,512
Where are we going?

1159
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:19,640
That way!

1160
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:01,560
Now, Nemesis,
speak or I'll. . . !

1161
01:20:03,541 --> 01:20:05,627
No! No, Mighty Zeus.

1162
01:20:05,731 --> 01:20:07,712
I beg you!

1163
01:20:07,712 --> 01:20:09,694
It was J uno.

1164
01:20:09,798 --> 01:20:11,883
She bade me do what I did.

1165
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:16,055
So, interfering again.

1166
01:20:17,097 --> 01:20:20,747
I've told you I will not tolerate
your everlasting interference.

1167
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:23,980
I thought it best,
to save a lot of trouble.

1168
01:20:28,568 --> 01:20:31,279
I will discuss this
with you later.

1169
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:34,720
Zeus, will you not save
Hercules?

1170
01:20:35,867 --> 01:20:38,579
Let him abide
by the consequences

1171
01:20:38,683 --> 01:20:41,081
of his own folly
and obstinacy.

1172
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:57,662
Oh, no. Herc!

1173
01:21:08,715 --> 01:21:11,218
Hercules is in great peril.

1174
01:21:12,261 --> 01:21:15,076
If Zeus does not relent,
there's nothing we can do.

1175
01:21:14,972 --> 01:21:17,266
- There is.
- What?

1176
01:21:17,266 --> 01:21:20,394
We may send aid
to Hercules.

1177
01:21:20,499 --> 01:21:22,793
We?
Send help to Hercules?

1178
01:21:22,897 --> 01:21:24,670
You know where to find them.

1179
01:21:24,774 --> 01:21:26,860
And they'll listen to you.
I know they will.

1180
01:21:26,964 --> 01:21:29,884
- Who?
- Atlas and Samson.

1181
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,635
Hercules! Get up!
Come up here!

1182
01:21:50,635 --> 01:21:53,868
- Come on, Hercules.
- Hercules, get up!

1183
01:21:53,763 --> 01:21:55,223
He's not coming.

1184
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,296
Are you all right, boy?

1185
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,633
You all right?

1186
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:17,852
Go get them!
Come on, go get them!

1187
01:22:57,061 --> 01:23:00,710
Who sent Atlas and Samson
to Hercules' aid?

1188
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:04,881
Is it not enough that Hercules
has been causing

1189
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:06,758
all that trouble
by himself?

1190
01:23:06,758 --> 01:23:09,470
Call those other two away,
at once.

1191
01:23:13,641 --> 01:23:15,414
Mercury. . .?

1192
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,897
- Zeus?
- Was it you?

1193
01:23:21,357 --> 01:23:23,234
It was I .

1194
01:23:25,216 --> 01:23:28,344
How dare you
go above my head?

1195
01:23:28,344 --> 01:23:31,577
I feared
for Hercules' safety.

1196
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:34,705
Bereft of his strength,
he's as helpless as a child

1197
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,895
in the world of mortal men.

1198
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,336
It is not to be borne.

1199
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:43,986
Hercules treated as a common
mortal by those scoundrels.

1200
01:23:43,882 --> 01:23:46,071
Then save him, Mighty Zeus!

1201
01:23:46,176 --> 01:23:48,991
He deserves all he's getting.

1202
01:23:49,095 --> 01:23:52,849
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

1203
01:23:53,788 --> 01:23:56,812
Hercules is a son of Zeus.

1204
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:59,002
I n treating him as they do,

1205
01:23:59,002 --> 01:24:03,590
those scoundrels down there
show disrespect for his father.

1206
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,571
Then save him,
Great Zeus,

1207
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:08,700
even if it is only because
he is your son.

1208
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:48,534
No mortal shall ever triumph
over a son of Zeus!

1209
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:02,716
( thunder )

1210
01:25:40,465 --> 01:25:42,759
I don't see nothing.

1211
01:25:42,759 --> 01:25:44,949
It's all very dark
in there.

1212
01:25:45,992 --> 01:25:47,869
Fire torpedo!

1213
01:25:49,016 --> 01:25:50,788
Aw, you gotta put
a dime in.

1214
01:25:50,788 --> 01:25:52,457
Forget it.

1215
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:57,879
You can see
all the way to Jersey!

1216
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:00,278
It's really something, huh?

1217
01:26:00,382 --> 01:26:02,468
I've never been up here,
you know.

1218
01:26:02,468 --> 01:26:04,657
Kind of makes you
feel like. . .

1219
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:07,264
some sort of god
or something.

1220
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:10,601
Too bad it's a little
cloudy today.

1221
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:13,208
Well, you can still see
pretty far.

1222
01:26:14,147 --> 01:26:16,128
I can see the whole river.

1223
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:19,465
Look at that big boat
down there.

1224
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:22,698
You know, Herc,

1225
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:25,305
that looks like the boat
you were on.

1226
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,329
Take a look at it, Herc,
I think it's. . .

1227
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:30,101
Hey, Herc?

1228
01:26:30,206 --> 01:26:31,770
Where'd you go, Herc?

1229
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,960
I have been willful.

1230
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,150
I have been disobedient.

1231
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:40,112
Mighty Zeus has more wisdom
than Hercules.

1232
01:26:40,216 --> 01:26:42,719
He knew better
what is best for him.

1233
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:44,596
Please, Mighty Zeus, relent.

1234
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,289
You'll be sorry.

1235
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:51,896
Zeus has only to speak now

1236
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,981
for Hercules to obey.

1237
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:55,858
( thunder )

1238
01:27:01,385 --> 01:27:03,053
Herc?

1239
01:27:03,053 --> 01:27:05,035
Where'd you go, Herc?

1240
01:27:05,139 --> 01:27:06,703
Hey, Herc!

1241
01:27:10,144 --> 01:27:11,291
Herc!

1242
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:51,230
H uh, strongest guy
in the world. . .

1243
01:27:52,273 --> 01:27:56,027
tying up with a nothing
like me.

1244
01:27:56,131 --> 01:27:57,591
Imagine. . .

1245
01:27:59,051 --> 01:28:02,492
He really made me feel
like something. . .

1246
01:28:02,492 --> 01:28:05,620
a half-pint like me.

1247
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,123
I ain't never gonna
forget him.

1248
01:28:09,896 --> 01:28:11,147
Never.

1249
01:28:13,337 --> 01:28:15,944
Only, where did he go?

1250
01:28:18,551 --> 01:28:20,324
( jazz music )

1251
01:28:21,575 --> 01:28:23,661
Radio: Don't grieve,
my friend.

1252
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,642
I n the memory
that leaves you,

1253
01:28:25,746 --> 01:28:28,040
separation may have
a quiet happiness all its own.

1254
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,396
Herc?

1255
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:32,629
We are friends, you and I .

1256
01:28:32,733 --> 01:28:34,714
And nothing can
take that from us.

1257
01:28:34,714 --> 01:28:36,070
Herc?

1258
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,449
Herc!
Where are you, Herc?

1259
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:43,161
What are you doing
in my radio?

1260
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:44,621
Herc. . .

1261
01:28:44,829 --> 01:28:46,915
It's me! It's Pretzi!

1262
01:28:47,957 --> 01:28:51,399
Why did you take a powder like that?
Why did you just leave?

1263
01:28:53,276 --> 01:28:56,404
I didn't say anything
out of line, did I?

1264
01:28:56,404 --> 01:28:59,637
Or do nothing?
Did I , Herc?

1265
01:28:59,741 --> 01:29:02,765
I enjoyed knowing you,
my little friend.

1266
01:29:04,121 --> 01:29:05,581
Gee, Herc.

1267
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:07,875
Ain't I never gonna
see you again?

1268
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:10,273
Ain't you never
coming back?

1269
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:12,463
Even for a visit?

1270
01:29:12,567 --> 01:29:14,548
'Cause if you ain't,

1271
01:29:14,548 --> 01:29:16,843
it's sure gonna be
lonesome for me again.

1272
01:29:18,824 --> 01:29:22,161
Herc, we really did
all them things, didn't we?

1273
01:29:22,161 --> 01:29:25,081
I didn't just imagine
all them things, did I?

1274
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:28,105
It wasn't like what
the head shrinkers call,

1275
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:30,607
''wishful thinking,''
was it, Herc?

1276
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:36,134
Radio: Any time you wish me
to be with you,

1277
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:38,741
all you need to do
is think of me.

1278
01:29:38,741 --> 01:29:40,305
and there I shall be,

1279
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:43,017
in your mind
and in your heart. . .

1280
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:45,102
for as long as
you want me to be,

1281
01:29:45,206 --> 01:29:46,979
as long as you need me.

1282
01:29:48,126 --> 01:29:50,942
Radio: Due to temporary
atmospheric difficulties,

1283
01:29:50,837 --> 01:29:53,236
we were interrupted
in our broadcast.

1284
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:54,591
We resume. . .

1285
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,468
Herc?

1286
01:29:56,573 --> 01:29:57,615
Herc?

1287
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:06,271
''Any time you need me,

1288
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:09,920
any time you want me,

1289
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:11,902
just think of me,

1290
01:30:11,902 --> 01:30:13,987
and I'll be there

1291
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:16,803
for as long as
you want me to.''

1292
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:19,201
Yeah.

1293
01:30:21,287 --> 01:30:24,102
I think I'll eat an apple.

1294
01:30:25,145 --> 01:30:28,899
And this is what I saw
on the world below.

1295
01:30:29,003 --> 01:30:32,027
It all sounds
revoltingly noisy.

1296
01:30:37,971 --> 01:30:40,057
Leave me, now.

1297
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:43,394
I would think
on what I've been told.

1298
01:30:51,736 --> 01:30:53,613
You, too, my love.
