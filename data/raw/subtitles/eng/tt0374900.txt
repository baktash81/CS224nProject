Did you see him today?

344
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,101
No.

345
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,178
Neither did I.

346

- Do you need a ride?
- <i>No.</i>

347
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:22,183

<i>is a good little area right here.</i>

352
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,412
We should do it there. Don't go down here,
'cause they don't have any money.

00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:55,747
<i>[Kip]</i>
<i>So, how long are we talkin' about workin'?</i>

<i>You're already losing your steam?</i>

355
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:02,055
No. I just--
I have a chat room meeting at 4:00.

356
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,093
I gotta be back here by then.

357
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:07,459
- All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all.
- All right.

358
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:10,055
Or else work afterwards.
How long's the chat room?

359
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:13,330
Geez, sometimes up to
three, four hours maybe.

360
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,573
Maybe not.
I don't know.

361
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,642
You-- You pay the bills
for that?

362
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,837
Does that cost money every time
you're on, like for minutes on the phone?

363
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,846
Yeah. Grandma's still
payin' per minute.

364
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,008
She gets kind of pissed at me
sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.

365
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,985
I'll bet she does.
I'd be throwin' you out the window.

- I'm one of Pedro's best friends.
- Your name is Napoleon?

371

Yes. Is Pedro there?

00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,720
Let's go, Kipper.
I think we should take this...

378
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,313
- someplace a little more private.
- That's a good idea.

<i>Before we get started on our new project,</i>
<i>I have a few concerns.</i>

383
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:35,046
First off, I'm concerned about
your transportation situation.

384
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:38,519
I mean, do you-- you got a car
you can borrow from someone?

385
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,522
Well, that's the problem
right now.

386
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:42,524
At the moment,
nothing comes to mind.

387
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:53,993
<i>You can borrow my van for the time being.</i>
<i>I-- I do better on foot anyway.</i>

388
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:57,904
We also need some way to make us
look official, like we got all the answers.

389
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,374
How about some gold bracelets?

390
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,579
We need, like,
some name tags...

391
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,773
with our picture on it,
all laminated and whatnot.

392
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,782
I mean, we gotta
look legit, man.

393
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,784
<i>That's true. That's true.</i>

394
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,582
<i>Say, you know of a-- a place</i>
<i>we can get our picture taken...</i>

395
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,589
like a-- a photo store?

396
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,591
Okay.

397
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,287
Turn your head
on more of a slant.

398
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,792
<i>Now, make a fist...</i>

399
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,061
and slowly ease it up
underneath your chin.

400
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:33,873
- This is looking really good.
- You can say that again.

<i>[Deb]</i>
<i>Okay, hold still right there.</i>

402
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,773
Now, just imagine
you're weightless.

403
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:44,046
You're in the middle
of the ocean...

404
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:47,123

tiny little sea horses.

Uh, you did it?

Wow. Wow, that felt

Thanks, Deb.

410
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:10,611
- [Buzzing]
- [Chuckles] You're up, Kip.

411
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,646
Is there some kind of vest
that I can wear?

412
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,094
- Where have you been?
- I got sick.

413
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,192
Has Summer said
anything to you yet?

414
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,463
No, not yet.

415
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,368
Well, she said no.

416
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,373
She did?

417
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,835
- Well, what about that other girl?
- What other girl?

418
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:46,006
- The one that left all that crap on your porch.
- You mean Deb?

419
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:48,710
- <i>Yes, her.</i>
- What about her?

420
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,616
- Well, I asked her out too.
- What?

421
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,812
Well, nobody's gonna
go out with <i>me</i>.

422
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:31,719
- Have you asked anybody yet?
- No, but who would?

423
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:35,195
- I don't even have any good skills.
- What do you mean?

424
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,664

bow hunting skills...

426
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,134
computer hacking skills.

427
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,875

who have great skills.

428
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,171
<i>Aren't you pretty good</i>
<i>at drawing, like...</i>

00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,442
Yes.

431
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,882
Probably the best
that I know of.

432
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:58,613
Just draw a picture of the girl
you want to take out...

433
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:01,350
and give it to her
for, like, a gift or something.

434
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,723
That's a pretty good idea.

435
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,324
Now, if you invest
in the 24-piece set...

436
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,893
I'm gonna throw in
a little gift.

437
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,258
So, what's the gift?

438
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:45,560
I bet you folks
don't have one of these.

439
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,768
I want that.

440
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:55,868
You see, this ain't
your run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware."

441
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,608
These are some serious
"NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.

442
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:02,708
<i>So, if we purchase</i>
<i>the 24-piece set...</i>

443
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,753
the mini sailboat
is included?

444
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,947
That's correct, sir.

00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:10,184
