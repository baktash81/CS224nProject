1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,524
A SERBIAN FILM

2
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:04,314
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

3
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,990
Are you insane?

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,492
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,997
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

6
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,791
Sorry, but it's not a big deal.

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,812
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

8
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:10,000
How are you, kiddo?

9
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,803
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

10
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,141
Marija, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,311
I dug up that DVD because...

12
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,647
Lejla called and
wanted to see me today.

13
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:26,984
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

14
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:29,779
The jumping bread!

15
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:37,749
Mom, what was dad doing there?

16
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,915
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

17
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,126
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

18
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,173
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

19
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:57,349
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

20
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:11,498
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

21
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:13,382
That's why I drink it.

22
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:24,518
- So, how's family life?
- Nice.

23
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:27,897
How are Petar and... Marija?

24
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,678
Yes, Marija.
They're fine.

25
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,188
Petar's starting school next year.

26
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:37,490
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

27
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,241
his father's occupation.

28
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:43,754
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

29
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:49,168
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

30
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,781
How much money do you
have stashed away?

31
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:55,160
5 or 10 grand?

32
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:59,438
Miloš, you were more
than just a porn star.

33
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,316
You were an artist.

34
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:04,433
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

35
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:09,707
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

36
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:11,871
And...

37
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,104
I'm your guardian angel.

38
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,795
Listen. Something big is about to happen.

39
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:24,311
Artistic pornography of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

40
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:25,878
In Serbia?

41
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,649
Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

42
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,965
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid.

43
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:39,439
If you accept, your family will be
settled till the end of Petar's life.

44
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:46,100
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

45
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,204
Be nice to him.

46
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:53,014
Here's something for the junior.

47
00:05:58,237 --> 00:06:01,741
Wow, where's his pussy?

48
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:05,217
You didn't tell me you brought
your policeman brother here.

49
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,186
I came on my own.

50
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:11,813
I knew you'd be here and couldn't
miss a chance to see you.

51
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,987
I'm your great admirer.

52
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,559
You're well preserved.

53
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,229
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

54
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:36,942
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

55
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,196
Everybody needs it.

56
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,369
These don't.

57
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:55,169
So long, fags.
Miloš, you heard my advice.

58
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:02,677
- A hooker!
- A porn star.

59
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,387
Has-been.

60
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,266
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

61
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,084
I know.

62
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:17,441
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

63
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,360
A natural talent.

64
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,681
Funny she hasn't contacted her
dealer in the past few years.

65
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,326
Is she off drugs?

66
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:29,775
Doubtful.

67
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,151
A new, rich provider, more likely.

68
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:39,255
You'll alienate me from my friends
if you keep checking on them.

69
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:42,836
Friends, in Serbia?

70
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,544
You can't check them enough.

71
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,349
I gotta go.

72
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,228
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

73
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:59,233
I'm paying for the bite.

74
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,779
- So long.
- Bye.

75
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,477
Sleeping time, hands up.

76
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,271
- Dad?
- Yes?

77
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,607
Know that friend of yours

78
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:42,193
that you were
beating in the video?

79
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:47,281
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

80
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:50,409
I know, but while
I was watching it

81
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:53,746
- I felt something strange.
- What?

82
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:57,166
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

83
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,754
- A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

84
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:05,716
Several of them,
like a family, traveling.

85
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,348
Do they live in me?

86
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:15,643
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

87
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,570
- Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

88
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,902
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

89
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,577
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

90
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,361
What language is that?

91
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,714
I'm translating for some Swedes.

92
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:47,383
Swedish? I'm great in it.

93
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,829
That's right.

94
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:56,225
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

95
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,612
You would be a mega star.

96
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,378
So, you say Lejla is
offering you a serious job?

97
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:28,007
So she said.
It's strange.

98
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:32,261
Why would anyone
offer me big money

99
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:36,900
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

100
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:44,507
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

101
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:01,432
Maybe they need the only porn
star with a university diploma.

102
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,259
Do you miss it?

103
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:16,430
- What?
- The job.

104
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,268
I don't know. No.

105
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:25,898
I miss the money, so we could
escape away from here.

106
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:39,370
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

107
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,668
How come you've never
done me like them?

108
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,517
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

109
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:06,952
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

110
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,390
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

111
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:07,518
<i>The Nikola Tesla
of the pornography world ?</i>

112
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,021
You must be Vukmir?

113
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,773
<i>Of course. Miloš, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

114
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:16,402
<i>right now and provide
for your family for good</i>

115
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:20,197
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

116
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,869
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

117
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:28,914
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

118
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,958
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

119
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:56,609
I'm honored to shake the hands
of such a great artist, I'm Vukmir.

120
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,195
I'm Miloš, nice to meet you.

121
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,616
The right hand...

122
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,459
is the sex center of any man.

123
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,915
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

124
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,669
Ever since your childhood.

125
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:17,621
Your hand is special

126
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:21,592
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

127
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,203
Miloš.

128
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,846
It's an honor to shake the hand

129
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,891
of such an artist of fuck.

130
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,609
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

131
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:40,552
Why not?

132
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,852
Bebecause they just want
to jizz into a napkin

133
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,784
what they can't into a woman.

134
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,371
These movies are
mostly made so that

135
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,957
those who can't
get laid can cum.

136
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,796
They're made by butchers

137
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:02,049
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

138
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:07,221
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

139
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:09,807
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

140
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:16,063
Do you know what proves that
there is art in pornography?

141
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:17,922
What?

142
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,356
You.

143
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:22,793
You, Miloš.

144
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,992
You are the proof!

145
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,288
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

146
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:36,208
of exhausting her,
your talent to humiliate her,

147
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,962
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

148
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,507
And your love for it,
that's art.

149
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,023
Sadly, this is no country

150
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,982
for real art.

151
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,813
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

152
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,900
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

153
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,194
are giving press conferences.

154
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:07,114
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

155
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,705
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

156
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,957
Just for the selected clients.

157
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:19,168
All right, but what is it?

158
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,964
Art, naked art!

159
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:27,784
Truth.

160
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:32,640
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

161
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,937
minimal editing.

162
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,607
There's a serious script.

163
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,861
We know it, you don't!

164
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:56,831
And what am I supposed to do?

165
00:17:57,164 --> 00:18:01,669
The same as always, Miloš.
Just stand before the cameras,

166
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:06,596
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

167
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:11,721
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

168
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:15,391
You're also tired of
humping scum

169
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,602
any time your family
needs money.

170
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,358
Kissing some wretched cunts

171
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:27,603
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

172
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,000
Thanks, doctor.

173
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,093
- What's that?
- The contract.

174
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:56,682
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

175
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,205
Something wrong?

176
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,712
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

177
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,799
You're not supposed to know.

178
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:33,260
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

179
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:32,601
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill.</i>

180
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:39,050
<i>A creek was frozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

181
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:46,472
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

182
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:52,373
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

183
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:58,683
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

184
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:05,874
<i>perhaps hes after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

185
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,357
Vukmir.

186
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:14,274
Sounds like a name of one of those
guys at the Hague tribunal.

187
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,781
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

188
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:23,162
No, he's some kind of an artist
philosopher with a grand plan.

189
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,539
Is it?

190
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,804
I don't know.

191
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:34,698
But it seems like he desperately needs me
since he's willing to offer so much money.

192
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:40,471
How much?

193
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:44,265
I won't tell you.

194
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,606
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

195
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,650
Ok, I'll tell you, just let go.

196
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,708
Don't tell me you refused?

197
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,835
Of course I did.

198
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,589
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

199
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,262
If I were, I'd have dumped you
for your brother long ago.

200
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,655
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

201
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:43,284
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

202
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:50,124
Remember what you told me when
I asked if you missed your job?

203
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:56,465
Miloš, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

204
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:57,940
If it's true...

205
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,201
If what is true?

206
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:05,130
That you were always
able to have it erected

207
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,005
without touching or looking.

208
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:13,772
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

209
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:21,298
I also know that you filmed
all your scenes in the first take.

210
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:23,723
Don't be so modest.

211
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:28,342
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

212
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:15,728
How long do you
think it would take?

213
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:18,572
A few days.

214
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:22,201
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

215
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:35,414
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

216
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:42,412
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

217
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:57,520
- Want one?
- Yes.

218
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:05,528
No thanks.

219
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,738
You said you would.

220
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,408
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

221
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,538
I miss female company.

222
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:19,834
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

223
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,455
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

224
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:30,219
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

225
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,725
You stopped hoping too soon.

226
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,893
Women here like men in uniform.

227
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:40,396
Especially if they're not wearing it.

228
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:48,612
Sorry, gotta go to the bathroom.

229
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:28,838
You know what
they say about rye.

230
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:34,802
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

231
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:38,472
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

232
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:41,475
- When exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

233
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:44,228
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

234
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:47,773
Miloš, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

235
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:52,236
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

236
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:55,489
It's a bit absurd.

237
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:58,951
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

238
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,166
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

239
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,251
Nothing is left to accident.

240
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,194
Miloš.

241
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,895
This is a serious organization.

242
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:17,134
My clients know
exactly what they want,

243
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,894
and I know what I'm doing.

244
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:23,399
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

245
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:26,068
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

246
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,573
relax and react as Miloš would.

247
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,245
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

248
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:38,873
but a live transmission of sex.

249
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,367
<i>- Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

250
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:44,712
Remember the little wheels?

251
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:47,339
I do.

252
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:50,426
Do you know how
to make them spin?

253
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,711
I do.

254
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,664
But you must do it yourself.

255
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:57,099
We all do it alone.

256
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,585
Tell me how.

257
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:07,267
When you feel them,
try to follow them.

258
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:10,613
It's a family traveling

259
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:16,494
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

260
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,795
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

261
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:14,143
Put it in your ear.

262
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:41,495
<i>Enter the building, relaxed.</i>

263
00:31:56,904 --> 00:31:59,731
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

264
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:24,872
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

265
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,886
<i>Be natural.</i>

266
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,405
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

267
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:41,448
than giving birth to you!

268
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:45,161
Haven't I told you not to let
the villains take you away?

269
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:48,122
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

270
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,708
What are you staring at?

271
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:02,336
<i>Bravo.</i>

272
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:12,545
What was it like?

273
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,849
Fine.

274
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:21,906
We were filming at a home
for orphaned children.

275
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,766
Where?

276
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,077
Drag yourself over here!

277
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,028
Look at yourself.

278
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:32,829
You can't raise a dick,
how will you raise a child?

279
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,503
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

280
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:39,237
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

281
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,569
Let me go, villains!

282
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:47,022
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

283
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,570
<i>- Honey?</i>
- Hi.

284
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,135
<i>What are you doing?</i>

285
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,149
I picked up Petar from classes.

286
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:28,979
I'm taking him to a costume party.
Are you coming?

287
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:32,283
No, I'm tired.
I must get some sleep.

288
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:33,556
<i>Everything all right?</i>

289
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,681
Sure. You two enjoy yourselves.

290
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:39,626
I'll talk to you later,
we must park now. Bye.

291
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:43,409
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

292
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,504
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

293
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:53,236
- Aren't you in action?
- <i>Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

294
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:55,554
I'm all dick.

295
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,809
<i>I need a detailed background
check on my director,</i>

296
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:06,387
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

297
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:09,881
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

298
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:16,465
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

299
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,857
Look, it's important and urgent.

300
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:21,901
<i>Understood.</i>

301
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,043
Everything Ok with you?

302
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,585
Yes, so far.
How about you?

303
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,296
Working on it.

304
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,200
<i>Light the candles.</i>

305
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:47,898
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

306
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:03,247
Baby, the time is flying
and your 'animal' is snoozing again.

307
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:10,504
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

308
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:16,010
- Blow harder.
- Bravo!

309
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:22,850
Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.

310
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:27,146
This is the present
from your uncle.

311
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,856
How do you open this?

312
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:41,181
Happy birthday, my sweet son.

313
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:37,168
What do you think, how does he
manage to be hard for so long?

314
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:40,879
It's not a dick,
it's a police baton.

315
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:45,574
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

316
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:54,320
Those bitches are leaking all over,
and he's servicing all three of them.

317
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,111
How come he's not tired?

318
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:02,301
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

319
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,199
You're at it again!

320
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,295
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

321
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,841
What was so urgent?

322
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:23,187
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

323
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:26,067
Are those cameramen real cops?

324
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:29,209
Are they protection? From what?

325
00:42:29,226 --> 00:42:31,333
Cut the crap!

326
00:42:31,334 --> 00:42:35,213
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

327
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,961
I may be dumb, but not naive.

328
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:43,090
Vukmir knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

329
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:46,468
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

330
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:51,027
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

331
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:56,075
Don't take it all out on me because
I fuck animals for art's sake,

332
00:42:56,235 --> 00:43:00,232
while you can't take a bit
of uncertainty for some big bucks.

333
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:04,153
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

334
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,780
It's not so bad, trust me.

335
00:43:07,573 --> 00:43:11,361
Better than the crap
you've been in lately.

336
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:19,585
- You know I miss that.
- What?

337
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:22,171
The certainty of that crap.

338
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:24,590
At least I knew
what I was filming.

339
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,139
Alright,

340
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,845
do you miss this?

341
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,145
You're losing it.

342
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:41,106
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

343
00:44:01,835 --> 00:44:04,630
You're resting
from healthy life.

344
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:09,414
How was the costume party?

345
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,140
- What's that?
- It's a balloon.

346
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:42,418
Your Raiko was a war hero.

347
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:48,340
If only he knew about
his wife’s whoring!

348
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:57,307
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

349
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:08,170
What the hell
is all this, people?

350
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,964
Hello, I can't work like this!

351
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:30,734
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

352
00:46:31,568 --> 00:46:34,530
Hit her.

353
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:25,581
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

354
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:33,247
Miloš?

355
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,641
- Miloš, what's wrong?
- I'm not doing this.

356
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,755
I'm not beating women
in front of kids or cameras.

357
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,356
Miloš, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

358
00:47:50,522 --> 00:47:53,692
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

359
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:56,153
You're like a Sunday
picnic for her.

360
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,197
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

361
00:47:58,364 --> 00:48:00,240
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

362
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:02,076
You're going against mine.

363
00:48:02,284 --> 00:48:04,620
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

364
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,539
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

365
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:13,115
Did you enjoy it less than that midget woman
who you locked up in an oven in Stuttgart

366
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,408
and pierced a hole in it so
she could suck you off for hours?

367
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:24,181
At least your dick enjoyed it,

368
00:48:28,435 --> 00:48:30,979
and he never lies.

369
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:36,652
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

370
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,574
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

371
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:49,373
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

372
00:48:49,623 --> 00:48:52,084
of the State TV.
It's getting better and better!

373
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,759
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

374
00:48:58,594 --> 00:49:01,221
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

375
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:03,974
with data from
the State Security.

376
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:08,771
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

377
00:49:10,856 --> 00:49:15,519
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

378
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,073
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

379
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:25,079
That's about it.

380
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:28,415
I don't know what bothers you.

381
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:34,463
According to this you've never
worked with a more educated man.

382
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,120
Who are you gonna trust if not a child
psychologist who is working for the Security?

383
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:56,215
<i>Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.</i>

384
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:45,946
Want something to eat?

385
00:51:46,027 --> 00:51:49,918
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

386
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,183
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

387
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:09,729
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

388
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:07,119
Today we're shooting
at home again.

389
00:53:07,747 --> 00:53:11,415
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

390
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:21,551
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

391
00:53:22,302 --> 00:53:23,452
No.

392
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:30,177
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

393
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,812
I fully understand you.

394
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,692
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

395
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:41,112
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

396
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,034
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

397
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:51,372
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

398
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:56,544
What did you say, kindergarten?

399
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,757
That's a good term.

400
00:54:03,468 --> 00:54:06,721
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

401
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,006
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

402
00:54:13,185 --> 00:54:14,647
Do you know what it feels like?

403
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,523
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

404
00:54:17,774 --> 00:54:20,610
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

405
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:24,572
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

406
00:54:24,823 --> 00:54:26,950
drink, bleed, earn money...

407
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:31,108
do whatever it takes to survive.

408
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,485
Until you die!

409
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:37,043
Would you believe me
if I told you that me and

410
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,423
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

411
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:46,469
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

412
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:52,434
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

413
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:57,188
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

414
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,109
and useful for anything.

415
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:08,491
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that.

416
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:12,369
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

417
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:21,606
No, Miloš, no, no!

418
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,356
Not pornography.

419
00:55:24,382 --> 00:55:28,325
Not pornography,
but life itself!

420
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:31,014
The life of a victim.

421
00:55:31,848 --> 00:55:34,809
Love, art, blood...

422
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,564
Flesh and soul of a victim.

423
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,818
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

424
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:47,656
and now is paying to watch that

425
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:50,992
from the comfort of an armchair.

426
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:54,621
I have no doubt
that it sells well

427
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:57,249
based on the sum you offered me.

428
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:01,127
Victim sells, Miloš.

429
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:07,968
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

430
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:12,389
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

431
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:15,976
We are victim, Miloš.

432
00:56:16,226 --> 00:56:19,229
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

433
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:22,065
We're just too retarded.

434
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:25,485
And I won't be
a victim bebebecause of that.

435
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:28,697
But Miloš...

436
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,783
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

437
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:35,185
Is that so?

438
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:42,335
Allow me, as your shepherd

439
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,671
to show you the power
of a real victim.

440
00:59:09,724 --> 00:59:12,911
Can it be that you don't get it?

441
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:16,315
This is a new genre, Miloš!

442
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,253
A new genre!

443
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:20,777
Newborn porn!

444
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,788
Newborn!

445
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:44,457
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

446
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:48,250
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

447
01:02:54,153 --> 01:02:56,322
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

448
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,667
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

449
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:27,258
If you only knew how easily

450
01:05:27,308 --> 01:05:29,456
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluted in whiskey.

451
01:05:29,486 --> 01:05:32,322
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

452
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:38,484
Viagra for bulls!

453
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:42,238
A special recipe concocted
by our sexy doctor who is

454
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,928
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

455
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:46,585
Can he follow my words?

456
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:51,842
Now, that's our stud!

457
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,050
Look at him, look at him!

458
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,219
Bravo, bravo!

459
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:47,188
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

460
01:06:47,397 --> 01:06:49,941
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

461
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:54,112
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

462
01:06:54,362 --> 01:06:57,907
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

463
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:03,955
Yeah, you bitch!

464
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,458
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

465
01:07:07,709 --> 01:07:09,878
<i>who conceive babies in lust</i>

466
01:07:10,044 --> 01:07:11,963
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

467
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,923
<i>The lustful brood of wenches</i>

468
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:16,426
<i>with endless gashes in them.</i>

469
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:29,158
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

470
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:32,301
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

471
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:34,235
<i>Imagine that, Miloš!</i>

472
01:07:36,645 --> 01:07:39,365
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

473
01:07:58,635 --> 01:08:00,637
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

474
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:04,515
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

475
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:45,925
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

476
01:10:49,303 --> 01:10:51,055
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

477
01:10:55,309 --> 01:10:57,103
<i>What?</i>

478
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,862
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.</i>

479
01:11:01,477 --> 01:11:03,758
<i>Don't worry, he will.</i>

480
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:08,498
<i>Fucking hell.
Ok, run now.</i>

481
01:11:33,928 --> 01:11:36,014
<i>This one is on me.</i>

482
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:14,719
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

483
01:12:14,886 --> 01:12:16,387
<i>I did what? How?</i>

484
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:19,849
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

485
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:25,530
<i>You had Miloš. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

486
01:12:25,563 --> 01:12:28,066
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

487
01:12:28,316 --> 01:12:30,860
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

488
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:34,781
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

489
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:39,619
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

490
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:43,498
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

491
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:46,251
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

492
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:50,588
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

493
01:12:50,964 --> 01:12:53,800
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

494
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,803
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

495
01:12:58,012 --> 01:13:02,635
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

496
01:13:02,703 --> 01:13:04,727
<i>What do you know
of ecstasy?</i>

497
01:13:05,645 --> 01:13:09,977
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

498
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,179
<i>I'm not working for you anymore.</i>

499
01:13:12,223 --> 01:13:15,399
<i>Nor is Miloš.
I'm taking him home.</i>

500
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:45,443
Get away from me!

501
01:15:56,508 --> 01:16:01,096
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

502
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:06,263
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

503
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:11,136
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

504
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:16,941
She was a shame to our house.

505
01:16:17,942 --> 01:16:23,447
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

506
01:16:25,574 --> 01:16:31,038
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

507
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:38,295
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

508
01:16:45,627 --> 01:16:49,058
There's not only house,

509
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:53,809
but a daughter to take care of, too.

510
01:16:53,978 --> 01:16:58,774
Our poor Jeca became an orphan.

511
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:03,320
My Alice in Wonderland.

512
01:17:05,744 --> 01:17:08,725
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

513
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:12,746
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

514
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:16,709
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

515
01:17:18,622 --> 01:17:25,068
You'll have the honor of giving
her a virgin's communion.

516
01:17:25,389 --> 01:17:27,750
To make her a woman.

517
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:33,543
Like my late father did with me.

518
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,240
Come on, come on...

519
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:54,254
Now!

520
01:18:06,054 --> 01:18:08,764
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

521
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,417
No, Miloš, no...

522
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,729
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

523
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:26,689
<i>What are you waiting for?
After him!</i>

524
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,875
- Marko, it's me. Come for me.
- <i>Miloš, what's wrong?</i>

525
01:21:06,925 --> 01:21:11,646
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm on Celopecka street, no 7.

526
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:12,990
Come and get me.

527
01:21:13,016 --> 01:21:14,190
<i>Miloš!</i>

528
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:52,896
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

529
01:21:53,229 --> 01:21:57,789
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

530
01:21:58,902 --> 01:22:01,946
Be polite, the girl is underage.

531
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:06,159
So what if I am underage?

532
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:14,250
Look at this jerk!

533
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:40,819
No, Raša, don't.

534
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:52,551
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

535
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,888
<i>into a shed during summer.</i>

536
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:58,252
<i>They leave them for a month</i>

537
01:22:58,795 --> 01:23:02,579
<i>until their balls
are like melons.</i>

538
01:23:03,214 --> 01:23:07,218
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

539
01:23:07,627 --> 01:23:11,406
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

540
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:13,066
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

541
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:19,501
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

542
01:23:21,425 --> 01:23:25,976
<i>You're a he-goat, Miloš.
I'm your monk.</i>

543
01:23:26,977 --> 01:23:29,605
Don't worry, my child.

544
01:23:35,605 --> 01:23:37,607
My he-goat.

545
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:44,959
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

546
01:26:57,308 --> 01:27:01,020
Welcome to a warm family home.

547
01:29:55,512 --> 01:30:00,362
A real, happy Serbian family.

548
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,316
Life...

549
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:07,544
Art.

550
01:31:37,202 --> 01:31:40,872
That's it, Miloš.
That's cinema.

551
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,633
That's film!

552
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:15,525
Get away from me!

553
01:36:59,658 --> 01:37:09,920
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill.</i>

554
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:17,482
<i>A creek was frozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

555
01:39:42,607 --> 01:39:44,123
Come on.

556
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:50,806
Start with the little one.
