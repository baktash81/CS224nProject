1
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,821
Ooh. Minion!

2
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,239
Freeze! AVL!

3
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,720
Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,418
- Stop right there!
- Grab her!

5
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,944
Oh. Ah!

6
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:17,033
- Yeah, baby!
- Attention, all units.

7
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,083
Whoa!

8
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,128
Look out!

9
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,087
- You like that?
- Hey!

10
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,800
Repeating, all units,
villain is heading westbound...

11
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,192
Ooh, baby!

12
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,455
The Anti-Villain League
can't catch this.

13
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,326
Guess who stole the map.

14
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,593
Hallelujah!

15
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:00,120
Yeah! I got this.

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,996
Good work.

17
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,523
The map to the legendary
Zodiac Stone.

18
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,179
We will become the most
powerful villains in the world.

19
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,574
Okay, let's get a move on.

20
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,489
We leave for Asia tonight.

21
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:50,909
Okay, let's see here.

22
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,457
I'm in.

23
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,962
Hello, beautiful.

24
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,283
Whoa!

25
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,589
What?

26
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,812
Oh.

27
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,058
Ha ha! Yes!

28
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,582
The Zodiac Stone.

29
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,194
Whoa.

30
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,334
Soon, the power
of these unstoppable beasts

31
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,293
will be ours.

32
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,389
Ah, for crying out loud.

33
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,049
Oh.

34
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,922
Whoa.

35
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,839
Whoa.

36
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:30,373
Hurry up. I got a bunch of
deadly tchotchkes on my tail.

37
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,375
Roger that on the copy.

38
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,421
Step on it, sister.

39
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,167
Hurry up! Come on!

40
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,955
Off! Off!

41
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,964
I got it. I got the stone.

42
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,661
Party's over, old man.

43
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,143
The Vicious Six has
a new head honcho.

44
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:04,755
You just got played
for a sucker!

45
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,454
Whoa! Hold on.
I started this group.

46
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,194
We're a team.

47
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,979
Where's your loyalty?

48
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,937
Oh, please. We're villains.

49
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,765
There's no such thing.

50
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,985
It's time
for the next generation.

51
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,544
Quiet down, class.

52
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,503
Quiet down, class.

53
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,332
People, people.

54
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,813
So, what do you want to be

55
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,616
- when you grow up?
- Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

56
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,860
- Samantha.
- I want to be a doctor.

57
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,035
- Wonderful.
- Oh, oh!

58
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,080
Bradley.

59
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,385
I want to be a teacher.

60
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,344
No, you do not.

61
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,911
- Ooh! Me, me!
- Yes.

62
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,130
I want to be a fireman
who is also the president

63
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,176
and-and also drives race cars.
Yeah.

64
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,091
Exciting.

65
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,397
And what about you, Gru?

66
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:07,443
Gru?

67
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,401
Me?

68
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:12,535
I want to be...

69
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,407
a supervillain.

70
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,062
Supervillain?

71
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,934
- Supervillain.
- Loser!

72
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,811
- Kelly!
- Daddy!

73
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,161
- Brett!
- Mom!

74
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,554
Gru!

75
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,295
Kiss-a la mama!

76
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,646
Oh. My favorite tiny relatives.

77
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,693
Eh, oh, no. Guys, come on.

78
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,738
Hey.

79
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,958
I got an image to uphold here.

80
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,179
Okay.

81
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,051
Hey, are you guys pumped
for the movie?

82
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,314
Let's go!

83
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,824
Oh, no!

84
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,286
Shark! A shark!

85
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,754
Oh!

86
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,320
I am a pinball wizard.

87
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:47,151
Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish. Swish.

88
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,588
Swish. Swish.

89
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,851
Swish. Swish. Swish. Swish.

90
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,422
- Bello. -Bello.
- Bello.

91
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,729
- Bello. Bello.
- Bello. -Bello.

92
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:07,781
Everything you got.

93
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,565
A little more. Come on.

94
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,220
Put some of
those sprinkles on there.

95
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,614
I like those sprinkles.

96
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,575
Cheese-Ray! Cheese-Ray!

97
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,969
Cheese-Ray!

98
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,666
Don't cheese me, bro.

99
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,064
Pank you!

100
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:35,069
Mmm!
So creamy, so delicious.

101
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,854
Worth every calorie.

102
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,248
Ah, mmm!

103
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,864
Bills, magazines,

104
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,605
S&H Green Stamps.

105
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,780
Huh?

106
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,608
Ooh!

107
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,046
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

108
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,788
Holy guacamole!

109
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,138
Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?

110
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,496
Hello, Mr. Gru.

111
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,021
We've received your application
to the world's best

112
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,719
supervillain team,
the Vicious Six.

113
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,722
A recent opening
has become available,

114
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,637
- and...
- And?

115
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,335
...your interview is tomorrow at noon.

116
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,076
Dyn-o-mite!

117
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,560
Please go to 417 Main Street.

118
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:35,346
The password is:
"You're no good."

119
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,653
"You're no good." Mm-hmm.

120
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,481
Now, get up on the down stroke,

121
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:42,484
'cause this invitation
is gonna explode, baby.

122
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,442
Explode? Oh.

123
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:46,749
Oh, no, no, no, no!

124
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,191
Oot!

125
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,671
Oot! Oot!

126
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,760
Oot! Oot!

127
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,414
Ooh. Very big news, Mom!

128
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,505
Mom?

129
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,946
Mom?

130
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,001
What?

131
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,046
Mom, who is this sweaty guy?

132
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,874
He's stinking up the house.

133
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,702
I thought you were
cooking cabbage.

134
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,878
He's my new guru.

135
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,797
Tell your weird buddies
they'd better start

136
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,538
pulling their weight
around here,

137
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,105
or I'm kicking them out.

138
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:41,369
They are killing
my mellow vibes.

139
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,982
Hey! I heard that!

140
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:54,295
Come on. Let's go tell
the troops the good news.

141
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,864
Gentlemen, to the basement,

142
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,388
aka our new evil lair.

143
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,697
This is fantastic!

144
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,048
Oh, construction
looks great, guys.

145
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,462
My first evil lair.

146
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,987
Goose bumps!

147
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,687
Well, you've got to break
a few eggs to make an omelet.

148
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,515
Am I right?

149
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,778
- Oh, great job, Ryan.
- Wh-Wh-What?

150
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,127
I said great job!

151
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,042
- Wh-What?
- Never mind.

152
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,828
Adrien, Mack, looking good.

153
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,009
Ah.

154
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,619
Joe, how's the family?

155
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:00,100
Hey. Good, good.

156
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,885
Okay, everybody, get over here.

157
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,890
Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

158
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,023
Hold on to your goggles.

159
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,634
The Vicious Six wants
to meet me.

160
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,854
Tomorrow.

161
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,509
Mini-Boss!

162
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,207
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

163
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,035
All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

164
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,732
Please stop calling me that.

165
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,952
And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

166
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,566
Hello, Otto. What is it?

167
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,831
Blah, blah, blah.

168
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,964
Uh-huh. Well, th-that...

169
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,443
Yes, I...

170
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:42,446
Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,057
I... Okay.

172
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,580
You know what would be fun?

173
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,364
Let's play the quiet game.

174
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,410
Oh, oh! The quiet game! Si, si!

175
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:53,240
Anyway, thanks for
the hard work today, everyone.

176
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,546
I got to go get some rest.

177
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,288
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of my life.

178
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,508
Watch out, world.

179
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,814
Here comes Gru!

180
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,079
- Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!
- I'm not...

181
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,559
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

182
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,956
Oh!

183
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,227
Oh, these guys are the best.

184
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,837
I can't believe it.

185
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,755
Uh, Mini-Boss?

186
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,108
Yeah, I get it, but I need

187
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,110
a good night's sleep,
so get out.

188
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,415
Oh.

189
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,593
Okay, fine, fine.

190
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,160
Because you had a nightmare.

191
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,946
But just tonight.

192
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,951
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

193
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,999
Uh, uh, excuse-a.

194
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,611
Oh, really? You, too?

195
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:02,135
- Mm-hmm.
- Get in.

196
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,487
- Good night.
- Good night.

197
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,272
Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

198
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,840
- Good night!
- Oh!

199
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:15,539
Oh, I just want
to get some sleep.

200
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,242
Breaking news:
The Vicious Six is ready

201
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:25,245
to rewrite the rules
of villainy.

202
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,986
Villains of the world,

203
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,380
in three days,
when the clock strikes midnight

204
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,817
and the Chinese New Year begins,

205
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:36,734
this bad boy's power is
gonna be unleashed.

206
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:39,302
With the power of the Zodiac,

207
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,566
we're gonna take out
the Anti-Villain League.

208
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,440
And the Vicious Six will be

209
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:49,530
the most powerful villains
on the planet.

210
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,576
Can you dig it?

211
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,797
Do I dig it? Do I dig it?

212
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,147
I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

213
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,497
They thought they could
leave me for dead, huh?

214
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,065
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat?

215
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,502
Oh, they got no idea
what's coming.

216
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,071
- Um...
- Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

217
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,744
- for what they've done to me.
- Uh, Mr. Knuckles?

218
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,074
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mr. Knuckles.

219
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,423
What?

220
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,859
We, uh, just wanted to make sure

221
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,600
we'd be getting paid this week.

222
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,124
What a mouth on you.

223
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,995
I'm paying you with knowledge.

224
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,779
You are? Oh!

225
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:25,044
Lesson one: Always be prepared.

226
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:30,745
Lesson two: The Belgian
five-armed nose pick.

227
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:35,141
And lesson three:
The Lithuanian haircut.

228
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,193
That's worth
all the money in the world.

229
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,605
Hey, guys, forget about it.

230
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,935
You're gonna get paid.

231
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,503
But first, we got to get
my stone back.

232
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:00,731
Yee-haw!

233
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,621
Guys!

234
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:25,016
Oh, you want to come.

235
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,279
Yeah.

236
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,150
Right, right.

237
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,370
Okay.

238
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:33,024
When you guys tracked me down

239
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,984
and responded
to my "help wanted" ad...

240
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,684
...I was like,
"Who are these tiny tater tots?

241
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,686
And where did they get
so much denim?"

242
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,609
And you just wouldn't quit.

243
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,017
All right, I surrender.

244
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,671
Come on in.

245
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,198
Huh?

246
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,810
We've had some great times
since then,

247
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,857
but the thing is,
the Vicious Six,

248
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,251
they're the big leagues,

249
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:28,428
and you guys are...

250
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,170
great, and so...

251
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,390
Uh, the job you did
on the lair...

252
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,479
A-plus.

253
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,134
It's just,
what I was thinking is that

254
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,789
there are a lot of
other villains in the world.

255
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,356
You know?

256
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,271
Uh...

257
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,797
Never mind.

258
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,235
Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

259
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,672
See you later, alligators.

260
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,416
Uh, Kevin? Kevin!

261
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,819
Uh, Ot-Ot-Otto. O-Otto.

262
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,792
Go, go, go!

263
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,322
Hey, I'm walking here!

264
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,586
Wow!

265
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,764
Ooh! Here we go.

266
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:46,288
Oh!

267
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,429
Excuse me. Sir?

268
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,912
I was just wondering
if you're... no good.

269
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,612
You're good. My mistake.

270
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,355
Oh, oh. Oh, sorry.

271
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,139
I didn't mean to scare you.

272
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:14,664
I was just, uh, trying out
this new invention of mine.

273
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,624
I call it Sticky Fingers.

274
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,626
Or Smart Goo.

275
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,542
I-I haven't quite landed
on the name yet.

276
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,065
Come here.

277
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,984
I overheard you were looking
for something...

278
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,638
special.

279
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:34,075
Ah, yes. I was hoping...

280
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,904
you're no good.

281
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,952
I think you'll enjoy listening

282
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,999
in booth three.

283
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,002
Right this way.

284
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,180
Aha!

285
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,408
This is it. Mum's the word.

286
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:03,800
Keep it down. Good luck.

287
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,280
Let 'em have it, son.

288
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,674
Thanks, Mister...

289
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,502
Nefario.

290
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:12,853
That's Dr. Nefario.

291
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:15,116
- Here, take this.
- Uh...

292
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,987
If you ever get famous,
remember who gave you

293
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,337
your first gadget.

294
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,427
Okay.

295
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:34,701
Try backwards.

296
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,616
Ah.

297
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,577
Welcome to the Vicious Six.

298
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,187
Whoa.

299
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:46,147
That is pretty... Whoa!

300
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
Hello.

301
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,168
Everybody here
for the interview?

302
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,344
Me, too.

303
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,215
So, what do you guys got
going on later?

304
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,608
Are you up to no good?

305
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:15,263
You gonna get
into some mischief?

306
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,615
Okay.

307
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,226
Send the first one in.

308
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,925
They're ready
to see you, Mr. Gru.

309
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,535
Oh, good.

310
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,841
Great.

311
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,408
Oh...

312
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,962
Distinguished villains,

313
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,399
my name is Gru.

314
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,054
I feel like I'm talking too loud

315
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:09,970
even though our proximity

316
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,973
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

317
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:20,546
If you told me when I was ten

318
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,983
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

319
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,159
of my favorite villain ever,

320
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,596
Wild Knuckles, I would say,

321
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,685
"You got rocks in your head."

322
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,253
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

323
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,734
it makes a lot more sense.

324
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:37,171
All right, who let the kid in?

325
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,434
I thought he was a tiny man.

326
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,045
What's wrong with you?

327
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:46,920
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

328
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,356
Um, yes.

329
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,576
I-I am pretty despicable.

330
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,795
You don't want to cross me.

331
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:55,885
Evil is for adults

332
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,802
who steal powerful
ancient stones and wreak havoc.

333
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:03,676
And not for tubby little punks

334
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:07,418
who should be at school,
learning,

335
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,464
taking a recess,

336
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,335
sucking his thumb.

337
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,773
"Sucking his..."

338
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,864
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

339
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,431
Who's next?

340
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:23,260
I am Wing Man,

341
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,611
the next member
of the Vicious Six.

342
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:29,005
Behold, the power of flight!

343
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,010
All right, joke's over.

344
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,882
Showtime.

345
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,409
This is a big one.

346
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,455
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,718
To the left. That's right.

348
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:04,406
Bring him in,
bring him in, boys.

349
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,608
Everybody pile on!

350
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:10,438
He took the stone!

351
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,528
I'll get him!

352
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,964
Oh! Ah!

353
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,794
Lock down the building.

354
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,758
Oh! Oh!

355
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,456
- Huh?
- What? -Uh...

356
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,459
Nothing to see here.

357
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,200
- Oh.
- Oh, look at you.

358
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:35,376
Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.

359
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:39,510
I...

360
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:42,470
Just keep walking.

361
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,786
Who the heck is that? A kid?

362
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,659
Oh, guys.

363
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,792
- Bello.
- Mini-Boss!

364
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,707
What are you doing here?

365
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
Okay, just get on.

366
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,668
Which way did he go?

367
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,017
There's that little thief!

368
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,845
Go! Go, go, go!

369
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,760
Split up!

370
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:28,777
Knock, knock. Delivery.

371
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:43,313
That demon child!

372
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,595
Otto, take the stone
back to the lair.

373
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,012
I'll distract them.

374
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:47,753
Go! Go, go, go!

375
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,888
Uh, uh... Ooh!

376
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,546
Oh, not now.

377
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,548
Come on, come on!

378
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,553
Oh!

379
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,916
Yeah, baby.

380
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,226
I'll handle this.

381
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,713
Hope you enjoy the rest
of your short life.

382
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,236
Please work.

383
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,891
Come on, come on, come on!

384
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,721
Yay!

385
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,688
We're coming for you, tiny man.

386
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:56,256
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

387
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,654
Josh, pump it up.

388
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:04,873
Up, up, up!

389
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:14,100
They all said the kid
couldn't be a real villain.

390
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,754
Well...

391
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,626
this kid just stole something

392
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,934
from the worst villains
in the world.

393
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:27,156
When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say...

394
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,204
"We have made
a terrible mistake.

395
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,946
Please join us. Please, Gru."

396
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,470
And I will say, "Yes!

397
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:40,866
I will be the newest member
of the Vicious Six."

398
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,869
Now all I need is Otto.

399
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,261
Where is Otto?

400
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,741
Uh, uh, Otto le come-ay.

401
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,264
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

402
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,353
He needs to "come-ay" now.

403
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,838
- Otto!
- Mini-Boss!

404
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,058
There you are.

405
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:00,711
Ah. You got it?

406
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:08,328
Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?

407
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,852
Otto, where is the stone?

408
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,028
Le scone? Ah, si, le scone.

409
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:15,117
Ooh...

410
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,135
Over there.

411
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,836
Oh, no!

412
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,719
Oh.

413
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,863
Mi amor. Mi amor.

414
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:09,911
I... love... you.

415
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,491
Huh?

416
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,409
Did you just trade my future

417
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:31,759
for a Pet Rock?!

418
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,066
Uh... si?

419
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,545
Okay.

420
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,244
Otto, where was
this birthday party?

421
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,333
Uh, uh...

422
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:45,033
This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

423
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,949
I told you guys
that you weren't ready

424
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,821
for the big leagues,
and you have proven me correct.

425
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:55,043
All you do is mess
everything up.

426
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,524
Up? Pump it up!

427
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,485
No play-a music a! Ah!

428
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,185
My mom was right.

429
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,361
You do not belong here.

430
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,580
You're fired!

431
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,107
I'm going to find that stone.

432
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,283
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

433
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,849
Mini-Boss...

434
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,330
And, Otto, close your yapper!

435
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:22,897
Oh.

436
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,205
Josh.

437
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,858
Si, si.

438
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,477
Uh, Gru.

439
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,131
Por favor. Por favor.

440
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,221
Kevin, no.

441
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,397
I will be better off on my own.

442
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,398
Mini-Boss!

443
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,359
Oh, no.

444
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:36,971
I'm sorry.

445
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,668
I thought you'd be impressed.

446
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:41,019
Could I just speak
to Belle Bottom? She'll...

447
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,374
Wild Knuckles!

448
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,028
Oh! Oh!

449
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,030
You're alive?

450
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:55,120
Wow. My favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

451
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,165
This could be
a great opportunity

452
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,254
if you don't kill me.

453
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,082
Shut up and give me the stone.

454
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,650
Oh, yes, the stone.

455
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,087
Here's the thing about that.

456
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,784
Kind of a funny story.

457
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,699
Give it to him!

458
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,879
And it's all going to go south

459
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:18,404
very quickly.

460
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:23,670
What the heck is this?

461
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,512
Where is it, boy?

462
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,036
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

463
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,951
I know you're hiding it
somewhere.

464
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,692
I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

465
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,974
Cross my heart and hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.

466
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:49,348
Don't actually do that, though.

467
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,567
Somebody bring me a phone.

468
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,484
Call home.

469
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,443
It's ransom time.

470
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,750
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!

471
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,491
Good one.

472
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:03,971
Call!

473
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,167
La telefono.

474
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,041
Huh?

475
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,528
Bello. La casa de Mini-Boss.

476
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:40,964
- Who is this?
- Kevin.

477
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,183
Kevin, uh, le Minion.

478
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,706
"Kevin le" what?

479
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,317
- Le Minion.
- You kidding me?

480
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,014
You got henchmen?

481
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,842
Well, that's the end of that.

482
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,539
M-Mini-Boss?

483
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,238
Listen, you, bring the stone
to me in San Francisco.

484
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,415
6830 Green Street. Got it?

485
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,331
Now, you got two days,
or you are never going to see

486
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,595
your little boss again.

487
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:04,727
Bello? Bello. Aah!

488
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,515
Otto...

489
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,256
Uh...

490
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,437
Ah! Okay, okay, okay.

491
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,786
Mm, hmm.

492
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:20,874
Ah?

493
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:31,580
Otto...

494
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:34,714
O-Okay. Si, si.

495
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,727
Otto...

496
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,685
- Uh, uh, si, si.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

497
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,778
Oh?

498
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,171
Oh!

499
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,738
Oh, the stone!

500
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,131
Uh, si.

501
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:02,524
Gave that to my uncle.

502
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,047
It's more his style.

503
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,574
Oh.

504
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,280
La-la... la stone-a!

505
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,542
K-Kevin! Kevin!

506
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,027
La stone-a!

507
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,987
I told you.

508
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:34,034
I don't know where he went,
you stupid Twinkies.

509
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:42,216
Uh, okay.

510
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,697
Uh, pank you. Eh, bye-bye.

511
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,395
Huh?

512
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,224
Oh, not cool, man.

513
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,281
San Pan-pisco. Oh!

514
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,385
Let's rock and roll.

515
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,169
Time to get our stone back.

516
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,954
We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.

517
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:27,000
Hallelujah!

518
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,223
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop!

519
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,664
Smash! Smash!

520
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,989
Flight 1109 will now depart

521
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,383
at gate 27B.

522
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,776
Ah. Bello.

523
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,126
Uh, trey ticket-as
por San Pan-pisco.

524
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:08,128
San Francisco? Okay.

525
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:09,782
- How will you be paying?
- Ah.

526
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,349
Uh...

527
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,220
No problemo.

528
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,048
Oh, great.

529
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,658
You know, if you have
any hair balls,

530
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,574
we can upgrade you
to first class.

531
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,663
Get out.

532
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,367
So there I was.
We lost thrust in both engines,

533
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,717
and I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.

534
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,024
Ooh-la-la.

535
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,461
- Hey, Sally.
- Hey.

536
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:37,592
Hmm.

537
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,639
Ah.

538
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,477
Okay. Vamos.

539
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,396
Ooh.

540
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:06,447
Bello.

541
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,318
- Peanut?
- Oh. Yes, please.

542
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,929
Ah...

543
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:12,671
Mm. Uh, peanut.

544
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:14,890
- Peanut.
- Uh...

545
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:16,588
Peanut? Peanut.

546
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,024
Peanut?

547
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:19,634
Hey, baby, peanut?

548
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,244
Ah? Ah?

549
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,942
Uh... aw.

550
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:25,901
Hey!

551
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,647
Huh?

552
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:50,709
Hmm?

553
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,510
Huh?

554
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,599
Hmm.

555
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,822
Uh, uh...

556
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,345
Ah.

557
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,826
Oh, bello!

558
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,089
Bello.

559
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,316
Oh, uh...

560
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:36,972
Ah.

561
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,869
You see me, you see me not.

562
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:46,373
You see me, you see me not.

563
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,201
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

564
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,223
No. No ha-ha.

565
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:16,185
You got real moxie, kid,
stealing from the Vicious Six.

566
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,013
I got moxie, really?

567
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:21,408
Did I just receive a
compliment from Wild Knuckles?

568
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:22,975
Oh, all my dreams...

569
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:24,977
are coming true right now!

570
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,414
Well, it's about to become
your nightmare.

571
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:30,025
Welcome to my newest
torture device,

572
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,245
the Disco Inferno.

573
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:39,818
Your Minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow,

574
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:43,212
because if 48 hours of disco
don't kill you,

575
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:44,779
the blade will.

576
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,043
No, no, no, no, no!

577
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,317
Stone-a! Stone-a!

578
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:03,624
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

579
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:06,409
Stone-a!

580
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,759
Stone-a! Stone-a!

581
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:11,980
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

582
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,765
- Stone-a! Stone-a!
- Hey!

583
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,593
Stone-a! Stone-a!

584
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:21,120
Stone-a! Stone-a!

585
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:23,688
Stone-a! Stone-a...

586
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,087
Look-a the map-a.

587
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,308
Gru...

588
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:56,677
Bello!

589
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:07,209
Next stop, Green Street.

590
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,517
Bye-bye.

591
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,694
Huh?

592
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:16,044
Hey, hey. Look-a.

593
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:21,920
Come-ay! Come-ay!

594
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,758
Mini-Boss.

595
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,982
Stuart.

596
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:44,638
- Mini-Boss.
- No, no, no.

597
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,161
Okay, okay.

598
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:03,352
Uh, uh...

599
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:08,314
Okay. Go, go, go.

600
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,884
Hmm.

601
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,103
Hey. Go, go, go.

602
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:18,846
Huh?

603
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,980
Hey, wait a minute.

604
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,156
Bello.

605
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,592
Oh, no!

606
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:33,208
Trespassers!

607
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,209
Get 'em!

608
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:35,384
Hey, you. Come back here!

609
00:45:38,474 --> 00:45:40,520
Go, go!

610
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,573
Kevin! Oh, okay.

611
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:12,465
Get your little butts back here!

612
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:22,431
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

613
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,439
Got you now.

614
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:33,834
Time to break some bones.

615
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,364
Any plans for the weekend?

616
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,504
Take five deep breaths.

617
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:53,419
I'll be right back.

618
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,595
Hey!

619
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:58,554
You like picking
on little guys, huh?

620
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:01,122
Go take a nap, old lady.

621
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,515
Old lady?

622
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:15,833
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

623
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:16,921
Ah.

624
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,629
Huh?

625
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,028
Ha-ha!

626
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:50,171
Get lost!

627
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,135
If you come back
to our place, you're dead.

628
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:58,658
Uh, come-ay.

629
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,272
Oh, pank you.

630
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:06,231
Pank you...

631
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,887
You can thank me by going away.

632
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,279
I'm working.

633
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:13,934
...kung fu...

634
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:16,328
You want to learn kung fu?

635
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,899
Bello, chica.

636
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,639
...kung fu
por smoochie, smoochie?

637
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,641
Mm, mm.

638
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,866
My teaching days are over.

639
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,260
This is my life now.

640
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:43,355
...kung fu para...
para save-a le Mini-Boss.

641
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:45,487
P-Por favor.

642
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,669
Ai-ya.

643
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:54,932
Fine.

644
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:56,542
I will teach you.

645
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:01,939
Hey!

646
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,046
Those are not for you.

647
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,680
Uh, excuse-a, excuse-a.

648
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,379
The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell!

649
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:23,786
What?!

650
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,536
Where's Gru?

651
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,016
Huh? How should I know?

652
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,496
What's with the costumes?

653
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,454
Halloween was four months ago.

654
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:41,456
You look stupid. Buzz off.

655
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,675
Shoo!

656
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:44,372
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

657
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,635
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

658
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,246
Uh-uh-uh. Don't touch me.

659
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,943
Now, where's the boy?

660
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:54,382
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

661
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:57,211
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

662
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:59,170
We just want to...

663
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,823
hire him.

664
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:05,350
Where is he?

665
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:07,352
Wild Knuckles, San Pan-pisco.

666
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,223
Wild Knuckles is alive?

667
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,312
And working with the kid.

668
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:12,618
- Hmm.
- Oh.

669
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:14,402
We're going to San Francisco.

670
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:17,057
Let's hit it.

671
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:24,804
You had better be paying
for my roof.

672
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,024
Ay, ay, ay.

673
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,288
- Ooh.
- Pretty groovy, huh?

674
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:39,688
We begin with a basic kick.

675
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:41,864
Now you.

676
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:47,435
Okay.

677
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:48,871
No kicking.

678
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,526
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

679
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,225
This is Fred.
He is a dummy.

680
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:57,054
Never underestimate a dummy.

681
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,447
- Ha. Dummy.
- Bello, Fred.

682
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:02,146
Now attack!

683
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:11,546
Stuart! Stuart!

684
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,428
Fred.

685
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:26,909
Doubt tells me
I cannot break this wood.

686
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:28,128
Uh-huh.

687
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:30,652
But doubt exists
only in the mind.

688
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:33,394
You know what I say to my mind?

689
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:37,224
Now you.

690
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,617
Uh, uh...

691
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,009
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:49,410
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

693
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,214
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

694
00:52:10,257 --> 00:52:12,172
Let's just train.

695
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:29,189
Oh, whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, okay.

696
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,681
Hoo!

697
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,905
- Huh?
- Rest up.

698
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:53,735
Tomorrow's going to be
even worse.

699
00:52:53,779 --> 00:52:55,911
What, you're quitting?

700
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:58,218
I told you,
when I get that stone,

701
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,741
we're gonna be unstoppable.

702
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:01,439
I have had enough!

703
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,093
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

704
00:53:04,137 --> 00:53:05,965
So long, old man!

705
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:07,532
Guys, come on.

706
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:09,664
We're a team.

707
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,417
Is this heaven?

708
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,419
I just had to fire my henchmen.

709
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:28,683
You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

710
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:30,598
Okay, I'm just gonna
untie you now

711
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:32,252
because I-I, uh...

712
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:35,255
I-I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

713
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,389
And it might be, you know, uh,
kind of nice to have a...

714
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:40,260
a little company around here.

715
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,609
Oh. Oh, yeah.

716
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:45,222
Two villains
just doing some chores.

717
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,702
Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into?

718
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:52,185
What's that?
That's your evil chuckle?

719
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,840
- Obviously.
- Well, it stinks.

720
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:57,059
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

721
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:59,279
Really?
Well, you look like a wizard

722
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,542
going through
an end-of-life crisis.

723
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:04,153
Easy there, Don Rickles.

724
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:06,243
Who's Don Rickles?

725
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,725
Stone-a.

726
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:13,815
Stone-a.

727
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:18,559
Stone-a!

728
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:23,608
Stone-a...

729
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,049
Dude.

730
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,269
Ah, I thought we lost you there
for a minute.

731
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,401
Hey, chill, chill,
ch-chill, ch...

732
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:39,145
Hey, you want to try this on,
little dude?

733
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:43,062
La stone-a!

734
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,934
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother,
where you jettin' off to?

735
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:48,154
...San Pan-pisco.

736
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:50,199
Ha! Frisco disco!

737
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:52,071
- Wow.
- It's your lucky day, kid.

738
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:53,551
I'm headed up the coast.

739
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:55,224
I could drop you off on the way.

740
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:57,076
Yee-haw!

741
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,041
...la stone-a!

742
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:09,654
Oh, look-a!

743
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:17,270
Huh? Hey.

744
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,296
Start with the pool.

745
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,795
This place has got to be
spick-and-span.

746
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:46,168
What are you doing?

747
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:47,735
You look like
the overcooked turkey

748
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:49,650
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

749
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,784
Oh, God.

750
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,134
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to mention,

751
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:58,485
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

752
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,534
Yeah, well, well,
doesn't scare me.

753
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,495
Be careful.
I can't have you lose an arm,

754
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,237
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

755
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,371
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

756
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:17,939
Betsy, knock it off.

757
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:20,507
Hey!

758
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:22,248
Whoa! Oh, no.

759
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,427
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

760
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:30,952
Whoa. Help! Oh, no.

761
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,085
The net!

762
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:36,349
I got you! I got you!

763
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,960
I don't got you.

764
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,748
Take my hand.

765
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,446
Whoa. Whoa.

766
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,317
I got you!

767
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,765
You could've run,
but you... but you didn't.

768
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:04,769
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

769
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:08,468
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

770
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:11,253
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

771
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:15,519
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

772
00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:18,696
That's all I ever wanted.

773
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:21,350
You want, uh...
I don't know, you want me...

774
00:57:21,394 --> 00:57:23,875
you want me to teach you
a thing or two?

775
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:26,443
Mm-hmm-hmm!

776
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:29,837
Many fighters have asked me,

777
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:33,362
how did I become a great master?

778
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:34,842
Hey, look-a!

779
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:49,335
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

780
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:51,729
You just dig down deep,

781
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:54,732
find your inner beast, and...

782
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:02,130
Uh... gesundheit?

783
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:04,176
Now you try.

784
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,612
Uh...

785
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:22,455
Find your inner beast!

786
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,763
Stop this kick.

787
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:35,033
We have a lot more work to do.

788
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,704
Eh? Eh?

789
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:48,410
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

790
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,068
No, no, no, no, no!

791
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:57,506
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

792
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,987
They're dead.

793
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:08,387
First rule of heists:
always stay in character.

794
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,215
Got it, Grandpa.

795
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:15,524
Say, do you mind
if we use the john?

796
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:18,658
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

797
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:20,181
Uh-huh.

798
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:35,849
The Bank of Evil.

799
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,209
It's showtime, kid.

800
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:50,995
Follow my lead,
and don't forget your cue.

801
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:55,303
Hello. I, uh...
I just need to cash this.

802
01:00:55,347 --> 01:00:58,219
Oh, wowie zowie!
What a big bank.

803
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,048
How many security guards
are in here?

804
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:02,615
Who's this little guy?

805
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,357
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

806
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,403
that children should be seen
and not heard.

807
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:10,231
Kids.

808
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:12,320
I actually have a son of my own.

809
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,714
He looks weird.

810
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,673
Oh, don't listen to him.

811
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:20,154
Your son is very, uh, cute.

812
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,765
Hmm.

813
01:01:21,808 --> 01:01:24,202
Oh, no!

814
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:25,769
Oh.

815
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:28,206
Oh, help!
I'm seeing a white light.

816
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:31,818
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

817
01:01:34,212 --> 01:01:37,084
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

818
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:38,477
Oh. Help!

819
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,349
Help my-my pop-pop!

820
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,917
Somebody help him!

821
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:45,179
Huh?

822
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:46,528
My grandpa!

823
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:47,810
We need a doctor!

824
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,880
This is the big one.

825
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,230
- Whoa!
- Oh.

826
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:55,320
You hear that?

827
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,583
It's the sweet sound of angels.

828
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:00,804
Help!

829
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:02,196
Do something!

830
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,546
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

831
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,431
No, no, no. The other way.

832
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:21,085
The other way.

833
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,655
All right, everyone stand back.

834
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,570
Uh-oh.

835
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:29,974
- Clear!
- No, wait a minute. Wait.

836
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:35,186
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

837
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,927
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

838
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,538
Clear!

839
01:02:39,581 --> 01:02:41,627
Maximum charge.

840
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,194
- Clear!
- Thank you.

841
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:45,587
You saved my grandpa.

842
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,242
Uh, did we...
did we do the heist?

843
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,812
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

844
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,814
- You dropped these.
- Um...

845
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,341
Look what I got!

846
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:02,126
Hey. Not bad.

847
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:03,649
Not bad at all.

848
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,172
We make a good team.

849
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:06,565
We do?

850
01:03:06,608 --> 01:03:08,872
Oh, yeah.
Hey, we got to keep at it.

851
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:11,048
Wait till you see what
I'm gonna teach you next.

852
01:03:11,091 --> 01:03:13,311
I cannot wait.

853
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,792
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

854
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:21,928
Mm-hmm.

855
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,343
Yoo-hoo. Mini-Boss.

856
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:46,997
Okay, Stuart...

857
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,781
Bob...

858
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,827
Time to strike!

859
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:55,701
- Mini-Boss!
- Yoo-hoo.

860
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:23,729
Aah! They're not here.

861
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:25,513
Fan out and find them.

862
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,880
Something big's going down
in Frisco.

863
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:46,665
Look-a. Ooh.

864
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,413
- Whoo, there it is.
- Whoa.

865
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,549
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

866
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:02,942
Ah, dude.

867
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,858
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

868
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:09,688
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

869
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:20,786
Wow.

870
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:26,661
Oh...

871
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:29,186
Ooh.

872
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:34,452
My friend, you're now

873
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:36,802
gonna learn from the old school.

874
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,897
Oh, no.

875
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:04,308
I can't believe
they did this to me!

876
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:07,224
I-I taught them
everything they know!

877
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:10,183
We were a team!

878
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:13,012
I give up.

879
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,975
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

880
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,368
and they are stupid idiots.

881
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,196
Only dream I ever had

882
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,504
was doing bad stuff
with my buddies.

883
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:30,029
Now look at me: old, alone.

884
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,684
Well, you are old,

885
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:34,686
but you're not alone.

886
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:39,038
All right.

887
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,953
Listen up, buster.

888
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,347
We are starting a new team,

889
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:47,264
and it's going to be called
The Terrible Twos.

890
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:49,092
We can find a better name later,

891
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:52,834
but right now
we're going to find that stone

892
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:55,750
and show everybody
that you still got it.

893
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:58,623
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

894
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:01,278
It's over. Go home.

895
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,715
- But you said we...
- Go home!

896
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,409
Come on, come on. Let's go!

897
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:50,022
Whoa!

898
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,547
Otto?

899
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:58,639
Otto!

900
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:00,641
- Yee-haw!
- Otto!

901
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:02,513
Hyah! Hyah!

902
01:08:03,862 --> 01:08:05,037
Hey!

903
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,605
Otto! It's Mini-Boss!

904
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:09,346
Ah! Mini-Boss!

905
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:13,872
- Mini-Boss!
- Otto!

906
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,136
Look-a! Look-a!

907
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,965
Stone-a.

908
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,445
You found the stone.

909
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,490
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

910
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:25,797
Oh...

911
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,407
All right,
we don't have much time.

912
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:28,993
- We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.
- Oh, okay.

913
01:08:29,017 --> 01:08:30,497
Okay.

914
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,151
Get him!

915
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,462
Go, go, go!

916
01:08:42,074 --> 01:08:44,903
Long time, no see, punk.

917
01:08:47,775 --> 01:08:49,690
I'll take that.

918
01:08:53,477 --> 01:08:54,608
Yes!

919
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:57,176
Don't move!

920
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,482
- Huh?
- Right there! Freeze!

921
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,266
Anti-Villain League.

922
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,573
You are under arrest.

923
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,667
Whoa, whoa, whoa, everybody.

924
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,017
Did you forget what time it is?

925
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,728
Happy New Year!

926
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,387
Fire!

927
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:57,845
Stand your ground.

928
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,240
- Look out!
- Whoa!

929
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:13,881
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

930
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:15,341
no, no, no, no, no!

931
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,779
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

932
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:22,914
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

933
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:31,966
Enjoy being torn apart.

934
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,273
Hey!
...Mini-Boss!

935
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:35,666
Guys!

936
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:38,625
Oh. Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

937
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,857
Oh, you thought I was serious.

938
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,815
Run!

939
01:10:58,123 --> 01:11:00,560
No!

940
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,304
Hello, traitors.

941
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,176
Remember me?

942
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,005
You.

943
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:12,616
You can leave me for dead,

944
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,661
you can destroy
everything I own,

945
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:17,664
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

946
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,884
Oh, so you're gonna
save the kid?

947
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:22,321
Yeah, you and what army?

948
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,150
This army!

949
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,152
Okay. This army.

950
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:30,955
Dig down deep.

951
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:33,914
Find your inner beast.

952
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:11,996
Mmm.

953
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:52,906
Otto!

954
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:55,561
Hurry! Faster!

955
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,912
No!

956
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:08,879
Got you.

957
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,493
Go, go, go!

958
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:27,724
No.

959
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:39,126
Get away from him!

960
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,693
Destroy the kid.

961
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:51,748
Oh!

962
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,800
No!

963
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:05,065
Hey, hey.
How does it feel to be beaten

964
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:07,154
by a tubby little punk?

965
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:14,074
You guys were amazing!

966
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:16,729
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

967
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:19,210
Obviously, you guys are rehired.

968
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:23,301
- Oh.
- Stuart!

969
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:45,584
It's all yours, sir.

970
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,151
Where do you want it?

971
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:48,718
Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

972
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:51,677
Oh, no.

973
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:53,897
Wild Knuckles.

974
01:15:56,247 --> 01:15:57,857
Hey.

975
01:15:57,901 --> 01:15:59,859
Y-You're gonna be okay, right?

976
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:02,079
Don't worry about me, kid.

977
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:03,515
I'll be fine.

978
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,125
Finally.

979
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:08,651
You're going away
for a long, long time.

980
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:11,479
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

981
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,873
No.

982
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,789
See you soon, kiddo.

983
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,839
Ooh-la-la.

984
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,784
Wild Knuckles was
my favorite villain.

985
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,223
We didn't have much time
together,

986
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:01,225
but the time we did have,

987
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:04,315
I'm so grateful for.

988
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:07,710
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

989
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,886
or be there for
all the terrible things

990
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:12,149
that I'm going to do.

991
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,586
And believe me,
there are gonna be

992
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,632
some awful things.

993
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:28,556
But I'm going to make you proud.

994
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,777
I'm going to be
the best villain ever

995
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,866
because of you.

996
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,261
Because you taught me
what matters.

997
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,829
You can't do anything alone.

998
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,267
Find your tribe,

999
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:47,575
and never, ever let them go.

1000
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:49,360
Otto?

1001
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,928
Si.

1002
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:37,321
You better stay out
of trouble, kid.

1003
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:41,586
I will lead a good
and honest life.

1004
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:45,677
You're alive?

1005
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,984
Oh!

1006
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,682
You just blew my mind.

1007
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,031
How did you do that?

1008
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:55,774
I cannot wait
to fake my own death

1009
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:57,645
to avoid the authorities.

1010
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:59,430
Shoot for the moon, kid.

1011
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:00,736
Shoot for the moon.

1012
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,043
See you later, suckers!

1013
01:19:36,554 --> 01:19:38,338
Sorry, we're closed.

1014
01:19:38,382 --> 01:19:39,731
Whoa.

1015
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,560
I just wanted
to thank you for this.

1016
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:44,692
Worked like a charm.

1017
01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:46,651
All right, let me cut
to the chase here.

1018
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,566
I need a genius mad scientist.

1019
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:50,568
You want to come work for me?

1020
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:52,831
No, I am done with villainy.

1021
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,355
Off to happier horizons.

1022
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:57,401
Goodbye, little chap.

1023
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,446
Por favor.

1024
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,329
Oh, all right, all right.

1025
01:20:12,372 --> 01:20:14,418
Fine. Stop with the face.

1026
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:16,159
I'm in.

1027
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:18,552
Want to see something cool?

1028
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,953
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1029
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:38,659
Big Boss!
Big Boss! Big Boss! Big Boss!

1030
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:40,487
"Big Boss." I like that.
