1
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,961
<i>...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.</i>

2
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,064
What are you looking at, Caroline?

3
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,667
The wind, Mom.

4
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,181
They say the hurricane is coming.

5
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,014
I'm on a boat.

6
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,385
I'm drifting.

7
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,024
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

8
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,261
Make anything easier?

9
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,631
Oh, sugar...

10
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,432
There's nothing left to do.

11
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,529
Is what it is.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,009
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

13
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:22,106
My mouth's full of cotton.

14
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,776
There, there, Miss Daisy.

15
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,614
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

16
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,323
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,426
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

18
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,796
No need for anybody to suffer.

19
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,684
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

20
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,084
to say goodbye to her mother.

21
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,557
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,187
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

23
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,756
Mom.

24
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,530
Oh, Caroline.

25
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,832
Are you afraid?

26
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,638
I'm curious.

27
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,040
What comes next?

28
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:39,354
They built the train station in 1918.

29
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,123
My father was there the day it opened.

30
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,493
He said they had

31
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,732
a tuba band playing.

32
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,569
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,978
to build that glorious clock.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,409
<i>His name was...</i>

35
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,118
Mr. Gateau.

36
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,654
Mr. Cake.

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,395
<i>He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish</i>

38
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,732
<i>and they had a son.</i>

39
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:31,770
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.</i>

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,279
<i>When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.</i>

41
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,588
<i>And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.</i>

42
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:51,259
<i>For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.</i>

43
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,768
<i>One day,</i>

44
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,037
<i>a letter came.</i>

45
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,009
<i>And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,</i>

46
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,207
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

47
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,685
<i>And their son came home.</i>

48
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,660
<i>They buried him in the family plot,</i>

49
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,667
<i>where he would be with them
when their time came.</i>

50
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,765
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

51
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,239
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

52
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,482
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

53
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,915
<i>Papa said
there were people everywhere.</i>

54
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,918
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

55
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,544
It's running backwards!

56
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,911
I made it that way

57
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,384
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,852
might stand and come home again.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,193
<i>Home to farm,</i>

60
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,490
<i>work,</i>

61
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,761
<i>have children.</i>

62
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,539
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

63
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,406
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

64
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,613
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

65
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,456
I hope you enjoy my clock.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,230
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

67
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:15,006
<i>Some say he died of a broken heart.</i>

68
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,040
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

69
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,343
Excuse me.

70
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,011
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

71
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,349
Sure.

72
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,829
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

73
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,028
You couldn't disappoint me.

74
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:51,375
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

75
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,380
Find my dark suitcase.

76
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,654
There's a diary.

77
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,883
This?

78
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,530
Could you read it to me?

79
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,330
Is this what you want to do?

80
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,337
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

81
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,297
Mom, it's not exactly...

82
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,809
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

83
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,640
Okay.

84
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,752
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

85
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,219
And it says New Orleans.

86
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,053
"This is my last will and testament.

87
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,357
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

88
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:49,997
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

89
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,505
"All I have is my story,

90
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,039
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

91
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,006
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button. "

92
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,473
<i>And I was born under
unusual circumstances.</i>

93
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,680
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

94
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,254
<i>and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.</i>

95
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,053
Thank God it's over!

96
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,958
We won the war!

97
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,675
The Great War is over!

98
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,982
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,390
Thomas,

100
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,062
I'm afraid she's going to die.

101
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,323
What?

102
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,128
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

103
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,433
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

104
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,805
Thomas.

105
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,905
Promise me he has a place.

106
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,442
Yeah.

107
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,809
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

108
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,824
<i>And for that, I am forever grateful.</i>

109
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,833
Mr. Button.

110
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,379
Thomas!

111
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,713
Thomas.

112
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,883
Thomas? Where are you going?

113
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,851
Hey! What are you doing there?

114
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,115
What do you have there?

115
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,115
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

116
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,585
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

117
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,953
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

118
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,924
The air is sweet.

119
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,427
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

120
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,898
Handsome as I've ever seen.

121
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,571
The brown matches your eyes.

122
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,008
Oh, hush!

123
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,610
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

124
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,990
Hambert's back in town.

125
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,861
He came home legless, but he's home.

126
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,494
I know you were sweet on him one time.

127
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,901
Sweeter than I should've been.

128
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,904
Miss Simone messed herself.

129
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,234
Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,866
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

131
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,002
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

132
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,673
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

133
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,044
It's awful nice out here.

134
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,347
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

135
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,477
You're so bad.

136
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,056
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

137
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,664
Oh, the Lord done something here.

138
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,262
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

139
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,897
We best leave that for the police.

140
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,498
Poor baby.

141
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,675
I'll go.

142
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,009
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

143
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,119
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

144
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,155
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

145
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,350
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

146
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,491
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

147
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,461
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

148
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,624
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

149
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,531
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

150
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,194
Somebody stole my necklace.

151
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,239
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

152
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,535
Go on back upstairs, hear?

153
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,374
You are as ugly as an old pot

154
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,146
but you're still a child of God.

155
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,619
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

156
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,189
Mercy.

157
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,259
I'll be right there!

158
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,231
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

159
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,199
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

160
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,141
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

161
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,543
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

162
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,241
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

163
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,350
Your heart is strong.

164
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,423
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

165
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,118
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

166
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,356
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

167
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,765
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

168
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,933
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

169
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,145
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

170
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:46,844
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

171
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,580
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

172
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,677
He's dying?

173
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,020
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

174
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,828
Where'd he come from?

175
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,299
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

176
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,303
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

177
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,937
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

178
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,242
No room for another mouth to feed here.

179
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,874
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

180
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,749
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

181
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:23,934
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:25,014
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

183
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:29,686
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

184
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,829
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

185
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,928
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

186
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,466
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

187
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,269
We're gonna have us a visitor

188
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,473
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

189
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,279
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

190
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,284
He's known as...

191
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,857
Benjamin.

192
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,826
Benjamin.

193
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,666
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

194
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,825
I had 10 children.

195
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,268
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

196
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,103
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

197
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,573
Look, he's prematurely old.

198
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,609
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

199
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,078
Join the club.

200
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,659
He's smiling!

201
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,095
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

202
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,244
Are you right out of your mind?

203
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,916
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

204
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,248
but this ain't yours to keep.

205
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,618
It may not even be humankind.

206
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,166
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

207
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,732
Please.

208
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,648
You never know what's coming for you.

209
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,033
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

210
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,264
Is any of this true?

211
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,741
You have such a lovely voice.

212
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,975
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

213
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,812
That clock just kept going,

214
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:14,020
year after year after year.

215
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,230
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

216
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,800
Same old crap every day.

217
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,466
<i>I thought I was like everyone else there.</i>

218
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,634
<i>An old man in the twilight of his life.</i>

219
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,073
Could you make him stop that?

220
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,138
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

221
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,081
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

222
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,715
Queenie!

223
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,097
Hey, boy.

224
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,773
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

225
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,403
<i>What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?</i>

226
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,581
Go get him!

227
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,382
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

228
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,852
Stay put, child.

229
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,161
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

230
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,590
<i>She was my mother.</i>

231
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,858
Mama.

232
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,693
Mama.

233
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,268
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

234
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,734
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

235
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,010
But we're all going the same way.

236
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,046
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

237
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,621
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

238
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,054
Mama? How much longer I got?

239
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,861
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

240
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,025
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

241
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,839
<i>Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.</i>

242
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,210
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

243
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,848
<i>I would listen to the house breathing.</i>

244
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,115
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

245
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,788
<i>I felt safe.</i>

246
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,243
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

247
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,253
<i>Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,</i>

248
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,416
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.</i>

249
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:07,254
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,</i>

250
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,994
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

251
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,246
All right, baby, come on.

252
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:27,182
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

253
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,586
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

254
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,525
<i>No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

255
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,789
Molasses.

256
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,125
Molasses.

257
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,924
Molasses.

258
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,427
I learned to read when I was five.

259
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,940
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

260
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,739
He brung home every play
for me to read.

261
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,712
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

262
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,247
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

263
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,753
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

264
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,555
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

265
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,925
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

266
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,536
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. "

267
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,971
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

268
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,502
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

269
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,239
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

270
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,575
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,982
You never know what's coming for you.

272
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,285
<i>On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.</i>

273
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,463
Benjamin!

274
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,367
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

275
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,312
What can I do for you, sister?

276
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,620
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

277
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,462
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

278
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,665
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

279
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,175
Out, damnable affliction!

280
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,438
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

281
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,706
Hallelujah!

282
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,281
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

283
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,081
And what's this old man's irrediction?

284
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,222
He's got the Devil on his back,

285
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,588
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

286
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,330
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

287
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,263
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

288
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,898
How old are you?

289
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,495
Seven. But I look a lot older.

290
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,064
God bless you.

291
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,143
He's seven.

292
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,883
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

293
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,679
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

294
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,775
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,684
We are all children in the eyes of God!

296
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,086
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

297
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,058
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

298
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,185
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

299
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,621
It's all right.

300
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,761
In the name of God's glory...

301
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,068
Rise up!

302
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,937
Come on.

303
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,538
Come on. Walk.

304
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,076
Come on, son. Come on.

305
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,908
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,381
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

307
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,286
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

308
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,186
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

309
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,260
- Hallelujah!
... and divine inspiration alone!

310
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,521
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

311
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,926
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

312
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,258
- Yes.
- Come on.

313
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,027
Don't touch him.

314
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,133
Rise up, old man.

315
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,767
Rise up like Lazarus.

316
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,004
I said, rise up!

317
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,044
Hallelujah!

318
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,410
Yes.

319
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,079
Come on.

320
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,175
Say hallelujah.

321
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,652
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

322
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,584
Walk.

323
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,451
Walk on. Yes.

324
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,355
That's right, Benjamin.

325
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,697
<i>Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.</i>

326
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:41,829
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

327
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,972
Glory in the highest!

328
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,239
Sweet Jesus!

329
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,473
- No!
- No!

330
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,282
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

331
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,913
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

332
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,617
<i>So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.</i>

333
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,752
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

334
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,399
<i>And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.</i>

335
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,636
<i>You always knew
when someone left us.</i>

336
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,229
<i>There was a silence in the house.</i>

337
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,586
<i>It was a wonderful place to grow up.</i>

338
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,151
<i>I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

339
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,958
<i>Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,</i>

340
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,396
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

341
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,767
<i>For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.</i>

342
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,110
I've been married five times.

343
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,346
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

344
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,511
Oh, goodness gracious.

345
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,088
We escaped across the river.

346
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,556
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

347
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,853
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,793
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

349
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,128
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

350
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,259
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

351
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,463
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

352
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,437
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

353
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,409
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

354
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,022
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

355
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,364
You just fooling everybody.

356
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,962
<i>What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,438
<i>What's Madjembe?</i>

358
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,838
Worms.

359
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,507
I don't think I have worms.

360
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,703
This is just how I am.

361
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,681
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

362
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,116
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

363
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,346
I found the medication
under your pillow.

364
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,618
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

365
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,455
Who said that? Come on, little man.

366
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,423
Hello, children.

367
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,165
Hold, please.

368
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:39,146
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

369
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,543
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

370
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,878
Look.

371
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,592
What's it like living in a cage?

372
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,161
It stinks.

373
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,060
But the monkeys.

374
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,891
They do some tricks there.

375
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,831
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

376
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,401
She is orangutan.

377
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,368
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

378
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,571
in my cage, with my teeth.

379
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,582
So then what'd you do?

380
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:26,528
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

381
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,022
You were all alone?

382
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,431
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

383
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,971
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

384
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,839
But I'll tell you a little secret.

385
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,242
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

386
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,339
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

387
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,079
But they're scared shitless.

388
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,920
I think about the river I grew up on.

389
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,296
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

390
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,933
Come, I have an appointment.

391
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,898
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

392
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,340
Always ready. Always ready.

393
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,238
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

394
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,342
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,419
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

396
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,250
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

397
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,854
Hey! Hey!

398
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,676
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

399
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,454
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

400
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,454
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

401
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,726
<i>It had been the best day of my life.</i>

402
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,365
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

403
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,996
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

404
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,008
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

405
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,578
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

406
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,170
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

407
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,013
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

408
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,048
Was there just company?

409
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,024
It was just Dorothy leaving.

410
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,628
Go on, Caroline.

411
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,824
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit. "

412
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,168
<i>It was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

413
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,239
<i>I met the person
who changed my life forever.</i>

414
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,377
Well, Benjamin.

415
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,119
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

416
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,149
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

417
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,524
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

418
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,995
What elixir have you been drinking?

419
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,465
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

420
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,236
That was really something.

421
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,205
Come on over here, you.

422
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,140
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

423
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,910
This is Mr...

424
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,711
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

425
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,445
Benjamin's fine.

426
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,419
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

427
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,518
Good people, supper is served.

428
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:47,724
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

429
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,326
Amen.

430
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,662
- Amen!
- Amen!

431
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,932
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

432
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,065
Why do you say that?

433
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,304
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

434
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,937
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

435
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,209
I love birds that can't fly.

436
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,308
They are so delicious.

437
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,955
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

438
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,219
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

439
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,260
I had a miracle happen.

440
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,390
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

441
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,400
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

442
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,028
Thanks. Thank you.

443
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,505
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

444
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,468
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

445
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,843
but he didn't live long,

446
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,414
'cause he didn't breathe right.

447
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:47,280
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

448
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,987
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

449
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,058
"You can see that it is 5:00,

450
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:58,124
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so. "

451
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,067
Isn't that something?

452
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,003
Again, read it again.

453
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,404
Oh, read it again, please.

454
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,808
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

455
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,578
I promise.

456
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,380
"Old Man Kangaroo. "

457
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,349
Are you sleeping?

458
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,382
Who's that?

459
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,051
It's me, Daisy.

460
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,563
Oh, hi!

461
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,655
'Kay, come on.

462
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,540
Where are we going?

463
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,511
Come on. Under here.

464
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,492
Here, you light it.

465
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,687
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

466
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,060
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

467
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,111
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

468
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,646
Okay.

469
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,080
I saw my mama kissing another man.

470
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,544
Her face was red from it.

471
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,312
Your turn.

472
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,925
I'm not as old as I look.

473
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,587
I thought so.

474
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,000
You don't seem like an old person.

475
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,830
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

476
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,199
Are you sick?

477
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,938
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

478
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,209
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

479
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,976
You're odd.

480
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,621
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

481
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,954
- May I?
- Okay.

482
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,637
What are you doing under there?

483
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,175
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

484
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,039
It's after midnight!

485
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,237
You are not to be playing together.

486
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,870
Yes, ma'am.

487
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,142
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

488
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,209
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

489
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,724
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

490
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,068
You are a different child.

491
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:55,937
A man-child.

492
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,507
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

493
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,985
What's wrong with me, Mama?

494
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,690
Come here.

495
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,094
God hasn't said yet, baby.

496
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,030
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

497
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

498
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,818
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

499
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,064
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

500
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,401
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

501
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,753
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

502
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,348
"... blue eyes. "

503
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,385
Mom?

504
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:23,263
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

505
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,969
Not many people experience that.

506
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,235
Want me to go on?

507
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,234
He crosses something out.

508
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,644
<i>When that baby came,
things were different.</i>

509
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,081
<i>Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay</i>

510
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,985
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

511
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,051
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

512
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,793
<i>A lot of folks been through
that old house.</i>

513
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,996
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

514
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,364
Going?

515
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,394
Where?

516
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,063
I haven't figured that out yet,

517
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,642
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

518
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,507
What about your friend, the tall lady?

519
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,011
We are not friends anymore.

520
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,379
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

521
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,248
Well, goodbye.

522
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,303
<i>Spent a lot of time by myself that year.</i>

523
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,905
Hello?

524
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,443
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

525
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,381
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

526
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,511
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

527
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,954
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

528
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,050
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

529
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,096
She won't be a bother much longer.

530
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,894
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

531
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,195
Right this way, ma'am.

532
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,430
<i>As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.</i>

533
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,667
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

534
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,473
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

535
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,910
<i>It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least</i>

536
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,539
<i>make the greatest impression on us.</i>

537
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,483
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

538
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,386
<i>And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

539
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,051
<i>Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

540
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,128
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

541
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,131
It's not about how well you play.

542
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,706
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

543
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,141
Try this.

544
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,725
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

545
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,796
<i>There were many changes.</i>

546
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,967
<i>Some you could see,
some you couldn't.</i>

547
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,944
<i>Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,</i>

548
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,450
<i>along with other things.</i>

549
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,481
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

550
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,217
Darling, the pain.

551
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,850
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

552
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,058
<i>Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,</i>

553
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,158
<i>a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...</i>

554
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,100
Not doing too good?

555
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:51,237
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

556
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,640
I'm gonna ride it out.

557
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,611
There.
That should make things much easier.

558
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,247
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

559
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,846
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

560
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,925
Couldn't go without him.

561
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,122
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

562
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,491
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

563
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,498
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

564
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,828
Sure.

565
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,045
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws... "

566
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:41,955
<i>...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.</i>

567
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,993
<i>These were hard times.</i>

568
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,728
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

569
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,070
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

570
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,876
My fourth hand didn't show up.

571
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:09,574
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

572
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,217
What's the matter?

573
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,054
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

574
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,717
He never pays.

575
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,494
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

576
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,966
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

577
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,436
I think.

578
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,843
Well, that's good enough for me.

579
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,403
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

580
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,548
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

581
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,918
I need a volunteer!

582
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,355
<i>I would do anything.</i>

583
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,892
Yes, Captain!

584
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,292
Scrape off all this bird shit!

585
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,725
Right away, sir.

586
00:43:55,566 --> 00:44:00,026
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.</i>

587
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,037
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

588
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,943
<i>He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.</i>

589
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,708
Get moving, then.

590
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,139
Come here.

591
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,313
Can you still get it up?

592
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,681
I do every morning.

593
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,760
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

594
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,694
I guess.

595
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,928
When was the last time
you had a woman?

596
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,372
- Never.
- Never?

597
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,934
Not that I know of, sir.

598
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,207
Wait a minute, now.

599
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,143
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

600
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,516
and you've never had a woman?

601
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,252
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

602
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,958
Never?

603
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,824
No.

604
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:09,565
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

605
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,176
What did your father do?

606
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,311
I never met my father.

607
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,355
You lucky bastard.

608
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,885
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

609
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,930
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

610
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,700
this little, fat bastard.

611
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,497
"Tug Irish," they called him.

612
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,971
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

613
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,572
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat. "

614
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,647
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,710
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

616
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,115
Absolutely! Damn right!

617
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,483
So you know
what my father says to me?

618
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:06,763
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

619
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,594
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

620
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,561
So I tell him.

621
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,399
"Well, if you're asking,

622
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,699
"I want to be an artist. "

623
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,177
He laughs.

624
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,673
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

625
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,413
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do. "

626
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,752
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

627
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,955
A tattoo artist!

628
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:43,195
I put on every one of these myself.

629
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,536
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

630
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,832
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

631
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,511
That one.

632
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,477
Don't let anyone tell you different.

633
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,179
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

634
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,382
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

635
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,289
But you're a tugboat captain.

636
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,623
Captain Mike?

637
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,459
We're ready for you and your friend.

638
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,227
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

639
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,134
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

640
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,241
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

641
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,638
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

643
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,848
How are you tonight, grandpa?

644
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,647
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

645
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,057
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

646
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,427
Again.

647
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,067
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

648
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,298
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

649
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:00,103
<i>It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.</i>

650
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,575
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

651
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,874
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

652
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,227
It's nasty out.

653
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,602
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

654
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,637
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

655
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,452
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

656
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,214
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

657
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,618
It's a pleasure to know you.

658
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:54,392
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

659
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,863
All right.

660
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,431
Evening, Mr. Button.

661
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,941
What'll it be, sir?

662
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,703
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

663
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,179
With whiskey, not brandy.

664
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,772
You don't drink, do you?

665
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,478
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

666
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,645
I've never been to a brothel, either.

667
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,519
Well, it's an experience.

668
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,752
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

669
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:27,261
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

670
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:34,131
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

671
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,099
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

672
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,765
What kind of disease?

673
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,604
I was born old.

674
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,840
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

675
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,472
There's nothing wrong with old age.

676
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,385
My wife passed away many years ago.

677
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,627
I'm so, so sorry.

678
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,965
She died in childbirth.

679
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,997
- To children.
- To mothers.

680
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,110
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

681
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:22,345
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

682
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,920
Our biggest competition
is B.F. Goodrich

683
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,753
and his infernal zippers.

684
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,657
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

685
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,787
One for the road, Benjamin?

686
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,730
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

687
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,469
So, what line of work do you do?

688
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,339
I'm a tugboat man.

689
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,572
I enjoyed talking to you.

690
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,177
I enjoyed drinking with you.

691
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,188
Benjamin?

692
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,726
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

693
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:07,228
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

694
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,527
Good night, Benjamin.

695
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,632
Drive on.

696
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,638
Where have you been?

697
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:23,736
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

698
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,711
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

699
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,813
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.</i>

700
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,091
<i>One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.</i>

701
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,356
<i>She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.</i>

702
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,159
Benjamin! Come on!

703
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,897
Okay.

704
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,726
<i>I loved those weekends
when she'd come</i>

705
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,635
<i>and spend the night
with her grandmother.</i>

706
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,182
Daisy. Daisy.

707
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,511
You want to see something?

708
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:09,455
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

709
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,363
Come on.

710
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,296
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

711
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,998
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

712
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,477
Is he okay?

713
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,021
Captain?

714
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,148
Captain Mike?

715
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,593
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

716
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,065
Do you know what day it is?

717
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,432
Sunday?

718
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,665
Do you know what that means?

719
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,408
Means I was very drunk last night.

720
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,275
Well, you're drunk every night.

721
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,013
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

722
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:09,844
I want to show her the river.

723
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:13,252
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

724
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,551
I could lose my license.

725
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,836
What are you waiting for?

726
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,128
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

727
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,699
She's flying now, huh?

728
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,869
Ahoy, sailor!

729
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,780
I wish we could go with them.

730
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,053
Did you say something, Mom?

731
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,801
It's getting really bad.

732
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,600
Can you hear me, Mom?

733
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,903
Time just seeped out of me.

734
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,481
"Things were changing quickly. "

735
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:53,682
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

736
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,194
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

737
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,594
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

738
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:05,600
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

739
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,535
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

740
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,538
It's an awful responsibility.

741
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,201
<i>I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.</i>

742
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:19,906
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

743
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:23,750
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

744
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:31,316
<i>And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.</i>

745
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,861
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

746
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,375
<i>She taught me how to play the piano.</i>

747
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:49,740
- Amen.
- Amen.

748
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,009
<i>And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.</i>

749
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,020
Let's go.

750
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,990
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

751
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,390
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

752
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,952
<i>Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.</i>

753
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:13,367
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,</i>

754
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,303
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

755
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,738
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

756
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:23,302
<i>I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.</i>

757
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,142
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

758
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,718
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

759
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:37,158
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

760
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,592
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

761
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,494
Be safe, hear?

762
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,281
Benjamin!

763
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,015
- Where you going?
- To sea.

764
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,484
I'll send you a postcard.

765
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,262
From everywhere.

766
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,958
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

767
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:33,346
Can you imagine?

768
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:41,850
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

769
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,394
Every place he worked.

770
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:49,789
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

771
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,460
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

772
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:59,003
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

773
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,274
<i>Captain Mike had contracted
for three years</i>

774
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,677
<i>with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.</i>

775
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:09,650
<i>The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

776
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:12,653
<i>We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

777
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:16,156
<i>We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.</i>

778
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:19,592
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

779
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,096
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

780
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,428
<i>who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,</i>

781
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,594
<i>once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.</i>

782
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,265
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

783
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,501
<i>There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.</i>

784
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,441
All hands lost at sea.

785
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,775
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

786
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,015
<i>And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.</i>

787
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:45,281
<i>Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.</i>

788
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,837
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:50,284
I wrote him constantly.

790
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:56,922
<i>I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City</i>

791
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,162
<i>for the School of American Ballet.</i>

792
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,669
Please stay.

793
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,898
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,137
You can stay.

795
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,706
<i>But I was relegated to the corps.</i>

796
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,415
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

797
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,246
Benjamin!

798
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,359
How is it when you showed up

799
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,328
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

800
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:32,629
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

801
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,530
or you sprouted?

802
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,202
What's your secret?

803
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,200
Well, Captain,

804
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,809
you do drink a lot.

805
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:53,885
<i>We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

806
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,754
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
00:59:56,859 --> 01:00:00,317
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

808
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,761
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

809
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,232
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

810
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,166
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

811
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,644
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

812
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,310
This is no ordinary bird.

813
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,078
This is a frickin' miracle.

814
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:31,158
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

815
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,023
and you know what they saw?

816
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,328
Their wingtips are doing that.

817
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:45,205
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

818
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,735
Infinity.

819
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,177
Infinity!

820
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,585
<i>Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,</i>

821
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,714
<i>the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.</i>

822
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,025
<i>They were drunk every single night.</i>

823
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,652
Three, please.

824
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,355
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

825
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,728
Thank you very much. Good evening.

826
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,529
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

827
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,935
<i>She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.</i>

828
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,838
<i>But she was pretty as any picture to me.</i>

829
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,169
What are you looking at?

830
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,940
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

831
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,416
never to go to bed sober.

832
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,919
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

833
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,080
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

834
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,092
<i>He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

835
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,821
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

836
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,796
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

837
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,924
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

838
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,465
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

839
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:56,170
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

840
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,744
<i>They were long days there.</i>

841
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,227
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

842
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,991
<i>One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.</i>

843
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,959
I'm sorry.

844
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,568
I couldn't sleep.

845
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,945
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

846
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,689
Oh, no. Thank you.

847
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,089
Milk? Honey?

848
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,667
A bit of honey, please.

849
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,965
I hope you like flies in your honey.

850
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,731
Oh, perhaps not.

851
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:48,819
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

852
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,020
Steep?

853
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,452
Soak.

854
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:56,391
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

855
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,730
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

856
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,929
Well, quite right.

857
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,247
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

858
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,079
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

859
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,312
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

860
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,822
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

861
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,933
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

862
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,234
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

863
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,642
Something's been keeping me up.

864
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,073
My father, in his 80s,

865
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,445
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

866
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,212
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

867
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:54,752
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

868
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,790
- Did he?
- Did he what?

869
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,554
Die in his sleep?

870
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,858
He died sitting in his favorite chair

871
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,594
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

872
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,170
He must have known something.

873
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,974
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

874
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,415
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

875
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,977
but it never seemed to work out.

876
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,152
Have you been in the Far East?

877
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,454
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

878
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,995
I mean, outside of harbors.

879
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,758
And where is it that you're from?

880
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,357
New Orleans. Louisiana.

881
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,168
I didn't know there was another.

882
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:50,502
<i>And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

883
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,015
<i>And we talked till just before the dawn.</i>

884
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,519
I'm just a lush, myself.

885
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:02,557
<i>And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.</i>

886
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:11,296
<i>But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.</i>

887
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,541
<i>A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.</i>

888
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,313
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

889
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,843
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

890
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,718
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

891
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,859
<i>There's something peaceful,
even comforting</i>

892
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,193
<i>knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds</i>

893
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,529
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

894
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,572
<i>Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night</i>

895
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,269
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

896
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,677
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

897
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,306
Beg pardon?

898
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:05,217
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

899
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,346
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

900
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,983
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

901
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,199
Good night.

902
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,833
Murmansk.

903
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:27,533
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love. "

904
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:28,837
Mom?

905
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,206
That was over 60 years ago.

906
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,543
Did you love him, Mother?

907
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,417
What does a girl know about love?

908
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,217
Well...

909
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:21,492
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

910
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,826
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

911
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,962
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

912
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:35,032
but the caviar and the vodka

913
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:39,707
are sublime and plentiful.

914
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:44,781
So.

915
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,389
Savor it.

916
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,497
And don't eat it all at once,

917
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,692
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

918
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:04,703
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

919
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,421
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

920
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,253
Not on Sundays.

921
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,192
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

922
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,925
No, ma'am.

923
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,433
When I was 19,

924
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:45,710
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

925
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,114
Really?

926
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,777
But the current that day
was so strong that,

927
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,981
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

928
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,185
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

929
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,995
And when I was two miles from Calais,

930
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,862
<i>it started to rain.</i>

931
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,502
That's it! Steady on!

932
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,666
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

933
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,708
I stopped.

934
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,703
<i>I just stopped.</i>

935
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:23,183
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

936
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,784
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

937
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,386
But I never did.

938
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:36,059
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

939
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,227
Your hands are so coarse.

940
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,141
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

941
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,415
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

942
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:13,563
<i>It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.</i>

943
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,536
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

944
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,074
I think you make me feel younger.

945
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,709
You make me feel years younger, too.

946
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,412
I wish I was.

947
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,550
So many things I'd change.

948
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,591
I'd undo all my mistakes.

949
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,390
What mistakes?

950
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,894
I kept waiting, you know?

951
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:52,030
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

952
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,038
Do something.

953
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:59,843
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

954
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,783
Wasted time.

955
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,490
If we're going to have an affair,

956
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,059
you're never to look at me
during the day.

957
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,632
And we're always to part before sunrise.

958
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,928
And we will never say "I love you. "

959
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,368
Those are the rules.

960
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:29,136
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

961
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,178
Oh, you! You're frozen.

962
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,477
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

963
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,948
<i>She was the first woman
that ever loved me.</i>

964
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,150
You want me to skip some?

965
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:21,025
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

966
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,168
"I couldn't wait to see her again. "

967
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,380
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

968
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,283
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

969
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,589
<i>But each time seemed new
and different.</i>

970
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:53,427
Come here.

971
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,302
Elizabeth.

972
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,071
Good night.

973
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,403
<i>Until one night.</i>

974
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:52,279
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

975
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:55,481
<i>a date which will live in infamy...</i>

976
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:59,721
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

977
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,220
possibly beyond.

978
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,192
There's been a change of plan, lads.

979
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,995
As you may or may not know,

980
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,698
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

981
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,598
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

982
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:20,207
<i>The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.</i>

983
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:23,914
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

984
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:29,788
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

985
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:34,090
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

986
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:40,358
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

987
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,460
My wife's doing poorly.

988
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,301
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

989
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,842
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

990
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,248
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

991
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:02,414
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

992
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,890
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

993
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,621
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

994
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:12,132
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

995
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,202
What the hell?

996
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:18,637
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

997
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,808
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

998
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,449
<i>She had left a note.</i>

999
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,552
<i>She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you. "</i>

1000
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,918
<i>And that was it.</i>

1001
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,224
<i>It wasn't the war any of us expected.</i>

1002
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,963
<i>We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.</i>

1003
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,540
<i>If there was a war, we didn't see it.</i>

1004
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:58,504
<i>There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1005
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,809
<i>But most of all, he loved America.</i>

1006
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,817
There is no other country in the world.

1007
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:05,011
When you spell America...

1008
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,284
<i>His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1009
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,485
<i>His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.</i>

1010
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:17,122
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1011
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:20,827
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1012
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:24,895
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1013
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,493
Hey. I've been watching you.

1014
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,458
You seem trustworthy.

1015
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,357
If something happens to me,

1016
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,997
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1017
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:02,634
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1018
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:07,811
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1019
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,418
All hands on deck!

1020
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,723
Get your asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

1021
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,211
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1022
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,388
All stop!

1023
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,116
Pleasant, man that light.

1024
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:04,165
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1025
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,839
<i>We were first to arrive at the scene.</i>

1026
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,505
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1027
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,552
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1028
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,901
Fellas!

1029
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,938
Sub!

1030
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,550
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1031
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,588
Battle stations!

1032
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,458
Thank you, Chief.

1033
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:11,864
What?

1034
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,650
Is that the last one?
