1
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,423
Here we are,
floating peacefully in the sky.

2
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,176
Metro City, the jewel in the crown.

3
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,263
Beautiful, isn't it? But how did we get here?

4
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:42,226
A century ago, the founders of Metro City,
seeing our world was changing,

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,813
took Mount Sofia and lifted it
out of the Earth and into the sky

6
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:50,401
to be an oasis, a floating paradise.

7
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,155
We don't really know
what happens these days

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,366
on the strange and mysterious Surface
we left behind.

9
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:03,289
But life in Metro City is better than ever,
thanks to our friends, the robots.

10
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,417
Robots do our shopping.

11
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,630
They cook for us. They serve our meals.

12
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,007
They take good care of us.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,593
They even do the really important things

14
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,721
like reminding us to call Mom
on her birthday.

15
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,308
Whether it's raising our children,
building our buildings,

16
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,145
taking care of our city
or making sure we're all fit and healthy,

17
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,106
for these guys, no job is too big

18
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,527
or too small.

19
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:37,782
Plus, robots do a lot of the things that
frankly we just don't want to do anymore.

20
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,659
Oh, no!

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,745
Don't worry, folks,
that street will get clean.

22
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,415
The best and brightest of them get picked
for the more exciting tasks.

23
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,503
This lucky guy is starting the first day
at his new job.

24
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,969
And it's all thanks to this man, Dr. Tenma,

25
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,806
head of the Ministry of Science
and father of modern robotics.

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,517
Thanks to him and
the incredible innovations he introduced...

27
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,727
Hey, Toby, isn't that your dad?

28
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,354
- It sure is.
- Hush!

29
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,192
Our friends, the robots, help us.
Thousands are created every day,

30
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,195
and thousands are disposed of
in the great unending cycle

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,240
that sustains life in our great city.

32
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,994
Thanks for everything, guys.
May you rust in peace.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,789
Okay, students. Ready for a pop quiz?

34
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,666
- What?
- Oh, no.

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,876
Begin.

36
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,338
- Oh, man.
- I am so busted.

37
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,185
Yes, Toby. Is there a problem?

38
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,147
There's no problem.
I'm just finished, and I'd like to leave.

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,481
Finished?

40
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,651
For rocket science,
it wasn't exactly rocket science.

41
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,155
I don't suppose there's much point
in you staying.

42
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,908
- Good luck, guys.
- Jeez.

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,581
Just like his father.

44
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,335
Hello, Master Toby.
Did you have a good day at...

45
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,086
Think fast, Orrin.

46
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,007
Thank you, Master Toby.
Very good throw, by the way.

47
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,637
- Hello, Son.
- Hello, sir.

48
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,180
- How was school?
- Oh, great.

49
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,476
Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us,
but I'm pretty sure I got 100%.

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,897
That's good, Son, very good,
but I don't want you to become complacent.

51
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,193
It's important to keep studying.
Onward and upward, Toby.

52
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,611
Sure, Dad.

53
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,283
I'm aware I said I'd take you
to that symposium on quantum mechanics,

54
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,661
but I'm afraid
I have to take a rain check again.

55
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,873
- But you promised.
- I'm sorry, Toby, but it's unavoidable.

56
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,876
President Stone has brought forward
the unveiling of the Peacekeeper.

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,545
The Peacekeeper?
You've got to be kidding me!

58
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,215
I never kid. Goodbye, Son.

59
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,427
The Peacekeeper, huh?

60
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,431
Hey, Orrin, change of plan.
Take me to the Ministry of Science.

61
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,144
I'm sorry, Master Toby, but your father
gave me strict instructions to...

62
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,565
Stop that! What are you doing back there?
Hey! Hey!

63
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,485
Next stop, Ministry of Science.

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,414
You ready to blow me away today, Tenma?

65
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,166
To make my hair stand up,
to knock my socks off?

66
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,421
- Yes, yes, metaphorically speaking.
- Well, that's the spirit.

67
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,549
Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague
of mine, Mr. President.

68
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,594
He may be resistant to having his discovery
used for military purposes.

69
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,555
Well, you leave Dr. Elefun to me.

70
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,223
- Dad!
- Hold that kid!

71
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,268
What are you doing here?
I gave Orrin specific instructions to...

72
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,229
Ow, ow.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,190
I wanted to see the demonstration.
You're always talking

74
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,109
- about the Peacekeeper and...
- Really, Toby.

75
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,069
- Your boy?
- Yes, sir.

76
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,612
Well, let him tag along.

77
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,905
Releasing potential threat.

78
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,949
It'll be good for him, educational.

79
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,284
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,747
So, you're interested in robots, son?
Robot weapons?

81
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,333
Absolutely, though I'm sure you'll agree
the latest D-Class Interceptor

82
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,587
underlying deployment-to-target system
is quite old-fashioned.

83
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,132
Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid.

84
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,509
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.

85
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,552
What the...

86
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,471
- Dad!
- I think it's for the best, Toby.

87
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,139
But you said I could see the Peacekeeper.

88
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,143
You still can,
on tonight's news with everybody else.

89
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,353
Ladies and gentlemen,

90
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,399
allow me to present Blue Core energy.

91
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,069
- Wow.
- Blue Core energy,

92
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,072
a new self-sustaining power source

93
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,367
much stronger than nuclear energy
and infinitely cleaner.

94
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,870
The raw materials came from space.

95
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:58,375
A fragment of a star millions of light-years
away that no longer even exists.

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,170
This is now all that's left of it.

97
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,591
Properly harnessed,
this small sphere could transform

98
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:10,387
not only Metro City,
but life for those on the Surface, as well.

99
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,435
Imagine cleaning up Earth's water.

100
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,604
Imagine bringing back the forests.

101
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,482
Imagine overcoming the effects
of centuries of pollution.

102
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,319
I know he's a bit of a dreamer,
but he's a brilliant scientist.

103
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,697
He's a dangerous idiot
who happens to have a high IQ.

104
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,617
Unfortunately, there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

105
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,121
When we extracted the positive blue energy
from the fragment,

106
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:40,167
we were left with this highly unstable
by-product, negative red energy.

107
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,377
I like that one.

108
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,463
Women voters are partial
to the color red, you know.

109
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,925
Until we discover how to
safely dispose of it... What...

110
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,677
What are you doing? Stop!

111
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,056
- Keep the cores apart or you'll kill us all!
- Do as he says.

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,811
This is outrageous!
What are you intending to do with it?

113
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,897
I'm gonna give
the people of this city

114
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,150
- a reason to re-elect me.
- How?

115
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,028
The only way you can, Doctor.
I'm gonna kick some butt.

116
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,910
- This is so unfair.
- Now cool off, hotshot.

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,662
Please don't leave me in here, sir!

118
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,123
I can't stand small places.
Anywhere but here!

119
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,460
Jeez, kid. You're like 13 years old.
It's time you grew a backbone.

120
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,965
Thanks for the life lesson,
and thank you for this.

121
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,718
As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.

122
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,346
Come on, Elefun. You know as well as I do,
without military funding

123
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,058
all of our research, including yours,
would grind to a halt.

124
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,768
Start it up.

125
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,872
I told President Stone,
"You gotta bring out the big guns."

126
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,498
"Onward and upward, Toby."

127
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,500
Load the Blue Core.

128
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,763
Hold on. This Blue Core,
it's all sweetness and light, right?

129
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,557
I mean, "Save the dolphins,"
"Give peace a chance," and so forth?

130
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,976
It's pure positive energy.

131
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,148
Call me a dreamer, but I think we'll get a bit
more bang for our buck using the red one.

132
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,817
Oh, you're not joking.

133
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,781
Sir, we're not putting something that
dangerous into something that dangerous.

134
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,742
Listen, Tenma, I've got an election to win.

135
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,954
I need my robot to be a fighter, not a lover.

136
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,665
- Load the red one.
- I won't.

137
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,251
Well, then I'll do it. Move over, sweetheart.

138
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,585
- Hey!
- No!

139
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,798
It's like a video game.

140
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,015
Core loaded.

141
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,850
Piece of cake.

142
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,852
Activate weapon drones.

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,361
I hate this job.

144
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,950
I gotta get a better look.

145
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,786
- Time to check the classifieds.
- I hear you.

146
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,713
It's using that drone against
the other drones. How's that possible?

147
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,799
It's called "adaptive technology."
It can absorb and control anything.

148
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,509
Well, I may have
flunked out of college,

149
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,386
but I was right about the Red Core.

150
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,222
You scientists think
you're the only ones with the brains.

151
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,019
Huh? Sir?

152
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,327
Dad! Dad!

153
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,537
- Toby!
- Dad!

154
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,248
I can't open it! I can't open it!

155
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,667
Help me, Dad! Help!

156
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,127
- Toby!
- Dad!

157
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,756
It's going to be okay, Toby.
I'm going to get you out!

158
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,009
Everything's going to be fine, I promise.

159
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,101
Toby!

160
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,442
Fire now.

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,141
Where's Toby? Where's my son?

162
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm so sorry, Tenma.

163
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,116
Toby.

164
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,330
It's all my fault.

165
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,931
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.

166
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,433
- I know.
- He's gone crazy, hasn't he?

167
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,437
If you lose your son like that
and you don't go crazy,

168
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,105
you're not a human being.

169
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,274
Clear the lab.

170
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,963
It looks just like him, doesn't it?
A perfect replica.

171
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,508
Plus, I've uploaded all of Toby's memories.

172
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,887
- It will think it is Toby.
- Don't expect too much, Tenma.

173
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,141
It has the most advanced defense systems
ever created.

174
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,893
I won't lose him again.

175
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,688
Did you bring what I asked?

176
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,148
I couldn't refuse a grieving father.

177
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,116
The Core is unpredictable.
I can't guarantee what effect...

178
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,077
It's gonna make it perfect! Perfect!

179
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,329
Just like Toby was.

180
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,439
Dad?

181
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,399
Toby.

182
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,864
Whoa. Whoa.

183
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,616
Dad!

184
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,077
Welcome back, Son.

185
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,248
Thank you, Elefun.
I'm going to take it, him, home now.

186
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,002
Quality time. Bonding. All the good things.

187
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,837
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

188
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,507
Bye, Toby.

189
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,802
Incredible.

190
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,990
Dad?

191
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,955
Good morning, Son. How do you feel?

192
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:25,210
Uh, kind of weird.
Have I been sick or something?

193
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,297
No, you're fine, Toby. You're perfect.
You're wonderful.

194
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,591
Oh, that's good, 'cause...

195
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,558
Um, are you okay?

196
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,567
No. I must be malfunctioning.
Wires crossing, short-circuiting.

197
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,236
It can't be you. You're...

198
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,197
Oh, my gosh!

199
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,199
You're... You're...

200
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,659
Hey, Orrin, you okay?

201
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,829
You're gonna be late for school.

202
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:09,379
Well, I must say,
it's very nice to see you again.

203
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,507
Sit down, Toby. I wanna talk to you.

204
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,469
- Sure, Dad.
- It's about school.

205
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,346
I've decided
you shouldn't go anymore, Son.

206
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,558
I'm gonna teach you at home myself.

207
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,726
Sounds good to me.

208
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,729
Hey, Orrin, looks like we're gonna be
hanging out together.

209
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:32,152
Together? Well, that'll be very nice,
Master Toby.

210
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,946
- Oh, dear.
- Please, Toby,

211
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,866
- just let the robot do its thing.
- Sorry.

212
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,996
Hey, if you're going to be home-schooling
me, what about the Ministry? Yourjob?

213
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,750
My job now is to be your father.

214
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,876
Huh.

215
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,170
I am so freaked!

216
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,508
Let's start you out with something familiar.

217
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,053
Four-dimensional calculus.
It's your favorite.

218
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,222
I guess it is.

219
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,434
If sir wishes,
perhaps I could help Master Toby with...

220
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh, bad idea. Bad idea. I'm a robot.
What am I thinking?

221
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,317
Wrong way.

222
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,862
Okay, there.

223
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,740
Excellent.

224
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,700
Yeah.

225
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,452
Interesting solution.

226
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,539
Good. Good.

227
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,504
Bravo. Wonderful. Excellent, Toby.
First rate, Son. First rate.

228
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,880
You ain't seen nothing yet.

229
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,138
Howdy!

230
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,308
Hey, that fractal's looking fair
Cosine, tangent, there's a square!

231
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,395
Is that secant high or low?
Watch me as I do-si-do

232
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,442
Let's get back to basics.
Remember this one?

233
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,112
Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.

234
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,030
I used to read it to you in bed
when you were little.

235
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,117
To put me to sleep?

236
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,661
Yes! You asked for it every night.

237
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,289
That's not quite what I...

238
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,167
Just try re-reading these.
Get the old brain humming again.

239
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,044
Whir.

240
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,349
Hmm.

241
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,979
Next.

242
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,277
Huh.

243
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,660
Huh.

244
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,169
Beautiful. I got it! I got it!

245
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,381
- Whoa! Close.
- Way to go, Orrin. You're the man.

246
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:03,595
Yes. You know, I haven't had
this much fun since, well, ever.

247
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,055
Check this out.

248
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,264
Oh!

249
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:17,359
I'm impressed.
Not knocked out, but impressed.

250
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,194
That's nothing. Watch this!

251
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:25,867
Oh!

252
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,579
Now, that is impressive, Master Toby!

253
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,123
Just "Toby" is fine, Orrin.

254
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,214
Toby.

255
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,055
What are you doing? I said to read
these books, not destroy them.

256
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,475
I just wanted to
test da Vinci's theories.

257
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:57,232
I um, perhaps encouraged Master Toby, sir.

258
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,156
You should not be wearing that hat.

259
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:10,370
A robot should not be wearing my son's...
Toby's hat.

260
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,424
Dad, it's fine. I don't even like the hat.

261
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,430
I think you should go to your room.

262
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,682
- But, Dad...
- Do as you're told!

263
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,198
Tenma? What's wrong?

264
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,784
I think I've made a terrible mistake.

265
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,788
I thought he would be like Toby,
but he's not.

266
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,458
He's strange. He's very strange.

267
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,752
Strange? Strange how?

268
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,464
He's brilliant as Toby was, but different.

269
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,551
Well, you can't expect him to
be a carbon copy. Give him time, Tenma.

270
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,969
You don't understand.

271
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,097
He was meant to replace Toby,

272
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:15,852
but every time I look at him,
it just reminds me that Toby is gone

273
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,230
and he's never coming back.

274
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,285
What's different?
I haven't seen Dad angry before.

275
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,835
Check out the haircut on that one.

276
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,129
It looks like he's got horns.

277
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,422
Horns! Good one!

278
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,424
What do you mean horns? It's gel!

279
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,887
- Wait. I can understand you?
- Whoa! That's creepy.

280
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,139
- What is?
- It's like he can understand us.

281
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,434
- Don't be a dummy!
- I can hear what you're saying!

282
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,061
It's as if he can hear what we're saying.

283
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,271
There's no way. He's a human!

284
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,733
Come on, let's go leak oil on some statues.

285
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,360
Okey-dokey.

286
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,989
How can I understand what you're saying?
You're robots.

287
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,491
We don't want any trouble.

288
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,201
- Wait up! I just wanna know...
- Hey, leave him alone!

289
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,702
...what's going on. What's happened to me?

290
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:25,839
Okay, guys, let's back up very carefully.

291
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,675
Oh, no!

292
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,970
Hang on, buddy! We're coming!
We're coming!

293
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,187
That's too freaky for me.

294
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,322
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

295
00:24:55,828 --> 00:25:01,583
Whoa! Whoa!

296
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,961
Uh-oh!

297
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,888
Waiter, this steak is under-cooked.

298
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,767
Ah.

299
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,568
This is so cool. I gotta show Dad.

300
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,036
How can my approval ratings be this low?

301
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:06,833
I was very popular in high school. I've cut
taxes for a lot of very influential friends.

302
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,459
What more do people want?

303
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,879
We're tracking an unidentified object
flying over Metro City, sir.

304
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,840
The Surface dwellers are firing at us?

305
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,718
This is what I've been waiting for!
Declare war on them!

306
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,469
This is going to get me re-elected.

307
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,263
This didn't come from the Surface, sir.

308
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,473
It's my opponent. He's taken the gloves off.

309
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:23,641
He's playing hardball.

310
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,059
It's Blue Core energy, sir!

311
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,563
What? Elefun told me the Blue Core
was destroyed.

312
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,400
Get me a location and mobilize all units!
I want that thing now!

313
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,362
I got here as fast as I could.

314
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,656
Where is he? Where's Toby?

315
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,327
I sent him to his room. Please,
just deactivate him and take him away.

316
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,663
I can't bear to see his face again.

317
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,625
Come on, Tenma. You can't just
throw him away like a piece ofjunk.

318
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,793
Dad?

319
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,088
What's going on?

320
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,007
Why are you talking about me like this?

321
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,885
Toby, there's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.

322
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,014
You're not actually
an entirely ordinary boy.

323
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,849
I know.

324
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,936
Dad, I can fly. I can drill my way
through solid rock. It's amazing.

325
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,773
How did I think this could work?

326
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,818
What's wrong with me?
Why don't you love me anymore?

327
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,613
He's programmed with the memories
of your own son, Tenma.

328
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,699
- Programmed?
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?

329
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,994
But he isn't my son.

330
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,205
Dad.

331
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,210
I'm not your dad.
You're not Toby.

332
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,212
You're a copy of Toby.

333
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,131
Not my son, a robot,

334
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,596
and I don't want you anymore.

335
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,681
No! No!

336
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,975
Toby, wait!

337
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,230
I can't see into the future,
but I'm sure there's a place for you.

338
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,564
You just have to find it.

339
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,902
He's my father. This is my home.
It's all I know.

340
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,655
Everyone has their destiny, Toby.

341
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,117
Didn't you hear him? I'm not Toby.

342
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,077
Please, Elefun.

343
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,188
It's true.

344
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,607
What?

345
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,821
Sir, we've located
the signal's source, but it's a child.

346
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,157
Readings for the Core are off the chart!

347
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,033
Is that Tenma's boy?

348
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,997
Of course not! Holy cow.
Tenma must've lost his mind.

349
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,707
Bring it in.

350
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,209
This is Stinger One.
Set weapons for capture.

351
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,586
Oh, no.

352
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,048
Whoa! He just took off!

353
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,177
Commander, engage the subject
with intent to capture.

354
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,227
What do you guys want?

355
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,855
Command Center, we have it in our sights.

356
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,085
- Huh?
- Ta da!

357
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,254
Oh, my God!

358
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,007
I'm just gonna take these things back.

359
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,092
I'm getting married!

360
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,469
Get him!

361
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,475
Where'd he go? Huh?

362
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,644
What?

363
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,246
We've got him.
We're coming home.

364
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,289
No, no, no!

365
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,833
Oh, no!

366
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,510
Send in the Spirit of Freedom.

367
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,847
Destroy the robot, then collect the Core.

368
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,475
You're safe.

369
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,105
Again? What's with you guys?

370
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,273
I love you!

371
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,525
Come on, then!

372
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,462
Fire!

373
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,231
Finish it.

374
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,324
Touchdown!

375
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,831
Hey, where's he going?

376
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,417
- It's falling to the Surface, sir.
- Get him back!

377
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,795
I am declaring
a state of national emergency.

378
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:31,425
Leave for all military personnel is canceled
until Tenma's boy is found.

379
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,616
Welcome to your new home, kid.

380
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,494
Hello.

381
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,289
Batteries! He's got new batteries!

382
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,834
Spare a few volts for a fellow Sparky?

383
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,043
New batteries.

384
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,171
Help me, son. I'm fading...

385
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,217
Table for one.
Smoking or non-smoking?

386
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,137
Smoking. I'm smoking.
I'm definitely smoking.

387
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,472
You're one of us, now. Happy to meet you.

388
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,559
No, I... No, no, I'm not one of you guys.

389
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,394
You're a robot, ain't you?

390
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,814
- Yes, but...
- Well, welcome to the scrap heap.

391
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,233
This is where we all end up sooner or later.

392
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
No way, I'm not ready yet.

393
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,988
Hey! Hey, get off of me!
What are you doing?

394
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,240
One of us.

395
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,324
Incoming!

396
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,676
What do I do?

397
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,138
Dad?

398
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,851
Who's there?

399
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,359
Whoa!

400
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:16,322
You like me, huh? "Trashcan."

401
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,157
So, are you lost, Trashcan?

402
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
I know I sure am.

403
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,371
What is it, boy?

404
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,207
Someone's in trouble?

405
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,875
Oh, no.

406
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,545
Trashcan, wait up!

407
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,758
Over here? Whoa!

408
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,178
Is this it? Hello!

409
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,764
They could be miles down.

410
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,475
The hole looks pretty deep!

411
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,648
Quick, get the restraints on it. Hurry!

412
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,442
Good work, boy! Treat for you.

413
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,070
Hey, hey! Knock it off!

414
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,949
- That's not a robot.
- It's a kid.

415
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:05,955
- That's... That's right. I'm a kid like you.
- What?

416
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,624
We want robots, not kids,
you stupid garbage-eater.

417
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,793
So, where are you from, non-robot?

418
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,003
I'm from Metro City.

419
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,882
Metro City! Can you
believe it, guys? He's from Metro City,

420
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,260
- and he's actually talking to me.
- Are you feeling okay?

421
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,053
Oh, my gosh! He talked to me twice.

422
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,890
Well, this is definitely going in my diary
as the most exciting day of my life.

423
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,018
Okay, I get it.
You don't like people from Metro City.

424
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,689
Metro City.
Robots waiting on you hand and foot.

425
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,400
I'd love to visit, just for one day.

426
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,318
They wouldn't let you in.

427
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,780
They have a strict "No losers
from the Surface allowed" policy.

428
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,782
Anyway, why would you want
to go someplace

429
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,701
where people think you're garbage?

430
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,120
I mean, look at this.

431
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Can you believe someone
just threw it away?

432
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,791
Nu-uh! Finders keepers.

433
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,961
So, what are you doing down here?

434
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:59,216
I don't know yet. Looking for something,
I guess, somewhere.

435
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,676
Did you run away?

436
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:05,139
Not exactly.
They sort of suggested I find a new place,

437
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,057
whatever that means.

438
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,226
Dude, it means they kicked you out.

439
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,730
- Well, I...
- I'm Zane.

440
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,565
- I'm Widget.
- Hi, I'm Sludge,

441
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,442
- and I'm older than her.
- By 90 seconds.

442
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,236
- And I'm Cora. What's your name?
- Oh, it's...

443
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,489
- Viva la Roboto-lution!
- Viva la Roboto-lution!

444
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,241
What just happened?

445
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:31,165
Did you see the humans' faces?
They were quaking in their capitalist boots!

446
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,501
Don't worry, brother. You're safe!

447
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,462
You have been rescued by...

448
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,465
The Robot Revolutionary Front!

449
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,217
I'm Sparx, the brains.

450
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,095
And I'm Robotsky, the muscle.

451
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,308
And I'm Mike the Fridge. I'm the fridge.

452
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,352
You are now liberated!

453
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:56,106
Go ahead, comrade.
Take your first step as a free robot.

454
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,399
Take it! Take it!

455
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,112
Feels different, doesn't it?

456
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:08,535
- It feels wetter.
- It feels wetter! Liberation!

457
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,206
- Yeah!
- What are you doing?

458
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:17,336
Uh, sorry. I'll pick it up.

459
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,837
Yes, please.

460
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,050
You look like a pretty advanced model
if I might say so, brother.

461
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,303
Just out of interest, no particular reason
for me asking, but are you exempt

462
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,515
- from the laws of robotics?
- Remind me?

463
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:33,394
A robot cannot harm a human,
be a cause of any harm to a human,

464
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,771
blah-blah-blah, boring, boring, boring.

465
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,190
Well, I don't really want to harm anybody.

466
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,319
Lug nuts!
The RRF are dedicated to freeing robot-kind

467
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,823
from human slavery
by any means necessary.

468
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,243
And he means any means necessary.

469
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,370
What is your name, comrade?

470
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,914
- Toby.
- Toby?

471
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,040
Well, that's not much of a name.

472
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,126
No, you want something
with a bit more oomph to it.

473
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,005
- Something like the Ice-maker.
- Yeah, or the Annihilator.

474
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,090
Or Pauline.

475
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,342
- Well, I guess I'll...
- Hang on a minute.

476
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,261
We haven't come up
with a new name for you yet.

477
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,554
What about...

478
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,726
What about Astro?

479
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,729
Oh, be quiet. If you can't come up
with a sensible suggestion,

480
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,523
- then kindly mind your own business.
- Sorry.

481
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,275
Think. Think.

482
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,693
- I've got it!
- What?

483
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,237
- Astro!
- That's marvelous, that is.

484
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,239
It's modern, a little space-age. I love it.

485
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,616
Thanks, guys. Well, I better get going.

486
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,827
Show Astro the plan!

487
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,164
As you wish, comrade. This is Hamegg!

488
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,128
- Nice.
- The likes of him enslave our kind.

489
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,213
We need to make an example of Hamegg.

490
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:47,009
We want to do something so horrible,
so frightening, so shocking,

491
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,220
that the humans will be forced
to free all robots.

492
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,473
- What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna sneak into town.

493
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,350
- We're going to lie in wait for Hamegg.
- And?

494
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,353
- And when he shows up...
- Yes?

495
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:01,565
Now bear in mind, we're forced to follow
the laws of robotics.

496
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,903
- Okay.
- We are going to tickle him with a feather!

497
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,322
Viva la Roboto-lution!

498
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,490
That's the plan?

499
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,575
We're already looking into purchasing
the feather.

500
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,744
Oh, blimey!

501
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,497
- You okay?
- How did you find our secret hideout?

502
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,750
You guys really need to work on
your camouflage skills.

503
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,878
Don't make us dismantle you.
We just want the kid back.

504
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,963
Kid? What are you talking about? He's a...

505
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,381
Ow!

506
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,966
You want a piece of me, tin man?

507
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,719
Be cool.
I'm an undercover robot from Metro City.

508
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,472
I knew it. Viva la Roboto-lution.

509
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,725
These guys aren't doing any harm.
Let's just leave them.

510
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,352
Whatever you say.

511
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,524
Thank you, brother.
The RRF are forever in your debt.

512
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,361
So, what is your name?

513
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,949
Toby, but that's not who I really am.

514
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,992
- You see...
- Dude, it's a simple question.

515
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,202
Um...

516
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,872
My name's Astro. Call me Astro.

517
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,457
Cool. Sounds modern.

518
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,042
A little space-age. I love it.

519
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,295
Hold on, I'll be right there.

520
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,131
- Good afternoon. How...
- Excuse me, robot. Thank you.

521
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,758
Search the apartment!
Leave no stone unturned.

522
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,844
- Arrest this man.
- Yes, sir.

523
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,930
- What are you doing? Stop!
- Where is Tenma's robot son?

524
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,682
He isn't here.

525
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,183
What is the meaning of this?

526
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,978
You put the Core for my Peacekeeper
into your robot.

527
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,856
I'm running for re-election,
in case you hadn't noticed,

528
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,774
and we're in an arms race with the Surface!

529
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,693
An arms race? What nonsense.

530
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:33,490
It was a stupid mistake. When I lost my son,

531
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:38,078
I thought I'd be able to... I thought...

532
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:44,084
I know. I hate losing, too. You want proof
of that, you can ask any of my wives,

533
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,171
but we got to get over
all this personal stuff, Tenma.

534
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,591
You're head of the Ministry of Science.
It's time to move on.

535
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,302
Get the Core back.
Get it in the Peacekeeper.

536
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,637
Let some good come from all this mess.

537
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:05,564
When you find the robot,
I'll deactivate it and give you the Core.

538
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,774
Good man. Let him go.

539
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,405
Let's hope you never find him.

540
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,242
So, there's actually people
living in these ruins?

541
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:23,332
Ruins? Hey, it might not look like much to a
Metro City kid, but this place is home to us.

542
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,083
- Here we are.
- Huh?

543
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,298
Come on, Astro.

544
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,633
Whoa!

545
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,722
Sorry.

546
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,022
What's the password?

547
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,107
Don't make me hurt you.

548
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,276
Close enough.

549
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,578
Fore!

550
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,206
- Five!
- You're out!

551
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,667
We're out of apples. We're on to grapes.

552
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,544
Hey, Cora,
did you bring me back something?

553
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,297
The perfect gift for a sweet little girl.

554
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,842
- Thanks!
- Be careful!

555
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,263
- Too late!
- Hey, we're kind of tired!

556
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,390
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

557
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,267
You need 10 sets of eyes around here.

558
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,566
Hey, Hamegg!

559
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,613
Back so soon?

560
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,157
Did you guys find anything
good for me today?

561
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,871
I don't know, kids. A lot of dead batteries.
A lot of elbows here.

562
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:49,626
The knee joint of a toilet-cleaning robot?
I told you, I need heads.

563
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,253
We would've gotten better stuff, but the...

564
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,302
Well, well.

565
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,846
His name's Astro. He's from Metro City.

566
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:05,100
Metro City? Wow,
I used to work there once upon a time.

567
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,351
Really?

568
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,479
Why am I running a crummy
body repair shop down here

569
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,357
when I could be creating
state-of-the-art robots in Metro City?

570
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
No, I didn't mean to...

571
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,988
Relax, son. We're family here.
We're allowed to ask questions.

572
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:23,160
The answer is I love robots,
especially the discarded ones.

573
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,329
The more banged-up they are,
the more abused,

574
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,998
the more I like getting them
back on their feet.

575
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,795
- Oh, wow.
- It's almost a religious thing with me,

576
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,923
kind of like the way saints feel
about the poor

577
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,053
or women feel about shoes
or fat people feel about donuts

578
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,015
or... I'll stop with fat people and donuts.

579
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,934
So, you're not into enslaving robots?

580
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,312
- What?
- He ran into the RRF.

581
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,860
I don't enslave robots. I love robots!

582
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:01,531
They're our friends,
and we rely on them for our daily bread.

583
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,993
Speaking of which,
are any of you misfits hungry?

584
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,873
Let me guess, take-out pizza again?

585
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,667
More like "taken out of the trash" again!

586
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,754
Picky, picky. It's only a couple of days old.

587
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,465
Look, this one still has toppings!

588
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,800
Oh!

589
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,844
Hey, haven't you forgotten something?

590
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,473
What have they forgotten, son?

591
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,727
- Grace?
- Exactly. Grace!

592
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,063
- What?
- Turn on the TV, sweetheart,

593
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,731
would you, please? There's a dear.

594
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,236
Well, bon appétit.

595
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,405
Yo, new guy, you gonna eat that?

596
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,656
You can have it if you want it.

597
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,032
Don't be so nice.

598
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:48,161
You're gonna starve to death
or be the only survivor.

599
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,748
So, tell me, Astro,
do your folks know where you are?

600
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,625
I don't have any parents.

601
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:59,423
How very sad. Did you lose them?
Or, even sadder, did they lose you?

602
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,927
No. The truth is I'm actually a...

603
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,179
I'm a...

604
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,223
A what?

605
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,058
Don't worry, son.

606
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,687
We're all orphans down here.
Nothing to be ashamed about.

607
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,773
So, none of you have parents?

608
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,775
Parents? Are you kidding me?

609
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,780
This whole place is a parent-free zone.

610
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:27,159
I was born in the scrap heap.
I was raised by wild dogs.

611
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,619
Really? Are you sure it wasn't wild pigs?

612
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,683
Feeling homesick
for Metro City, Astro?

613
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,145
- No.
- Me neither.

614
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,775
I was head of advanced robotics
at the Ministry of Science.

615
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:05,780
Oh, yeah. Right up there with Tenma
and the other mucky-mucks.

616
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,159
- What happened?
- What always happens to genius.

617
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,786
They were intimidated by my talent,
my ideas,

618
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,499
so they threw me away like an old battery.

619
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,418
I'm sorry.

620
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:23,089
Not your problem. You know,
I've got a hunch about you, Astro.

621
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,760
There's always room for a good kid
in this family.

622
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,846
Now, how about getting some shut-eye?

623
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,432
Good night, son.

624
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,977
Good night, Hamegg.

625
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:42,359
I'm gonna tell them, just not yet, okay?

626
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,494
Hey, quit bugging me.

627
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,331
I said I would.
I just want them to get used to me first.

628
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,961
What does Hamegg want
all these parts for?

629
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:06,216
He's a genius. He can make cool robots
from pretty much any old scrap.

630
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,386
And then he puts them
into Hamegg's Robot Games.

631
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,470
Robot Games?

632
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:14,224
They're a tradition down here.
It's kind of a Roman thing.

633
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,809
And it's pretty cool.

634
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,770
You're not going to find much here.
It's a graveyard.

635
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,440
Mr. Metro City's first day
and he's already an expert.

636
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,652
You'd be surprised.
I know a thing or two about robots.

637
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,487
Hey, guys, I think we've got something.

638
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,240
- See? Coming!
- Look!

639
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,243
Hey, what's the matter, boy?

640
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,672
Almost makes me wish I could read.

641
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,550
Nice try, rust-bucket.

642
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,305
Whoa! Cora, hey, I think I found something!

643
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,477
Ha! That's just an old construction robot.

644
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,188
It fell to the Surface, like, 100 years ago.

645
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,857
Do you think Hamegg could use it?

646
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,152
Yeah, if he had a robot like that,
he'd make a fortune in the Games,

647
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,572
but it's just junk.
We used to have picnics in its head.

648
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,908
- Just give me a minute.
- It weighs hundreds of tons.

649
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,494
What are you going to do,
put it in your backpack?

650
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,540
She'd flip if she knew I could carry it.

651
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,477
Hmm.

652
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:46,066
I know you're not dead.
You're just pretending.

653
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,294
Come on, big guy.

654
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,546
Time to wake up.

655
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,604
Zog, let me help you.

656
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,274
Come on.

657
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,123
Okay, tiger, show me what you got.

658
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,670
Hold it right there, twinkle-toes.

659
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,922
What are you, some kind of ice-skater?

660
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,801
You planning on ballroom dancing
with this guy or you gonna fight him?

661
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,887
That's better! Now hit him below the belt.

662
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,640
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

663
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:05,353
Now get him in a headlock and pound him!
Pound him! Use your thumbs!

664
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:09,524
Great, great. Kid, I think you've got
the makings of a champion.

665
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,657
Hi, Hamegg!

666
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,075
Sorry about your robot.

667
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:24,789
What? Oh, him?
He wasn't really working out anyway.

668
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:30,003
But, hey, this guy's something else!
Look at the legs on this baby.

669
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:34,632
Look at those feet. None of your
carbon-fiber plastic junk on this guy.

670
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,342
That's solid pig iron.

671
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,804
Astro got it running,
which I'm still having trouble believing.

672
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:43,516
But it's been dead for at least a century!
How did you do it?

673
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,020
Please, tell me! How did you do it?

674
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,398
I just kicked it, you know,
like a vending machine.

675
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,276
"Give me back my money!" It was nothing.

676
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,779
You hear that, kids?
A genius with modesty.

677
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,697
I didn't think it occurred in nature.

678
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,034
Ah! You're almost too good to be true, kid.

679
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,870
Keep this up
and I may just have to adopt you.

680
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,418
Holy cow.
This thing's got enough juice to run a city.

681
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,754
What was that?

682
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,467
Oh, nothing, son, just another machine
with a mind of its own.

683
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,932
Ready, guys?

684
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,101
We are young, we run green

685
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,313
Keep our teeth, nice and clean

686
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:35,193
See our friends, see the sights, feel all right

687
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:41,115
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag

688
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,577
Put it out, see our friends

689
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:48,206
See the sights, feel all right

690
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,169
Are we like you?

691
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:56,339
I can't be sure

692
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,509
Of the scene, as she turns

693
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,303
We are strange in our worlds

694
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,222
But we are young

695
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,050
Are we like you?

696
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,220
I can't be sure

697
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,723
Of the scene, as she turns

698
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:50,143
Hey! I thought I was... And you were...

699
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,770
How did you do that?

700
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,314
I'm faster than I look.

701
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,358
Keep our teeth, nice and clean

702
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,695
See our friends, see the sights, feel all right

703
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,620
Everybody say, "Limburger."

704
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,746
Limburger!

705
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,465
Good night, Zog.

706
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,762
Hey, Trashcan, you wanna play?

707
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,390
Fetch!

708
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,019
Oops!

709
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,361
Hello?

710
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,196
Hello?

711
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,657
- Hello?
- Hello?

712
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,158
Ouch!

713
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,330
Hey, didn't your nanny-bots tell you
it's rude to sneak up on people?

714
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,333
- How's your head?
- Well, it's still on.

715
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,128
You know, they say that sometimes
when it's really clear, like tonight,

716
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,047
you can still call through to Metro City.

717
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,716
You wanna call Metro City?

718
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:06,886
Yeah. What?
You've never made a prank call before?

719
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,557
The only thing is
I can't get this stupid phone to work.

720
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,936
- Let me try.
- Knock yourself out.

721
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,401
Ow.

722
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,903
Here. It's kind of weak, but there is a signal.

723
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:28,241
Hey, not bad. The kid has hidden talents.

724
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,243
You have no idea.

725
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,786
Hi.

726
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,457
Come on, somebody, pick up.
Please, pick up. It's me, Cora.

727
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,086
I miss you guys.

728
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,423
Are you okay?

729
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,010
Sometimes I wonder
if they've even noticed I'm gone.

730
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,428
Who?

731
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:50,930
My parents.

732
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,307
Your... Your parents?

733
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,310
That's right.
Now you know the truth about me.

734
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:00,189
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go tell Zane and the others

735
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:05,153
that Cora's from Metro City
and that she's still trying to call home.

736
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,989
Don't forget the part
about you being raised by nanny-bots.

737
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:15,830
Everybody's got secrets. I wouldn't tell.
You can trust me, Cora.

738
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,500
I know. You're a good guy, Astro.

739
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:24,505
Can... Can I tell you something, my secret?

740
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,300
Sure, that's what friends are for, right?

741
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,012
Do you ever feel like you just don't fit in,

742
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,725
like you're different to everyone else,
kind of an outsider?

743
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,479
Of course,
everyone feels like that sometimes.

744
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,231
Well, the last few days have been different
for me,

745
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,818
I mean,
being with all you guys and Hamegg.

746
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,947
The thing I need to tell you is, I'm a...

747
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,325
I'm kind of a...

748
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,911
I'm a...

749
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,621
Yeah?

750
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,541
I'm really starting to like it here with you,

751
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,628
- with you guys.
- Yeah?

752
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,423
Well, we like you too, Astro.

753
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,886
Hey, Trashcan.

754
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:20,937
I know it's not the same thing,
but isn't Hamegg sort of like our dad now?

755
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,689
Yeah, I guess.

756
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,325
Robot Revolutionary Front,
transform!

757
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,624
Check, check, check.

758
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,670
Yeah.

759
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,006
Ow!

760
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,719
Get off me! Which part
of "ninja-like" do you not understand?

761
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,429
What's a ninja?

762
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,891
Bring out the secret weapon.

763
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,573
I've been looking for that.

764
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,200
Yeah. Oh.

765
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,952
- Viva la Roboto-lution!
- Viva la Roboto-lution!

766
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:22,123
My fellow Surface dwellers,
today is the day you've all been waiting for!

767
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,376
Give him a hand, folks,
the kid in the red boots!

768
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,713
He's the one who got this killing machine
up and running!

769
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,548
Look out, Hamegg.

770
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,846
You are the golden child.
Hamegg really likes you.

771
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,389
I like him, too.

772
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,349
What's he mean by "killing machine"?

773
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,727
Well, the robots fight until one of them
is destroyed.

774
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:43,853
What?

775
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,606
Don't worry.
Zog is gonna crush them all.

776
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,399
That's what happens
at the Robot Games?

777
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,735
Well, what did you expect?
Rock, paper, scissors?

778
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:56,532
- Who's the robot?
- I'm the robot!

779
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:57,909
- No mercy!
- No mercy!

780
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,579
- No mercy!
- No mercy! No mercy! No mercy!

781
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,543
- Mercy?
- Nice knowing you, kid.

782
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,754
I thought it was a show,
not a slaughter.

783
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,423
- They're just robots, son.
- I thought you liked robots.

784
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,761
I do, but at the end of the day,
they're just junk waiting to happen.

785
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,847
I know, some of those more advanced ones

786
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:24,101
from Metro City are programmed to smile
and laugh just like us.

787
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,811
Really?

788
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,606
Yeah. Unfortunately,
they don't have real emotions,

789
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,108
which is why I have no problem doing this!

790
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,159
- It worked! I don't believe it!
- What are you doing?

791
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,579
I swiped this from Dr. Tenma after
he fired me from the Ministry of Science.

792
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,958
- Who cares? Why did you do that to Astro?
- He's our friend!

793
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,252
I thought I raised you better. Are you blind?

794
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,544
He's a robot!

795
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,757
That's not true. It can't be true.

796
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,386
Somebody programmed him to be nice.
He's not really nice.

797
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,888
He's just an incredibly powerful machine.

798
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,265
But he was so...

799
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,434
I know, sweetheart. It's got to be tough.

800
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,395
What are you gonna do with him?

801
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,146
Take a wild guess.

802
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

803
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,701
and all you riff-raff who snuck in
without buying a ticket,

804
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,372
allow me to present Astro Boy!

805
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,295
I know, I know. You're wondering
what a nice-looking kid like that

806
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,005
is doing in a place like this.

807
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,840
That ain't no kid, folks.

808
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:40,636
That's a robot from Metro City.

809
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:46,434
Get this, folks. Astro personally told me
he doesn't think much

810
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,269
of our fighting robots.

811
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,478
Boo!

812
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,605
Thinks they're all a bunch of sissies!

813
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,191
Thinks you're all trailer park trash!

814
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,818
He didn't say that.

815
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,695
He didn't say he was a robot, either.

816
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,531
This is what we've all been waiting for,

817
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:04,493
a fight between the Surface and Metro City.

818
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,246
Let's get it on!

819
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,088
I'm not fighting.

820
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,674
Ah!

821
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,432
I'm not doing this.

822
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,958
- Yeah!
- Go, Astro!

823
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:03,010
Bring out the Little Stinker!

824
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,808
Will you play with us?

825
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,185
- Us?
- Yes, us.

826
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,495
Hey, fella.

827
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,205
Oh, no!

828
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:35,918
Oh!

829
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,422
I have a boo-boo.

830
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:47,805
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

831
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,645
Go! Go!

832
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,272
- Stand back!
- What are you...

833
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,650
We've got a feather,
and we're not afraid to use it.

834
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,236
Oh!

835
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,238
I may have spoken in haste.

836
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:24,216
Why fight, brothers?
A great robot once said...

837
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,885
Me schnoz!

838
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,281
Yeah! Yeah!

839
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,499
- We've located Tenma's son, sir.
- What?

840
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,417
I win again!

841
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:01,754
And now, the final challenger.

842
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:07,218
A robot so fearsome, so powerful,
even I'm afraid to watch.

843
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:12,890
I give you the mighty Zog!

844
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,892
- Oh, no.
- No.

845
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,811
Let's see how Astro Boy does
against a robot

846
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,898
powered with the same energy he's got.

847
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,442
I'm not fighting you, Zog.

848
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,448
I mean it. I won't fight.

849
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,996
Oh, no.

850
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,342
Yeah!

851
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:53,305
Great! A love-in. Some big finale.
I said fight!

852
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,811
- I won't fight.
- Fight!

853
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,604
That's enough!

854
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:01,939
What's the matter with you?

855
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,024
They're just machines!
They'll do what I tell them!

856
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:05,693
What? I'm gonna get embarrassed

857
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,320
by some souped-up hotshot
from Metro City,

858
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,116
and a 100-year-old bulldozer
from New Jersey?

859
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,159
I don't think so!

860
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,870
I'm turning you both off!

861
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,296
Stop! The laws of robotics!

862
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,300
You can't hurt a human!
It's been that way for 50 years!

863
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,052
I'm old school.

864
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:36,473
Look!

865
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,066
What kind of robot are you?

866
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,572
We've got to recruit the big guy.

867
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,212
What are they doing here?

868
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:10,341
Seize the rogue robot and secure the area.

869
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,134
- Hey!
- Come here.

870
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,679
Zog, stop! Put them down.

871
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,392
It doesn't matter anymore.

872
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,979
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Come on.

873
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,774
Boo!

874
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,613
- I'm sorry. I tried to tell you.
- Keep moving.

875
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,616
Trashcan, no!

876
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:40,746
Hey, get off me, you dumb robot! Get off!

877
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,582
It's okay, Trashcan.

878
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,504
Oh, no.

879
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,423
President Stone's
approval rating reached a new low today

880
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,968
when he failed to show up for
a televised debate with Robert Logan,

881
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,180
the man many pundits are picking
as the next President of Metro City.

882
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,392
No darn dirty hippie's gonna sit
in my Oval Office

883
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:04,269
eating mung beans
and stinking of patchouli oil.

884
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,188
I've got the Blue Core,

885
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,191
and my Peacekeeper's gonna start
a war with the Surface.

886
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,985
That's bound to get me re-elected.

887
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:18,075
Why the long face, robot boy?
We're taking you home to your dad.

888
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,827
Care for a drink?

889
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,539
Very funny, Mr. President.

890
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,218
The experiment is over.
I want the Blue Core removed

891
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,721
and transferred into the Peacekeeper now.

892
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,848
Will you help me, Elefun?

893
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,641
This is where we created him.

894
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,018
Well, un-create him. Unplug him.

895
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,312
It's a matter of national security.

896
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,064
Let me talk to him first.

897
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,903
- Hello, Dr. Elefun.
- Hello, Toby.

898
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,323
Toby? Nobody's called me that for a while.

899
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:02,077
This isn't your fault, you know.
You're fantastic.

900
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,581
Absolutely first-class. Superb. Wonderful.

901
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:09,668
Thank you. You know,
I tried to find my place in the world.

902
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,630
I thought I'd found it, but I guess fitting in

903
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,175
can be a lot more complicated
than it seems, huh?

904
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,594
Dear boy, if you only knew.

905
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,847
I think maybe this is what's supposed
to happen.

906
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:24,516
This is my destiny.

907
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,103
Boo-hoo-hoo.

908
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,938
It's a machine.

909
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,024
Come on, let's get moving, people.

910
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,485
This is wrong, Tenma. You know it!

911
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:38,697
The President is right. It's just a machine.

912
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,075
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

913
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,244
Load the Blue Core into the Peacekeeper.

914
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,581
I've got a press conference scheduled
in 10 minutes.

915
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,290
I'm sorry.

916
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,711
Don't be. I'm sorry I couldn't have been
a better Toby for you,

917
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,214
Dad.

918
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,095
Well, Tenma, is it done?

919
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,934
It's done.

920
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:56,650
Good man.

921
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,778
When I'm re-elected,
you can have the funding

922
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,447
to make as many little toys as you want.

923
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:07,619
No. If you want the Core,
you're gonna have to kill me.

924
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:13,250
Tenma, no! I created the Core.
They're gonna have to kill me.

925
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:17,462
Well, I think Metro City can learn
to cope without you. Hand it over.

926
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:22,593
- Oh, it appears I don't have it.
- Tenma!

927
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,181
Tenma, open this!

928
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,143
Open that door!

929
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,395
Oh, please.

930
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,568
I said, open that door!

931
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,320
- Never.
- Now!

932
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,240
Blast.

933
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:48,035
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

934
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,792
Whoa! What are you doing?

935
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:59,880
You may not be Toby,
but you're still my son.

936
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,131
Dad.

937
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,804
Now fly! Fly!

938
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,524
No! No!

939
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,363
Arrest them immediately!
I want them shot for treason.

940
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,949
We're gonna have to use the Peacekeeper
to get the Blue Core back.

941
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,451
Don't use the Red Core,
the negative energy.

942
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,036
We can't know how it will behave.

943
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:34,289
Doctor, in any conflict between positive
and negative energy,

944
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,877
the negative always prevails.
Look at human history! Look at me!

945
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,295
My point exactly.

946
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,214
- Turn this thing on.
- I won't.

947
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,384
I have 50 reporters waiting outside!
Turn it on!

948
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,010
You don't understand the technology.

949
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:51,932
Technology! Who cares about technology?
Who understands technology?

950
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,726
It's a robot. It'll do what I say.

951
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,230
Red Core loaded.

952
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,651
You ready to do as you're told?
You ready to rock 'n' roll?

953
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,986
Sir!

954
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:08,073
Destroy the boy robot
and bring back the Blue Core.

955
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:16,039
What? Are you deaf?
I told you to destroy the boy robot...

956
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:21,253
And bring back the Blue Core.

957
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,547
- Everybody out! Now!
- Let's go!

958
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,049
Move it!

959
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,602
Uh, sorry, guys. I'm getting word that
President Stone may be slightly delayed.

960
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,947
Is this thing on?

961
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:53,827
Where are you going? Come back!

962
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:58,248
Monster, stand down
by order of President Stone.

963
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:05,172
This is the life, buddy. Smooth sailing.

964
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,507
Whoa!

965
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,051
Sorry, guys.

966
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,720
Oh, no! It's that crazy flying kid again!

967
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,224
I'm a robot just like you. Well,
what are you doing all the way out here?

968
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,518
We got tired of the rat race.
We dropped out.

969
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,271
We're trying to live more natural, you know,
like real birds.

970
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,650
- What's that?
- You know what humans are like.

971
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,820
New Year's, Fourth of July, Mother's Day.

972
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,363
- We've got to do something.
- What?

973
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:32,657
Help the humans? We're robots.
It's not our problem.

974
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,952
Yeah, forget about them.
What did they ever do for us?

975
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:46,171
He's right. According to the rules
of robotics, we gotta go help.

976
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:51,301
A squeezy bottle's gotta do
what a squeezy bottle's gotta do.

977
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:59,184
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

978
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,321
Where are you, robot boy?

979
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,785
Oh, no.

980
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,999
There you are.

981
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:35,595
What?

982
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:37,722
Ha! Cool!

983
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,736
That has to be Astro.

984
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,156
I don't care if he's a robot. I miss him.

985
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:55,949
I hear you.

986
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,038
When the going gets tough,
smart people take a hike.

987
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,333
Bye-bye, kids.
What do you want, an apology?

988
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,085
Nope. Just the car.

989
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,713
I would love to oblige you, but...

990
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:17,637
Come on, I love you guys!
Please, call off the freaking robot!

991
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,019
Gotcha!

992
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,438
Huh?

993
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,238
This city elected me!

994
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:38,074
I own it! It's mine!

995
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,711
Hey! I'm voting for the other guy!

996
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,795
Huh?

997
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,304
Thank you. Anytime you need me.

998
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,812
Huh?

999
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,818
What?

1000
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,657
I got machine guns in my butt?

1001
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,744
You gotta be kidding.

1002
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:23,995
Batter up!

1003
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,168
Home run!

1004
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,190
- Astro.
- Cora?

1005
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:56,528
Thanks, guys. Hey, who's driving?

1006
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,621
Trashcan, faster!

1007
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,291
Move over!

1008
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,318
Are we going up?

1009
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,736
No, the city's going down!

1010
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,779
Cora, I have to take care of this.

1011
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,072
Astro! No!

1012
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,074
Astro!

1013
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:50,749
Look!

1014
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,764
Right then, comrades. To arms!

1015
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,724
I've got three arms.

1016
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,142
Ow!

1017
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,366
Where is he?

1018
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,784
Will he be okay?

1019
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,285
I hope so.

1020
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,918
Hey! Ugly!

1021
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,087
Down here!

1022
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:40,048
We demand immediately
that you cease oppressing

1023
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,718
our comrade, Astro.
We may not be allowed to harm humans,

1024
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:48,431
but there's nothing to say we can't do
some serious damage to a monster.

1025
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,682
Aye, comrades?

1026
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,355
Oh! Look over there!

1027
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,902
Where are you, robot boy?
I know you're still alive.

1028
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,071
You can't hide from...

1029
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,785
Is that all you've got?

1030
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,169
Come here!

1031
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:25,260
Party's over, kid. Blue Core obtained.

1032
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:47,532
Toby!

1033
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,034
Dad!

1034
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,372
I don't understand.
Why didn't it absorb me?

1035
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,540
Because it can't.

1036
01:19:55,624 --> 01:20:00,211
If the Red and the Blue Core come together,
well, you both die.

1037
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,424
Come on, Son. We need to get far away.

1038
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:06,885
Where are you, Astro?

1039
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,223
Where's your robot friend? Where is he?

1040
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,020
I've got an election to win,
and I want that Core.

1041
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,151
Tell me where he's hiding! Tell me!

1042
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,111
Do you hear me? Where is he?

1043
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,654
We have to go.

1044
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:30,575
This is it. This is what I was created for.

1045
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,495
This is my destiny.

1046
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,038
Toby, now!

1047
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,040
I'm sorry, but this is who I am.

1048
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:42,170
- Onward and upward, Dad.
- No!

1049
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,341
You're back for more?

1050
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,267
Wait! Wait. No, no! Wait. Wait.

1051
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,648
Wait! No!

1052
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,034
- My son.
- Dad.

1053
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,252
Get out of me now!

1054
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:24,837
Get out!

1055
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,507
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1056
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,095
No! No!

1057
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,098
Oh, nuts.

1058
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,024
Son.

1059
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,591
Gotta seize this girl immediately.
She kicked me! She can't kick me!

1060
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,926
President Stone, sir, you're under arrest.

1061
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,263
No, you can't do this to me!
I've got an election to win.

1062
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:16,931
- Astro!
- Astro!

1063
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,017
- Astro!
- Astro!

1064
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,479
Astro!

1065
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,817
Oh, no.

1066
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:32,238
Oh, Astro.

1067
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,659
- Who was he?
- That robot saved the whole city.

1068
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,494
Why would he care?

1069
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,206
Because that robot had more humanity
than most of us.

1070
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,167
Who are you?

1071
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,628
I'm a friend of his from the Surface.

1072
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,671
You're from the Surface?

1073
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:54,844
Can you fix him?

1074
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:58,931
No, I'm afraid not.
His Blue Core was unique.

1075
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:01,559
Now it's died with him.

1076
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,688
It's not fair.
All he ever did was help people.

1077
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:07,231
Not just people.

1078
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:12,028
- Astro brought Zog back to life.
- How?

1079
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,072
The blue stuff.

1080
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:18,034
Do you have
any of that blue stuff left?

1081
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:22,246
Do you think you could spare some
for our friend here?

1082
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,115
Mommy, look!

1083
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:01,369
Dad? Cora? What happened?

1084
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,621
- Is the Peacekeeper gone?
- Yes.

1085
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,753
But... But how am I still...

1086
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,260
Thank you, Zog.

1087
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,761
It was no biggie.

1088
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:30,773
Astro, I think you've finally found
your place in the world.

1089
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,986
You're a hero,
a robot with the heart of a lion.

1090
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:36,904
And everyone finally knows it.

1091
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:46,706
I love happy endings.

1092
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,500
- Would you?
- Sure.

1093
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,586
Thanks.

1094
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,796
- Cora!
- Huh?

1095
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,631
- Cora!
- Cora!

1096
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,966
Mom? Dad?

1097
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,719
- Where have you been, sweetie?
- We searched high and low for you.

1098
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:00,845
Really?

1099
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,810
- Viva la Roboto-lution!
- Viva la Roboto-lution!

1100
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,605
It looks like all the interesting stuff's over.

1101
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,190
Typical, just typical.

1102
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,524
Thanks for your help, guys.

1103
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,817
Yeah, it was nothing.

1104
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,863
Well, when you think about it, Sparxy,
it really was nothing.

1105
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:21,282
Are you trying to upset me?

1106
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,994
Will you be wanting the car, sir?

1107
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:27,955
I don't want you to call me
"sir" anymore, Orrin.

1108
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,543
In fact, take the day off. Go on and enjoy
yourself with the robot ladies and so forth.

1109
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,671
Thank you, Dr. Tenma.

1110
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,381
Call me Bill.

1111
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,177
I am so freaked right now.

1112
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,352
Everybody, take cover!
We're under alien attack!

1113
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:54,565
Wait. Are you sure
you're ready for this, Astro?

1114
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,359
I was made ready.
