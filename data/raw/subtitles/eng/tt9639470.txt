00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,747
Can I help you?

180
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,083
Uh, sorry.

181
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,789
(cash register dings)

182
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,624
(entry bell chimes)

183
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,637
Hey, do you want a hand?

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,172
Fine.

185
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,207
You don't look fine.

186
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,142
Well, I am.

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,819
- Are you Eloise?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,787
Yeah, you-you look
like an Eloise.

189
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,623
Well, Ellie.

190
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,591
I'm Jocasta.

191
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,426
Did they spell your surname
wrong or something?

192
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,562
Oh, no, I've just decided
to drop it because I feel like

193
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:04,930
it's way more singular
to be known

194
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,398
by just your Christian name.

195
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,233
You know, like,
so famous in your work

196
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,835
that you can actually
just go by Kylie.

197
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,903
- Minogue?
- Jenner.

198
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,505
Oh.

199
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:16,642
Okay, bad example, but...
how many Jocastas do you know?

200
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,709
None.

201
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,378
Exactly, babes.

202
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,515
You don't mind I snagged
the bed by the window, do you?

203
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,517
- No.
- If we don't end up throttling each other,

204
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,686
we could maybe talk about
switching next term.

205
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah.

206
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,189
- So, where are you from?
- Uh, Redruth.

207
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,524
It's in Cornwall.

208
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:33,458
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:36,194
You know, Cornwall,
in the countryside.

210
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,295
No, no, I-I heard you, babes.

211
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:38,630
I'm just, I'm sorry.

212
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,733
Uh...

213
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,301
what about you?

214
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,936
Manchester originally,
but I, uh,

215
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,705
moved down here in my gap year.

216
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:49,408
Uh, I had an internship
at an atelier in Savile Row.

217
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,944
Oh, wow. I've just been in
Redruth making my own clothes.

218
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:55,414
I had a hunch you made that.
(chuckles)

219
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,549
Yeah, this is Bouchra Jarrar.

220
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,318
Before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

221
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,920
- Smoke?
- No.

222
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,555
Is it allowed in here?

223
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:06,391
Oh, I-I just took
the batteries out of the alarm.

224
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:09,828
I can go outside if you really
have a problem with it.

225
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,329
No.

226
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,831
- No, it's fine.
- I tried vaping.

227
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:16,601
I just think it makes you look
like so much more of a cunt.

228
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,737
Yeah, totally.

229
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,708
So, what does your dad do?

230
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,342
Uh, I don't know him.

231
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,311
Oh, tell me about it.

232
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,313
- And your mum?
- My mother's dead.

233
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:31,850
Well, I knew we'd find
some common ground eventually.

234
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,986
Yeah, I was only 15
when she died.

235
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,621
What about you?

236
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,956
Seven.

237
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, wow, that is young.

238
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,294
Although I guess
it's maybe easier at that age.

239
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:46,732
Not that it's a competition,
though, is it? (chuckles)

240
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:49,634
- (distant door opens)
- (chatter in hall)

241
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,237
Ooh, fresh blood!

242
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,640
(door opens)

243
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:00,746
Oh, my God, wow, is that
a bloody Bouchra Jarrar?

244
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,547
Oh, good eye.

245
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,783
Yeah, well, before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

246
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,017
- Yeah.
- Obviously. (chuckles)

247
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:07,018
Oh.

248
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:09,387
Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise.

249
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,722
OTHERS:
Hi.

250
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,492
Yeah, she literally made
the outfit she's wearing.

251
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,495
How amazing. All of us
turn up in our Sunday best,

252
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,497
and she's here
rocking her own design.

253
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,598
(laughter)

254
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm thinking we should call her
Brass Balls Ellie.

255
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,001
ASHLEY:
And what will we call you?

256
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,636
Oh, well, by tomorrow morning,

257
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,638
you'll know me only
as Hurricane Jocasta.

258
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:29,007
Ooh. So you guys know
each other from before?

259
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,542
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

260
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,078
- What is it, like 15 minutes?
- (chuckles)

261
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,945
Yeah, something like that.

262
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:36,048
JOCASTA:
We're in the Dead Mums Club.

263
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:38,050
- LARA: Oh.
- Fuck leukemia, am I right?

264
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,485
- That's awful.
- JOCASTA: Yeah.

265
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,920
It's pretty shit.
I'm not gonna lie.

266
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,923
But, I don't know, I feel like
it kind of fuels my work.

267
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:45,991
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,060
What happened to your mum?

269
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:51,797
Uh, she wasn't well... mentally.

270
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,535
She... she killed herself.

271
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,703
ASHLEY:
(gasps) Sorry.

272
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,006
We shouldn't have asked.

273
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,607
It was a long time ago.

274
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,544
- You're, like, so brave.
- So brave.

275
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,346
Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle
commit suicide... hung himself.

276
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,581
ASHLEY:
Oh, God.

277
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,583
So, yeah, I know exactly
what it's like.

278
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,485
ASHLEY:
Also so brave.

279
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,020
- LARA: So brave also.
- CAMI: Yeah.

00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:25,864

hungover on our first day?

That's future you talking.

00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:40,645
- You know what, fuck her.
- (laughter)

Uh, no one.

1058
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,323

Look, we're at the pub,

1059
00:54:57,356 --> 00:54:59,191
a whole bunch of us, having fun.

1060

Yeah, Hurricane Jocasta.

Everyone, really.
The whole class.

1063
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:06,498
- Something's wrong.
- No. (chuckles)

1064
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:10,035
Ellie, I can hear it
in your voice.

1065
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:12,870
Gran, I really am at the pub.

1066
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:14,573
I'm working here.

1067
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:17,509
Working there? Why?

1068
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:20,145
- I moved out the halls.
- Oh, no. What...

1069
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,081
I needed to get
a place of my own.

1070
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:23,881
Did-did something happen?

1071
00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:25,917
- Did you see her again?
- No.

1072
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,320
No, Mum's not here with me.

1073
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:30,322
Then what is it?

1074
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:32,191
What's wrong?

1075
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:33,392
Please tell me.

1076
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:35,026
Look, I should go back in.

1077

something to prove,

1078

but it's okay to ask for help.

1079
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:42,468
She didn't.

1080
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:45,104
Gran, I have to go.

1081
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,140
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

1082
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:51,110
Everything all right, Ellie?

1083
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:53,379
Or do I call you Eloise,

1084
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:56,048
like the old song?

1085
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:58,117
I don't know that song.

1086
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,651
And how do you know my name?

1087
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:01,919
I make it my business to know

1088
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,323

around here.

1089
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:06,625

1090
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,427

No.

1093

Handsy?

1099
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,388
Yeah.

1100

01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,162
BARTENDER:
Jesus.

1756
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:18,463
(Eloise sobbing)

1757
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:20,299
- What happened?
- DRIVER: He just stopped

1758
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,601
in-in the middle of the street.

1759
01:32:22,634 --> 01:32:25,137
Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard.

1760
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:27,439
Call an ambulance, pet.

1761
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:28,774
Now!

1762
01:32:28,807 --> 01:32:31,343
And tell 'em
he used to be police.

1763
01:32:31,376 --> 01:32:34,279
- That'll make them hurry.
- Right. Okay.

1764
01:32:34,313 --> 01:32:36,114
Lindsey?

1765
01:32:36,148 --> 01:32:38,383
- He's police?
- Yeah, he's ex-vice.

1766
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,652
He used to be a copper in Soho
for years and years,

1767
01:32:40,686 --> 01:32:44,723
working the red light district,
and now look at him.

1768
01:32:44,756 --> 01:32:48,727
Then his name's not Jack?

1769
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,861
Jack?

1770
01:32:49,895 --> 01:32:51,797
No, love.

1771
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:53,632
That's Lindsey.

1772
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:55,434
(whimpering, panting)

1773
01:32:55,467 --> 01:32:57,269
BARTENDER:
Yeah, he looks very bad.

1774
01:32:57,302 --> 01:32:58,737
I reckon you're a copper
or something.

1775
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:01,473
(echoing): <i>I reckon
you're a copper or something.</i>

1776
01:33:01,506 --> 01:33:02,708
Do you, now?

1777
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:05,410
(echoing):
<i>Do you, now?</i>

1778
01:33:05,444 --> 01:33:08,747
(echoing): <i>I'd get out
while you can, girl.</i>

1779
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,116
CAROL:
Ellie?

1780
01:33:12,618 --> 01:33:14,419
Ellie!

1781
01:33:18,924 --> 01:33:21,193
(siren blaring)

1782
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,761
ELOISE (sobbing):
<i>I've let you down.</i>

1783
01:33:22,794 --> 01:33:24,363
<i>I've let Mum down.</i>

1784
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:26,898
PEGGY (over phone):
You haven't let anyone down.

1785
01:33:26,932 --> 01:33:29,801
- You never could.
- Okay.

1786
01:33:29,835 --> 01:33:31,937
Ellie, I don't know
what's happened,

1787
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:35,374
but it's okay to come home.

1788
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:37,376
You haven't failed anyone.

1789
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:38,677
(sobbing)

1790
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:41,246
I'll-I'll come and get you
first thing tomorrow.

1791
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:44,249
No, Gran, I can't stay
another night.

1792
01:33:44,282 --> 01:33:46,785
Well, uh, I'll get someone
to drive me now.

1793
01:33:46,818 --> 01:33:48,720
- JOHN: Ellie?
- (siren wailing)

1794
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,589
- Ellie?
- PEGGY: Hello?

1795
01:33:51,556 --> 01:33:53,458
PEGGY:
Hello?

1796
01:33:53,492 --> 01:33:55,193
Look, I have someone
who can help.

1797
01:33:55,227 --> 01:33:56,395
- JOHN: El!
- I'll call you.

1798
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:57,663
PEGGY:
Ellie? Eloise?

1799
01:33:57,696 --> 01:33:59,665
- JOHN: Ellie!
- John!

1800
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:01,700
John!

1801
01:34:01,733 --> 01:34:03,435
Ellie.

1802
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:05,337
Thank God.

1803
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:07,839
I saw the flashing lights,
and I thought...

1804
01:34:07,873 --> 01:34:09,274
I'm scared here.

1805
01:34:09,307 --> 01:34:10,809
I'll take you back to yours.

1806
01:34:10,842 --> 01:34:13,378
No, I want to go home.
Home, home.

1807
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:15,447
I-I need to get out of London.

1808
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,416
Can you help me get
to the train station?

1809
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:19,551
Forget the train.
I'll drive you.

1810
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:21,319
You have a car?

1811
01:34:21,353 --> 01:34:23,288
How else am I supposed to get

1812
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:25,624
to North London
from South London?

1813
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:28,527
ELOISE:
<i>Right, I'm gonna go in there,</i>

1814
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,697
<i>get my things and never see
that fucking room ever again.</i>

1815
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,699
JOHN: <i>Do you want me
to come up and help?</i>

1816
01:34:33,732 --> 01:34:35,467
ELOISE: <i>No, better not.
Ms. Collins would probably</i>

1817
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,436
<i>kill you if she sees you again.</i>

1818
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:41,440
Maybe if I plead, she might
give me some of my deposit.

1819
01:34:41,473 --> 01:34:42,607
Fuck.

1820
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:51,450
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
maybe come check on me.

1821
01:34:52,551 --> 01:34:54,486
Okay.

1822
01:34:56,354 --> 01:34:58,557
(sirens wailing in distance)

1823
01:35:01,693 --> 01:35:05,497
(door opens, closes)

1824
01:35:09,968 --> 01:35:12,437
Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie.

1825
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:14,773
MS. COLLINS:
Just coming, deary.

1826
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:20,846
(gasps) You look like
you've had a fright.

1827
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:22,848
I need your help.

1828
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:24,883
Just you, is it?

1829
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:26,785
Yeah.

1830
01:35:26,818 --> 01:35:28,754
I'll put the kettle on. Come in.

1831
01:35:28,787 --> 01:35:31,523
("Alfie" by Cilla Black playing)

1832
01:35:31,556 --> 01:35:36,762
Your music upstairs got me
breaking out my old records.

1833
01:35:36,795 --> 01:35:40,632
Oh, I picked up
a letter of yours by mistake.

1834
01:35:40,665 --> 01:35:42,400
It's in that pile.

1835
01:35:55,447 --> 01:35:56,648
(Ms. Collins chuckles)

1836
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,085
Don't judge me
on the cigarettes.

1837
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:02,054
All that hoo-ha last night
got me going again.

1838
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:03,421
Sorry.

1839
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:05,390
Oh, it's not your fault.

1840
01:36:05,423 --> 01:36:07,793
I was always on the edge
of starting again.

1841
01:36:07,826 --> 01:36:09,828
So...

1842
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:13,632
How can I help you?

1843
01:36:13,665 --> 01:36:16,535
Ms. Collins,
I-I'm really sorry to do this.

1844
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:18,436
I-I didn't want
to be this person,

1845
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,072
but I'm leaving tonight.

1846
01:36:20,106 --> 01:36:21,940
Oh.

1847
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:23,675
Are you, now?

1848
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:26,812
I'm not having
a very good time here, and I...

1849
01:36:26,845 --> 01:36:29,481
I really need to go back home,
and I promise...

1850
01:36:29,514 --> 01:36:30,949
I promise I'll pay you
for the mirror,

1851
01:36:30,982 --> 01:36:33,652
- but I really need some of my deposit.
- Slow down.

1852
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:35,987
I don't want to beg,
but this has been a disaster.

1853
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:38,690
(chuckling):
Hush. Slow down.

1854
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:40,592
Drink your tea.

1855
01:36:46,698 --> 01:36:50,069
You went to the police,
didn't you?

1856
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:53,972
About the room upstairs, hmm?

1857
01:36:54,005 --> 01:36:55,607
Yeah.

1858
01:36:57,008 --> 01:37:00,378
A nice police lady came round

1859
01:37:00,412 --> 01:37:03,982
asking questions about you.

1860
01:37:04,015 --> 01:37:07,419
About your well-being.

1861
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:10,822
Welfare check, she called it.

1862
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:13,725
Had me worried.

1863
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:16,962
You'd been saying
a girl died up there.

1864
01:37:18,997 --> 01:37:20,432
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1865
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:23,135
It's funny 'cause...

1866
01:37:23,169 --> 01:37:26,605
there is some truth in it.

1867
01:37:26,638 --> 01:37:27,806
(chuckles)

1868
01:37:27,839 --> 01:37:31,743
I hadn't thought about it
until you brought it up, but...

1869
01:37:31,776 --> 01:37:35,847
a girl did die up there,
I suppose.

1870
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,749
The young me...

1871
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,654
...that came to this big city.

1872
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,591
Sandie.

1873
01:37:47,726 --> 01:37:50,896
MS. COLLINS: <i>I had hopes
and dreams like you.</i>

1874
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:53,199
I wanted to be a singer.

1875
01:37:53,232 --> 01:37:55,101
I wanted to perform.

1876
01:37:55,134 --> 01:37:56,902
To act.

1877
01:37:56,935 --> 01:38:01,539
<i>Being a whore is a bit like
being an actress, I suppose.</i>

1878
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:05,577
You have to pretend
you're someone else.

1879
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:08,647
Someone that's not you.

1880
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,749
I'd pretend
I was somewhere else.

1881
01:38:10,782 --> 01:38:12,450
LINDSEY (echoing):
<i>It's too late for you.</i>

1882
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:14,686
That this wasn't
happening to me.

1883
01:38:15,854 --> 01:38:18,790
MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
<i>Try and forget all those...</i>

1884
01:38:18,823 --> 01:38:21,526
<i>all those men.</i>

1885
01:38:21,559 --> 01:38:24,230
<i>Their faces.</i>

1886
01:38:24,263 --> 01:38:25,697
I'd blank them out.

1887
01:38:27,099 --> 01:38:28,600
I had to.

1888
01:38:30,001 --> 01:38:32,570
<i>Make like they were nothing.</i>

1889
01:38:33,772 --> 01:38:39,811
So, yes, you could say
Sandie died in that room.

1890
01:38:41,846 --> 01:38:45,151
She died in that room
a hundred times.

1891
01:38:45,184 --> 01:38:46,818
And then one night...

1892
01:38:49,121 --> 01:38:50,855
...the man who put me there...

1893
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,961
...the man who put me to work...

1894
01:38:58,697 --> 01:39:00,999
...the man who stole my dream...

1895
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,536
(echoing yell)

1896
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:06,238
...well...

1897
01:39:06,272 --> 01:39:08,573
(gasping)

1898
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,942
...I put a knife in him...

1899
01:39:14,879 --> 01:39:16,481
...a hundred times.

1900
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:22,221
And do you know what, Ellie?

1901
01:39:22,254 --> 01:39:24,923
Oh, I can call you Ellie,
can't I?

1902
01:39:24,956 --> 01:39:26,024
Yeah.

1903
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:27,892
It felt right, Ellie.

1904
01:39:30,996 --> 01:39:33,598
All those bastards

1905
01:39:33,631 --> 01:39:36,001
- <i>who came ringing my bell,</i>
- (doorbell ringing)

1906
01:39:36,035 --> 01:39:38,570
<i>creeping up my stairs,</i>

1907
01:39:38,603 --> 01:39:41,307
they sent me to hell, so...

1908
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,641
I sent them to theirs.

1909
01:39:48,147 --> 01:39:49,981
The papers call them

1910
01:39:50,015 --> 01:39:52,318
<i>missing persons.</i>

1911
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:55,754
As far as I'm concerned,
they were already lost.

1912
01:39:57,323 --> 01:40:01,559
So they don't know
where they are.

1913
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:05,097
I say they didn't know
who they were.

1914
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:06,631
(board sliding)

1915
01:40:06,664 --> 01:40:08,967
I was doing everyone a favor.

1916
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,637
MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
I wasn't gonna be used anymore.

1917
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,274
I wasn't gonna let
this city break me.

1918
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,809
I'm so sorry.

1919
01:40:17,842 --> 01:40:18,943
Why?

1920
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:21,280
It's not your fault.

1921
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:24,283
No, I mean I understand.

1922
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:26,718
I know what you've been through.

1923
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:27,919
Oh.

1924
01:40:27,952 --> 01:40:30,089
Do you, now?

1925
01:40:30,122 --> 01:40:33,658
Yeah, I didn't mean to get you
in trouble with the police.

1926
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:35,960
Oh, it's all right.

1927
