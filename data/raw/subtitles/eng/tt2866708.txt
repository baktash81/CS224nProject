1
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,288
<i>Is there a world beyond this one?</i>

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,454
<i>Do we go there when we die?</i>

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,412
<i>Does God exist?</i>

4
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,757
<i>If so,</i>

5
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,417
<i>why do bad things happen?</i>

6
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,504
<i>As children,</i>

7
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,181
<i>we ask these questions
to make sense of the world.</i>

8
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,306
<i>To understand what lies ahead.</i>

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,142
<i>But I often wonder,</i>

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,853
<i>if we knew the whole truth,</i>

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,606
<i>would we be less afraid...</i>

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,901
<i>or more?</i>

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,382
What the fuck?

14
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,443
Philip?

15
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,446
Philip!

16
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,329
You should blow on it. It's hot.

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,996
It's split pea.
You like split pea.

18
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,298
No. Ronnie likes split pea.

19
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,091
Sorry, Mr. Food Critic.

20
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,964
That's what I made,
so that's what you get.

21
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,989
I'll microwave something later.

22
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,740
Great.

23
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,438
Hi, Philip.

24
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,100
Melissa.

25
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,692
I didn't know that you were...

26
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,616
Wow.

27
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,901
- Guess it's been a long time.
- Yeah.

28
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,205
Is it okay if I come in?

29
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,123
No, yeah, of course. Come on in.

30
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,340
Sit.

31
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,048
- Let me clear...
- I got it. It's okay.

32
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,358
So I heard you've
been living in the city?

33
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,607
Yeah, I was, um...

34
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,858
I am. Just home for a bit.

35
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,013
You know, till the leg heals up.

36
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,155
Yeah, ouch. Are you skiing?

37
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,409
Biking...

38
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,994
...poorly.

39
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,876
Uh, but... Whatever.
You know, it's fine.

40
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,841
Are your parents home?

41
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,969
Ronnie's Melissa?

42
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,796
It's been five years.
What does she want?

43
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,971
She wants to see you.

44
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,638
- She's pregnant.
- Oh, great!

45
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,311
The last goddamn thing I wanna hear
is how goddamn happy she is.

46
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,979
Mom, here's a crazy idea.

47
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,898
Why don't you hear what she has to say,

48
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,317
before you freak out, okay?

49
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,368
- So, you're pregnant?
- Yeah.

50
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,238
About 39 weeks, give or take.

51
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,084
Um, I looked for you
at the library, but,

52
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,332
a woman at the front desk
said that you quit.

53
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,960
Oh, I'm sure she did.
Pilia right?

54
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,962
Bad die-job, tits like torpedoes?

55
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,595
I guess, um,

56
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,384
Mr. Chase isn't around, is he?

57
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,682
No, Mr. Chase is not around.

58
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,760
Mr. Chase has chosen
to become clichÃ©

59
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,873
and live in West Palm Beach
with his new trophy wife.

60
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,638
I know about Florida,
I just didn't...

61
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,043
If you know, then why
would you assume

62
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,433
that man would be in my house?

63
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,695
Are you looking for money?

64
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,740
- Jesus, Mom!
- It's okay.

65
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,991
I know it must seem,
you know, strange,

66
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,619
me showing up here
after all these years,

67
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,619
but I think about
your family every day.

68
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,421
Especially you, Mrs. Chase.

69
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,298
Losing a child
is the hardest thing

70
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,047
that could every
happen to somebody.

71
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,135
And, um...

72
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,972
I know that
everybody says that...

73
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,135
that it wasn't my fault...

74
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,937
what happened...

75
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,311
But, um...

76
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,354
Take your time.

77
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,864
Let me just...
Sorry, this isn't coming out

78
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,657
the way I wanted it
to come out, but...

79
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,534
Ronnie used to have
this old stereo in his room.

80
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,412
Do you know if it's still there?

81
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,920
Where is this?

82
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,339
I have this one in a 8x10.

83
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,088
You can see how blue
his eyes are in that.

84
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,223
<i>I can see in your eyes...</i>

85
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,231
<i>A loss, a longing.</i>

86
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,780
<i>There's a human energy here,</i>

87
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,279
<i>gone before his time.</i>

88
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,610
<i>Someone you love.</i>

89
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,695
<i>Someone who loves
you very much.</i>

90
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,826
<i>Ronnie?</i>

91
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,076
<i>The image...</i>

92
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,128
<i>There are pictures, photographs.</i>

93
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,294
<i>His brother,
Philip took a lot of pictures.</i>

94
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,341
<i>I actually think
he's a photographer now.</i>

95
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,420
<i>He wants his brother
to keep taking pictures.</i>

96
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,971
Are you serious?

97
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,969
Is this what you
came here to tell us,

98
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,766
that Ronnie
liked Philip's pictures?

99
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,515
Do you have any idea what I go
through every single day?

100
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,221
Every time I
walk past this door?

101
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,399
Will you just listen to it?
There's... There's more.

102
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,239
<i>But you're here about the baby.</i>

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,910
<i>First love is pure</i>

104
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,788
<i>because we give our entire
heart and soul to that person.</i>

105
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,085
<i>He knows your pain
since he passed over.</i>

106
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,460
<i>That's why he's found a way
to carry on in your life.</i>

107
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,635
<i>This baby, it's a part of you.</i>

108
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,714
<i>So, it's a part
of Ronnie as well.</i>

109
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,978
And?

110
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,739
That's it. What she said is...

111
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,906
It's true.

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,410
What's true?

113
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,909
I've only been with one person...

114
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,491
...in my entire life.

115
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,748
And that was Ronnie,

116
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,670
on the night that
he died five years ago.

117
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,011
So, when I got pregnant,
I was scared and confused,

118
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,305
and I didn't understand
how it was possible.

119
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,138
But now I do.

120
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,431
Some strange miracle has happened

121
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,936
because of Ronnie.

122
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,189
'Cause of our love.

123
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
This baby...

124
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,774
This baby inside of me belongs

125
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,533
to Ronnie.

126
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,616
It's his.

127
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,337
Get her out of my house.

128
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,473
Why are you doing this?

129
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,732
You guys just deserve to know.

130
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,483
Melissa,

131
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,187
it's not possible.

132
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,273
I'm not crazy, okay?

133
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,450
I'm not stupid...

134
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,114
It's just the only
answer that there is.

135
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,869
Is it?

136
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,498
Since the accident, I get these

137
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,795
- spells, these blackouts...
- Just stop.

138
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,965
- And I can feel Ronnie.
- Stop.

139
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,044
- It's how I knew to see the psychic.
- Stop!

140
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,851
You ever wanna talk, or...

141
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,939
Come see the baby,

142
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,863
I'm living in a small cottage
off Moxhull Road.

143
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,990
It's my cellphone number.

144
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,125
He likes your photos.

145
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,383
That's something.

146
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,447
<i>How's my tie?
It feels awful.</i>

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,826
<i>It's a tie.</i>

148
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,783
It's tied. Big night.

149
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,081
Don't be nervous.

150
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,585
- You wanna give me some tips?
- I don't know...

151
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,256
Don't mess it up.

152
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,595
- Wow.
- Wow.

153
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,388
Where's the glass slipper?

154
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,216
- Shut up.
- You look amazing.

155
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,913
- Okay, let's get a picture.
- No, we're gonna be late.

156
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,519
Can I just take some when we get there?

157
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,847
Oh, no, no.
One for your mom. Come on.

158
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,525
Next year at this time, you're gonna be
in the city with all your friends,

159
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,172
we need something
to remember you by here.

160
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,405
- One picture. One picture.
- All right, okay. Smile

161
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,885
Let Philip take it though,
so it's doesn't suck.

162
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,320
Hey!

163
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,323
The man has a point.
Big smiles. Big smiles.

164
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,534
- There it is.
- Okay.

165
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,082
Call me if you need anything. Oh.

166
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,293
You have fun tonight, all right.
That's your job.

167
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,498
You look great.

168
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,299
Hey, lovebirds!
Shall we get this on the road?

169
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,780
You're gonna be at
Kiera and Gordon's, right?

170
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,948
- Yeah. You're gonna be there?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,383
I'll see you there.

172
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,469
See you guys.

173
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,721
- Have fun.
- My baby.

174
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,732
Take care!

175
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,854
Bye.

176
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,114
You all right?

177
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,326
I'm still here, you know?

178
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,404
Yeah, yeah, well obviously...

179
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,366
All right, ready?
One, two, and...

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,789
Hi, honey.

181
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,791
Hi, Gail.

182
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,044
You look like you could
use some ice tea.

183
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,968
Perfect.

184
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,115
Thank you for letting
me borrow the car.

185
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,849
Oh, you kidding? Whatever Bill
and I can do to help you.

186
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,926
You don't have to go
through this alone.

187
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,767
I won't be alone soon enough.

188
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,019
Can I?

189
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,063
Of course.

190
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,648
That was a big one.

191
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,241
Oh!

192
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,116
- It doesn't hurt, huh?
- Sometimes, but...

193
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,332
I kind of like it.

194
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,245
Makes me feel
like we're talking.

195
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,171
Well, I do worry
about your driving,

196
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,839
having one of your blackouts.

197
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,010
It's been five months and the doctor says
it probably won't happen again.

198
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,463
- Well!
- Ah!

199
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,015
If it isn't my two favorite
people in the world.

200
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,889
Oh. Sorry. Two and a half.

201
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,887
Oh, Bill, you've been smoking.

202
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,438
No, if you're
smelling something,

203
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,107
it's because I was helping

204
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,810
- Rafael load up the truck.
- Yeah, right.

205
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,317
- That man is a chimney with legs.
- Mm.

206
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,194
Come on. You can frisk me if you want.

207
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,151
- I'm cooking.
- Go on, check out my pockets.

208
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,328
Give me a quick once over.
Melissa won't mind, right?

209
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,614
Might be kind of fun to watch.

210
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,872
Enough out of you two.

211
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,915
Okay, I believe you.
You're not smoking.

212
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,162
Go, sit down.

213
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,372
So, what's for dinner?

214
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,505
These new kids, they can't tell
a half inch from a quarter.

215
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,379
Every damn time they pull out
a ruler, the line gets longer

216
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,714
and the customers get angrier.

217
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,554
You're the last good worker I've got.

218
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,476
- Hmm.
- We're gonna miss you.

219
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,354
I'll just be gone
a couple of months, I mean,

220
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,479
once the baby comes,
I'll be back in no time.

221
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,944
That's actually something that

222
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,692
I wanted to talk
to you guys about.

223
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,316
Since my parents aren't, uh...

224
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,365
Since they've chosen
not to be involved,

225
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,907
I was wondering...
I was hoping that

226
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,207
maybe you two would
be the guardians <i>ad litem.</i>

227
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,335
It's just in case
something goes wrong,

228
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,791
and I can't make a decision,

229
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,673
then you guys would be
in charge of me, and...

230
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,967
- And the baby.
- Are you sure?

231
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,633
- Yeah.
- I mean, you don't wanna

232
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,595
try to contact the father?

233
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,399
- Gail.
- I mean, a child needs a family.

234
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,068
You guys are the closest thing
that I have to a family.

235
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,117
We'd be honored.

236
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,704
Yes.

237
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,416
It's just in case.

238
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,233
<i>You've got a little girl now.</i>

239
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,123
<i>I do. Her name's Acacia.</i>

240
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,675
<i>Acacia? Beautiful.</i>

241
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,593
<i>You didn't chose it, did you?</i>

242
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,094
<i>No. She's almost two years old,
and I have to tell you this,</i>

243
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,597
<i>she did this most amazing
thing yesterday.</i>

244
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,429
<i>Does this involve diapers
because we recently had...</i>

245
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,059
<i>No, no. It's very clean.</i>

246
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,642
<i>She has this doll, and she sucks
on his fingers, of course.</i>

247
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,730
<i>Okay, stop. You clearly promised
that it was going to be a clean story.</i>

248
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,158
<i>- You're not allowed to...
- So I'm putting her down for a nap,</i>

249
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,620
<i>she's sucking on his fingers,
and she starts to sing</i>

250
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,119
<i>"Itsy Bitsy Spider,"
so I'm singing it too...</i>

251
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,377
Why would you say that?

252
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,146
What happened to your hand?

253
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,232
I cut it.

254
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,687
So you duck taped it?
It's what I had.

255
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,484
You wanna talk about my hand?

256
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,437
After that, we'll talk
about your leg, okay?

257
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,792
Hmm.

258
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,746
Isn't this a healthy
start to the morning?

259
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,547
- Why do you have to be so sarcastic?
- Oh, you think I'm...

260
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,634
You know, forget it.

261
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,838
You're obviously still
upset about yesterday.

262
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,507
You're a selfish young man.

263
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,638
That's what I've raised,
a selfish young man.

264
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,560
This woman...

265
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,764
this girl get herself knocked up
and then comes stalking around,

266
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,440
pointing the finger at my dead son.

267
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,921
As far as I'm concerned,
I let her off easy.

268
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,028
- I should have called the cops.
- Fascinating.

269
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,944
You're on her side?

270
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,162
Philip?

271
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,409
Why are you on her side?

272
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,578
Philip, hey!

273
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,705
Why are you on her side?

274
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,081
I'm not on anybody's side.

275
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,288
There's no side to have.

276
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,998
Both you and Melissa
are equally delusional.

277
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,630
That is my point.
It is completely impossible.

278
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,303
Well, it's not completely impossible.

279
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,596
You are on her side.

280
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,389
Okay, I'm not saying that I believe her.

281
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,593
All I'm saying
is that if you think about it,

282
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,406
there's a chance that
what she said is true.

283
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,722
Then explain it to me. Please.

284
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,601
Look, if...

285
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,728
it's a big if,

286
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,905
Ronnie's sperm was somehow
frozen before he died,

287
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,200
there's a chance that Melissa
could've used it, and impregnated herself,

288
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,949
years later, and thus
we would have Ronnie's baby.

289
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,614
That's ridiculous.

290
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,200
He was a teenager with
his whole life ahead of him,

291
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,501
why would he do that?

292
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,128
Philip?

293
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,547
Someone's in here.

294
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,136
People do it all the time.

295
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,555
- What people?
- I don't know, Mom, people.

296
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,677
Friends of yours?

297
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,055
Philip?

298
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,665
You need to get a grip,
and give it up.

299
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,932
Oh, okay, yeah,
just, just walk away.

300
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,564
You're just gonna
block it out of your mind?

301
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,145
Just like that?

302
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,821
Well, I can't do that.

303
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,867
This is my son

304
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,491
she's talking about, Philip.
Your brother.

305
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,958
Where's the computer lab?

306
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,665
Used to be right there.
Now it's some sorta Starbucks?

307
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Charlene?

308
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,928
Pilia.

309
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,130
It's okay, Bailey, I've got it.

310
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,933
It's been a while.

311
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,681
How are you?

312
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,228
Every day's a blessing.

313
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,143
Where's the computer lab?

314
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,099
We scaled back
the lab years ago.

315
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,943
Why don't you just follow me.

316
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,896
We got a grant
to digitize all the pre-articles

317
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,777
and research papers
going back six years.

318
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,950
So, whatever you're
looking to research,

319
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,447
it'll be relatively easy to find.

320
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:33,202
I'm the highest credentialed librarian
this institution has, or will ever see.

321
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,874
I know how to use a search bar.

322
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,756
The system resets itself
every few years if the cards aren't used.

323
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,215
So, I'll update it.

324
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,718
You can use mine for now.

325
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,179
Now, there are some tricks
to these searches.

326
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,072
For example, what are you
looking to research?

327
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,357
I don't see how
that's any of your business.

328
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,982
Right. Okay, well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

329
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,483
Sitting behind my desk.

330
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,574
It's good to see you again, Charlene.

331
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,464
<i>After the ejaculate
has been donated,</i>

332
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,282
<i>and the sperm properly collected...</i>

333
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,506
<i>...cryoprotectants are added,
and the sperm is frozen...</i>

334
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,568
"Medically assisted reproduction...

335
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,405
"Recent advances allow for collection

336
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,910
"of sperm samples to occur for up to
24 hours after death of the father."

337
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,747
"After death."

338
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,372
So it's four-wheel drive,
all-standard features...

339
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,962
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

340
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,674
Let me guess,
you're looking for something safe.

341
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,764
Am I right?

342
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,514
Oh, shit! Philly C.
How you doin', man?

343
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,970
Chaz.

344
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,934
It's good to see you.

345
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,516
Yeah.
Sweats and tee, casual choice.

346
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,772
I like it. I like it.

347
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,149
What's up with the leg, man?

348
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,654
Uh, bike accident.
I was going up Broadway,

349
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,578
and some asshole in a
convertible ran a red doing 50.

350
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,621
- Oof.
- Yeah, like...

351
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,203
- Lucky it was just your leg.
- Yeah.

352
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,410
Yeah, I know.

353
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,915
So, what are you looking at?

354
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,626
- What?
- What kind of car?

355
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,709
I can hook you up. Junior Salesman
as of last month.

356
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,967
- Wow.
- 40k base, commissions on top,

357
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,265
and I can take any one of these bad boys
out for the night.

358
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,387
Impress the ladies.

359
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,060
So, you and Stacy aren't still together?

360
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,891
We still see each other, but
it's not, you know, exclusive.

361
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,356
- Right.
- Come on, I'll show you the good stuff.

362
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,566
Hey, what about Melissa?

363
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,814
You still talk to her?

364
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,324
Uh, it's been a bit.

365
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,448
She kind of freaked out
after what happened.

366
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,745
You know, blamed herself.

367
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,119
So, what is she doing now?

368
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,493
She dating anybody?

369
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,873
Don't think so.

370
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,751
To be honest, I don't really
think she moved on at all.

371
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,049
Her parents kicked
her out a few years back.

372
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,612
So she's not really
in the loop anymore.

373
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,377
Why'd her parents kick her out?

374
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,714
Some tight-ass
Christian bullshit.

375
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,971
Her pop got pissed off at all
that magic stuff she was into.

376
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,061
Magic?

377
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,144
What do you mean?

378
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,349
I don't know,
she as always going on about

379
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,561
talking to the dead,
contacting spirits, re-incarnation.

380
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,480
She wanted to talk
to Ronnie again, you know?

381
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,154
Oh, but Stacy saw her down at
the hardware store last month.

382
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,407
- Preggo.
- Preggo?

383
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,614
- Wow.
- So...

384
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,993
She must be dating somebody,

385
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,620
Right? At least
for a couple minutes.

386
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,037
You want her number?
I bet Stace still has it.

387
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,087
No. I was just wondering.

388
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,540
- You sure?
- Yeah.

389
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,546
You two always had a thing.

390
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,632
Hey, no, no, it's cool.

391
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,908
I just mean, Ronnie
would have liked

392
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,639
you looking out for her, that's all.

393
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,799
<i>South Miami Hospital
Fertility Clinic.</i>

394
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:56,984
Dr. Richard Chase.

395
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,940
- <i>Who's calling please?</i>
- His wife.

396
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,492
<i>- Is this urgent?</i>
- Yes, it's urgent.

397
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,162
Cathy at the front desk, she'll put
something in the books for next month.

398
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,662
But, looks really good. All right?

399
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,580
Dr. Chase, your wife's on the phone.
She says it's urgent.

400
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,502
Holly, what's wrong?

401
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,460
<i>Wrong wife.
But you sure answered quickly, didn't you?</i>

402
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:22,134
For Christs' sake, Charlene,
you can't do that.

403
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,305
I was with a patient.

404
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,759
- Can you freeze sperm?
- You're calling me for what?

405
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,937
- Can you freeze sperm?
<i>- Of course, you can freeze it.</i>

406
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,809
Post mortem?

407
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,561
<i>Yeah, it's been done. Yes.</i>

408
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,234
- By anyone you know?
- What are you driving at?

409
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,277
<i>We had a visit from Melissa Moody.</i>

410
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,364
<i>She's pregnant.</i>

411
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,565
But, wait, it gets better.

412
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,985
I'll call you back.

413
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,535
None of what you're saying
makes any sense. It's impossible.

414
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,227
<i>Yeah, welcome to the goddamn club.</i>

415
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,789
But then Philip got me thinking,
and so I did some research,

416
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,246
"Post-mortem cryogenic preservation."

417
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,456
You think Melissa froze Ronnie's sperm.

418
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,712
<i>Well, who was working the night
they brought Ronnie in?</i>

419
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,589
Oh, yes, that was you.
And then I thought,

420
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,262
that just the sort of freak stunt
my husband would pull.

421
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,759
That would be ex-husband.

422
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,843
<i>Ex-husband. Trust me,
I thank God for that every day,</i>

423
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,428
and now you're acting cagey,
so I know something's up.

424
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,764
<i>Okay, so let me make sure
I got this straight,</i>

425
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,601
you believe that I
extracted Ronnie's sperm,

426
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,654
after her was dead, and I froze it,
and I put it in Melissa nine months ago?

427
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,652
<i>The girl knew you lived in Florida.</i>

428
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,904
- Why is that?
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

429
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,986
So you haven't seen her,
or spoken to her?

430
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,267
What's this really about?
You want me to come up there?

431
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,560
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

432
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,166
White Knight riding up on his horse.

433
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,539
No. You stay down there
with Malibu Barbie.

434
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,166
Don't bring Holly into this.

435
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,424
Hello?

436
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,232
Look who's home early.

437
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,986
Hey.

438
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,571
Couldn't live without me, could ya?

439
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,158
- Bad day?
- No.

440
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,414
Feinstein baby delivered early.

441
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,582
It's a boy.

442
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,577
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

443
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,460
Charlene called.

444
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,209
Little off the deep end.

445
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,341
And she's usually pretty hostile,
but she seemed...

446
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,307
I don't know, scared.

447
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,349
Of what?

448
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,848
Communication is not her strong suite.

449
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,054
So, I don't know.

450
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,857
I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm sure you're right.

451
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,067
- Knock-knock. Room service.
- Oh!

452
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,454
What did you do to this?

453
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,161
It's sugar free. I was hoping
you wouldn't notice.

454
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,733
Well, you might as well slap me
on the face and call it a kiss.

455
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,756
Bill, you've got to see a doctor
about this cough.

456
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,922
Don't look at me like that, I'm fine.

457
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,180
All right, well, please
don't stay out too late.

458
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,012
- The floor won't fix itself.
- Yeah.

459
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,189
- Are you gonna drink that?
- Yeah, I'm drinking. Thank you.

460
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,771
Hurry up.

461
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,853
Five more boards, then I'm done.

462
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,133
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?

463
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,559
<i>Same old, same old.</i>

464
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,511
Yeah? How's the leg holding up?

465
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,848
It's still attached.

466
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,901
Well, good. Hopefully you're
getting outta the house,

467
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,229
finding a few good shots.

468
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,064
<i>Camera's still busted up, so...</i>

469
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,821
I'm pretty much stuck inside
staring at contact sheets.

470
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,652
<i>Oh, listen, if you
need a new camera,</i>

471
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,533
I'm happy to do it, okay?

472
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:15,955
It's no big deal.

473
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,782
It's okay. I got it covered.

474
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,418
I spoke to your mom.

475
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,622
She, um,
she told me about Melissa.

476
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,048
<i>I bet she did.</i>

477
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,925
Kind of threw mom for a loop.

478
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,800
How... How did she seem to you? Melissa?

479
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,472
<i>Seems pretty damn pregnant.</i>

480
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,891
No, no, no. I mean, you know...

481
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,473
does she seem stable?

482
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,772
Just bringing up
Ronnie like that, and

483
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,770
not saying who the father was.

484
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,649
<i>I don't know,
things seemed pretty strange.</i>

485
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,150
But I don't think it's our problem.

486
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,485
No. No, of course, not.

487
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,405
It's not. I just, um...

488
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,270
Look, I just wanted to check on you,
and see how guys are holding up.

489
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,536
<i>Yeah, well,
mom's gone off the reservation.</i>

490
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,337
I can barely take a piss

491
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,256
without getting it
all over myself, so...

492
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,051
Yeah,

493
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,256
things are not the best.

494
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,546
Listen,

495
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,303
Philip, if you need anything,
I just want you to ask.

496
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,180
Okay, I'm here for you.

497
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,227
Sure, dad. Got it.

498
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,106
Tell Holly I say hi.

499
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,776
I will. Take care of yourself.
I love you.

500
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,979
<i>Yeah, you too.</i>

501
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,414
<i>- Hello, Bill's Hardware.</i>
- Bill Herman, please.

502
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,854
Mom?

503
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,530
Is that you?

504
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,155
I brought dinner.
Come down.

505
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,905
Coming.

506
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,177
No one likes a nosey neighbor.

507
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,139
- I was just cleaning up.
- Uh-huh.

508
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,351
- She seems happy, right?
- Why not?

509
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Baby on the way.

510
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,147
Yeah, but she's all alone.

511
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,475
Why won't she tell us
who the father is.

512
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,278
She has her own life to lead.

513
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,653
- It doesn't matter you don't approve.
- That's not what I meant.

514
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,903
She's not our daughter.

515
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,032
We open ourselves up,
do what we can. Let her get on.

516
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,155
You'll see.

517
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,665
Everything will be okay.

518
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,369
Hmm.

519
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,883
I'm off to the library.

520
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,968
- Really?
- Really.

521
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,429
- What are your big plans?
- Solve world hunger.

522
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,809
Smart ass.

523
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,979
Gum's for the children.

524
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,550
You're welcome
to have a piece if you like.

525
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:47,195
Sorry, I'm looking for a woman
named Chantel.

526
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,780
Chantrel. You found her.

527
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,333
Philip.

528
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,877
Ah. Now you're doing my job for me.

529
00:36:54,963 --> 00:37:00,960
Uh, you had a client recently
named Melissa. She was pregnant.

530
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,887
I can't talk about others
who've come for my guidance,

531
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,201
but you're welcome to come
and have a session for yourself.

532
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,217
No, thank you.

533
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,844
What happened to your leg?

534
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,097
I don't wanna do your job for you.

535
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,524
I'm a psychic, not a surgeon.

536
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,063
But I can tell it embarrasses you.

537
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,532
And you lie about it.

538
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,824
You're like a regular visitor now.

539
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,160
Yeah, well,
I'm doing research on children.

540
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,120
I might be a grandmother soon.

541
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,214
Might?

542
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,298
Congratulations.

543
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,803
Well, I should get going.

544
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,556
I didn't steal your job, Charlene.

545
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,974
You didn't show up for six months.

546
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,352
The place was going downhill.
Someone had to take over.

547
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,648
I know.

548
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,365
So... what now?

549
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,150
You, um,

550
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,530
you tell my future?

551
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,362
The future hasn't happened yet.

552
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,414
I tell your present.
The parts you can't see.

553
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,787
I'd like a strand of your hair.

554
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,836
- A strand of my...
- Watch.

555
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,592
Ah, okay.

556
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
What is that for?

557
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,643
The things we see,
and feel, and do,

558
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,516
they stay inside us.

559
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,771
Joy and pain lives on
long after you experience it.

560
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,194
It's the same
for everyone, everything.

561
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,237
We carry it alike.

562
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,488
Man, bird, fly...

563
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,866
what lives in one,
can live in another.

564
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,663
That's what connects us.

565
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,208
That's what gives us strength.

566
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,383
You think about Ronnie often.

567
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,386
- He's here?
- No.

568
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,683
But Melissa had
a boyfriend Ronnie, right?

569
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,143
And Ronnie
had a brother, Philip?

570
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,902
Half this job
is just having a good memory.

571
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,994
Your pain is deep.

572
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,872
But it's different than hers.

573
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,461
This emptiness,
it's not gonna go away,

574
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,914
because you're not ready to be whole.

575
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:48,718
You've tied yourself
to the world around you, but

576
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,638
there's more answers than
those you can touch and see.

577
00:39:55,727 --> 00:40:00,142
You don't believe we live
in a world beyond this one.

578
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,647
What, like ghosts?

579
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,396
It's all right, you don't have
to believe in ghosts.

580
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,021
I do. That's my truth.

581
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:15,361
And Melissa believes,
and it's true for her.

582
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,289
But the question is,
what do you believe in?

583
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,796
That's why you run from
the things you find difficult.

584
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,671
The things you find painful,

585
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,344
you ignore, or ridicule.

586
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,849
- That's why you've given up on yourself.
- Okay.

587
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,019
And you've
given up on everyone else.

588
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,356
Find your truth,
whatever or whoever that is.

589
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,105
Only then will you walk out
of the shadows.

590
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,573
I'm not supposed
to be telling you this.

591
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,415
He says that
there's a chance you could get hurt.

592
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,712
Who says?

593
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,256
Ronnie?

594
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,675
There could be trouble for you...

595
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,212
For those you're close to.

596
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,318
That's it.

597
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,785
You know what you have to do.

598
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,034
I take Visa and Mastercard.

599
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,642
Oh, can I help you?

600
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,815
Hi, I'm looking for Melissa Moody.

601
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,065
Her cottage is in the back,
but she's at work right now.

602
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,112
- Oh, okay.
- You would be?

603
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,815
I'm Charlene Chase.

604
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,401
Ronnie was my son.

605
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,578
- Melissa's boyfriend.
- I'm so glad to meet you.

606
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,748
God, Melissa's...

607
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:30,330
really a wonderful girl, and she
speaks very lovingly of Ronnie.

608
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,586
- Thank you.
- Everything that you have done for her...

609
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,919
Above and beyond the call of duty...

610
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,298
- I'm sorry?
- The rent for the cottage.

611
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,429
Dr. Chase sends that check every month.

612
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,851
Right on time.

613
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,977
I'm... I'm sorry...

614
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,896
I get confused.
Mrs. Chase? I'm sorry, I...

615
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,277
Calm down, or I'm hanging up.

616
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,529
No, no, no. You don't get
to tell me what to do.

617
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,612
Look, I have done nothing
to you, not a thing,

618
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,059
- if you want Richard to call you back...
<i>- Listen, you little tramp,</i>

619
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,700
you put that lying sack of shit
on the phone right now.

620
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,626
Or so help me god,
I will come down to Florida

621
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,420
and shove a palm tree up that
perfectly bleached asshole of yours!

622
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,624
<i>He's gone to New York!
He's gone to see you!</i>

623
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,322
Ah!

624
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,544
Wha...

625
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,293
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

626
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,771
Thank you for stopping by.

627
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,536
- Who's that?
- It's Gail.

628
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,329
If it isn't my favorite person.

629
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:32,660
Yeah, so, I was just down in the
basement doing some laundry...

630
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,962
Rafael! You need
to restock the mops, okay?

631
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,215
Sorry, hon, go on.

632
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,088
<i>Yeah, and then
I was coming back up</i>

633
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,340
and a sock rolled on the floor.

634
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,390
And...

635
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:47,976
And?

636
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:53,060
Yeah, and I don't know,
I did something to my back.

637
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,566
When I went to pick it up,
I hurt it, so

638
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:00,817
I'd rather not make dinner tonight
if that's okay with you.

639
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,320
Whatever you want, hon.
I'll bring something home.

640
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,867
- Anything in particular?
- Oh. You decide.

641
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,580
Bill?

642
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,536
You're feeling okay, right?

643
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,083
Yeah, strong as an ox.

644
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,126
You would tell me
if anything was wrong.

645
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,704
Seriously wrong, right?

646
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,460
Of course.
What's gotten into you?

647
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,712
Oh, nothing. I'm just...

648
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,464
Forget it, I'm just tired.

649
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,887
<i>You go lie down, take it easy,</i>

650
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,090
and I'll be home
before you know it.

651
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,221
- Love you.
- Love you.

652
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,919
Miss me?

653
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,043
- What are you doing here?
- You took the words right out of my mouth.

654
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,718
- I'm here to see Philip.
- Oh, so you didn't bring

655
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,011
a big fat check with you?

656
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,885
The alimony's direct deposit.
I've never missed a payment.

657
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,809
Do you use the same account
to pay Melissa Moody's rent?

658
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,187
Why would you do that?

659
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,437
What else are you
keeping from me, Richard?

660
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,640
Charlene...

661
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,146
You just have this big
web of deceit going on,

662
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:21,236
and now I have proof.

663
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,903
- You son of a bitch!
- Okay, I'm not doing this right now.

664
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,902
No, I can't think
of a better place to do it.

665
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,073
Enough!

666
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,652
I'm here to see Philip. That's it.

667
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,328
Well, he's on my sofa, so you
might as well get in my car.

668
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,629
That false labor again?

669
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,174
Yeah.

670
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,502
What's it feel like?

671
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,757
Feels... tight.

672
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,340
Like everything's clamping up.

673
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,036
Doctor says
I'll know the difference

674
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,060
when it actually happens.

675
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,849
When the baby comes, what then?

676
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,680
Then I'll be a mom.

677
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,772
Best job there is.

678
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,732
Me and Gail tried to have kids.

679
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,615
Gail's body just wouldn't take.

680
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:17,120
We tried a bunch of times,
but she just kept losing them.

681
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,201
I didn't know that.

682
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,250
- I'm sorry.
- It made it hard on us,

683
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,831
as a husband and wife...

684
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,171
as a couple.

685
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,469
That's a beautiful thing,
having kids,

686
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,841
raising them up.

687
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,593
A man has
a lifetime of experience

688
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,799
that he wants to pass down,

689
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,850
something to leave behind.

690
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,893
You know, um,
Gail will never say it, but

691
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,350
she looks at you like

692
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:48,439
God brought us
the little girl we never had.

693
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,457
Okay. Here...

694
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,031
- Where are we?
- No, no, no. It's a surprise.

695
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,671
Okay. No peeking.

696
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,345
You sure you don't wanna
go back to prom, and

697
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,971
see the king
and queen announced?

698
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,019
Think I'll live without it.
You want to?

699
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,392
No.

700
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,190
Little further. Little further.
Okay, right here.

701
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,562
One second.

702
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:26,769
Eyes closed.

703
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,188
Okay, open your eyes.

704
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,617
I still can't see anything.
I know, just one more second.

705
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,850
Okay.

706
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,183
You like it?

707
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,937
- Did you do all this?
- Phil helped a little.

708
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,279
All right.

709
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
I'm ready.

710
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,335
It's perfect.

711
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,389
Gail?

712
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,610
Hon?

713
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,365
Gail?

714
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,711
Gail?

715
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,299
You might wanna slow down.

716
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:43,632
That's how you wanna start
this conversation? Try again.

717
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,602
Yes, I have been paying Melissa's rent.

718
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,896
Oh, look at that?
A bit of truth.

719
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,851
So what makes a grown man pay
the rent of a woman... a girl...

720
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,776
he hasn't seen in five years.

721
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,482
You have seen her.

722
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:03,114
Holy hell, Richard. You are
a regular bullshit factory!

723
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,241
I come up to the city a couple
of times a year, Charlene.

724
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,120
Barry and I still have
a stake in the medical plaza.

725
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,950
You come in
and you don't call me?

726
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,083
No! No, I don't tell you.

727
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,415
You've made this impossible.

728
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,465
You made it clear
you want nothing to do with me.

729
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,463
Philip's in the city,

730
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,513
and yes, I have seen Melissa.

731
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,936
- I knew it.
- Oh, calm down, Charlene.

732
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,981
I'm trying to help.
Maybe explain if I could.

733
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,148
Can't wait to hear it.

734
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,405
After Ronnie died, I wanted
to talk about him, Charlene.

735
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,391
I couldn't do that
with you, could I?

736
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,321
You were either curled up
playing dead, or lashing out,

737
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,122
and I sure as hell couldn't
lay my grief off onto Philip.

738
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,205
So, every day...

739
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,792
my bubble just
got a little bit smaller.

740
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,799
And I had no idea
how to make it stop.

741
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,340
One day I was out jogging,

742
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,841
down by the ravine,
not far from where Ronnie died,

743
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,436
I saw her...

744
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
Melissa.

745
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:16,984
And I...

746
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,649
I could have kept going,

747
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,634
let her deal on her own,
but I didn't wanna do that.

748
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,194
I wanted to talk
to her, I want to...

749
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,572
to be with her.

750
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,325
And somehow,

751
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,453
I knew she needed me
in the same way.

752
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,860
Shit.

753
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

754
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,191
- Come in.
- Thanks for meeting me.

755
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,877
Oh, no, of course.

756
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,802
I'm really glad you called. It's nice
getting off work early sometimes.

757
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,009
Sit down. Can I get you
some tea or something?

758
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,306
I just have herbal, but...

759
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,430
No. Thank you though.

760
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,272
Sorry about the...

761
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,526
No.

762
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,741
We're quite the pair, huh?

763
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,454
The blunder twins.

764
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,431
You know, I lied.

765
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,095
Um?

766
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,266
About my leg.

767
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,014
It wasn't a bike accident?

768
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,103
It was a bike.

769
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,188
Ronnie and I,

770
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,673
we were supposed
to move to New York.

771
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,279
I remember, yeah.

772
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,483
He talked about it a lot.

773
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,034
So, after...

774
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,247
what happened,
once I was finished with school,

775
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,584
I figured, you know, this is
what Ronnie and I said we'd do.

776
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:44,373
So, I got a place...
moved to New York.

777
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,879
My dad sent money to cover the rent.

778
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,385
But...

779
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,089
You know, we were supposed
to make it, you know?

780
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,517
On our own,
so in comes the day job.

781
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,561
- Bike messenger.
- In Manhattan?

782
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,139
In Manhattan.

783
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,358
I was actually
pretty good at it,

784
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,565
but at the end
of the day I was alone.

785
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:11,692
I met people,
but it wasn't the same.

786
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,282
It wasn't what we planned.

787
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,910
So, one day I got a package and
I'm cruising down Fifth Avenue,

788
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,461
and, uh,

789
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,256
in the corner of my eye,
I see this yellow

790
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,135
Honda Prelude

791
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,512
cruising alone,
20-30 miles an hour,

792
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,305
and all I have to do,

793
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,601
is turn the bike
a little to the left,

794
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,894
and I miss him by a mile.

795
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,942
But I don't turn.

796
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,231
- You weren't trying to...
- No.

797
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,485
No, I wasn't trying to kill myself.

798
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,242
I guess I just needed
a reason to leave.

799
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,334
You know, to give up,

800
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,584
without giving up.

801
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,465
I should have tried harder

802
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,601
with you.

803
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,891
- I know that now.
- You left us.

804
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,015
I did. I found a way to move on,
and you hadn't.

805
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,357
I knew I'd fall right back into it
unless I got the hell out.

806
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,481
And I know what it did,

807
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,115
to us, to Philip,

808
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,116
we crumbled.

809
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,994
I live with it every day.

810
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,666
What did you do to her, Richard?

811
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,916
- Charlene...
- What did you do, Richard?

812
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,567
Thank you

813
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,074
for trusting me.

814
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,949
The fact still remains I quit.

815
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,452
I took a way out, but...

816
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,460
God, here you are!

817
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,538
As big as a house...

818
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,295
on the edge
of this giant step, and... and

819
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,877
you still have the guts
to go toe-to-toe with my mother.

820
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,554
You're the whole goddamn town.

821
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,924
You didn't quit.

822
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,101
And I want you know
that you're not alone.

823
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,562
I might not believe
that this is Ronnie's baby,

824
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,977
but I believe that you believe it.

825
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,232
And I believe that Ronnie
would have believed it too.

826
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,613
So...

827
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,574
if that makes me an uncle...

828
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,032
so be it.

829
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:10,829
I...

830
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,127
It's not like...

831
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,215
it's not like I'm so sure, 24/7.

832
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,384
Some days it's hard enough just

833
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,264
waking up.

834
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:30,770
Some days I wake up, and

835
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,856
I don't remember
much of anything.

836
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,862
<i>I pass out,
and I dream about Ronnie.</i>

837
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,831
<i>And the night we made love.</i>

838
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,662
<i>But, when I come to the next morning,</i>

839
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,583
<i>everything just feels off,</i>

840
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,337
<i>just feels different.</i>

841
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,807
So I make mistakes,

842
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,722
I get confused,

843
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,724
Join the club.

844
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,022
And I know...

845
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,896
I know everybody talks about me.

846
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:21,283
The psycho pregnant girl with the
dead boyfriend.

847
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,783
But...

848
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,368
But it's okay.

849
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,543
Gail? Can you
come down here for a sec?

850
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,255
<i>What did you do to her?</i>

851
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,841
Nothing. At first, we just talked...

852
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,802
About Ronnie,

853
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,471
and that silly accent
he used to do.

854
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,424
His clothes, anything.

855
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,218
After a while,

856
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,601
we filled in the gaps where
our normal lives fell apart.

857
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,144
Melissa's parents found out.
They didn't approve.

858
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,103
I guess it got heated
and she moved out,

859
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,733
and I felt like I
owed it to Ronnie to

860
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,691
take care of her.

861
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,568
I got her a place, paid the rent,

862
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,197
gave her some
spare cash the first year.

863
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,325
And the next.

864
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,414
After a while,
it just became habit.

865
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:20,925
Like anything else.

866
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,510
So, you didn't sleep with her?

867
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,805
Christ! No, Charlene.

868
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,468
Of course, not.

869
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,346
Who would do that?

870
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,020
It's like I'm trying to find my way out
of one of those corn mazes

871
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,521
that they put up at Thanksgiving,

872
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,860
and I'm going down a different
path than everyone else.

873
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,576
But I know it's the right one.

874
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:54,542
Meanwhile, everyone else is going down
their own paths thinking about

875
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,960
how wrong everyone else is.

876
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:03,380
But, I figure if I go my way,

877
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,005
and you go yours,

878
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,808
<i>we're all gonna wind up
in the same place in the end.</i>

879
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,020
I... I wanna apologize.

880
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,860
For what?

881
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,532
For the cigarettes.

882
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,945
I see you found 'em.

883
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,032
That's an old stash, before our
conversation the other night.

884
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,993
That's all right, Bill.
I understand.

885
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,254
It's over now, I swear it.

886
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,916
Forgive me?

887
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,846
I went to the pharmacy

888
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,179
to find out what they were
because I thought you were sick.

889
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,149
You... you son of a bitch!

890
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,022
Now wait a minute,
let's not get unhinged.

891
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,650
How should I react? You tell me!

892
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,105
It's not like that.

893
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:09,529
God! 30 years!

894
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,157
Under the same roof.

895
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:17,041
The whole time, I was the idiot!

896
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,164
I don't know what it is
you think you know.

897
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,871
Rohypnol, Bill! Roofies!

898
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:27,593
Yeah. I know what they are,
I've seen the news.

899
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,798
Melissa doesn't
know who the father is

900
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,223
because she was passed out.

901
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,267
Now, let's just take a breather.

902
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,936
- Step back for a second...
- She trusted us!

903
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,532
How long?

904
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:54,997
How long?

905
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,377
I found the pills
in the evidence lock up

906
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,670
right before I left the force.

907
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,131
I don't know why.

908
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:08,883
I just took 'em.

909
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,677
I didn't even plan on using them.

910
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,434
It was just...

911
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,144
It was supposed to be

912
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,484
less complicated.

913
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,530
Oh.

914
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,731
You did...

915
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,363
- You did...
- I didn't want to, I...

916
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,742
I couldn't control it.
I tried, but I kept...

917
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,408
- Gail, Gail, please!
- You bastard!

918
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,334
- You monster!
- Gail!

919
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,333
- Gail! Stop!
- Get out of the way.

920
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,132
Gail?

921
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,806
Oh, God! No.

922
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,064
Gail?

923
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,521
Oh!

924
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,651
Ohh, oh.

925
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,487
No.

926
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,990
The car.

927
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,032
- What about it?
- It's gone.

928
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,120
Well, he probably went
to meet up with his friends.

929
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,331
He can barely walk,
much less drive.

930
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,741
Philip?

931
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,587
It's Dad!

932
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,925
- The keys are gone.
- He took the car.

933
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,797
It was great seeing you.

934
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,849
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Take care.

935
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,274
Ahh!

936
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,412
Philip!

937
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,708
Philip!

938
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,788
Philip!

939
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,544
Philip!

940
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,965
Hang on. I'm coming!

941
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,302
Philip!

942
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,102
Hang on, I'm coming.

943
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,849
- You okay?
- It's the baby.

944
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,526
What, did you fall?

945
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,274
- I think it's coming.
- Okay.

946
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,855
All right, can you stand up?

947
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,613
Whoa, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

948
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,445
- You okay?
- Just keep walking. It's okay, it's okay.

949
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,996
Put your arm
on my shoulder, okay?

950
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,995
Okay. Almost there.

951
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:28,872
Please tell me you have the key.

952
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,703
You can just move that fence.

953
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,129
Move the fence. Okay.

954
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,547
- Okay. Back door's unlocked.
- Back door.

955
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:43,723
Deep breaths.

956
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,041
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

957
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,271
Wait, wait, wait. I need Gail.

958
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:54,838
I need Gail and Bill to come, please.

959
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,148
- What?
- They're my guardians.

960
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,841
- Please will you go get them?
- No, we'll call them

961
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,343
- from the hospital.
- No, I really need them.

962
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,636
They're just down there
at the next cottage.

963
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,020
You just have to go down there.
They're right there. Please?

964
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,159
Okay, yeah.

965
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,081
No, yeah. Okay
You just wait there.

966
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,208
Thank you. Sorry.

967
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,424
Okay.

968
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,510
Couldn't just accept the ride.

969
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,937
Hello?

970
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,186
Anybody home?

971
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,033
Hello?

972
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,434
I'll call someone
and get some help.

973
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,256
- Mom? Mom.
<i>- Philip?</i>

974
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,966
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>
- Listen...

975
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,517
listen, I'm at Melissa's okay.

976
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,963
<i>- You shouldn't be driving, you know that.</i>
- Listen... fuck!

977
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,612
I don't know what
you think you saw.

978
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,068
It was an accident.

979
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,506
Ah, ah!

980
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,561
What the fuck!

981
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,706
Ah!

982
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,142
Philip!

983
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,440
Philip!

984
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,731
Philip!

985
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,328
- Hey, guys.
- Yo, yo!

986
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,502
- Hi.
- Dude! Dude, you missed the end.

987
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,796
The prom king got wasted
and fell of the stage.

988
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,589
It was hilarious.

989
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,338
Yeah, it's a shame to miss it.

990
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,886
Oh, yeah? Real shame, huh?

991
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,214
Here.

992
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:44,811
Driver, the lovers have arrived.
Onwards!

993
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,423
Philip!

994
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,721
Okay.

995
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,053
Okay.

996
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,821
It's not connecting.

997
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,702
- Reception's bad out here.
- He's in trouble.

998
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:48,750
I heard it in his voice.

999
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,316
Well, maybe it's the baby, she's due.

1000
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,371
Well, then why doesn't
he pick up his phone?

1001
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,465
He's driving.

1002
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,548
He doesn't wanna talk on the phone.

1003
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,966
He's a smart kid.

1004
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,513
Hey.

1005
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,096
We'll find him.

1006
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:12,732
- Do you remember when Ronnie was born?
- Of course.

1007
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,401
Oh, that labor was so painful.

1008
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,939
I was screaming my head off.

1009
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,737
But then when the doctor put his
little body right on my chest,

1010
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,571
I just started laughing.

1011
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,496
Do you remember?

1012
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,543
Yeah.

1013
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:34,500
He was so happy.

1014
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,132
I think about that a lot.

1015
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,056
Richard...

1016
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:50,939
the gate.

1017
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,725
- No!
- That's how you wanna start

1018
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:09,910
this conversation?

1019
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,688
Hello?

1020
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,566
Hello?

1021
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,487
- Forget it, nobody's here. Come on.
- No, no. Let's look around.

1022
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,487
Dr. Chase.

1023
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,489
Nice to see you again.

1024
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:52,534
Hey, Bill. Yeah, I moved
my trip up a couple of days.

1025
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,289
Um, sorry to bother you,
this is a little odd.

1026
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,292
We... We're looking for our son, Philip.

1027
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,544
He's 21, brown hair.
He's on crutches.

1028
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,752
We got a call from him. He was
gonna meet up with Melissa,

1029
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,553
but nobody's at the house. So...

1030
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,557
I've been here for a bit,
and I haven't seen anyone.

1031
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,557
You don't think the baby's come?
Do you?

1032
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,390
I think that's a real possibility, yes.

1033
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:19,317
That's probably where he is,
down at the hospital.

1034
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,689
You should check it out.

1035
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:24,318
Uh, Gail's gone down
to the store for some food.

1036
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,570
As soon as she's back,
we'll be on your tail.

1037
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,240
Okay. Okay, good.

1038
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,330
Sorry to bother you,
we'll see you at the hospital.

1039
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,624
- Ah.
- Oh. Your head. What happened?

1040
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,493
Uh...

1041
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,913
Number one rule in carpentry,

1042
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,587
don't daydream.

1043
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,516
- I should take a look at that.
- Oh, no, it's nothing. It's just a cut.

1044
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,473
Nothing I haven't done a thousand times.

1045
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,051
So, I'll see you down at the maternity.

1046
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:57,309
Okay.

1047
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,073
Something's not right.

1048
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,401
Charlene, you don't know that, all right.

1049
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,806
- We're gonna go to the hospital...
- Why the hell are you so calm?

1050
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,571
Because I'm not
jumping to conclusions.

1051
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,623
You didn't hear him, Richard.
He's in trouble.

1052
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:16,950
We will find him.

1053
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:19,582
You didn't hear him, Richard.
He's not safe!

1054
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,754
Shh.

1055
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,087
- Richard...
- Okay, Charlene.

1056
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:30,717
Richard.

1057
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,372
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
somebody get me a wheelchair.

1058
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,294
Wheelchair, now.

1059
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,760
Okay, okay. Hang in there.
I want you to breathe.

1060
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,508
Easy does it. There you go.

1061
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,431
Okay. How far apart
are your contractions?

1062
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,144
Like... I don't know, a minute.

1063
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,721
Okay, is there
someone we can call?

1064
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,023
- Gail Herman.
- Can you tell me your name, honey?

1065
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,703
Wait here.

1066
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:41,461
Please.

1067
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,059
Where are you?

1068
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:50,649
Where are you?

1069
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,373
Jesus.

1070
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:48,963
Richard.

1071
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,922
She's dead.

1072
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,750
- Snapped her neck.
- Oh, my God.

1073
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:57,546
Outside. Outside. Call 911.

1074
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,784
- I'm not getting a signal.
- Try it again.

1075
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,703
- We have to find Philip.
- He's not in the house.

1076
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,719
- What do we do, Richard?
- I'm trying 911.

1077
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,395
- What do we do?
- I don't know, it won't connect.

1078
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,602
I'm not leaving without him.

1079
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,718
Okay. That's it, that's it.
Big breath.

1080
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:40,467
And bare down.
Push, push, push, push.

1081
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,641
Come on, you can do this.
Push, push, push, push.

1082
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,093
You can do it.

1083
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,984
Oh.

1084
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,423
I'm so sorry.

1085
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,593
Help!

1086
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:29,020
- Richard.
- I heard it.

1087
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:44,118
Quiet. Please, be quiet.

1088
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,196
- That was Philip.
- Philip!

1089
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,414
Philip?

1090
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,129
Philip!

1091
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,889
The woods.

1092
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,543
- Charlene! No, no!
- He's in the woods.

1093
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:37,208
Oh, God.

1094
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,505
Philip!

1095
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,722
Philip?

1096
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,325
Bill?

1097
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,173
I never meant to hurt her.

1098
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,500
- No!
- No!

1099
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,029
I love you, Ronnie.

1100
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,575
I love you, too.

1101
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,447
You don't sound so sure.

1102
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,084
I love Melissa Moody.

1103
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,050
You know,

1104
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,055
saying it to three people just
really isn't that impressive.

1105
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,486
Whatcha doing?

1106
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:26,735
- I'm gonna tell the world.
- Yeah?

1107
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,653
Hey, world!

1108
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,704
I love Melissa Moody!

1109
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,243
Dude, you're insane.
You're insane.

1110
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,377
Get back in the car, please.

1111
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,130
Ignore him. One more time.

1112
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,204
So is your brother coming tonight?

1113
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,935
Yeah. Yeah, after prom.

1114
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,942
At least he said he'd show up.

1115
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:04,273
- Hold on, I gotta take this.
- Okay. No problem.

1116
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,400
Hey, Mom.

1117
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,135
What's his GCS?

1118
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:17,328
<i>All units south of
Triphammer respond to a 413 vehicle crash</i>

1119
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,638
<i>at Highland and Hampton.</i>

1120
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,391
Officer Herman responding.
Three minutes out.

1121
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,313
Goddamn prom night!

1122
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,983
Every year.

1123
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,155
And all of us at the library are

1124
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,858
thrilled that he's here with us again.

1125
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,445
So, without further ado,
Mr. John Kendall.

1126
01:29:52,762 --> 01:29:54,799
Will you get back
in the goddamn car!

1127
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:09,060
<i>As children, we ask big questions</i>

1128
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:10,736
<i>to try to make sense of the world.</i>

1129
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:15,487
<i>As adults, we offer
answers without proof.</i>

1130
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:21,948
<i>I now understand
there isn't any single answer.</i>

1131
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,041
<i>We must all walk our own path,</i>

1132
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,207
<i>and find our own truth.</i>

1133
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,044
<i>But I figure,</i>

1134
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,551
<i>if I go my way,</i>

1135
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,302
<i>and you go yours,</i>

1136
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,884
<i>we'll all wind up
in the same place in the end.</i>
