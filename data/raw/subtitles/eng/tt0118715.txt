to the ground

00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:42,654
NARRATOR: Way out West
there was this fella.

4
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:45,090
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,626
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:52,330
£east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him.

7
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:55,467
But he never had
much use for it himself.

8
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:59,605
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

9
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:01,741
Now Dude,

10
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:05,511
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

11
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:10,983
But then there was a lot about
the Dude that didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,719
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,988
Drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,657
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,826
maybe that's why
I found the place
so darned interesting.

16
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,862
I know when night has gone

17
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:25,831
That a new world's
born at dawn

18
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:29,935
NARRATOR:
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

19
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:33,072
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

20
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,876
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

21
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:39,645
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

22
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,981
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:47,086
and I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies,
as the fella says.

24
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,088
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:54,460
after seeing Los Angeles
and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

26
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:57,396
well, I guess
I've seen something

27
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:01,668
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places,

28
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,904
and in English, too.

29
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,907
So I can die with
a smile on my face

30
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,707
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,813
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

32
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,916
took place back
in the early '9·s,

33
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:20,854
just about the time
of our conflict with
Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:24,524
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,626
I won't say a hero.

36
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,762
'Cause what's a hero?

37
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:31,164
But sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:34,267
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

39
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:37,037
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:41,708
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

41
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,511
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:47,914
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,718
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,421
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

45
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:58,259
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,128
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

47
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:06,267
But sometimes there's a man...

48
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:09,067
Sometimes there's a man...

49
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:14,008
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

50
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,272
But...

51
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:18,679

enough.

wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

Am I wrong?
Yeah, but...

176
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,322
WALTER: Okay then.

177
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:30,814
(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:34,161
That rug really tied
the room together,
did it not?

179
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,162
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,564
Donny, please.

181
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,832
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

182
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,201
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

183
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:43,637
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:43,638 --> 00:09:48,008
This is the guy who
should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,712
His wife goes out and
owes money all over town,
and they pee on my rug?

186
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,848
They pee on
your fucking rug?

187
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,545
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

188
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,319
They peed on
your fucking rug.

189
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,691
This is the study.

190
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:06,394
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

191
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:10,364
"Jeffrey Lebowski."
...citations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

192
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:14,101
Very impressive.
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

193
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,804
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

194
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,839
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

195
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,278
which Mr. Lebowski received
two years ago in recognition
of his various civic...

196
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,050
Oh! That's the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

197
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:31,285
which is given...
Oh, not necessarily
given every year.

198
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:32,486
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,788
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,156
Is this him with Nancy?

201
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:38,492
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:39,794
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,530
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

204
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:45,333
Of course. Mr. Lebowski,
on the left...
So he's a...

205
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,002
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

206
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:50,165
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

207
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:54,109
This picture was taken
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation.

208
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,277
Yes, yes.

209
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,312
Not of California.
Good shot.

210
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,615
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

211
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,451
though, unfortunately,
there wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

212
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,486
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
Oh, wonderful woman.

213
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,855
We were very happy to...
These are...

214
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:09,625
Oh, those are
Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

215
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,993
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:13,395
No, they're not...

pretty cool?

They're not literally
his children.

219
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,268
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

220
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,371
inner city children
of promise, but without
the necessary means for...

221
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,473
Necessary means for
a higher education,

222
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,976
so Mr. Lebowski is
committed to sending
all of them to college.

223
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,378
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

224
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,280
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:35,741
Far out. Think he's got
room for one more?
One... Oh.

226
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:38,720
You never went to college.

227
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,856
Please, don't touch that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

228
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,225
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

229
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:46,461
occupying various
administration buildings,

230
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,330
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

232
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,832
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

I'm a Lebowski.

That's terrific.

237

But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

What can I do for you, sir?

239
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:14,057
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

240
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,159
It really tied
the room together.

241
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,928
You told Brandt
on the phone.
He told me.

242
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,454
Where do I fit in?

243
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:24,434
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

244
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:26,502
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

245
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:29,706
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

246
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,841
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

247
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:35,144
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to
piss on your rug.

248
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,413
Did I urinate on your rug?

249
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,749
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

250
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,818

I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,127
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

254

I just want to
understand this, sir.

255

Every time a rug
is micturated upon
in this fair city,

256

I have to compensate
the person?

Come on, man.
I'm not trying to
scam anybody here.

a handout like every other...

Mr. Lebowski?

261

something to you.

Well, I do work, sir.

No, I do mind.
The Dude minds.

This will not stand, you know.

276

This aggression
will not stand, man.

277
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,893
I mean,
your wife owes money...

278
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,929
My wife is not
the issue here!

279
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,399
I hope that someday
my wife will learn to
live on her allowance,

280
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,867
which is ample.

281
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,804
But if she does not,
that is her problem,
not mine,

282
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:07,505
just as the rug
is your problem.

283
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:11,543

lot in life is his
own responsibility,

regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

285
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,515
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

from me in Korea.

your problems, sir.
Only you can.

Well, fuck it.
Oh, fuck it.

291
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:34,732
Yes, that's your answer.
That's your answer
to everything.

00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:45,743

what your parents did!

00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:47,680
Get a job, sir!

always lose!

always lose.

Okay.

any rug in the house.

Well, enjoy.

304
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:07,333

again sometime, Dude.

00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,534

00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:06,330
So, how much
did he give you?

511
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:09,733
20 grand, man.
And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

512
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,134
Just for making
a hand-off?
Yeah.

They gave Dude a beeper.

514
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:17,407
So whenever
these guys call...
What if it's
during a game?

515
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,110
Oh, I told them
if it was during
league play...

516
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,311
What's during
league play?

517
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,847

stop and start
at your convenience,

piece of shit.

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,884

What's wrong with
Walter, Dude?

520
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:30,487
I figure
it's easy money, you know.
It's all pretty harmless.

521
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:32,320
She probably
kidnapped herself.

522
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:36,260
What do you mean, Dude?
Rug-peers did not do this.

523
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:41,199
Look at it. A young
trophy wife marries
this guy for his money.

giving her enough,
you know.

I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

542
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,177
so that this
fucking strumpet,

543

could waltz around...

with Vietnam, man.

there isn't any connection.

00:44:26,221 --> 00:44:28,121
Now, your face.

848
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,291
As for this kidnapping.

849
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:32,493
Huh?

850
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:35,996
Yes, I know all about it,
and I know that you acted
as courier.

851
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:39,333
Let me tell you something.
The whole thing stinks to
high heaven.

852
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:43,637
Yeah, right, but let me
explain something about
the rug.

853
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:45,868
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

854
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,244
Excuse me?
Sex, the physical act
of love. Coitus.

855
00:44:50,245 --> 00:44:53,547
Do you like it?
I was talking
about my rug.

856
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:56,150
You're not interested in sex?

857
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,519
You mean coitus?
I like it, too.

858
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,888
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

859
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,390
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

860
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,858
However, there are
some people,

861
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:07,895
it is called
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women,

862
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:11,131
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

863
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:14,234
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

864
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:18,205
These unfortunate souls
cannot love, in the true
sense of the word.

865
00:45:18,206 --> 00:45:21,776
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

866
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:24,079
Listen, Maude,

867
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,349
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

868
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,819
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

869
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,619
You have any Kahlua?
Take a look at this, sir.

870
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,991
DUDE: Oh, I know that guy.

871
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:42,792
He's a nihilist.

872
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,201
"Karl Hungus."

873
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,863
(lCE CUBES CLINKING)

874
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,349
Hi.
Hello.

875
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,386
Mein dispatcher says
there is something
wrong with dein Kabel.

876
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,587
Yeah. Come on in.

877
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:08,123
I'm not really sure
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

878
00:46:08,124 --> 00:46:10,792
That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

879
00:46:10,793 --> 00:46:12,160
The TV's in here.

880
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:15,358
You recognize her,
of course.
Helga, bring my tools.

881
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:20,102
That's my friend Sherry.

882
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:21,871
She just came over
to use the shower.

883
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:24,306
The story is ludicrous.

884
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:27,343
My name is Karl.
lch bin expert.

885
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:29,478
You must be here
to fix the cable.

886
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:32,415
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

887
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:33,949
He fixes the cable?

888
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,085
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

889
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:39,455
Little matter to me that
this woman chose to pursue
a career in pornography,

890
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:42,191
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

891
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:44,026
to use the parlance
of our times.

892
00:46:44,027 --> 00:46:48,063
However,
I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

893
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:49,799
the other being my father.

894
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,867
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

895
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:53,335
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

896
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:57,106
Little Lebowski Urban
Achievers, yes, and proud
we are of all of them.

897
00:46:57,107 --> 00:47:01,043
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million
from the foundation account,

898
00:47:01,044 --> 00:47:02,945
and he told me
about this abduction,

899
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,680
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

900
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:08,651
This compulsive fornicator
is taking my father for
the proverbial ride.

901
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:10,686
Yeah, but my...
I'm getting to your rug.

902
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,488
My father and l
don't get along.

903
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:14,223
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

904
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:15,958
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

905
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,863
However, I hardly
wish to make my father's
embezzlement a police matter.

906
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,799
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

907
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,035
from the people
you delivered it to.

908
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:28,004
Well, I could do that.

909
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,973
If you successfully do so,

910
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:35,312
I will compensate you
to the tune of 10% of
the recovered sum.

911
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:37,414
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

912
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:40,250
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

913
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:44,588
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

914
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:47,257
Well, with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs

915
00:47:47,258 --> 00:47:49,960
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

916
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:52,562
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

917
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:55,098
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

918
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:57,734
Here's the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you.

919
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:59,369
You will receive no bill.

920
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,037
He's a good man
and thorough.

921
00:48:01,038 --> 00:48:02,739
(STUTTERS)
That's thoughtful but...

922
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,233
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

923
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:10,007
Oh, well, all right.

924
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:12,782
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

925
00:48:12,783 --> 00:48:15,285
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

926
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:18,556
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

927
00:48:18,557 --> 00:48:22,526
"l got a rash
so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.

928
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,795
"But you know me,
I can't complain."

929
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:26,664
(LAUGHING)
Oh, fucking A, man.

930
00:48:26,665 --> 00:48:29,396
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

931
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:33,104
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

932
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:36,307
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

933
00:48:36,308 --> 00:48:38,309
Really down in the dumps.

934
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,777
Lost a little money...

935
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:43,281
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

936
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:44,615
Yeah, fuck it, man.

937
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:47,518
You can't be worried
about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

938
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,216
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

939
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,326
TONY: Hey, yo. Come here.

940
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:57,819
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?
Huh?

941
00:48:59,698 --> 00:49:01,999
TONY: Yeah.
He followed us here.

942
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,002
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

943
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:07,204
Get in the limo,
you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

944
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:10,073
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

945
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:14,278
Start talking,
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

946
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:16,214
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

947
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:18,741
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

948
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:23,088
Well, we... I don't...

949
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:25,457
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

950
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,159
They did not
receive the money!

951
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,528
Her life was
in your hands!

952
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:31,129
This is our concern, Dude.

953
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,265
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

954
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:35,267
Nothing is fucked?
No, man.

955
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:39,171
The goddamn plane
has crashed into
the mountain!

956
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:43,475
Man, come on.
Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

957
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:45,310
We dropped off the damn money.

958
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:46,608
We?

959
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:50,983
l, the royal we.

960
00:49:50,984 --> 00:49:52,417
You know. The editorial...

961
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:54,553
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

962
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:58,423
Look, man, I've got
certain information.
All right?

963
00:49:58,424 --> 00:50:00,993
Certain things have
come to light and...

964
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:03,695
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

965
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:09,234
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

966
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:11,503
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

967
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:17,443
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

968
00:50:17,444 --> 00:50:22,482
I mean, it's not just...
It might not be just such
a simple... You know?

969
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:26,085
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

970
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,521
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

971
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:30,556
I've got information, man.

972
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:32,392
New shit has come to light.

973
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,361
And, shit, man,

974
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,230
she kidnapped herself.

975
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:44,070
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

976
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:48,107
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of
our times, you know.

977
00:50:48,108 --> 00:50:53,274
She owes money
all over town, including
to known pornographers.

978
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:57,446
And that's cool.
That's cool.

979
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,221
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

980
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:05,886
And, you know,
of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

981
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:10,096
because she wants more, man.

982
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:12,532
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

983
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:18,038
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

984
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,097
Sir?

985
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:24,745
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred
to me.

986
00:51:24,746 --> 00:51:27,047
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

987
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:28,582
Well, okay, you know?

988
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:33,187
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit,
so, you know...

989
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:36,657
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

990
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:37,784
(CHUCKLES)

991
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:40,194
Speaking of which,

992
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:44,598
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

993
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,668
My concern is, and
I've gotta check it
with my accountant,

994
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:50,471
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

995
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:53,066
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

996
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:57,845
Oh, well, if you've
already got the check
made out, that's cool.

997
00:51:57,846 --> 00:51:59,837
BRANDT: We received this
this morning.

998
00:52:02,383 --> 00:52:05,853
Since you have
failed to achieve,

999
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:09,423
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1000
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:12,693
since you have
stolen my money,

1001
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:16,464
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

1002
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:20,502
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

1003
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,804
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:26,935
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,347
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

1006
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:35,717
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1007
00:52:35,718 --> 00:52:39,313
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1008
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:43,157
By God, sir,

1009
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:46,685
I will not abide another toe.

1010
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:52,800
I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above

1011
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:54,929
