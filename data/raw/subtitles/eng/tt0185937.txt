00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,692
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT

2
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,990
In October of 1994,
three student filmmakers. . .

3
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,493
. . .disappeared in the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland, . . .

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,454
. . .while shooting a documentary.

5
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,165
A year later
their footage was found.

6
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,006
-It's already recording. . .
-Okay.

7
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,091
This is my home. . .

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,136
-You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
-Okay.

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,929
Good morning.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,765
-Got it?
-Okay, I got it.

11
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,350
This is my home, . . .

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,936
. . .which I am leaving for the weekend. . .

13
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,814
. . .to investigate the Blair Witch.

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,068
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods", . . .

15
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,903
. . .'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

16
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,738
And this is an important book. . .

17
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,241
. . . because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

18
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,159
It looks pretty old. . .

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,620
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

20
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,414
It's Mr. Punctuality.

21
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,668
How are you this morning?

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:25,752
Tired.

23
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,420
So I got the CP up.

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,296
Good.

25
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,092
That's what we're shooting on.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,594
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

27
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,305
Come into the house. Come on.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,308
I can see you.

29
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,187
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

30
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,314
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

31
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,274
So where's Mikey?

32
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,235
-We have to go get him.
-Okay.

33
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,361
At 8:30.

34
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,404
Okay.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,365
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,366
That's cool.

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,159
I guess you're Mike!

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,830
Wait. Stop.

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,919
Don't we get to meet your Mama?

40
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,883
See you later, Mom !

41
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,594
How are you, Mike?

42
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,929
I'm tired but I'm fine.

43
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,598
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,476
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

45
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,854
We've got enough
battery power to. . .

46
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,481
. .fuel a small country for a month.

47
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,068
We've got rice, fruit punch. . .

48
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,446
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

49
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,656
The ultimate campfood.

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,410
Feel how soft.

51
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,833
-Marshmallows. . .
-Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart!

52
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,798
Do you believe in ghosts?

53
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,176
Ever heard of the Blair Witch?

54
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,849
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

55
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,354
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,024
-Can you tell me a little more?
-I don't wanna go cheesy.

57
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,194
I want to present
this straightforward.

58
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,571
The legend is unsettling.

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,365
Wanna get the. . .

60
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,618
. . .ceremonial first slate?

61
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,162
Absolutely.

62
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,501
The first slate for our
first shot.

63
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,797
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it?

64
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,632
A little blood-letting?

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,217
No, we'll save that for later.

66
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,219
Kiss the slate.

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,055
It's the first slate.

68
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,099
Marked by my lipstick.

69
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,893
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

70
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,104
-There we go.
-Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

71
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,189
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

72
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,026
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

73
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,488
A small quiet Maryland town.

74
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,574
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

75
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,329
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

76
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,000
Many remain, either on this hill. . .

77
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,335
. . .or in the town below.

78
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,132
An unusually high number of
children are buried here. . .

79
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,843
. . . most of whom passed
in the 1 940's.

80
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,806
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time, . . .

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,933
. . . not to us, anyway.

82
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,227
Yet legend tells
A different story, . . .

83
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,771
. . .whose evidence is all around us.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,107
Etched in stone.

85
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,492
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

86
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,536
The opening is shot.

87
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,498
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

88
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,462
-Have you heard of the Witch?
-That's an old, old story.

89
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,838
As I remember, . . .

90
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,133
. . . Mr. Parr was an old hermit, . . .

91
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,346
. . .and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there, . . .

92
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,889
. . . for a long, long, time.

93
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,266
-You heard of the Blair Witch?
-Several times.

94
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,727
What was the first incident?

95
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,564
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

96
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,942
I also saw a documentary on the
television. . .

97
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,446
. . .about her and legends
of Maryland, . . .

98
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,283
. . . my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

99
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,870
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house. . .

100
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,580
. . .the Blair witch will get you.

101
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,085
In the fall or winter of 1 940, . . .

102
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,380
. . .some young kids
started disappearing.

103
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,298
Nobody knew. . .

104
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,218
. . .why they were disappearing.

105
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,640
-A kind of an omen, isn't it?
-The creepiest story about her. . .

106
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,601
. . .was that two men out hunting. . .

107
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,397
. . .camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt. . .

108
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,314
No. No.

109
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,733
. . .and they just disappeared
forever.

110
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,487
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

111
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,530
It's not true.

112
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,033
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market. . .

113
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,494
. . .and said "l'm finally finished".

114
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,662
And what did he mean by that?

115
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,497
Nobody knew at first. . .

116
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,666
But the police finally. . .

117
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,418
went up the mountain. . .

118
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,381
. . .and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,176
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos. . .

120
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,637
. . .and he'd make one
face the corner. . .

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,432
. . .and he'd kill the other one. . .

122
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,019
. . .then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

123
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,979
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

124
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,149
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time. . .

125
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,569
. . .it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

126
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,654
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him. . .

127
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,742
. . .that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

128
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,785
All my life I've believed. . .

129
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,663
. . .in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

130
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,665
Do you believe there are some
in this area?

131
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,541
Oh, definitely.

132
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,710
-Do you believe in witchcraft?
-No.

133
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,880
-Are you religious?
-Yep.

134
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,006
Alrighty.

135
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,344
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

136
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,888
And do you think she could
still be up there now?

137
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,848
-I don't go up there.
-You don't?

138
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,391
I believe enough not to go.

139
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,936
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

140
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,897
What? How are they haunted?

141
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,193
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted. . .

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,737
. . . but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who. . .

143
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
Mary Brown?

144
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

145
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,326
How was she seen by the community?

146
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,160
Crazy.

147
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,414
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

148
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,249
I'm gonna bring her out.

149
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,585
You look for the best light, okay?

150
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,378
Okay.

151
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,758
This is Mary's gate.

152
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,512
I'm not even sure how to open it.

153
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,599
And something interesting
happened to you once. . .

154
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,893
You met the Blair witch?

155
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,520
Yes.

156
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,938
That is really. . .

157
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,649
. . . kind of a scary story.

158
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,984
To make ends meet. . .

159
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,778
. . . my Dad and I

160
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,239
. . . used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

161
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,450
In Burkittsville.

162
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,870
I was laying on the leaves. . .

163
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,582
. . .watching my pole, and
looking at the sky. . .

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,045
. . .and suddenly I felt
something near me. . .

165
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,339
. . . an eerie feeling. . .

166
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,050
. . . It was a woman. . .

167
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,928
. . .only on her
arms and hands. . .

168
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,972
. . .and everything. . .

169
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,724
. . .she had hair . . .

170
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,810
. . .dark, almost black hair. . .

171
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,979
. . .Iike a horse. . .

172
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,606
. . .Iike a fur, horse fur.

173
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,150
Then on her arm. . .

174
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,277
. . .she had a shawl. . .

175
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,113
And she scared you,
or threatened you?

176
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,367
She didn't say anything,
she just stared. . .

177
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,453
. . .and then she opened her shawl. . .

178
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,246
What was under there?

179
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,416
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

180
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,876
Hairy from head to toe?

181
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,462
Yeah. And her legs. . .

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,798
-How about her face?
-You could see she was a female.

183
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,885
She was just strange looking.

184
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,096
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

185
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,475
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

186
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,768
Get out.

187
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,770
And she says she's a historian. . .

188
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,771
I heard that.

189
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,231
. . .and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

190
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,610
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

191
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,571
You measured it in meters?
We're not in Europe.

192
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,199
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

193
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,826
It also has our system.

194
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,330
Nah, it has meters. Look.

195
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,292
But it's an American camera.

196
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,835
All those are meters.

197
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,837
What about the brown ones?

198
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,089
They're feet.

199
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,049
The brown ones are on there, right?

200
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,885
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

201
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,847
-Didn't you use this camera before?
-Yeah. Once before.

202
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,016
How was today, guys?

203
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,936
I learned a lot, man.

204
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,896
About Mary Brown?

205
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,732
No, I learned a lot about. . .

206
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,567
1 6 mill?

207
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,529
. . .about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

208
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,615
-We kicked some ass today.
-Cheers.

209
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,158
Very good day.

210
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,034
Excellent day.

211
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,494
Very good first day.

212
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,206
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

213
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,501
-I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
-We don't need that on film.

214
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,628
So I guess you're covered then.

215
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,424
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay?

216
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,800
Sure.

217
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,846
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot. . .

218
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,891
Okay, that's good, that's good.

219
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,227
That's good, thank you.

220
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,480
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

221
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,941
Today's been easy.

222
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,777
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

223
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,404
We're preparing.

224
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,824
Shut up, smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

225
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,661
-I'm freaking out.
-You can't, you're the director.

226
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,707
I fucking have to do this now,
okay? Do we have any weed?

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,168
Here I go.

228
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,670
Drink! Drink!

229
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,467
I hate fucking scotch.

230
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,433
There's my friend Josh.

231
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,143
How are you?

232
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,227
I'm hurtin'.

233
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,313
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

234
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,190
I know you don't like it.

235
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,611
Hello. Welcome to day two.

236
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,113
The trail is along here.

237
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,824
It should be pretty obvious.

238
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,203
You guys heard of
the Blair witch?

239
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,247
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

240
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,374
The myth?

241
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
That's all I think it is.

242
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,502
What'd you say, sir?

243
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,046
-I said damn fool kids never learn.
-Shut up.

244
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,798
Damn fool kids never learn?

245
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,715
That's what I said.

246
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,217
Why do you say that?

247
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,719
First of all, can I
have your permission. . .

248
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,681
. . .to use your image on a
video documentary?

249
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,058
I don't care about that, but. . .

250
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,060
You have to say yes or no, sir,

251
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,603
-Watch it.
-I'm sorry.

252
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,521
Yeah, sure, okay.

253
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,400
Some girl, in the late 1 800's. . .

254
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,194
. . . Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was, . . .

255
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,365
. . .supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

256
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,702
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off!

257
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,829
-Okay, wandered off.
-And got lost.

258
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,122
She got lost.

259
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,332
Wasn't no "supposedly".

260
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,584
Three days later. . .

261
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,046
. . .she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

262
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,883
And everybody's mystified.

263
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,803
-She was babbling something. . .
-Her story.

264
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,222
Babbling something about. . .

265
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,017
. . .an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

266
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,564
I saw. . just by that
tree up the creek. . .

267
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,066
. . . about a hundred yards,

268
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,529
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

269
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,907
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

270
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,534
Right out of the water.

271
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,660
Right out of the water?

272
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,246
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

273
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,914
You're full of it.

274
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

275
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,251
Sure you weren't.

276
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,420
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock?

277
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,173
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

278
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,007
How's that?

279
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,511
Anybody round here. . .

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,723
. . . knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

281
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,350
That's bullshit.

282
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,104
These woods are thick.

283
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,981
You excited?

284
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,941
You got it.

285
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,612
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

286
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,136
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

287
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,096
Okay.

288
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,140
Packs on, we're ready to go.

289
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,184
We gotta go up to the shack?

290
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,143
Yeah.

291
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,403
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

292
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,908
Off to Coffin Rock.

293
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,035
I know exactly where we are now.

294
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,246
Mikey, give me the video camera.

295
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,665
I wanna get her going across, man.

296
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,462
I see a dirty behind.

297
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,634
Good jump.

298
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,468
Thank you.

299
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,345
There it is. See?

300
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,765
That's Coffin Rock.

301
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,814
"They went into the woods
ready to find death. . .

302
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,025
. . . but what they found
was inhumane. . .

303
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,111
. . .at the site called Coffin Rock.

304
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,905
. . . up on the rock, the torture. . .

305
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,451
. . .suffered by these five
brave men was obvious. . .

306
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,621
. . .they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet. . .

307
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,790
. . .forming a solid
human structure. . .

308
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,918
. . . blood indicated that
it had happened. . .

309
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,838
. . .while they were
alive and resisting. . .

310
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,508
. . .their intestines had been
crudely torn out. . .

311
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,763
. . .and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing. . .

312
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,057
. . .cut into their flesh
with precision. . .

313
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,018
. . .the men, shocked by
what had happened. . .

314
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,020
. . .went to find the sheriff. . .

315
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,565
. . .without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies . . .

316
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,776
. . .they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

317
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,905
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown. . .

318
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,075
. . .the stench of death
was still thick. . .

319
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,703
. . . but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours. . ."

320
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,375
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

321
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,880
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

322
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,008
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

323
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,888
But I can use the shot
without me in it. . .

324
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:16,267
. . . because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing, . . .

325
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,020
. . . so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

326
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,776
It's starting to rain.

327
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,486
Did you rent this thing?

328
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,407
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

329
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:31,991
Just wondering. . .

330
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,285
I don't usually travel with two men.

331
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:38,289
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

332
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,750
Show us what the stick is for.

333
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,797
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

334
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,134
If it smells of farts
too much in the night. . .

335
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,803
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent, . . .

336
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,222
. . . but he can fart as
much as he wants?

337
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,101
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

338
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,520
You heard noises last night?

339
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,189
-I did.
-Problem is, I sleep like a log.

340
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,817
There were two separate noises. . .

341
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,945
. . .coming from two
areas over here. . .

342
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,656
. . .one of them could
have been an owl. . .

343
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,075
. . . but the other was a cackling.

344
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,494
No way.

345
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,288
It was a cackling, man.

346
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,915
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

347
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,335
Where did we start yesterday?

348
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,128
Off the map.

349
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,716
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today. .

350
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,259
Wait, . . . say that again.

351
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,678
I said I knew where
we were going.

352
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,890
Wait, . . .was that a
full of shit statement?

353
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:37,724
No, it wasn't.

354
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,893
-So that wasn't bullshit?
-I knew where we were going.

355
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,270
You got us lost, man.

356
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,314
For a very short period of time.

357
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,483
Just don't get us lost today.

358
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,317
Yeah, seriously.

359
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,319
No. These places are
very well documented.

360
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,571
You happy with the documentary?

361
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,739
Yes, I am.

362
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,618
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

363
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,911
"Our Little Mikey?"

364
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,496
Our Little Mikey. . .

365
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,459
. . .a very spirited young man.

366
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,671
What do you think about the
witch? You think she exists?

367
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,673
I don't know.

368
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,636
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

369
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,806
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

370
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,060
We like shortcuts, don't we?

371
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,523
We like level shortcuts.

372
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,234
Not mountain shortcuts.

373
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,028
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

374
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,489
It's really hard to film on video.

375
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,534
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

376
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,618
Like symbols.

377
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,329
It's like blank. . . hairy. .

378
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,415
. . . blank. . . hairy.

379
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,541
You should see my ass.

380
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,584
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

381
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,921
-And there's Paraguay.
-Yeah.

382
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,589
I think I see Bolivia.

383
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,552
What killed this
mouse? Witchcraft?

384
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,264
How 'bout God?

385
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,100
Is that the Blair Witch?

386
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,896
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

387
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,109
You know, I
really have to go.

388
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,820
Ohhh. . . go!

389
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:18,450
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be . . .

390
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,535
-What?
-Says who?

391
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:21,745
Says me, of course.

392
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,499
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

393
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,086
You guys cool with that?

394
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,588
What?

395
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:32,839
Ninety minutes?

396
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,675
-If you know where we're going.
-Sure.

397
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,844
Josh wants to look at the map now.

398
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,929
Though I know
where we're going.

399
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,432
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be . . .

400
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,725
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

401
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,478
-How could you possibly know?
-Because some is offtrail.

402
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,314
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there?

403
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,983
If we're lost, admit that, because. . .

404
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,401
. . . I know we're not lost.

405
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,904
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

406
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:59,074
Bullshit! We have
not been lost today.

407
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,242
Not once.

408
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,452
Okay, this is where we were.

409
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,205
You said that it was
two miles away.

410
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,332
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away. . .

411
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,085
-Okay, just chill!
-Maybe it's four hours away.

412
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,088
-You agreed to do this project.
-I agreed to a scouted-out project.

413
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,091
-Not to wander round the woods.
-I told you that . . .

414
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,677
. . .getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

415
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,720
Mike, Mike. . .Okay, guys!

416
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,098
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

417
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,557
We're looking at the map. . .

418
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,310
. . .we'll find this the best we can.

419
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,314
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

420
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,776
Okay, what do you say? Where
do you think we're going?

421
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,736
To tell you the truth. . .

422
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,827
. . .this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

423
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:44,828
Exactly.

424
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,621
So I'm putting my trust in you. . .

425
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,749
. . .that you know where it is.

426
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,501
Good.

427
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,296
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you. . .

428
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,424
. . .and l. . .

429
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,134
What?

430
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,303
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

431
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,555
Well, we're making a documentary.

432
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,891
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch !

433
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,644
I have a camera.

434
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,190
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

435
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,693
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

436
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,155
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

437
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,740
Are you gonna have to crawl?

438
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm gonna crawl.

439
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,241
Cool.

440
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,995
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

441
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,958
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

442
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,001
Okay, shut the fuck up.

443
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,419
Okay, I'm quiet.

444
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,754
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

445
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,089
Okay. . . Mikey?

446
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:38,882
Yeah.

447
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:42,844
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

448
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:43,970
No way, man.

449
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,430
There's no chance.

450
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,682
How do we get it
across?

451
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:48,767
It's really fucking hard.

452
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,185
How we gonna get
it across?

453
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,688
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

454
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,316
Well, how do we get
the DAT across?

455
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,904
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down. . .

456
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,822
I'll just go back and forth, man.

457
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,075
Can you do it that way?

458
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,743
It's the only thing I can do.

459
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,370
Okay, we'll do it like that.

460
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,662
Oh, Christ!

461
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,748
Oh, what'd you drop?

462
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,752
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

463
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,045
Oh, fuck.

464
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,297
We're very, very close now.

465
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,468
You guys excited?

466
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,639
Okay.

467
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,683
What's this?

468
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,943
What's this? Dude, guys.

469
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,197
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day?

470
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,660
What story from the
Bible was she telling us?

471
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,162
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

472
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,582
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

473
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,919
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

474
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,296
Well, what about
the rocks?

475
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,550
Anybody remember?

476
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,221
To live your life.

477
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,850
Looks like an lndian
burial ground, man.

478
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,060
I don't know if this counts,
three. . .

479
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,063
. . .four. . .

480
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,525
. . .five. . .

481
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,610
. . .six. . .

482
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,988
. . .seven.

483
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,948
Years ago witches
were roasted. . .

484
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,200
. . .just like my Vienna sausage.

485
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,704
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

486
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,332
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

487
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,835
...that started on
this desert isle...

488
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,920
...aboard this tiny ship...

489
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,214
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain. . .

490
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,759
. . . not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

491
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,594
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

492
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,180
They had no beer on
the island, man.

493
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,350
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

494
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,937
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

495
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,981
-No offense.
-That's all right.

496
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,608
It was a compliment. . .

497
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,694
. . .Gilligan was a funny guy. . .

498
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,113
. . .the Captain was fat, though.

499
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,574
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

500
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,326
It's not Captain. . .

501
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,995
It's the Skipper.

502
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,873
No more Captain.

503
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,503
Here we are back at
the rock again. . .

504
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,380
. . .the cemetery deal.

505
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,300
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

506
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,560
It certainly is odd.

507
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,986
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

508
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,780
I didn't just knock that over.

509
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:53,034
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

510
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,086
You can't be too careful.

511
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,879
What'd you think?

512
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:09,175
It was the same, only darker.

513
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,428
Yeah, pretty much.

514
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,223
All right. Bag it up.

515
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,017
Hello?

516
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,186
Shit, no light.

517
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,528
We were sleeping.

518
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,654
Do you want this?

519
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,657
Put it by the tent door.

520
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,797
Listen.

521
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,425
Hello?

522
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,136
Hello!

523
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,397
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

524
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,941
Michael, aren't you
coming down?

525
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,443
I ain't going down there.

526
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,903
Why not?

527
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,821
-Because I don't hear shit.
-You're fucking scared.

528
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,156
Because I don't
hear anything!

529
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,575
You cannot deny hearing it.

530
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,495
Get your ass out! Come on !

531
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,916
This rain fucking blows, man.

532
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,126
I know. It's raining heavily.

533
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:29,255
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

534
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,091
God bless her.

535
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,301
What do you think it
was last night?

536
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,179
Personally?

537
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:36,888
Yeah.

538
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,265
Someone fucking
with your head.

539
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,267
But nobody knows
we're here.

540
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,937
Yeah, but. . .you ever see
"Deliverance"?

541
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,941
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to. . .

542
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,318
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

543
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,530
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down. . .

544
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,323
. . .and all I can think is
"l want it all. . .

545
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,243
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

546
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,162
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen."

547
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,708
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around. . .

548
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,876
. . . maybe they were locals
or whatever.

549
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,004
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

550
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,258
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us. . .

551
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,468
. . .then there's something
wrong with them. . .

552
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,095
. . .and I'm not gonna
get into that.

553
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,430
And if it wasn't people?

554
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,515
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either!

555
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,101
Fuck, man. .

556
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,896
. .it's been a very long day. . .

557
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,899
. . .a very wet, very long day.

558
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:36,322
Nobody's speaking to me
right now .

559
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,534
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

560
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,578
What?

561
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,497
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

562
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:48,501
We have to go a different
route to get back. . .

563
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,795
. . . because we went
around in a curve.

564
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,467
Two more hours max, guys.

565
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:01,473
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way?

566
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,310
Because we have to go round. . .

567
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,396
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

568
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,565
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

569
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,691
Seriously?

570
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,318
Yes. Seriously.

571
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,363
-You know exactly what's going on?
-Yes. Let's just keep going.

572
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:17,655
All right.

573
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,825
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

574
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,369
All right.

575
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,956
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

576
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,292
That's not what I said.

577
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,420
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

578
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,134
Well the compass says. . .

579
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,595
. . .we go straight ahead,
that way.

580
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,431
We're in the middle of nowhere.

581
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,351
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

582
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,228
Just like the car.

583
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:51,064
Look at this shit, man !
This is nothing.

584
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,484
Let's just keep
going, all right?

585
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,947
I think we should camp.

586
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,198
Get the fuck out of here!

587
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,450
Why? 'Cause you don't know
where we are?

588
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,661
No, because we're still
A little way from the car. . .

589
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,204
. . .and it's gonna be dark soon.

590
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:10,959
-Look, I'm not sure. . .
-We don't camp. Stop the camera. . .

591
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,210
. . .and get us home.

592
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:15,797
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

593
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,465
Turn it off and get us home.

594
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,802
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

595
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,012
Give me the map.

596
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,140
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

597
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,558
God damn !

598
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,353
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

599
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,022
Fucking bullshit!

600
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,273
Mike, chill.

601
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:35,025
Just relax, Mike.

602
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,318
Don't fucking tell
me to relax!

603
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,947
Let's just sit down,
and check the map. . .

604
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,158
Yes. Let's do that, please.

605
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:45,869
Are you happy?

606
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,412
I'm not happy, no.

607
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,207
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

608
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,169
Are you absolutely sure?

609
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:58,214
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

610
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,591
We have to. . .

611
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,136
We will get the
DAT back on time.

612
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,763
And the camera.

613
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,389
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

614
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,933
I start work tomorrow at nine.

615
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,143
I know.

616
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,354
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

617
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,647
Let's just fucking camp, okay?

618
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,233
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

619
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,992
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

620
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,252
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold. . .

621
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,133
Hello?

622
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,973
Shit, it's fucking freezing. . .

623
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,184
. . .there.

624
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:53,311
What?

625
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,604
I hear it.

626
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,648
I don't hear shit.

627
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,109
You hear that?

628
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,282
Shit. . .

629
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:17,752
Hello?

630
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,784
I think it's just a deer.

631
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,371
-Could be deer, I guess.
-It's just a deer.

632
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,165
I don't think so, man.

633
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,460
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

634
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,919
It's gotta be just a deer.

635
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,504
It was a deer, man.

636
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,090
It wasn't like last night.

637
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,264
You say something?

638
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:15,018
Yes! Fucking listen ! Let's
get it on DAT. . . be quiet. . .

639
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,644
Okay, it's on.

640
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,151
Jesus Christ! What the
fuck was that?

641
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,243
It's not scared by our yelling.

642
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,000
Sounds like footsteps.

643
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,252
I know! It's a fucking person !

644
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,091
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right?

645
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,133
But I'm staying out.

646
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,677
You stay out here with me.

647
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:49,928
I am. I am.

648
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:54,182
What time is it? Anywhere
near morning?

649
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:55,809
Let me see. . .

650
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,561
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

651
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:00,814
Three.

652
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,815
Fuck!

653
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:06,486
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

654
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,907
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

655
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,159
This has got nothing to do. . .

656
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,037
. . .with what we're here for.

657
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,123
This is just it's bullshit.

658
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,043
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago. . .

659
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,380
. . .and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

660
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,011
There are three, actually.

661
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,640
Are you positive those
weren't there last night?

662
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,727
I am fucking positive
they weren't here!

663
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,354
How could we have
just camped. . .

664
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,858
. . . between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence?

665
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,277
You don't think this is strange?

666
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:51,364
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care. . .

667
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,117
. . . because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

668
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:57,412
Whatever it is,
man, right now. . .

669
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,581
. . .we have to get back to the car.

670
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:02,667
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

671
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,337
We have to get the DAT back.

672
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:07,922
-That's what I mean.
-Okay, let's go.

673
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,009
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

674
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:12,427
Can we just walk?

675
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:13,553
Yes, we're out of here.

676
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,596
Okay, cool.

677
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,724
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

678
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,978
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

679
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,356
-Let's get out of the woods.
-Okay, hang on.

680
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:25,982
Come on !

681
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,152
No, I'm not scared!
I'm just tired and hungry. . .

682
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:32,489
I'm just fucking done, man.

683
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:33,615
All right.

684
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,827
Did you take it?

685
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,997
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

686
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,252
I'm not playing head games.

687
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:48,588
You're the one playing
head games.

688
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,215
But I'm not.

689
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:55,970
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

690
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,180
Are you fucking serious?

691
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,391
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

692
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,686
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

693
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,604
I know it's not cool!

694
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,607
It's the fucking least
responsible thing. . .

695
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,235
. . .you could have done, man.

696
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,153
I know that.

697
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,074
You really don't have it?

698
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:19,619
One of you must have the map.

699
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,205
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you. . .

700
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,457
. . .after map check yesterday.

701
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,585
I always keep it in the
same place. . .

702
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,754
. . .and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

703
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:33,216
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

704
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,468
Well, I don't have it!

705
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:36,970
Look, why would I take it?

706
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,514
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

707
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,682
Me too.

708
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:41,725
Let's go!

709
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,311
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around. . .

710
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:46,146
Let's go!

711
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,523
. .you wanna film this and that. . .
Which way?

712
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,357
That way.

713
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,359
We're in the
middle of the woods!

714
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,820
We can walk any way!

715
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,282
This way! Because we've
been going this way all day.

716
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,285
We're going this way!
We gotta find something!

717
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,495
I gave you back the map!

718
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:03,371
I gave you the map.

719
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,790
I gave you back the map!

720
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,210
-Let's just go.
-We can move as fast as we want. . .

721
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,213
. . . but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

722
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,716
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

723
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,134
Would you guys stop it?

724
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,144
We are fucked, we are done. . .

725
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,730
. . .we are dead, we are fucked.

726
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:36,696
I'm staying here. When you
find someone. . .

727
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:40,158
. . .tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

728
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,868
All blame aside. . .

729
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,456
. . .this is really fucked up.

730
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,000
I know.

731
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,920
We really need to work together.

732
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,255
-I realize that.
-Exactly. Exactly.

733
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,634
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back. . .

734
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,052
. . .or your DAT.

735
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,888
No blame from now
on about that shit.

736
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,098
Look, seriously. . .

737
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,559
. . .this area's not that fucking big.

738
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:10,605
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days. . .

739
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,817
. . .and even harder to stay lost.

740
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,901
What?

741
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,238
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

742
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:22,242
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today. . .

743
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,077
. . . people are gonna notice. . .

744
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,122
. . . My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice. . .

745
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,375
. . .and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

746
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:35,338
. . .that I didn't get back and
I didn't call. . .

747
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,215
. . .so if by tonight we
haven't found shit. . .

748
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:40,093
. . .someone's gonna be looking for us.

749
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,177
Oh, no!

750
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:43,138
Not down here, go another way. . .

751
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,473
. . . I just got my whole shit wet.

752
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:51,980
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

753
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,649
No, not this way. . .

754
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,944
. . . better try the other way.

755
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,366
-If we didn't have these packs. . .
-I don't mean to laugh. . .

756
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,660
Your feet are wet!

757
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:07,537
Is Michael laughing?

758
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,876
Shut up and cross the stream.

759
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,794
He's laughing. . .

760
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,922
. . .that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

761
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,388
I'm happy you
find it amusing. . .

762
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,891
. . .that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

763
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,810
Dude, uncomfort does not even. . .

764
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,104
Can we keep going, please?

765
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,607
No, we're gonna chill out!

766
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,445
-Didn't you want to get to the car?
-Oh boy! !

767
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,489
Okay, come on. . .Iet's get up here.

768
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,740
Oh shit.

769
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,494
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you?

770
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:51,539
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

771
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,583
-Oh, Heather. .
-We're going a little stir crazy.

772
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,920
Heather! lf you make me
yell at this point. . .

773
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,963
. . .don't make me
yell at you, man.

774
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,717
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it!

775
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,304
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

776
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:11,476
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

777
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,524
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

778
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:21,111
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

779
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,696
It's fucking hilarious.

780
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,785
All our shoes are wet. . .

781
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,413
. . .we were laughing
at the situation.

782
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,330
Fine.

783
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,499
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired. . .

784
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,460
-. . .what the hell else can we do?
-You know what?

785
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:40,088
I'm sorry, it's fucked up. . .

786
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:46,094
. . . but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

787
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:50,265
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek!

788
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,187
I fucking hope he's kidding.

789
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,523
Mike?

790
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:01,735
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

791
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,946
Mike, are you fucking kidding?

792
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,823
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

793
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,452
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me!

794
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,579
-You think it's a game?
-Get off me!

795
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,789
What the fuck?
Are you out of your mind?

796
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,375
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit!

797
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,837
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said! !

798
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm sorry!

799
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,882
You're a fucking asshole!

800
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:24,966
I'm sorry.

801
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,509
You're a fucking asshole!

802
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:29,012
That map was useless!

803
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,015
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault!

804
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,559
You understand?

805
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,522
How could you be
such an asshole?

806
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:44,152
-What were you thinking?
-You are fucking me up here!

807
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,322
I am not! That map
was useless!

808
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,616
It was useless to you !

809
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,036
Okay. . .

810
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,622
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

811
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:59,334
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say?

812
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:03,546
-The map wasn't doing shit.
-Just don't say sorry.

813
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,256
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

814
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:08,385
I knew exactly where
we were!

815
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:11,429
Listen ! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on. . .

816
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:12,889
Shut up or else.

817
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,641
Turn the fucking camera off!

818
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:15,892
Give me the compass. . .

819
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,646
. . .you have betrayed us. . .

820
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:23,108
. . .way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

821
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,694
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

822
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,112
Yeah, thanks.

823
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,490
Can I have the fucking compass?

824
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,953
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one. . .

825
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,663
. . .you should've
bought your own.

826
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,665
You and he both fucked us up.

827
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,583
Why can't you admit that . . .

828
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,211
-. . .you fucked up from the start.
-Let's just walk south.

829
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,587
Because I haven't!

830
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,506
Why are we stopped?

831
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,054
Why are we stopped?

832
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,183
Just don't.

833
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:00,520
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

834
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:05,108
Weren't we going south?

835
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:07,193
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

836
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,863
Why don't we carry on like that?

837
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:20,206
What?

838
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,542
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here!

839
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,002
What kind of stuff?

840
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:25,879
Voodoo shit!

841
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,965
What?

842
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,177
-Hanging all over the place!
-No way. . .

843
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,305
It's all over.

844
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,389
Holy shit. . .

845
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:41,019
Come up quick! I need the CP!

846
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:42,937
There's all sorts
Here, man !

847
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,274
This is fucking crazy shit.

848
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:51,279
Please, I gotta film this!

849
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:52,697
Take the fucking camera.

850
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:57,702
What the fuck is this?

851
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,162
I have no idea.

852
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:45,709
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

853
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:52,799
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

854
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,136
Can we go now?

855
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,721
Yeah, please.

856
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:00,974
Okay, I got everything on video.

857
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,935
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these!

858
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,397
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

859
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:11,151
-That's enough ! Stop taping!
-That's enough !

860
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:14,195
-Okay, we're going right now.
-Let's go!

861
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:18,116
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

862
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,744
Come on, turn it off!

863
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,080
Help!

864
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,084
Please help us!

865
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,714
We won't get out of here like that.

866
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:33,923
Fuck!

867
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:35,967
Fuck!

868
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:40,138
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

869
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,640
I don't know what to do.

870
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,227
We should all get
lnside the tent.

871
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:47,479
All right.

872
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,731
Let's not light a fire tonight.

873
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,441
Yeah, that's my thinking.

874
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,819
-That's a good idea.
-We didn't light one the first night.

875
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:55,862
And nothing happened.

876
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:59,032
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

877
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,867
We should turn that light off, too.

878
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,160
All right.

879
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:05,121
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

880
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:07,999
Let's just go to sleep.

881
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:23,556
Oh God.

882
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:29,521
Put this out.

883
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:55,213
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God!

884
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:56,923
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

885
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,968
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

886
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,595
I'm gonna get this on video.

887
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,431
Oh, dear God, dear God!

888
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,862
Go, fucking go!

889
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:20,822
Oh God!

890
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,283
Oh God!

891
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:26,703
Hurry up!

892
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:29,789
I'm coming! My boots aren't laced!

893
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:32,876
Oh my God, what the fuck is that?

894
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:35,462
What the fuck is that?

895
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:44,012
Oh, shit!

896
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:53,855
Mike, where are you , man?

897
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:04,908
Turn the lights off. . .

898
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:07,911
. . .turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

899
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:13,875
All lights off,
all lights off.

900
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:22,509
I'm soaking.

901
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:23,760
That's okay.

902
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,595
What was that?

903
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,598
What the fuck is going on?

904
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,898
You hear that baby screaming?

905
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,651
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

906
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:42,821
-Yes there was.
-There was no fucking baby.

907
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,660
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away. . .

908
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:52,956
Oh my God, it's cold.

909
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,001
We should be quiet, okay?

910
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:08,221
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

911
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,143
How long have we been here?

912
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:15,061
I don't know, man, an hour. . .?

913
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,357
The sun's up. We're okay now.

914
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,570
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

915
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:24,988
Okay.

916
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,534
What the fuck, man?

917
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,661
Where's my pack?

918
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,705
Right there. Where's mine?

919
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:35,832
What the fuck, man?

920
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,300
Why're they fucking
with us like this?

921
00:48:46,217 --> 00:48:47,761
They just opened it up.

922
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:49,929
They spilled all my water!

923
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,806
Looks like slime, man.

924
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:53,850
It's just water, man.

925
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:56,895
It is slime. What the fuck is it?

926
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:58,772
Let's get out of here.

927
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:00,398
-Heather, turn that thing off!
-Let's go.

928
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:01,441
Okay.

929
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,610
I'm not interested
anymore! Let's go!

930
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:04,736
I know.

931
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,154
So turn it off.

932
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:09,282
Relax. Have we got everything here?

933
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,410
-Like I give a shit.
-Whose bag was opened?

934
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,787
It was mine!

935
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,375
Why you?

936
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,710
Are you not scared enough yet?

937
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:21,628
But why you?

938
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,963
Put it down. This is not funny.

939
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,633
Am I laughing at all?

940
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:30,095
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man !

941
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:31,721
Still your fucking documentary!

942
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:34,724
-Don't touch it!
-Then turn the goddam thing off!

943
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:37,602
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

944
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:41,106
-Don't touch my camera.
-Turn it off!

945
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:42,232
I'm sorry.

946
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,900
I didn't mean it, okay?

947
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:44,984
You all right?

948
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,778
Yeah. I wanna go home. . .

949
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:48,863
. . . but I wanna get
what we can.

950
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,490
What the fuck. .?

951
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,202
Is this possible?

952
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,746
All right.

953
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:58,790
Here I go.

954
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,459
I hate crossing streams on logs.

955
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,837
If I never cross another stream. . .

956
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:06,840
. . .on a log, I'll die happy.

957
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:12,303
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

958
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:14,681
You do?

959
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,725
It's not quite reality.

960
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,396
Reality says we gotta move.

961
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,775
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

962
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:30,822
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

963
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,660
Just leave him alone awhile

964
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,995
We need to go.

965
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,621
Leave him for five minutes.

966
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,417
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

967
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,336
Come on, he's lost it.

968
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,964
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

969
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:51,176
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

970
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:53,470
And we're not looking after him. . .

971
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:55,680
. . .if we film him
while he's crying.

972
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:56,639
I know.

973
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,183
I know you know.

974
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,852
Let's try and keep our wits.

975
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,395
But we have to go.

976
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:04,939
Sure. Believe me, I know.

977
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:06,816
It's hard to stay calm.

978
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,110
-We need to get out.
-I know.

979
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,779
You're not telling me
anything new,

980
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:13,615
Just let him calm down.

981
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:15,200
Anybody got a cigarette?

982
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,201
No, man.

983
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,744
No, there's none left.

984
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:20,538
Nobody has any cigarettes?

985
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:21,790
We're out.

986
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,628
Why the fuck. . .

987
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,631
. . .was this blue jelly
shit on my shit?

988
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:30,965
Let's go.

989
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:32,842
Let's go.

990
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:36,096
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

991
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,223
Please. . .

992
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:42,352
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

993
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,938
Josh, none of us do.

994
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:46,064
I know you don't.

995
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:49,526
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

996
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:50,902
It's not a fact.

997
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:54,072
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

998
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,866
Just what I need to
hear right now.

999
00:51:57,033 --> 00:52:00,537
I'm just trying to
rationally say that. . .

1000
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:05,250
. . .with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever. .

1001
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:09,504
Not possible in this country.

1002
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:11,131
Why not?

1003
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:14,968
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

1004
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:18,471
-Let's just keep going.
-America, America...

1005
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:22,267
... God shed your grace on thee...

1006
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:29,357
... Once so proudly we hailed...

1007
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:33,611
...at twilight's last gleaming...

1008
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,657
That's the tree we crossed.

1009
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,909
That tree is down. Same one.

1010
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:44,039
Oh God!

1011
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:45,623
Oh no. . .

1012
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,501
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke!

1013
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:52,130
It's not funny!

1014
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:56,259
Mike, please stop. . .
please stop. . .

1015
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:01,681
Oh no!

1016
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,392
No, Mike, it's not the same log!

1017
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:09,105
-Same log!
-Look, it's not!

1018
00:53:09,272 --> 00:53:11,149
Yes it is! Open your eyes!

1019
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,360
It's not the same log. . .

1020
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,254
It's the same log.

1021
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:36,424
Fuck you, God! !

1022
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:39,052
It's the same log.

1023
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,020
Okay, it's okay.

1024
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,903
Where do you wanna camp?

1025
00:53:57,153 --> 00:53:59,781
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

1026
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:02,033
I don't know what to say, Josh.

1027
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,787
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place?

1028
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:10,041
We walked south
all fucking day!

1029
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,293
I don't know how we
ended up here!

1030
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:21,553
Do you expect me to do,
or say something?

1031
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,230
What do you wanna do?

1032
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,863
Josh?

1033
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,745
I wanna make movies, Heather.

1034
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,166
Isn't that why we came?

1035
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,128
Let's make some movies.

1036
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,921
Fuck you.

1037
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:01,176
Fuck you.

1038
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,470
Let's not fight, please?

1039
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:07,390
. . . I can't take it.
I can't fight.

1040
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,436
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1041
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,105
I'll do the first watch.

1042
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:17,859
I got first watch.

1043
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,911
It's not the time or place, guys.

1044
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:29,913
We have things to prepare for.

1045
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,790
Okay, here's your motivation. . .

1046
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:35,335
. . .you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you. . .

1047
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,963
. . .there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around. . .

1048
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,590
. . . no one can help you. . .

1049
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,259
. . .she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one. . .

1050
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,054
. . .she's chasing us. And
no one can help you !

1051
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:48,014
We walked fifteen hours today. . .

1052
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,392
. . .and we ended up in the same place!

1053
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,020
There's no one to help you !
That's your motivation !

1054
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,359
Please stop.

1055
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:02,946
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

1056
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:06,116
You got her back. Good one.

1057
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:08,827
No, she's still making movies!

1058
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,995
-Please stop.
-Still making movies.

1059
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:14,082
It's all I have left, okay?
Just please stop.

1060
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:19,337
Please stop yelling at me.

1061
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,137
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

1062
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:31,057
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

1063
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,893
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

1064
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,402
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather?

1065
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,079
Come on, turn it off.

1066
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,999
You're getting like she was.

1067
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:05,050
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

1068
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,093
Well, I'm cold.

1069
00:57:07,677 --> 00:57:09,637
-I know.
-I hear you.

1070
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,307
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

1071
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:15,143
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point?

1072
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:16,436
Yes, it does.

1073
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,897
Lots of things seem absurd.

1074
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:22,692
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking. . .

1075
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:25,070
It's just fucking me up, period.

1076
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:29,282
Really fucking me up, man.

1077
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:36,331
-I'm sorry, man.
-Me too. It's all right.

1078
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,166
I'm sorry, Heather.

1079
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:39,918
It's all right.

1080
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:42,504
Who wants a cheeseburger?

1081
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:44,506
I do, I do. . .

1082
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:47,801
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

1083
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:51,554
Do you? Can I have a
light to cut this?

1084
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:53,848
Know what I'd fucking love?

1085
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:55,183
What?

1086
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:56,726
Mashed potatoes.

1087
00:57:57,936 --> 00:57:59,104
Me too.

1088
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:04,234
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1089
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:10,824
You'll have them again very soon.

1090
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:15,495
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1091
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:18,289
Josh?

1092
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,754
Fuck, we never go out of earshot!

1093
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,799
Come on, calm down.

1094
00:58:29,259 --> 00:58:30,719
How can l?

1095
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:41,855
He's probably at the river.

1096
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,399
If he was there,
he could hear me.

1097
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,989
Wait for him to respond.

1098
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,783
Remember what he said yesterday?

1099
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,243
What?

1100
00:58:56,953 --> 00:59:00,206
About the shit on his bag.

1101
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:08,048
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

1102
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,093
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh?

1103
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:13,303
Come on.

1104
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:15,180
No, I'm fine.

1105
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:18,141
Come on, come on, relax.

1106
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,894
All right, let's take
Down the tent. . .

1107
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:22,812
. . .and when he's back, we'll go.

1108
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:24,939
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

1109
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,816
Josh hasn't come back.

1110
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:27,734
Heather?

1111
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:30,278
I'm here, Mike.

1112
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:36,326
I don't know if Josh ran off.

1113
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,329
All his shit's here.

1114
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:42,540
I've got the camera. . .

1115
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,169
. . . I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

1116
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:48,797
Sure you wanna take it?

1117
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:50,131
We have to take the camera.

1118
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:53,927
How do you feel about east?

1119
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,514
How do you feel?

1120
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,518
Well, south didn't work.

1121
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:07,065
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south?

1122
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,653
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

1123
01:00:12,195 --> 01:00:13,446
Let's go east.

1124
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:18,410
What the hell is that?

1125
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:20,870
Josh?

1126
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:27,877
We'll have to put up the tent.

1127
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:41,850
I'd like a meatball.

1128
01:00:42,058 --> 01:00:43,518
Just one meatball?

1129
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,854
And a big glass of red wine.

1130
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:49,107
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1131
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:51,067
And a pack of smokes.

1132
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:55,030
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

1133
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,698
And a big pumpkin pie.

1134
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:58,700
A pumpkin pie with ice cream?

1135
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:02,412
Warm with milky ice cream?

1136
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,872
Yeah, sounds good.

1137
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,708
What do you like
to do on a Sunday?

1138
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:11,921
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

1139
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,552
But I think that might change now.

1140
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:19,888
I think you could scratch that.

1141
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:36,029
Should we open the door?

1142
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:38,907
Is it a trick?

1143
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,584
Josh !

1144
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,545
Josh !

1145
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,476
Where's it coming from?

1146
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,785
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

1147
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,542
Oh my God, no.

1148
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,050
Do you think that's them again?

1149
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:47,017
Is it over here?

1150
01:02:47,225 --> 01:02:48,935
No, it's over here.

1151
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:00,864
We'll look for him.

1152
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:17,255
I don't know if it's really him.

1153
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,770
I don't even know where to look.

1154
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,152
Tell me where you are, Josh !

1155
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,198
Mike?

1156
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,575
-What?
-Please don't fall asleep.

1157
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,202
I can't fall asleep.

1158
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:54,501
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

1159
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:03,009
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

1160
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,808
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

1161
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:12,894
See?

1162
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,815
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

1163
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,858
There. He's sleeping.

1164
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:28,076
Oh, shit.

1165
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:33,331
What the hell is that?

1166
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:38,503
-Mike.
-What?

1167
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,090
There's something out here.

1168
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,766
Okay,

1169
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:55,437
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

1170
01:04:55,687 --> 01:04:57,564
-Get rid of it.
-Okay.

1171
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,986
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

1172
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:06,072
I'm just throwing it.

1173
01:05:11,786 --> 01:05:14,539
We'll just keep walking, okay.

1174
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:15,832
Okay.

1175
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:23,715
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack. . .

1176
01:05:23,882 --> 01:05:26,551
. . .so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

1177
01:06:17,018 --> 01:06:18,561
It's all full of blood.

1178
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:02,188
Shit, shit, shit!

1179
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:09,863
Oh my God!

1180
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:24,919
Okay, see. . .?

1181
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,255
Yeah?

1182
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:29,966
What are you doing?

1183
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,218
Just washing my hands!

1184
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,178
What?

1185
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:34,888
Just washing my hands!

1186
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:36,848
I'm fine.

1187
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,142
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

1188
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:49,903
You all right?

1189
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:53,907
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1190
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:58,536
You need help?

1191
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:00,830
No, I don't need any help.

1192
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,124
I'm okay.

1193
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:03,958
What happened?

1194
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,462
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired. . .

1195
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:10,173
. . .and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay?

1196
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:11,132
Okay.

1197
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:13,259
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

1198
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:22,727
Ow! My hair's caught.

1199
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:28,274
Thank you, thank you.

1200
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:33,947
Okay, okay.

1201
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:20,201
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games. . .

1202
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:23,496
. . .one more season and
Cal Ripken is king!

1203
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:30,045
And I won't see it. . .

1204
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,298
. . . because I'll be in the woods.

1205
01:09:48,605 --> 01:09:51,941
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

1206
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,704
I just want to apologize. . .

1207
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:08,041
. . .to Mike's mom. . .

1208
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:10,835
. . .and Josh's mom. . .

1209
01:10:11,878 --> 01:10:13,505
. . .and my mom. . .

1210
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,968
. . .and I'm sorry to everyone. . .

1211
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,306
. . . I was very naïve.

1212
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:31,481
I am so, so, sorry. . .

1213
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,442
. . .for everything that's happened. . .

1214
01:10:35,985 --> 01:10:38,655
. . . because in spite of
what Mike says now. . .

1215
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:40,073
. . .it was my fault. . .

1216
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:43,493
. . . because it was my project. . .

1217
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:46,162
. . .and I insisted. . .

1218
01:10:47,872 --> 01:10:49,666
. . .insisted on everything.

1219
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,420
I insisted we weren't lost. . .

1220
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:57,549
. . . I insisted we keep going. . .

1221
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,927
. . . I insisted we walk south.

1222
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,265
Everything had
to be my way.

1223
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:07,809
And this is how we've ended up.

1224
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:12,272
And it's all because of me
that we're here now. . .

1225
01:11:12,605 --> 01:11:14,983
. . . hungry and cold. . .

1226
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:18,987
. . .and hunted.

1227
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,869
I love you, mom. . .

1228
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:28,288
. . .dad. . .

1229
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:33,001
. . . I am so sorry.

1230
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:40,717
. . .what was that?

1231
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:55,815
I'm scared to close my eyes. . .

1232
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:58,693
. . .and scared to open them.

1233
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,327
Oh God. . .

1234
01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:09,788
. . .we're gonna die here.

1235
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,461
-You got it?
-You ready?

1236
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:19,923
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1237
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:32,560
You ready?

1238
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:34,688
Here, take this light.

1239
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:39,359
That can't be him.

1240
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:21,985
Holy shit, it's a house.

1241
01:13:23,945 --> 01:13:27,115
-Watch your step.
-Holy shit, Holy shit. . .

1242
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:49,095
Josh?

1243
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:06,279
Mike. Mike.

1244
01:14:07,864 --> 01:14:08,865
Come on.

1245
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:11,576
Mike, where the fuck are you?

1246
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,745
Come on, I'm in the house!

1247
01:14:14,245 --> 01:14:16,790
Mike, don't go in there, please!

1248

Where is he?

1251
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:50,865
Mike, please don't.

1252
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,376
Is he in here?

1253
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:02,460
No.

1254
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,226
Oh, Jesus.

1255
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:19,644
Where is he?

1256
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:22,689
Are you gonna go upstairs?

1257
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:26,776
I hear him. I hear him.

1258
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:29,154

1259
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,289
I'm going upstairs.

1260
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:45,962
Oh, God, oh.

1261
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,718
Hear that?

1262
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:54,888
Where is he?

1263
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:56,931
Where are you?

1264
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:00,352
Come on !

1265
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:06,149
I'm getting downstairs.

1266
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,944
Come on, I hear him, downstairs!

1267
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:11,863

1268
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:12,947

Josh, is that you down there?
