1
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,918
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

2
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,421
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

3
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,025
Tippytoe, come in.
Are you there?

4
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,194
This is Tippytoe. Over.

5
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,529
Did you receive the souvenir package?
Over.

6
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,408
Package received. Over.
Is it snowing there now, Dad?

7
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,977
I wouldn't know, kiddo,
because I'm in Marrakech.

8
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,120
Whoa!

9
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,331
This is the big one, buddy.
A dream come true.

10
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,208
We have been compromised. Over.

11
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,460
Kiss her for me!

12
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,506
This is Mama Bird.
Over and out.

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,008
You, get to sleep.

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,927
Guess where I am now, pal. Romania!

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,416
Papua New Guinea.
Makes the old Guinea look like nothing.

16
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:49,299
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

17
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,861
I can reach now.

18
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,905
Wow! How long have I been gone?

19
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,865
Two months and 17 days.

20
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,535
Well, don't worry, because Samoa
is what we've been looking for.

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,370
This one is going to be my legacy.

22
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,480
Yeahbsolutely.

23
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,874
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe.
Over.

24
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,647
Bald Eagle calling Tippytoe. Over.

25
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,550
Tippytoe to Bald Eagle. Over.

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,069
Come in. Are you there?

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,865
Hey, kiddo. I'm right on the verge
of something big here.

28
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,993
But I'm not going to make it home
for your birthday.

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,077
I'm really sorry,

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,955
but opportunities like this
are hard to find, Son.

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,406
Opportunities like this
are hard to find, Franklin.

32
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,010
I'm about to bag a rare species
on this little expedition.

33
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,138
Fifteen F.A.R. That's a million absolute.

34
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,622
And a landmark building.

35
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,916
Don't thank me,
just start building a statue.

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,935
- Morning, Pippi.
- Mr. Popper.

37
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,562
Contract.

38
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,565
I love the smell of toner in the morning.

39
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,774
That's the pertinent printout.

40
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,611
And the person we are purchasing
the property from is present.

41
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,304
Let's do it.

42
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,765
Mr. Popper for Mr. Gremmins.

43
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,533
And you are?

44
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,994
Pippi Peponopolis.
I'm Mr. Popper's personal assistant.

45
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,705
I process his paperwork
and I procure his periodicals.

46
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,165
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,291
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

48
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,584
You can go in.

49
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,588
Mr. Popper, sorry to waste your time,

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,908
but I've changed my mind.
I'm not going to sell.

51
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,301
I understand.

52
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,720
Second thoughts
are as valid as first thoughts.

53
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,930
They just come later.

54
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,708
It's just that this building
is my last holding and if I sell, then...

55
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,378
Then you're free,
and that's a scary thing.

56
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,773
Hey, I get it.

57
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,091
Doing any sailing this year?

58
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,944
Who has the time?

59
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,988
Yeah. My father sailed
around the world solo.

60
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,306
- Yeah.
- Lucky man.

61
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,951
Yeah, pulled a Hemingway.
Just him and the sea.

62
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,079
You know,
that's always been a dream of mine.

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,290
Oh! He had some stories.

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,542
Like that storm off the Horn of Africa.

65
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,653
- The Horn of Africa?
- Oh, yeah.

66
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,049
The sea was calm, the sailing smooth.
When, out of nowhere...

67
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,679
Twenty-foot swells,
like a hammer punch to the prow.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,666
Dad was a heck of a sailor,
but he'd never seen waves like this.

69
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,936
Gale force winds
straight from the Devil's nostrils

70
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,355
whipped his ship like a rubber ducky.

71
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,465
The salt spray in his face
felt like a thousand needles.

72
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,760
And suddenly, the wind ripped
the mainsail off the mast.

73
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,071
He was doomed.

74
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,639
What did he do?

75
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,241
- What did he do?
- Yes.

76
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,659
He spun the wheel.

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,620
Hoisted the jib,
threaded the needle backwards.

78
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,081
And when he came out the other side...
Oh, my God!

79
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,024
Oh, my God!

80
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,920
- What?
- It can't be. But it is.

81
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,338
What is it?

82
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,531
A blue whale.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,723
Like a gentle giant,
the most majestic creature on Earth.

84
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,725
It's so beautiful.

85
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,851
Can you see it?

86
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,295
His skin glistening in the sun.

87
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,381
A rainbow

88
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,801
in the spray of his mighty blowhole.

89
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,054
Oh, well. You will get out there,

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,806
someday.

91
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,141
Mmm.

92
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,064
Wait.

93
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,736
Way to go, Popper.

94
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,421
Hey, it's what I do.

95
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,842
Gentlemen, what is the future
of Franklin, Reader & Yates?

96
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,261
A long, slow decline,
getting older and weaker...

97
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,596
till it has that funny smell...

98
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,223
and starts driving around all day
with the left-turn signal on?

99
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,416
Franklin?

100
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,101
Or will it be reborn

101
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,422
with vim, vigor and Viagratality?

102
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,216
I say we meet the future head-on.

103
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,469
Sexy!

104
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,780
Come on, guys.
It's time to commit.

105
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,058
It's time to go above and Beyoncé,
and put a ring on it.

106
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,770
Beyoncé is a singer, Franklin.
She's a singer.

107
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,455
Named Beyoncé!

108
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,940
Can he hear me?

109
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,666
We had a feeling
this was coming, Popper.

110
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,693
We saw the marble slab in your office.

111
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,337
Oops.

112
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,074
Popper, there's no one more qualified
than you to take a seat at this table.

113
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,468
- Don't sit just yet.
- Okay.

114
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,621
There is one more prize
we would like you to get for us.

115
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,015
Name it, fellas.

116
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,210
Plaza Hotel? Empire State Building?

117
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,879
The Pentagon?

118
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,589
Tavern on the Green.

119
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,217
Tavern on the Green?

120
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,010
What's the matter, Popper?

121
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,281
Nothing.
It's just kind of a rundown place.

122
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,977
It's the only privately held real estate
in Central Park.

123
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,871
We can build anything we want on it.

124
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,418
You mean, like,
wipe it off the face of the Earth?

125
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,669
Start over?

126
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,920
Mmm-hmm.

127
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,339
- It would be like it never existed.
- Exactly

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,175
But first you have got to get past
Selma Van Gundy.

129
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,761
She has gotten a thousand offers,
turned them all down.

130
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,830
You've got one shot.

131
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,456
You think you can close it?

132
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm sorry, have we met?
I'm Thom Popper.

133
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,379
I do deals like this in my sleep.

134
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,857
- Hello?
- Hey, Amanda, we're pulling up.

135
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,525
- Can you make sure the kids are ready?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,152
Last time it took a while.

137
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,138
- Keep it running.
- Sure thing, Mr. Popper.

138
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,991
Thomas! Greetings.

139
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,869
Greetings, Rick,
and welcome to our planet.

140
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,522
Lately, we've been using the word, "Hi"
or a simple, "Sup?"

141
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,066
How are you?

142
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,210
I'm better now. Thank you.

143
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,962
No, really, Thomas, how are you?

144
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,280
Really, I'm good.

145
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,135
Please look away.

146
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,703
Okay, I will.

147
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,334
Hey, Popper!
I've been working on my power shot.

148
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,003
Let's see what you've got, tough guy.
Come on.

149
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,816
Ooh! Oh!

150
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,468
Nice save.

151
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,970
- Hey, Popper.
- Greetings.

152
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,864
Did you say hi to Rick?

153
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,033
Yeah. Yeah, he hugged me three times.

154
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,409
I felt like an endangered sequoia.

155
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,203
Come on, we have only gone out
a couple of times.

156
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,329
He's a keeper.

157
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,164
There is nothing wrong
with a man who recycles.

158
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,792
I recycle. I turn decrepit old buildings
into shiny new ones.

159
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,753
Did I mention
he's also incredibly handsome?

160
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,962
Really?

161
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,422
Good to see your taste hasn't changed.

162
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,949
And thoughtful. And considerate.

163
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,428
- Where is your sister?
- She's having issues.

164
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,913
You know, Cooper Keegan?

165
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,289
Cooper Keegan.

166
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,124
The love of her life!

167
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,584
Oh.

168
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,213
Hi! Hey, look who's here.

169
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,424
Who's ready for a big weekend at Dad's?

170
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,971
She says she doesn't want to go
with you this weekend.

171
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,264
Maybe you should talk to her.

172
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,225
Yeahbsolutely.

173
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,811
What are we looking at?

174
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,374
95 pounds of C-4 explosives
on a hair trigger.

175
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,960
Make sure you clip
the right wire, otherwise...

176
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,403
Ba-boom!

177
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,948
You're in The Hurt Locker now, Popper.

178
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,538
Do you want to talk about it?

179
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,040
Come on.

180
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,923
What do you do if you like somebody,
but they don't like you back?

181
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,970
Janie,

182
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,890
you're a powerful woman,
you're an independent lady.

183
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,726
You don't even need a man, really.

184
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,121
Look at Martha Stewart.
She's rich and she sleeps with her dogs.

185
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,665
You are so warped!

186
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,835
I don't know why I thought
for one second I could talk to you.

187
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,070
- Janie...
- This is why I don't want to go.

188
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,298
He cut both wires.

189
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,508
Come on, it's our weekend.

190
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,828
It's going to be fun.

191
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,790
Good talk.

192
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,726
Mr. Popper? Pippi.

193
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,060
I've parlayed with the Tavern people

194
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,979
and persuaded them
to ponder your proposal.

195
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,897
Great. I don't have
the kids this weekend,

196
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,859
so set a meeting with Van Gundy
and call me.

197
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,694
No little ones this weekend, Mr. P?

198
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,654
No, Daryl. They don't like me right now.

199
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,156
Well, I like you, sir.

200
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,866
Already working
on the Christmas bonus, huh?

201
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,367
Never start too early.

202
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,187
- Yeahbsolutely.
- You have a good one, Mr. P.

203
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,439
Tommy, it's Reginald. Call me.

204
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,399
It's about your father.

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,901
So where was he, Reginald?

206
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,427
Antarctica.

207
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,656
Selling ice to the Eskimos?

208
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,157
That's the Arctic.

209
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,533
Whatever.

210
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,453
Your father loved you, Tommy.

211
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,397
That's good to know. Do you want to read?

212
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,985
The last will and testament
of Thomas Popper Sr.

213
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,756
"To the good folks
at the Geographic Society,

214
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,259
"I leave my Slovenian zither recordings,

215
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,513
"the Tahoe yurt and the Uzbek yurt,

216
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,183
"as well as the rest
of my worldly possessions.

217
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,602
"To my little Tommy,

218
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,771
"I've sent you a souvenir.

219
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,526
"I'm sorry I couldn't deliver
this one to you in person.

220
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,762
"Bald Eagle, over and out".

221
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,110
Monday! Thank God!

222
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,076
Ah!

223
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,619
My souvenir.

224
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,790
It's too big for a snow globe,
too small for a yurt.

225
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,146
Oh, wow!

226
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,257
A stuffed penguin,
for the man who has everything.

227
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,973
Thank you, Daddy.

228
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,497
Sergeant Pipper.

229
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,999
Yeah, I know. I'm late.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,984
Van Gundy's at the Tavern already?

231
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,671
Yes, I know how important she is.

232
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,673
Okay. Stall her.

233
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,508
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

234
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,845
I don't know. Tell her I was poisoned
by a porcupine or punched by a pedestrian.

235
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,956
What do I pay you for?

236
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,848
I'll call you back.

237
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,357
It's a live penguin.

238
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,818
He sent me a live penguin.

239
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,819
Hi, live penguin.

240
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,897
As soon as I get home,
you're going back where you came from.

241
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,710
See this? Made in Italy. Not for pecking.

242
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,797
Frette towels, also not for penguins.

243
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,533
Other than that, don't touch anything.

244
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,844
Pippi, hang on.

245
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,246
Coming now!

246
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,087
No time for pain.

247
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,951
Mr. Popper. Phew!

248
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,562
Punctuality is a priority
for this particular person.

249
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,122
Don't sweat it, Pip.

250
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,832
I'll start scratching this old gal
behind the ears,

251
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,542
pretty soon she will be curled up in my lap

252
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,127
purring like a kitty cat.

253
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,590
Right behind me?

254
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,133
Mrs. Van Gundy.

255
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,135
Pleasure to meet you. Thom Popper.

256
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,828
Mr. Popper.

257
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:59,981
I'm afraid I can only offer you 10 minutes.
You're extremely late.

258
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,799
That's all I need.

259
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,291
This is Tito and Freddy,

260
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,991
- our kitchen staff.
- Hi.

261
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,703
And Klaus, he's our handyman.
And this is our chef, Arnold.

262
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,497
His kind of cooking
never goes out of style.

263
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,666
Do you like kidney pie?

264
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,543
Are you kidding me? I love it.

265
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,836
In fact, I'm a donor.

266
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,324
I filled out the card and...

267
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,677
No, I've never actually had that,
but I would love to try it.

268
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,496
Let's have a seat.

269
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,890
All right, guys.
Back to work.

270
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:39,187
I wonder if we could sit more
in the center of the room.

271
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,172
I want to get a real sense
of the space.

272
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,036
You have a very unusual name, Mr. Popper.

273
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,395
And I never forget one.

274
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,541
This restaurant has been in my family
for three generations.

275
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,045
My grandmother served coq au vin
for Winston Churchill.

276
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,406
And my father poured champagne
for Fred Astaire.

277
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,885
My mother made a BLT
for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once.

278
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,221
She said he was
surprisingly down-to-earth,

279
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,874
which is ironic, considering
how tall he is.

280
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,020
Fascinating.
But I can't sell this place to just anyone.

281
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,298
I mean,
I consider the staff to be family, too.

282
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,884
Nothing is more important
than family to me. Nothing.

283
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,386
Are you married?

284
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,555
Not presently.

285
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,598
Any children?

286
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,120
Two. And we have the most magical

287
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,729
alternate weekends together.

288
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,357
Tell me about your father.

289
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,317
My father?

290
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,319
Uh...

291
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,130
What can I say?

292
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,216
A father is a father.
And he was no different.

293
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,701
You were close?

294
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,597
Yes. Well, we're related.

295
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,101
But, Mrs. Van Gundy,
I want to talk about you

296
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,670
and your life beyond all of this.

297
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,216
Picture yourself in a boat on a river.

298
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,695
With tangerine trees

299
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,223
and kind of a marmalade sky.

300
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,618
I don't do drugs, Mr. Popper.

301
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,746
Let me tell you something.

302
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,872
I could sell this place

303
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,359
to any number of sharp-tongued
snake-oil salesmen like yourself.

304
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,615
But I'm not selling to anyone
until I know what they're worth.

305
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,783
You mean my net worth?

306
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,638
If that's how you interpret it,
that tells me something.

307
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,141
Well, I'm afraid your time is up,
Mr. Popper.

308
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,376
The Tavern is not presently for sale.

309
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,300
I should have gone with Strawberry Fields.

310
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,378
Oh, good.

311
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,214
You sent me a package.

312
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,257
Uh. My name is Popper.

313
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,843
Popper?
You Captain Popper baby?

314
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,386
"Captain?"

315
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,746
Uh...

316
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,516
Yes, I'm Captain Popper baby.

317
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,519
My father, who is apparently your captain,

318
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,896
had you send me a penguin.

319
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,357
You like penguin? Is good, yes?

320
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,275
No, is bad.

321
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,944
Your captain was crazy.

322
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,946
So crazy. I love.

323
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,139
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you had someone.

324
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,535
But listen,
I have to send this penguin back.

325
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,497
What? Hello?

326
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,500
Hello? I have to send the penguin back.

327
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,668
Send penguin?

328
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,711
Yes! Send penguin. Send penguin.

329
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,172
I told you five times,
I have to send the penguin.

330
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,008
Five times. Send penguin. Okay.

331
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,703
Great. And the crate is damaged.

332
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,097
Can you send me another crate
so I can ship this thing?

333
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,294
Hello?

334
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,634
What am I going to do with you, bird?

335
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,623
You!

336
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,900
You are so done.

337
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,864
No. No.

338
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,432
- Hello.
- Sorry, cannot take your phone call.

339
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,252
We will be closing one month
for ice festival!

340
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,444
Hey. Animal Control.
Got a call about a bird.

341
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,404
I am very happy to see you.

342
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,847
Um...

343
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,574
Oh. That's the little fella.

344
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,159
- What the...
- Go ahead. He's friendly.

345
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,437
I didn't know it was a penguin, okay?
I'm going to have to check the manual.

346
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,122
It's not in the book.

347
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,274
Can't we just call it a pigeon?

348
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,626
Big, fat pigeon?

349
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,462
I can't touch it if it's not in the manual.
It's a union violation.

350
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,654
Try Fish and Game.

351
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,449
No. You need Marine and Waterfowl.

352
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,494
Sorry, bud. Try NYC Sanitation.

353
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,372
Yeah. I only pick up the dead ones.

354
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,705
This way.

355
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,960
Okay, get. Go.

356
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,711
Skedaddle.

357
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,147
Waddle on down the road.

358
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,899
South Pole is that way.

359
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,818
Exit the building, take a right

360
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,344
and keep going.

361
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,438
Okay. Need a little help. I get it.

362
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,316
Watch this.

363
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,007
There you go!

364
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,576
Yes! Bye-bye, birdie.

365
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,096
Hey, Mr. P.

366
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,764
Yeah.

367
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,891
I got your penguin for you.

368
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,043
What? What are you talking about?

369
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,353
That's not my penguin.

370
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,771
Oh, really?

371
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,841
Why would I have a penguin?

372
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,285
That could be anybody.

373
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,895
Oh, yeah.

374
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,233
Just give me the stupid thing.

375
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,379
So, the board must have given you
a free pass

376
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,341
on the whole "no pets" thing.

377
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,409
That is mighty nice of them.

378
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,120
How much till you don't see a penguin?

379
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,750
I can still see him.

380
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,437
It's getting blurry.

381
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,589
If I decided to squint,
it could look like a puppy.

382
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,966
How's that?

383
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,111
Is that you, Mr. P?

384
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,138
The light's going dim.

385
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,616
- Yeah, Pippi.
- Mr. Popper!

386
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,034
Yeah. I'm not coming
into work again today.

387
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,118
Oh.

388
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,244
I have a pest problem.

389
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,080
What particular pest is the problem?

390
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,539
- It's a penguin.
- A penguin?

391
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,125
Yeah. Starts with "P".
You ought to be able to handle it.

392
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,502
Hey there, Popper.

393
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,694
Kent.

394
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,673
Is that... Is that a pet I hear, Popper?

395
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,301
Pet? No. What? Of course not.

396
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,620
Okay. I mean, I can't say I blame you.

397
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,933
If I had your 3,200 square feet,
I'd find someone to share it with, too.

398
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,434
It's not a pet, Kent.

399
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,478
I left the television on.
I'll take care of it.

400
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,945
Digital surround.

401
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,488
It's like a real animal in there...

402
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,115
busting stuff.

403
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,724
It's amazing.

404
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,978
Bye, Kent.

405
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,690
The golden eagle is
North America's largest bird of prey.

406
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,835
With a wingspan of 185...

407
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:45,506
to 220 centimeters,
these extremely swift creatures...

408
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,799
can dive upon their quarry

409
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,969
at speeds of more than 241 kilometers
per hour.

410
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,996
You like that, huh?

411
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,514
Too bad.

412
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,225
I was listening to your commentary,
in The Economist,

413
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,309
reviewing these numbers,

414
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,229
and obviously the job number on Friday
wasn't a bad number.

415
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,189
We've got, what, three months now
averaging about 150,000 jobs...

416
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,383
That's not cute. You're not cute.

417
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,677
I don't know what people see in you.

418
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,449
Yes! Now you're talking.

419
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,285
Hey, Chilly Willy. Your ride is here.

420
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:25,504
Someone is going on a little trip today.
No big deal, right?

421
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:30,050
All right, penguin.
No long goodbyes. Let's go.

422
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,136
Come here.

423
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,789
Gotcha. Game is over. You lose.

424
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,395
Let me just seal you in. No!

425
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,648
Where do you think you're going?

426
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,593
My kid's birthday is in 10 minutes. Okay?

427
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,222
That's right. I make the rules.
Because I have the brains.

428
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,150
Wait. How did you...

429
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,323
What the...

430
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,591
Hey!

431
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,095
It's an infestation.

432
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,908
How did you even get up there?
Your legs are, like, four inches long.

433
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,770
Obviously, a little miscommunication.

434
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,897
All right. Who is hungry?

435
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,376
Come on, you little snow rats.

436
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,047
Ooh! Hey! Gosh, thought you guys
would never get here.

437
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,215
That's great.

438
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,342
You ready for the big birthday
celebration fiesta?

439
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,468
Here we go.

440
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,679
But here's the thing,
I'm not quite ready yet.

441
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,308
So, can you just hang out for a bit
while I get Billy's gift all set?

442
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,435
Translation, "I forgot as usual,"

443
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,062
"and I need to call Pippi
to go get something".

444
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,815
- Janie.
- Not true. Bad translation.

445
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,608
I got the gift,

446
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,360
and it's right in here.

447
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,180
Yeah! A penguin!

448
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,825
No, Billy. I actually...

449
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,993
He's awesome!

450
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,310
Oh! Great.

451
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,746
Hold on.

452
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,915
You got him an actual live penguin?

453
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,150
Uh...

454
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,752
Six penguins?

455
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,589
Yes! Best birthday ever!

456
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,257
That's good counting, Billy.

457
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,341
Do they have names?

458
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,993
Yeah, course.

459
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,971
This one is Captain.

460
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,832
Captain Popper.

461
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,836
And that's Loudy.

462
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,564
Hey! Hey!

463
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,383
And that one's Bitey.

464
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,178
Oh!

465
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,971
Stinky.

466
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,349
Aw! He loves me.

467
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,685
That's Lovey.

468
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,479
Yeah.

469
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,654
And that's Nimrod.

470
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,615
Let's make a fort.

471
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,217
- Oh! Fort! Cool.
- Go.

472
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,011
Billy, the cushions...

473
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,513
That's a great idea for fort building.

474
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,640
I gotta tell you,

475
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,310
you have officially raised the
birthday present bar to a whole new level.

476
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,063
- I know!
- How did you find them, anyway?

477
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,316
Some sort of, I don't know,
birthday-penguin rental company?

478
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,442
Um...

479
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,345
No. Actually, Thom Sr.

480
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,908
- Your dad?
- Yeah.

481
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,410
Wait. You saw him? How is he?

482
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,728
He passed away.

483
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,580
As in, he's dead?

484
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,249
Yeah. He broke on through
to the other side.

485
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,585
Oh, my God. I'm...

486
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,629
I'm so sorry.

487
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,174
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

488
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,742
You're fine.

489
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,678
Fine. I'm good.

490
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,137
And he left me those.

491
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,290
Hey, where're you going? Come back here.

492
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,085
- Got you!
- Hey!

493
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,271
You look great.

494
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,524
- Thanks. I should get the cake in the...
- That's a nice cake.

495
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,758
Oh!

496
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,134
What?

497
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,239
Oh, my God!

498
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,407
How cute.

499
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,367
It looks like they're nesting.

500
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,435
Finally, you have something in your fridge.

501
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,456
- Yeah?
- Thomas Popper?

502
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,708
Uh-huh.

503
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,317
Nat Jones, New York Zoo.

504
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,545
Flightless Bird Division.

505
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,381
Your assistant called,
the one with the "P" problem.

506
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,116
I'm here for the penguin.

507
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,051
Wow.

508
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,678
She didn't tell me they were Gentoos.

509
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,996
How many do you have?

510
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,472
- Five?
- Six.

511
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,249
Six! Oh, God. Even better.

512
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,101
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

513
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,255
I'll take care of it.
Hey, save me a piece of that. Mmm!

514
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,067
I've got my team downstairs,
and a fully equipped retrieval van.

515
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,152
Yeah, that's great.

516
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,113
But listen, you can't actually take
the penguins right now.

517
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,699
- What are you talking about?
- Believe me, I'd love to give them to you.

518
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,826
But it's my kid's birthday,
and he's crazy about them.

519
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,952
You know kids.

520
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,413
I don't know kids. I know penguins.

521
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,665
They like ice, snow and fish.

522
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,875
Put them in a New York apartment,

523
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,585
they're gonna get beak rash
and wing mange

524
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,336
faster than you can
blow out your birthday candles.

525
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,005
- Wing mange?
- It's not pretty.

526
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,423
Those animals belong in a zoo.

527
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,050
Hey, I get it.
I just have to take care of the politics.

528
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,554
Mr. Popper, don't postpone the inevitable.
Give me the birds.

529
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,849
Yeahbsolutely. They're yours.
Just not right now.

530
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,834
- I'll call you. Okay.
- Yeah. Soon.

531
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,190
Hey, it's me.

532
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,359
He's got six of them. And they're Gentoos.

533
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,236
Not yet, but I'll get them.

534
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,679
What was that?

535
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,140
What did that man mean,
"I'm here for the penguins"?

536
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,827
Oh, that guy?
He's here for their baths.

537
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,355
He's the bather. Trust me,
you're going to want them bathed.

538
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,207
I just told him
to come back later,

539
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,858
because we're in the middle of a part-ay!

540
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,235
They're mine, right? I can keep them?

541
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,838
You kidding me?
What kind of question is that?

542
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,423
I don't know, Billy.

543
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,283
I'd make him promise if I were you.

544
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,953
Do you promise me, Popper?

545
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,055
Yes.

546
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,389
Say the words.

547
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,891
You don't want to disappoint them.

548
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,351
When did I ever disappoint anybody?

549
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,435
- Father-son picnic.
- My birthday.

550
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,878
Our last anniversary.

551
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,214
I promise.

552
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,198
Can we come over again
tomorrow night?

553
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,533
- Really?
- Please?

554
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,077
Yeah. What about you, Janie? You, too?

555
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,246
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be too bad.

556
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,122
What do you think, buzz kill?

557
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,375
A night to myself? I think I'll survive.

558
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,027
Thanks, Dad. I'll see you tomorrow.

559
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,908
- It was a nice night.
- Yeah.

560
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,639
- My kids want to come over.
- Who gives a rat's butt?

561
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,000
Fair enough. Have a good one.

562
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,607
People love the sounds of nature.

563
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,594
Helps them sleep.
It's beautiful. It's natural.

564
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,493
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey!

565
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,271
Yeah. Good.

566
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,748
Now shut up and go to sleep.

567
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,693
Or I'll give you something to honk about.

568
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,903
All right, back off.

569
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,364
Spread out. Seriously.
I'm used to living alone.

570
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,366
No! Expensive.

571
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,726
Oh! Ah!

572
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,649
Hey, that's my remote, Pecky Peckerton.

573
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,659
Huh.

574
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,497
You like that, huh?

575
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,417
He's funny, right? Kind of like a penguin.

576
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,512
Good. That'll loop all day.

577
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,034
- I suppose it's a formal event.
- Precisely.

578
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,869
Popper, where have you been?

579
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,412
Hey, guys.

580
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,664
We talked to Van Gundy's people.

581
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,499
They say she turned you down flat.

582
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,377
Fellas, calm down. Life's too short,

583
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,461
especially for Franklin.

584
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,338
We thought we could trust you with this.

585
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,657
Hey, Taming of the Shrew
is not a one-act play.

586
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,536
You know that she's the chair of
several charitable foundations.

587
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,554
One of those foundations
is having a benefit

588
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,889
at the Guggenheim Saturday.

589
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,391
And Mr. Popper will be present.

590
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,642
I figured it out.

591
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,269
She's looking for somebody
with integrity and character.

592
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,146
Somebody like Jimmy Stewart.

593
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,273
And, doggone it,

594
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,552
that's exactly what I'm going to be.

595
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,112
I'll use my own voice, though.

596
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,572
Although, that was uncanny.
Come on, give it to me.

597
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,783
We expect some results, Popper.

598
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,937
And until we get them, you can keep
your name off my marble slab.

599
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,274
A man your age shouldn't be
talking about marble slabs.

600
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,317
I got this.

601
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,695
Penguins, Pippi. Talk to me.

602
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,090
Per your predicament,
I printed a pertinent page from Wikipedia.

603
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,217
"Gentoo penguins
may periodically imprint

604
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,928
"on a particular person
as if they were a penguin.

605
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,682
"Once imprinted, they remain permanently
proximate to their parental proxy".

606
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,167
Is it actually written that way?

607
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,102
I'm paraphrasing.

608
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,462
They're imprinting, all right.

609
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,009
"Uncanny tracking ability.
Can locate each other at great distance".

610
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,219
- What about keeping them in line?
- Next paragraph.

611
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,098
"Are more docile
when kept at lower temperatures".

612
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,600
Hmm.

613
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,288
Cold enough for you?
Glad you're comfortable. Ow!

614
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,650
Hey! This is a finger, this is a fish.
Learn to tell the difference.

615
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,796
Hey, kids.

616
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,449
It's nice, huh? A little fresh air.

617
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,634
It's not bad if you keep moving.

618
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,703
Captain, Bitey, Stinky!

619
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,290
Penguins need it cold,
otherwise they get wing mange.

620
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,892
Dad, are you okay?

621
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,144
Yeah. Never better.

622
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,812
Let's take the penguins to the park.

623
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,065
Billy, no. What if they run off?

624
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,382
Ah.

625
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,677
You know, maybe they are
a little cooped-up in here.

626
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,160
Boy! Look at all this space.

627
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,621
Makes you want to spread out and explore.

628
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,481
Get lost for a while.

629
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:07,104
Flight envy? Really?
That's hilarious.

630
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,382
I hate to break it to you, Captain,
but those are fins.

631
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:14,052
I think you might be more fish
than fowl.

632
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,695
Hey, Dad, heads-up!

633
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,808
Oh! I see how it's going to be.
All right. Let's see what you got, Billy.

634
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,522
Come on, Janie. Come on.
Let's get a game going.

635
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,624
Thanks, but no thanks.

636
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,417
- Aw! Come on.
- Let's go.

637
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,546
Little Popper over to Big Popper.
Looking for the flick-on.

638
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,672
Pass it. Pass it.

639
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,884
Back to Little... Nimrod blocks it.
Over to Loudy, who dribbles it.

640
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,052
Ah!

641
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,178
Flagrant flatulation.

642
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,555
Could be a yellow card.

643
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,042
Lovey controls, beaks it over to Billy,
who bends it like Bitey.

644
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,504
Uh-oh. Better pick it up. Come on, Janie.

645
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,482
What are you afraid of?
Can't beat an old man?

646
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,611
"O-M-G, I'm too A-D-D to play with D-A-D.

647
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,929
"Frowny face".

648
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,724
Fine.

649
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,642
All right!

650
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,120
You know,
I heard that girls are the weaker sex.

651
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,313
Didn't you hear that, Billy?

652
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,981
Yeah.

653
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,941
Are you okay?

654
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,051
Sorry, Dad.

655
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,428
It really was an accident.

656
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,805
Yeah, I get it. You both have power shots.

657
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,098
Mr. Popper.

658
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,684
Hey, guess what? I got new contact lenses,

659
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,436
I.E. I can see more now,

660
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,673
I.E...
I can still see your six illegal pets.

661
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,928
Are we cool now, Hawkeye?
Let's go, kids.

662
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,234
Hey, everybody. I found him in the lobby.

663
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,736
Oh, oops.

664
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,215
I figured it was like
that time you lost Janie at Macy's.

665
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,491
You lost me?

666
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,967
You were never lost.

667
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,595
I simply failed to maintain visual contact.

668
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,747
It was less than an hour.

669
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,312
They are liking it here.

670
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,856
- Do you want to keep them overnight?
- Really?

671
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,149
- Yeah.
- Cool.

672
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,301
And Rick and I are celebrating.

673
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,029
- You got the grant.
- Yes.

674
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,240
Wow. I'm really happy for you.

675
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,474
Thank you.

676
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,977
You know, I was planning on having them
stay at Mom's when we're in Ghana.

677
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,331
You're actually going to Ghana, then.

678
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,999
Just for three weeks.

679
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,669
Maybe they could spend
a few nights with you.

680
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,338
Hey, kids. Do you want
to stay the night with your dad?

681
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,422
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

682
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,408
- Okay.
- All right.

683
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,679
- Good night.
- Good night, Mom.

684
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,763
Good night, Mommy.

685
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,917
Good night.

686
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,132
You, too, Loudy.

687
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

688
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,556
You like Mom.

689
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,142
I do not.

690
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,122
I mean, I like her.
I don't know if she likes me.

691
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,232
Does she talk about me?

692
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,984
You're acting weird.

693
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,029
Look, this is my favorite part, right here.

694
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,640
Mr. Popper, I purchased
the special champagne per your request.

695
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,310
Good. Everything needs to be clockwork
at the Guggenheim.

696
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,228
This could be our last chance
with Van Gundy.

697
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,938
And should I be procuring a babysitter?

698
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,232
Yeahbsolutely.

699
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,068
So we're talking standard hours.
A little light housekeeping.

700
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,697
And you might want to do that coat up,
you'll catch your death in there.

701
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,782
But as far as the...

702
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,143
When you're taking care of...

703
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,620
Just plunk them in front of the TV.

704
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,955
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

705
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,540
So, should we meet the kids?

706
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,734
Sure. Yeah. Come on over.

707
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,903
Here they are.

708
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,052
So you will be home by 10:00?

709
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,970
At the latest.

710
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,373
Just keep the Chaplin movies going,
they'll zone right out.

711
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,455
Hello, Mr. Popper.

712
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,689
How are they doing?

713
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,460
You are worried like a new mother.
It is adorable.

714
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,879
Yeah, I know. Okay, turning my phone off.

715
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,989
Okay. Good night.

716
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,657
I'm hearing shrieking, cackling
and trumpeting sounds

717
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,033
coming from that apartment.

718
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,577
Now, either Mr. Popper
is hanging out with my mother,

719
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,454
or I'm losing my mind.

720
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,289
No, you're definitely...

721
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,917
I am telling you
that man is up to something.

722
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,379
I hear the pitter-patter of floppy feet
coming from inside that apartment.

723
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,839
I feel like I can hear them now.

724
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,965
Sorry, Kent.

725
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,701
As far as I'm concerned,
Mr. Popper is an ideal tenant.

726
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,490
Bubbly. Where is the target?

727
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,560
Up there,
proximate to the Pissarro painting.

728
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,854
You look pretty.

729
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,218
- So, she never did see the flowers...
- Mrs. Van Gundy...

730
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,820
What a pleasant surprise.

731
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,182
Mr. Popper. I wish I could say the same.

732
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,394
You're dry. I like that. Oh, please.

733
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,397
Mrs. Van Gundy only drinks Krug.

734
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,070
Oh, yeah!

735
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,425
May I?

736
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,762
1992? It's a ghastly vintage.

737
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,555
I'll take the free stuff.

738
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,933
- Selma!
- Oh, Terrence.

739
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,936
Congratulations, Selma.
Everything is impeccable.

740
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,437
Oh, thank you.

741
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,148
"1992. Ghastly vintage".

742
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,274
"I'll take the free stuff".

743
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,884
"Terrence!"

744
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,185
Stay in the game.

745
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,803
Mmm. I bet there's a giant
sentence somewhere,

746
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,304
looking for an ending.

747
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:42,600
Mr. Popper, if you're trying to convince me
to sell you the Tavern,

748
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,103
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

749
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,647
Let's not talk about the Tavern,
because that's not why I'm here.

750
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,815
Mrs. Van Gundy,

751
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,217
you want to know what I'm worth.
I get that.

752
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,989
Mr. Popper, this is the
premier cultural event of the season.

753
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,158
I've organized this evening very precisely

754
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,913
and I can't have anything disrupting it,
especially you.

755
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,249
Now, one might think
you would have realized that by now.

756
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,750
Oh!

757
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,379
Wow! What a beautiful piece of music
they're playing down there.

758
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,298
May I have this dance, down there?

759
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,492
You're tenacious, Popper.
I'll give you that.

760
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,136
I hope you can keep up with me.

761
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,764
Yeah, well, let's hurry. We're missing it.

762
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,708
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

763
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,425
- Are those penguins?
- Hmm. Must be part of the exhibit.

764
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,395
What is that noise?

765
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,048
- Popper!
- It's nothing. Stay focused.

766
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,281
Get it off me!

767
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,552
Who is responsible for this?

768
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,596
My money is on her.

769
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,791
Is this some kind
of environmentalist protest?

770
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,090
This is disgraceful!
Don't lie to me.

771
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,509
Huh?

772
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,097
Ah.

773
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,789
I don't like you,
I don't need you,

774
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,390
I don't want you in my life!

775
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,982
Come on.

776
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,299
This guy is a complete amateur.

777
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,661
I just got to pick my moment,
then make my move.

778
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,957
Pippi,
the Guggenheim was a fiasco.

779
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,560
Get me another meeting with Van Gundy.

780
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,811
Pronto.

781
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,671
I was going to say that.

782
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,401
Hey, Dad, come play hide and seek.
Captain's "it".

783
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,845
I'm still not speaking to them.

784
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,057
What? What happened?

785
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,786
Nothing. I'm fine. Billy, it's time to go.

786
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,330
- Janie, what happened?
- I said I'm fine.

787
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,499
Hey, I know I kind of blew it before,

788
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,501
but I'm actually pretty good
at giving advice.

789
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,986
Mom is here. We've got to go.

790
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,966
Janie, come on. I want to help.

791
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,243
Really? Fine. Here it is.

792
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,221
Madison broke up with Cooper Keegan
to go out with Brandon Yee.

793
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,598
- Brandy.
- So Cooper texted Brittany to see

794
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,433
if I was going to the Snowball Dance.

795
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:15,296
And she is all, "No, she's not going,"
so now I look all desperate and dumb.

796
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,440
So, great, right?

797
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,567
Cooper is gonna ask me
to the Snowball Dance, but he never calls.

798
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,570
And now Brittany's telling everybody that
Madison kissed him in the third period.

799
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,399
But then I hear
that Brittany likes him, too,

800
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,700
so I don't know what to think!

801
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,201
So there it is. What do you got, Dad?

802
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,369
Well, who is Brittany again?

803
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,873
Brittany is Madison's BFF.

804
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,816
Madison's Big Fat Friend. Got it.

805
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,487
Janie! Hold on, hold on. Janie.

806
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,884
Look, sweetheart.
Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.

807
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,495
Don't waste your tears.
There's going to be a lot of other guys.

808
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,141
I mean, you're going to go through this
over and over.

809
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,935
By the time you're my age,

810
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,854
you're not even going to remember
Keaven Coover.

811
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,047
Coover Keeven?

812
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,857
Kee... Coover...

813
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,192
Keiver Coover?

814
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,819
So just forget about it and move on?

815
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,136
Exactly.

816
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,889
Great, thanks. I feel much better.

817
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,412
It's good advice.

818
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,957
You know what,
maybe she doesn't want advice.

819
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,859
Maybe she just wants you
to be her dad and listen.

820
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,070
But what if my advice is amazing?

821
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,047
Good night, Popper.

822
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,907
It's a shame to waste it.

823
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:30,888
Madison kissed Keeper Coogan.
No, Cooper. Cooper!

824
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,265
Kissed Cooper...

825
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,725
What? I can't get 30 seconds
of privacy around here?

826
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,019
What do you want? Fish? Chaplin?

827
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,981
I'm not supposed to guess,
I'm just supposed to listen.

828
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,276
All right, I'm listening.
Come on, smart guy, what is it?

829
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,694
What do you wonk?

830
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,476
Not fair.

831
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,603
Come on.

832
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,605
Oh!

833
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,749
Did I do that? Hey!

834
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,126
Hey!

835
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,213
Is that what you were trying to tell me?

836
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,466
Hey, anybody else want to try? Come on.

837
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,471
You look full. Open the bomb bay doors!

838
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,622
Whoa!

839
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,668
That is some good...

840
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,965
Stay! Stay!

841
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,471
Or come.

842
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,129
Dear Lord, thank you for
the food we are about to eat.

843
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:50,134
Please use your mighty power
to stop the melting of the polar ice caps.

844
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,494
Amen.

845
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,253
Could you pass the salt? I'll get it.

846
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:15,034
Hey, kids. Check this out.

847
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,495
Everybody ready?

848
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:22,375
And, shuffle, ball, step.
Shuffle, ball, lunge.

849
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,878
Step, ball, change. Step, ball, change.
Step, ball, change.

850
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,154
Word!

851
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,341
And the Tony goes to Mamma Mia!

852
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,843
Because somebody didn't show up
for rehearsals.

853
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,428
Not mentioning names.

854
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,888
Nimrod.

855
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,973
That's awesome.

856
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,707
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

857
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,293
Good job, you guys.

858
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,506
Whatever it is, I'm here for you, sweetie.

859
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,276
Relax, it's no big deal.

860
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,196
But Cooper Keegan just asked me
to the Snowball Dance.

861
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,781
Cooper Keegan!

862
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,349
Oh, my gosh. I need a dress.

863
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,644
OMG. LGB1.

864
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,997
- What?
- Oh, my God. Let's go buy one.

865
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,707
You mean you?

866
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,941
Yeahbsolutely.

867
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,651
Okay.

868
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,763
Dad, I look terrible in all of these.

869
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,765
Well, I would love to see one of them.

870
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,809
I tell you what,
whatever you've got on right now,

871
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,187
just bring it on out to the viewing area
so we can view it.

872
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,380
Fine.

873
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,492
Wow. You actually look beautiful.

874
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,578
Yeah, right.

875
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,937
Dad?

876
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,608
You're an angel.

877
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,443
Shut up.

878
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,675
I made that.

879
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,093
What?

880
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,620
I'll tell you about it later.

881
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,139
- Hi, birds.
- Hi, birds.

882
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,208
Let me get you a snack.

883
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,469
OMG.

884
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,473
Dad!

885
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:25,915
No.

886
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,067
No!

887
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,861
Lovey.

888
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,425
Eggs?

889
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,202
So, baby penguins?

890
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,971
Baby penguins!

891
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,456
Or a three-penguin omelet.

892
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,832
- Dad!
- Mmm!

893
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,147
- Amanda.
- Hello?

894
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,423
You got to come over.

895
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,347
- Hey.
- Oh. You brought Rick.

896
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,826
Yeah, we were on a date. Be nice.

897
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,871
Hey. Wow. Greetings, little friend.

898
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,148
Hey. What's your name?

899
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,692
Ow!

900
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,528
Rick, Bitey. Bitey, Rick.

901
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,172
Hey.

902
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,865
Who's this fella?

903
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,677
Stinky.

904
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,912
- That's his way of saying "Greetings".
- Yeah.

905
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,377
Hey, you know what?
I'll meet you in the car.

906
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,063
Come on, you got to see this. Come on.

907
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,482
What... What am I looking at? What...

908
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,718
Just a miracle, that's all.

909
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,739
- Hold on, is that...
- Eggs. Three of them.

910
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,074
- Wow.
- Yeah.

911
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,267
Amazing.

912
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,537
Hey, look who is a new dad again. Huh?

913
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,621
It's really kind of cool.

914
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:50,207
They use those stones to make their nest.

915
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,567
Really?

916
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,462
Nimrod hasn't quite figured it out yet.

917
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,756
Yeah, but look. He's so attentive.

918
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,384
They have to separate
for long periods of time

919
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,036
just to find fish.

920
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,287
Hmm.

921
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,539
It must be kind of hard on them. Huh?

922
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,584
They always get back together, though.

923
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,728
That's nice.

924
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,605
It's natural.

925
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,316
Mom, Dad wants to know
if you'll have dinner with him.

926
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,401
- What?
- Billy, I don't know if that's...

927
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,428
Mom, just do it.

928
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,057
What do you think of this shirt?

929
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,868
Does it make me look pale?

930
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,828
I know they are.
It's a little cold in here.

931
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,080
How dare you?

932
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,357
Oh.

933
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:35,402
Nice. You were going to let me
go out like that. Some friend you are.

934
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,505
I got a reservation at Jean-Georges,

935
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:42,635
which is almost impossible
unless you're dating The Donald.

936
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,453
Which I am not willing to do.

937
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,599
Are you guys going to be okay?
Not that I don't trust you.

938
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,059
I just worry, that's all.

939
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,356
Pipperoni.

940
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,524
Mr. Popper,
Van Gundy phoned...

941
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,610
requesting your presence
at the property in the park.

942
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,654
- Now?
- Please be punctual.

943
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,971
Okay, tell her I'll be there.

944
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,075
I guess I'll kill two birds
with one stone.

945
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,521
It's a metaphor.

946
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,443
Uh...

947
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,239
Yeah, we'd prefer to sit over here. Yeah.

948
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,578
Thank you.

949
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,997
Oh, thanks.

950
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,710
Are you looking for someone?

951
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,523
No. Just taking in
the ambience of the room.

952
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,857
It hasn't changed in 30 years.

953
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,301
It's got sort of a decaying charm.

954
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,367
- Okay, what is it with that table?
- What?

955
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,286
You look like you've seen a ghost.

956
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,079
No, I'm fine.

957
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,481
Thom, it's me.

958
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,962
My dad used to bring me here
whenever he was home.

959
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,380
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

960
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,007
That was our table.

961
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,467
He used to give me these souvenirs
he'd bring

962
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,078
from his incredible adventures on the road.

963
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,666
It was about the only time
I ever got to see him.

964
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,002
Thanks, Dad.

965
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,731
It's actually a good memory.

966
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,008
Sometimes they're the worst.

967
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,863
We were married for 15 years,

968
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,764
and you have never told me that.

969
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,141
Hmm.

970
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,519
You are a complicated man, Mr. Popper.

971
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,209
I don't know.

972
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,777
I think this old place has still got it.

973
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,923
Where are we going?

974
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,468
That's for me to know
and you to find adorable.

975
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,635
Oh, really?

976
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,870
Yes.

977
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,335
Right, left.
Right, left. Right.

978
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,439
Well, we're out of the medals.
But we had a good time.

979
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,965
Nice trick.

980
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,570
I can't believe we're doing this.

981
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,989
I brought a girl here
once, a long time ago.

982
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,742
It was closed,
so we broke in and stole skates.

983
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,285
She sounds amazing.

984
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,745
I thought so.

985
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:19,500
Then she got on the ice,
and she was kind of a clutz.

986
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,460
I think she was just trying to impress you.

987
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,878
You remember the boathouse?

988
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,780
Oh, the boathouse.

989
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,367
- Yeah, it was surprisingly warm in there.
- Yes, it was.

990
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,953
- Yeah.
- Yep.

991
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,721
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

992
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,146
I don't know what happened there.

993
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,757
I think we just hit a rough patch.

994
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,094
I'll race you.

995
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,435
That's good, you got it.

996
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,939
Want some more? Want some more?

997
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,667
- You let him in?
- He had a badge.

998
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,944
- A badge from the zoo.
- Look at this.

999
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,338
Hey! Step away from the penguins.

1000
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,549
These birds have eggs, Mr. Popper.

1001
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,175
They need a full veterinary workup.

1002
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,969
Yeah? Well, if I get worked up,

1003
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,847
you're going to need a workup of your face.

1004
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,265
Really?

1005
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,393
You've got some interesting ideas
about animal care, Mr. Popper.

1006
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,353
You stick them in front of the TV?

1007
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,814
Yeah. Chaplin. A classic.

1008
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,234
You've got one nesting
in the produce bin of your refrigerator.

1009
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,346
Just shows what you know.
That's a cheese drawer.

1010
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,600
Fish fillet sandwich with tartar sauce?

1011
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,743
Is this your idea of a healthy animal diet?

1012
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,521
Ooh! Evidence! Call CSI.

1013
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,832
You planted this.

1014
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,109
You have no idea
what you're doing with these birds.

1015
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,694
Like you're some kind of penguin expert.

1016
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,739
I am a penguin expert.

1017
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,700
Yeah, but... Yeah, okay.

1018
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:55,804
It's time for me to take these birds
and put them in a proper home.

1019
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,473
You aren't giving them what they need.

1020
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,601
I am giving them exactly what they need.

1021
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,019
What? What are you giving them?

1022
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,712
I am giving them love.

1023
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,339
Love?

1024
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,399
Well, it sounds weird
when you make me say it.

1025
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,694
These aren't children, Mr. Popper.
They're animals.

1026
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,571
They need food. They need snow.

1027
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,574
And every once in a while,
one of them needs to be eaten by a whale.

1028
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,034
Hey!

1029
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,660
You want to know who they love?

1030
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,370
I'll tell you who they love.

1031
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,814
Whoever is holding the fish.

1032
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,992
Traitors.

1033
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,095
Wake up, Popper.

1034
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,432
These penguins can only survive
in the zoo or Antarctica.

1035
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,710
So, sooner or later,
I will take these penguins.

1036
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,922
Omega-3s, Pip.

1037
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,857
Penguins are way ahead of us on this.

1038
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,067
Mr. Popper, I'm perplexed.

1039
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,152
How does this pertain
to the Van Gundy problem?

1040
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,905
Van Gundy? Lots of that. Lots of that.

1041
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,448
Please tell me you have a plan.

1042
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,725
I always have a plan, Pippi.

1043
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,370
They're fresh.

1044
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,831
Oh, really? Why do I smell bleach?

1045
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,500
Mr. Popper,
we're being pressed for progress.

1046
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,443
Perhaps I could pamper the penguins
for you.

1047
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,337
You need to procure your promotion.

1048
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:14,032
No, Pippi.
What we need is squid, and plenty of them.

1049
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,010
The weather outside is frightful

1050
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,954
The fire is so delightful

1051
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,974
Since there's no place to go

1052
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,627
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

1053
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,814
Oh! Good morning, kids.
Babies on the way.

1054
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,090
Got to get ready.

1055
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,928
Young Gentoos need an ice shelf
at 28 degrees. A little powder on top.

1056
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,264
That's right. I'm kind of a penguin expert.

1057
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,765
Oh!

1058
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,493
Hey, not in the house, young lady.

1059
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,289
Besides, when you pack this stuff down,
you could really hurt somebody.

1060
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,232
Come on, let's get him, Billy!

1061
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,241
You're begging for it.

1062
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,761
Here, hold on.
Look how much can go in this hat!

1063
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,388
Look how much can go in this hat!

1064
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,539
Ah!

1065
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,099
Uh-oh!

1066
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,459
Grab a pen, Popper.

1067
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,670
I'm going to hook you up with the number
of a very good moving company.

1068
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,714
Ow!

1069
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,802
- Hey.
- Wow.

1070
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,846
I think I hear your mama calling.

1071
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,223
Kent! Kent!

1072
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,036
You're only delaying the
inevitable, Popper.

1073
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,896
I'll be telling the board about this.

1074
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,153
Kids, wake up.
You don't want to miss this.

1075
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,030
What are we doing?

1076
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,615
Shh!

1077
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:44,873
Wow. Cool.

1078
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,508
POPPER: Here it comes.

1079
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,511
- It's coming.
- Look at that.

1080
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,312
- Dad, look.
- Yeah.

1081
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,123
- Holy cow, another one.
- Look, look, look.

1082
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,108
It's another one.

1083
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,278
Reminds me of you guys.

1084
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,978
Rangers on a breakaway!
They're out in the open ice.

1085
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,398
Crosby! There's nothing but daylight!

1086
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,758
- No way.
- Can Crosby back-check? Back-check!

1087
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,803
- Oh! Sorry.
- Hey, Dad.

1088
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,973
- I got your number, okay?
- Ooh! I'm so scared.

1089
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,245
Mom.

1090
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,205
The place is coming together, huh?

1091
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,439
Or apart.

1092
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,377
Captain's still waiting to be a dad, huh?

1093
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:59,631
Mom. Yeah, that's right.
A woman can be a captain.

1094
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,633
We don't tolerate gender
bias in this house.

1095
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,536
- Really?
- Cross-checking is okay, though.

1096
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,017
- Five minutes for fighting.
- Oh, man.

1097
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,728
You promise to call me when it hatches.

1098
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,671
Promise. Any day now.

1099
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,348
Don't worry, Captain.

1100
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,493
The little fella is just taking his time.

1101
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,853
And I bet he'll be a great flyer.

1102
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,249
You're falling asleep.

1103
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,775
No, I'm not.

1104
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,861
Hmm. It must be me.

1105
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,464
You really should go to bed.

1106
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,615
Uh-uh.

1107
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,993
I'm not leaving him. He's a Popper.

1108
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,415
Good night.

1109
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,654
Oh! Hey, guys.

1110
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,198
We've left seven messages.

1111
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,783
You look terrible, Popper.

1112
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,201
We haven't heard anything
about the Tavern.

1113
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,537
- What have you been doing?
- Uh. Well... Um...

1114
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,373
I'm sure Pippi told you,
I've been kind of fighting a cold.

1115
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,541
Pneumonia.

1116
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,860
Move!

1117
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,463
What the...

1118
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,342
If I'd have known you guys were
coming, I'd have cleaned this place up,

1119
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,994
fired up the old Zamboni.

1120
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,207
The maid comes on Wednesdays.

1121
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,187
He's gone insane.

1122
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,271
I've seen this before.

1123
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,215
This is exactly what happened
with Howard Hughes.

1124
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,858
Because you're old.

1125
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,009
Popper.

1126
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,444
The Tavern?

1127
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,196
Oh! The Tavern.

1128
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,556
The Tavern is an interesting project.

1129
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,992
I have lots of ideas about the Tavern.

1130
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,995
For God's sakes, man!
Pull yourself together.

1131
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,106
Your house is full of penguins.

1132
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,459
I know. I know.

1133
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,002
I know how it looks.

1134
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,587
But it's just one more egg.

1135
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,131
And as soon as it hatches, I'm there.

1136
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,884
Franklin, how long have I worked for you?

1137
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,803
You know how many soccer games
I've skipped?

1138
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,680
And dance recitals?

1139
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,248
What are we doing this for, anyway?

1140
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,088
There are just some things
you can't afford to miss.

1141
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,343
It's too late, we've lost him.
Popper, you're fired.

1142
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,804
Okay.

1143
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,852
Best of luck
in your future endeavors, Popper.

1144
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:36,813
Appreciate it.

1145
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,312
Hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch!

1146
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,165
Hatch, hatch, hatch!
Hatch, hatch, hatch!

1147
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:24,169
Okay, it's going to happen.
I feel it. It's happening.

1148
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,338
It's happening right now.
It's happening right now.

1149
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,964
I'm going to give it the touch.

1150
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,383
Total belief. Total faith.

1151
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:31,785
Come on.

1152
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,668
Wow.

1153
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,728
Mmm.

1154
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,536
I tried to warn you, Mr. Popper.

1155
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,205
You're just not equipped for this.

1156
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,210
Maybe you should let me
take care of them for a while.

1157
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:52,073
What if the Statue of Liberty

1158
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,450
had a friend?

1159
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,161
Okay, people!

1160
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,263
No more loafing around.

1161
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,431
What's the matter, folks?

1162
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,307
You've never seen a zombie before?

1163
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:05,770
That's right, it's the Dawn of the Dead.
I'm eating brains and taking names.

1164
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,772
Marshall, get Zoning on the phone,

1165
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,524
I want to know
how soon we can break ground.

1166
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,569
Remind them of our donation
to the Mayor's re-election fund.

1167
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,363
Boy, I never get tired
of looking at New York from here.

1168
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,723
I love what you've done with the place.

1169
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,700
Popper, what are you doing here?

1170
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,953
I'm on a mission of mercy, Franklin.
I decided to take you back.

1171
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,063
You're taking us back? We fired you.

1172
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,207
All is forgiven then, don't worry about it.

1173
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,792
Let me bring you up to speed.

1174
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,961
I've been playing hardball with Van Gundy.

1175
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,197
I told her kids
we were offering $100 million.

1176
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:36,451
I suggested they make her life difficult
until she accepts,

1177
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,303
so they've all moved back home.

1178
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,555
Mrs. Van Gundy has planned
a press conference for tomorrow.

1179
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,207
She wants us all present.

1180
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,791
If you'll excuse us,

1181
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,960
we have to unpack.

1182
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,255
Popper's back!

1183
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,316
Oh, hey, guys!

1184
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,650
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

1185
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,194
Hey, how are you feeling?

1186
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,612
Yeah, Dad, are you okay?

1187
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,155
Yeah, I'm fine.

1188
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,407
Before you go in there,

1189
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,977
I think I should tell you,
there has been a couple of changes.

1190
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,463
Where are they?

1191
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,174
They're okay, they're fine.
They're at the zoo.

1192
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,243
And you know what?
It's really the best place for them.

1193
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,803
They're probably in an icy pool right now.

1194
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,764
All the fish they can eat.
Full-time penguin masseuse.

1195
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,291
The whole thing's being narrated
by Morgan Freeman.

1196
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,377
You sent them away to some cage?

1197
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:32,065
Billy, they're birds.
They don't feel things the way we do.

1198
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,817
- Thom, I don't think...
- Don't bother, Mom.

1199
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,527
Come on, guys.

1200
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,404
We had fun,
but it's time to get back to reality.

1201
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,573
We got soccer.
We got the Snowball Dance.

1202
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,643
I'm not going
to the stupid Snowball Dance.

1203
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,521
Cooper Keegan asked somebody else.

1204
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,999
Janie,

1205
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,693
sometimes boys are gonna disappoint you.

1206
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,196
I'm not disappointed in him.

1207
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,615
Janie!

1208
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,054
What was I supposed to do?

1209
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,681
How about feel something?

1210
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:05,873
Oh!

1211
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,559
Please.

1212
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,377
I feel great.

1213
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,730
I saw you with that egg. I saw you!

1214
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:14,190
That wasn't me.

1215
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,651
That was a dream
where people live with penguins.

1216
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,678
And their kids love them.
And all the eggs hatch.

1217
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,388
So wake up!

1218
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,016
Wow.

1219
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,062
I think I just did.

1220
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:34,068
And Rick wanted to extend the Ghana trip,
turn it into a vacation.

1221
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,654
Are you okay with that, Popper?

1222
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,658
Yeahbsolutely.

1223
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,323
Pipsi-Cola.

1224
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,575
Mr. Popper, we're pulling up presently.

1225
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,809
Okay.

1226
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:12,774
Come on.

1227
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,466
My dearest Tommy,

1228
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,151
in all my travels...

1229
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:44,155
I've never encountered
a creature quite so wise as this.

1230
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:47,141
You see, once it loves you,
it never leaves your side.

1231
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:52,121
I'm sorry, Son, that it took me so long
to learn that lesson.

1232
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,999
But I hope there's still time for you.

1233
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,627
Give your little ones a hug from Grandpa.

1234
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:01,781
And hold them as close as you can
for as long as you can.

1235
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,909
Bald Eagle, over and out.

1236
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,523
All right, everybody in. Let's go.

1237
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,801
We don't want to go
to your stupid press conference.

1238
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,680
- We're not going to the press conference.
- Pardon?

1239
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,783
- Driver, take us to the zoo.
- What?

1240
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,702
We're getting our penguins back.

1241
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,186
- Yes!
- Yes!

1242
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,753
Mr. Popper,

1243
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,822
late as usual.

1244
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,508
Call him.

1245
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,701
Who?

1246
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,995
Cooper-freaking-Keegan.

1247
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,305
But, Dad...

1248
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,973
Sweetie, you've got to put
your heart out there.

1249
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,101
And it might get broken,
but that's how you know you have one.

1250
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,294
Call him.

1251
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,714
Dad, I don't even really like him any more.

1252
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,508
I just got the name down.

1253
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,051
But thanks.

1254
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,138
- Call her.
- Who?

1255
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,098
Mom-freaking-Mom.

1256
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,992
I don't really like her any more.

1257
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,060
I'm kidding. Give me that.

1258
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,573
Hold on. Sorry.

1259
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,924
Hey, Janie. What's up?

1260
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,118
Amanda, hi. Look,

1261
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:35,500
I know this is a total Hail Mary,
but please don't go to Ghana.

1262
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,686
Thom, are you kidding me right now?

1263
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:42,398
If you go there with him,
then it becomes a relationship, and...

1264
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,984
I'm not asking for you
to just jump right back in with me.

1265
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:46,636
I just want one more date.

1266
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,972
Just stay
and go on one more date with me.

1267
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,060
Please.

1268
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,398
Long pauses are good, right?
It means she's thinking.

1269
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,628
Where are you going to take me
this time, Popper?

1270
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,488
Another landmark
you're planning to tear down?

1271
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,715
No.

1272
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,910
The kids and I are going
to visit some old friends.

1273
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,900
Two children, one adult.

1274
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,151
Make that two adults.

1275
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,903
Mom! Yes!

1276
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:32,139
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It's just a second date.

1277
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,742
And it better be a good one.

1278
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,827
Yeah, absolutely.

1279
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,645
Okay, here we go.

1280
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,985
Okay, guys, we're here to get you

1281
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,611
out.

1282
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,588
They're not here.

1283
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,906
These aren't our guys.

1284
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,200
No, they're not.

1285
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,163
- Where are my penguins?
- I'm going to call you back.

1286
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,684
Mr. Popper, they're not your penguins.

1287
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,520
Don't give us the runaround, slick.
Why aren't they out there?

1288
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,064
Because we already have penguins.

1289
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,858
What we don't have is an emu.

1290
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,010
Or a Komodo dragon.

1291
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,695
Or a Bengal tiger.

1292
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,281
- What are you talking about?
- Trading, Mr. Popper.

1293
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,576
Zoos do it all the time.
Same as sports teams.

1294
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,036
How do you think the Yankees won
27 championships?

1295
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,329
It sure wasn't their farm system.

1296
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,622
Where are you sending them?

1297
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:26,002
Three to Washington, three to Tokyo.
And the two chicks are going to Dubai.

1298
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,296
But you can't split them up.
They're a family.

1299
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,032
God's sake! They're just birds.

1300
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:34,177
Just birds?
And what about the American eagle?

1301
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,412
- Is that just a bird?
- Yes.

1302
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,040
Okay, what about...

1303
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,892
Big Bird is a Muppet.

1304
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,226
Look, can they just see them?

1305
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:45,463
My family is torn up about it.
My kids are distraught. Right, Billy?

1306
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,091
Please, sir, can we just say goodbye?

1307
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,135
- No.
- Children,

1308
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,847
this is what a liar looks like.
Take a mental picture.

1309
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,017
Look, Popper,
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

1310
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,952
They're already gone.

1311
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,747
- Loudy!
- Loudy!

1312
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,332
You are a liar.

1313
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,900
Popper! Popper!

1314
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,418
- There you are!
- Guys!

1315
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,337
Get back in there. Ow!

1316
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,113
Bitey! Good job.

1317
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:14,091
Mr. Popper,
those penguins are going back in the tank.

1318
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,259
No, they're not.

1319
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,287
What do we have here?
Anybody want some fish?

1320
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,014
That's right. Come on in.

1321
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,500
Come on, come on, come on. Hey!

1322
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,460
Not this time.

1323
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,026
Do you have some kind of a plan?

1324
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,445
I'm sorry, have we met?

1325
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,596
Come on.

1326
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,598
Let me out!

1327
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,702
- What took you so long?
- Sorry, sir.

1328
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,397
Sir, what do the suspects look like?

1329
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,290
Hmm, uh, let me think.

1330
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,859
They're the ones with the eight penguins.

1331
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,486
Now seal all the exits!

1332
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,380
You guys have the babies, right?

1333
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,631
Yeah, Mom, we got them.

1334
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,634
Excuse us!
Avian infectious disease containment!

1335
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,970
- Antarctic bird flu!
- Very bad!

1336
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,305
- Diarrhea! Vomiting!
- Vomiting! Diarrhea!

1337
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,598
You might want to hold your breath.

1338
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:04,291
Thank you for your co-operation.

1339
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,835
This way.

1340
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,188
- Oh, no!
- Or that way.

1341
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:10,940
Come on, guys.
Follow me. Follow me.

1342
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,008
Okay, try to act normal.

1343
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,594
Go! Go!

1344
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,288
I'll get him on this side. This way!

1345
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,501
Get him! Don't let him in the elevator.
He's heading to the roof.

1346
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,981
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry, ma'am, you can't take this exit.

1347
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,758
No, not this way.

1348
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,367
It's the north side exit,
you can't go this way.

1349
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,536
Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience.

1350
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,232
Hey, miss? Miss!

1351
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:11,776
All right.

1352
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:14,879
Nice and neat formation.

1353
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
Okay, stay in formation.

1354
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,842
Remain calm.

1355
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,219
- What happened?
- I was pricked by a porcupine.

1356
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,221
- Where were you pricked?
- In my posterior!

1357
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:25,389
I don't know where that is.

1358
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:27,516
There's the limo. Just stay in formation.

1359
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,043
I'm at the rear door,
he's not there!

1360
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,462
- Hey!
- Break formation!

1361
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,756
- Popper!
- Break formation!

1362
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,342
Halt!

1363
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,782
Ha-ha! You lose, slave trader!

1364
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,660
I don't think so, Popper.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1365
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,411
No, I don't think I'm forgetting something.

1366
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:50,164
Thom, we forgot to do a head count.

1367
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,791
Okay, one thing I forgot.

1368
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,150
We got him on the roof!

1369
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:00,908
Captain!

1370
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,059
Captain! No!

1371
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,262
She's doing it.

1372
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,934
Captain is flying!

1373
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,464
Whoa!

1374
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:42,199
Can you believe that?

1375
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,135
Hey!

1376
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,637
Why are you hitting yourself? Huh?
Why are you hitting yourself?

1377
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:48,806
That's not attractive
for a zoo official. Huh?

1378
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,082
I'll tell you what.

1379
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,546
Now you're trapped like an animal.
It's ironic.

1380
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:57,940
Hey! Don't...

1381
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,174
Come back here!

1382
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,444
Did you see that?

1383
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,821
- Pretty good date so far.
- We're just getting started.

1384
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,514
Driver, Tavern on the Green.

1385
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:09,101
Hold on, boss. Hold on, I got it.

1386
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:13,272
Hey, hey! Stop!

1387
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:20,671
There have been
a lot of rumors floating around lately,

1388
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,406
and I'm here to clear them up.

1389
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:26,135
I have always said
that I would only sell the Tavern...

1390
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,430
if I found the right person.

1391
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,391
And that's why I'm here to announce...

1392
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:35,711
Wait!

1393
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,089
Don't

1394
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,317
do...

1395
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:44,219
it!

1396
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,907
Did you like that? The slow motion effect.

1397
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,742
I just wanted to get your attention.

1398
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,369
Mrs. Van Gundy, you can't sell this place.

1399
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:53,972
- I know.
- If you sell it to me,

1400
01:19:53,973 --> 01:19:54,873
I'll just tear it down.

1401
01:19:54,973 --> 01:19:56,665
And then Freddy and Tito and Klaus,

1402
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,084
and the guy that looks like Chef Boyardee
will be out on the street.

1403
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:01,879
- I know.
- This place is a part of New York history.

1404
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,674
It's a part of my history.
I came here with my father.

1405
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:09,220
The other day I had the best
second first date a man could ever have.

1406
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:13,224
And I would rather cut my hands off
and stick knives in my eyes than...

1407
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,101
Wait, I'd have to do the eyes first
and then the hands,

1408
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:18,062
and I'd have to have somebody
help me cut the right hand off

1409
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,190
- because the left hand would be gone.
- Mr. Popper, stop talking.

1410
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,067
- Okay.
- I'm not selling.

1411
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,235
You're not?

1412
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,386
Mmm-mmm.

1413
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,197
Glad we got dressed up.

1414
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,032
There he is.

1415
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,744
Excuse me, folks.
Nat Jones, New York Zoo.

1416
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:36,038
This man has been trafficking
in stolen penguins.

1417
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,375
What are you even talking
about from left field?

1418
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,627
Penguins?

1419
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,320
It's absurd.

1420
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:47,449
No, no, no! Penguins, please!

1421
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,595
Hi, Pip. I thought you were
going to stay in the car.

1422
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:53,038
They pecked the power locks.

1423
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,141
He has been keeping
these defenseless creatures

1424
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:57,935
locked away in his apartment.

1425
01:20:57,936 --> 01:21:01,088
When I tried to save them,
he broke into the zoo and kidnapped them.

1426
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,190
I've seen these penguins before.

1427
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,276
Is it true, Mr. Popper?

1428
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,777
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1429
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:08,028
Why did you do it?

1430
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,906
Knowing you,
it must be for some sort of personal gain.

1431
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,826
Yes, the kind no amount of money can buy.

1432
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,077
For Pete's sake.

1433
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:18,622
Mr. Popper and his equally crazy family
believe that these penguins love him.

1434
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,790
They are wrong.

1435
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:23,252
If they have to choose between love
and a nice juicy sardine,

1436
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,129
they will choose the fish every time.

1437
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,072
- I don't think so.
- Let's find out.

1438
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,533
He's got a fish.

1439
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,369
I got this.

1440
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,758
Come on, guys.

1441
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,509
Come on.

1442
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,056
Come on. Yeah.

1443
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,365
That's right.

1444
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,808
Captain, come on.

1445
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,393
Come to Popper.

1446
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,816
Hey! That's my guys.

1447
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,757
No! That doesn't prove anything.

1448
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,258
Come on, aren't you going to arrest him?

1449
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,595
For what? Winning?
Is that what we do in this country?

1450
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,971
Is that what America is all about?

1451
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:19,600
I don't think so! I don't think so!

1452
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:25,648
America!

1453
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,025
Have you people lost your mind?
He's breaking the law.

1454
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,235
Come on, guy, have a heart.

1455
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:31,528
Have a heart?

1456
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,156
I'm going to call the Chief of Police.
I'm going to call the Mayor.

1457
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:35,849
Oh, allow me.

1458
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,705
Michael.

1459
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,749
- What?
- How are you, dear?

1460
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,751
I've got a small matter...

1461
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,211
- that needs your attention.
- Come on.

1462
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,379
That's not good.

1463
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,464
The penguins will be provided for.

1464
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,132
Mr. Popper always has a plan.

1465
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,344
- This is insane!
- Quiet, you. Quit your quarrelling.

1466
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,746
- Pippi.
- Quint.

1467
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,206
Pleasure.

1468
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:00,874
Quite.

1469
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,479
Well, I guess we have custody.

1470
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,981
I guess we do.

1471
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,632
Mr. Popper.

1472
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,235
Mrs. Van Gundy.

1473
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:15,389
Congratulations. The Tavern is yours.

1474
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,182
I told you.

1475
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:21,495
I never forget a name.

1476
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,247
I just needed to be sure...

1477
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:27,234
that that little boy
hadn't gotten lost somewhere.

1478
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,337
Nice work, Popper.

1479
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,381
Hey, Franklin.

1480
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:35,576
When do we break ground
on the new building?

1481
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,077
We're not.

1482
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,328
Hmm?

1483
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,248
What are you talking about?

1484
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:27,561
- It's really beautiful, Thom.
- Thank you.

1485
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,229
You did a great job, Dad.

1486
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,397
I appreciate that, Billy.

1487
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,883
But it wasn't just me.
I'm just the mastermind.

1488
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:39,239
So, I brought you here today
because I want to tell you something.

1489
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,159
I'm going on a trip, very far away.

1490
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,270
And I could be gone for a very long time.

1491
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,358
So, I'm going to need you
to come with me.

1492
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,652
Nice!

1493
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:55,322
Where are we going?
I hope it's someplace warm.

1494
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:00,327
It's not, is it?

1495
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,356
Warm enough?

1496
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:13,924
Perfect.

1497
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,025
Whoa!

1498
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,610
Hey!

1499
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,781
Will you look at that?

1500
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,325
It's a family reunion.

1501
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:44,579
Hey, look, it's the Loveys.
And the Loudys.

1502
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,957
And the Nimrods.

1503
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:59,219
Hey, Dad.
I don't think Captain likes it here.

1504
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,059
It's okay, girl.

1505
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:09,396
You just got to get used to it, that's all.

1506
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,332
Oh, my.

1507
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,877
I think she's going to be just fine.

1508
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,403
What should we name him?

1509
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,631
Well, he's going to be an amazing flyer.

1510
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:22,926
So, how about

1511
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,202
Bald Eagle?

1512
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,123
Hey! He's a good reason to come back.

1513
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,517
Yeah!

1514
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,545
You hear that, Captain?
We're coming back.

1515
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:37,691
Thank you, Captain.

1516
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,235
You're the coolest gift I ever got.

1517
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,197
See you soon.

1518
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,641
Way to go, Captain.
You're going to be a great mom.

1519
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:54,775
Not bad, Popper. Not bad.

1520
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:58,236
Yeahbsolutely.

1521
01:26:58,254 --> 01:26:59,613
Hmm.

1522
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:38,335
Yo, VIP, let's kick it

1523
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,837
All right, stop, collaborate, and listen

1524
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,798
Ice is back
with my brand new invention

1525
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,800
Something grabs a hold of me tightly

1526
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,843
Flow like a harpoon, daily and nightly

1527
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,887
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know

1528
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,973
Turn off the lights and I'll glow

1529
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,933
To the extreme
I rock a mic like a vandal

1530
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,018
Light up a stage
and wax a chump like a candle

1531
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,853
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms

1532
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:59,189
I'm killing your brain
like a poisonous mushroom

1533
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,233
Deadly when I play a dope melody

1534
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,277
Anything less than the best is a felony

1535
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,112
Love it or leave it, you better gang way

1536
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,406
You better hit bull's eye,
the kid don't play

1537
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,449
If there was a problem, yo,
I'll solve it

1538
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,493
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

1539
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,437
Ice, Ice, baby

1540
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,899
Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby

1541
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:22,200
Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby

1542
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:25,801
Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby

1543
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:28,010
Vanilla

1544
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,720
Now that the party is jumping

1545
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,097
With the bass kicked in
and the Vega's are pumpin'

1546
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,099
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking

1547
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,143
Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon

1548
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,395
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble

1549
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,063
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal

1550
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:42,316
And a high hat with a souped up tempo

1551
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,109
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

1552
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,261
Ice, Ice, baby

1553
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,390
Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby

1554
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:52,576
Vanilla

1555
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,578
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet

1556
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,705
Miami's on the scene
just in case you didn't know it

1557
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,915
My town that created all the bass sound

1558
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,625
Enough to shake
and kick holes in the ground

1559
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,544
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill

1560
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:04,629
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel

1561
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,923
Conducted and formed,
this is a hell of a concept

1562
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,925
We make it hype and you want to step

1563
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:11,053
With this, Shay plays on the fade

1564
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,096
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade

1565
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,182
So fast other DJ's say, "Damn!"

1566
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,225
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram

1567
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:19,019
Keep my composure
when it's time to get loose

1568
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,355
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

1569
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,357
If there was a problem, yo,
I'll solve it

1570
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,484
Check out the hook
while D-Shay revolves it

1571
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,427
Ice, Ice, baby

1572
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:35,644
Vanilla Ice, Ice, baby

1573
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:38,563
Yo, man, let's get out of here
