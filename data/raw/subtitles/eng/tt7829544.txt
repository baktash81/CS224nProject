I miss Dadda.

326
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,720
I know you do, Pat. We all do.

327
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
He needs to go home.

328
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,920
-Angela?
-I just need to do one thing.

329
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,280
[thumps]

330
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,560
[Pat] What is she doing, Mam?

331
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,400
-[Angela] Come on!
-Huh?

332
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,520
-[door opens]
-Angela, wait.

333
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,080
-Will you come on?
-[mother] Boys, coats.

334
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
[Angela] Come on.

335
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
You'll have me above in St. Jeremiah's
with your messin'.

336
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
What if we're caught, Angela?

337
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
We'll be fine, Pat. Come on.

338

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,480
-[man laughing]
-And then, He let out a sneeze.

341
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,560
A sneeze so small and heavenly,

342
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,600
only an angel could have made it.

343
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,800
A sneezy miracle!

344
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,200
And then, then--

345
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,000
Didn't the Baby Jesus Himself
only go and thank the both of us?

346
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,040
[man] Amazing!

347
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
[whispers] Quick.

348
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,240

351
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, you've broken it.

352
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Sorry.

353
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
-[mother] Sorry, Father.
-Guard, we have the thief.

354
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,880
-[door opens]
-[Angela] But, but...

355

357
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,160
No, no, no, no.
She was only warming the baby Jesus.

358
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,440
You won't put my sister in jail.
You won't.

359
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,320
You can put <span style="style.default_1">me </span>in the Limerick jail.

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
He was cold in the crib,
so I took him home to warm him up.

361
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,160
Well, then.

362
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,880
It looks like we've no choice
but to lock you up

363
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,840
for the taking of... "one baby Jesus."

364
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
And on his birthday, of all things.

365
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,760
[giggles]

366
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,680
I fail to see
how this is a laughing matter.

367
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,600
You're right, Father.

368
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,800
There is nothing funny
about taking a child,

369
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,040
any child-- away from his family
on Christmas Eve.

370
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,160
[priest] Wait.

371
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,480
You'll need this...

372
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,120
or you'll catch your death.

373
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,720
Thank you.

374
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
[softly] Goodbye.

375
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
-[mother] Good boy, Pat.
-[Angela] Thanks, Pat.

376
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,120
-[Tom] Yeah, well done, Pat.
-Thanks.
