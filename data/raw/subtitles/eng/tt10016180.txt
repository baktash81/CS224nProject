1
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,813
No, no, no. Hello! Hello!

2
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,273
Somebody!

3
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,734
No, please, no, no, please!
No, no, no, please!

4
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,068
Please, please, please!

5
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,700
Please, please, please!

6
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,914
Please. Oh, God.

7
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,211
Please, please,
please, help me!

8
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,593
-Yeah, it's blood.
-Good.

9
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,595
I hope they bleed to death.

10
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,974
It's the third time in two months.

11
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,601
There are 47 bulbs in the letter "G."

12
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,645
It's $3.10 a pop.

13
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,022
That's $145.70, every time.

14
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,277
That's an additional 13 dinners
I gotta sell just to float.

15
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,695
Are you listening to me?

16
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,947
Yes, sir.

17
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,116
Half our take is from the interstate.

18
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,369
You drive by, you look up...

19
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,956
Not exactly a Happy Meal.

20
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,131
Morning, Deke.

21
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,637
Hey, Deke.

22
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,141
Yes, sir.

23
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,685
You remember a punk named JJ Kendricks?

24
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,520
Robbed the Quick Mart?

25
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,733
We've got a witness who ID'd him,
but she's getting the, uh, guilts.

26
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,945
All she knows for certain is that he was
wearing a really nice pair of boots.

27
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,655
Fancy stitching.

28
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,616
"Unforgettable," she says.

29
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,994
But Kendricks is a suspect
in a robbery down in LA.

30
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,370
Down in LA?

31
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,955
-Yeah.
-Is this headed somewhere?

32
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,415
Yeah. And so are you.

33
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,336
There's a prelim day after tomorrow
with a motion to dismiss.

34
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,547
You drive to LA
and bring back the bloodstained boots,

35
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,091
she ID's them,
and the judge sets a trial date.

36
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,761
The blood, they definitely
ran the ABO on the blood?

37
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,221
That's correct.

38
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,807
Then that means
this is a DA problem, Captain, not ours.

39
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,351
Oh, no, it's our problem.

40
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,228
No evidence, no conviction.

41
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,605
I got nobody else.

42
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,150
Yes, sir.

43
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,098
Don't look at me like that. You the one
been gone for the last two weeks.

44
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,395
Ah...

45
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,525
I'll see you tonight.

46
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,508
I'm, uh, here to pick up
seized evidence.

47
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,885
Property said it was here.

48
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,970
Yeah.

49
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,155
Excuse you.

50
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,701
Evidence is here, but it's not leaving
without a signature.

51
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,453
-Ah.
-Uh-uh. Not yours.

52
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,081
I need authorization
from Homicide to release.

53
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,249
-There's a preliminary tomorrow.
-Not my problem.

54
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,752
Captain Farris put a lock on this item
for testing.

55
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,504
-It's already been tested.
-Don't I know it.

56
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:26,256
He wants it re-tested.
Become a thing.

57
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,341
So I hear.

58
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,968
Hey, look. You get me a signature
and, uh, you can walk out of here...

59
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,929
wearing the damn things for all I care.

60
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,103
Hey. Hey.

61
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,437
This yours?

62
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,314
-Yeah, unhook it.
-You blocked me in.

63
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,774
Why didn't you just ask me to move it?

64
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,567
'Cause I don't have time.
You want special treatment?

65
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,027
Go back to Kern County.

66
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,907
Unhook it.

67
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,371
...all-hands-on-deck
approach to this case.

68
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,706
To these cases.

69
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,167
Our city, our communities,
our citizens,

70
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,420
and above all else...

71
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,714
these innocent victims deserve no less.

72
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,674
I don't know how many times
I need to tell you, man.

73
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,720
Take it out of the file. Please.

74
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,852
...is that we're asking
for your help.

75
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,646
If anyone has seen
or heard from anyone

76
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,566
that might somehow
be related to these cases...

77
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:28,819
Carl.

78
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:36,285
I see Brother Love's...
salvation show's still in operation.

79
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,664
Everybody needs a little faith.
Even you.

80
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,959
Got yourself a new disciple.

81
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,544
Great detective, great guy.

82
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,172
You should listen in, you might
learn something on both counts.

83
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,132
-Anyway...
-The lab called.

84
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,467
Are you leaving town when you're done?

85
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,093
-You wanna take me to dinner?
-Want you out of here.

86
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,762
They'll run the test
first thing in the morning

87
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,638
and if there's no match, you're gone.

88
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,432
Tomorrow's no good.
My CO told me...

89
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,933
Ah, I called your CO.

90
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,394
He says you should hang
until the tests are complete,

91
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,979
deliver the evidence tomorrow.

92
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,355
Okay?

93
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,067
Good to see you, Captain.

94
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,652
Look at it this way...

95
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,280
give you a chance to visit
all those friends you left behind.

96
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,287
Who says that bad guys
don't return to the scene of the crime?

97
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,664
How's it feel to be back in uniform?

98
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,125
Still padding your overtime, Rogers?

99
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,419
Ooh. That's, uh,
Sergeant Rogers now, Deke. Yes.

100
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,545
Sergeant Rogers?

101
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,339
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

102
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,381
-Hmm.

103
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,466
Your phone's ringing.

104
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,801
Yeah, I know.

105
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,887
We are being meticulous
and methodical in our efforts.

106
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,640
Sergeant Rogers.
Yeah, but what did he say?

107
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,767
...and we are in the process
of evaluating and prioritizing leads...

108
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,977
-Nice to see you, Deke.
-Good to see you, too.

109
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,438
...and gathering additional evidence.

110
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,860
I can assure you all,
we are taking a 24/7,

111
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,987
all-hands-on-deck approach to this case.

112
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:54,988
-These cases.

113
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,116
Questions.

114
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,912
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but what I'm hearing is

115
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,581
after two months and four victims,

116
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,250
you don't have a suspect.

117
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,378
None that I can discuss.

118
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,424
Four dead girls, Jimmy.

119
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,928
We haven't been under this much scrutiny
since the Night Stalker.

120
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,389
There's talk.

121
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,767
Sheriff hinted that we might wanna
reach out to the feds for help.

122
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,602
-Are you kidding me?
-Some point.

123
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,896
Some point, Jimmy.
Not today.

124
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,443
Deke?

125
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,153
Son of a bitch.

126
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,614
-The man, the myth, the legend.
-Hey, Sal.

127
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,699
You still hanging around?

128
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:39,992
No rest for the ugly.

129
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,410
-What are you doing here?

130
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,828
Eh, don't ask, don't tell.

131
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,913
I'm just going across the street,
let me buy you a cup.

132
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,040
Come on, what's one cup of coffee?

133
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,083
All right.

134
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,086
Yeah.

135
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,630
Who is that, talking to Sal?

136
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,465
Kern County patrol dep.

137
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,092
That's Joe Deacon.

138
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,761
You're kidding.

139
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,973
No.

140
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,100
They're a bunch of nancies.

141
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,686
End of shift, I gotta beg for somebody
to grab a beer with.

142
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,396
They got no soul, these new guys.

143
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,899
They weeded all the heart
out of the place.

144
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,735
But then, you know that
better than anybody.

145
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,486
-Hey, Sarge.
-Sal.

146
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,780
-You know Joe Deacon?
-Get what you came for?

147
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:20,908
I will.

148
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,827
You got nothing better to do
than to bust my balls in the meantime?

149
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,204
Nothing personal.
Deke busts everybody's balls.

150
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,040
You wanna bullshit John Q. Public

151
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,250
into thinking that
the worst is behind us,

152
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,294
that's your business,
until the next time,

153
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,378
but, hey, it's your shift, right?

154
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,755
Yeah, itis.

155
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,883
I hear you're a good cop.

156
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,260
I hear things, too.

157
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,267
He is a good cop, Deke.
College boy,

158
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,145
bit of a Holy Roller, but, hey, I've
been thinking about joining them myself.

159
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,230
Get on the fast track for a promotion.

160
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,566
Sal, we're up.

161
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,861
You wanna stay with me
and the wife tonight?

162
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,987
Ah, nope. Thank you, though.

163
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,906
-Good to see you, Deke.
-Good to see you, too, brother.

164
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,914
Why don't you ride over with me?

165
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,292
Maybe you can even
give me a few pointers.

166
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:29,434
Everybody outside, nobody in.
Dollar to a dime, it's a decomp.

167
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,815
Baxter. 362071.
What's everybody waiting around for?

168
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,024
Power's off
inside the victim's building.

169
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,110
-You call Edison?
-They're working on it now.

170
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,194
You been inside?

171
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,614
-How big's the place?
-Two-room efficiency.

172
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,949
Due to the victim's body position,

173
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,243
access is through
the adjacent apartment's fire escape.

174
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,369
We got generators on the truck.

175
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,079
Nah, let's let
the wazoo boys go to work.

176
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,664
You wanna superglue the whole apartment?

177
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,208
Why not? We're dead in the water
until the power comes back on.

178
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,549
-You familiar with all of this?
-No.

179
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,886
Things probably changed a lot
since you left.

180
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,430
Still gotta catch him, right?

181
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,597
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

182
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,267
Not that much has changed, then.

183
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,658
Anybody want some menthol?

184
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,328
Everyone eat?

185
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,408
All right.

186
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,285
Lights off.

187
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,980
Holy shit!

188
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,033
Arterial wound...

189
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,036
stab wound, body cavity.

190
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,039
Another stab wound.

191
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,375
She crawled to here...

192
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,919
all the way to here.

193
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,213
This is where she died.

194
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,800
So, why is she there?

195
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,802
They lift prints from this window?

196
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,848
Hey, Jimmy, they dust that ledge yet?

197
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,477
Get me the first officer.

198
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,521
Still making house calls, eh, Flo?

199
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,233
Oh, good Lord.

200
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,026
You in town for a while?

201
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,403
No.

202
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,113
Stick around till I'm finished.

203
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,283
Okay.

204
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,454
Joe Deacon, meet Julie Brock.

205
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,250
Julie's 5'4", a buck 20,
and hails from Manhattan, Kansas.

206
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,793
This job sucks.

207
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,545
Hey.

208
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,632
Our Killer exited the same way
we came in.

209
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,260
It's your responsibility to secure
and protect the premises

210
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,137
from anyone who might spoil it.

211
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:56,683
From the moment she expired
to the time I cuff whoever did this...

212
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,143
we work for her.

213
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,811
-Yes, Sir.
-Get out of here.

214
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,148
It's starting to look
a lot like Illinois.

215
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,316
-It's Michigan.
-Cut it out.

216
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,317
This been dusted?

217
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,485
Yeah, but it's broken.
Stuff's rotten.

218
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,528
Not all of it.

219
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,533
Hey.

220
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,913
When's your boy, Columbo,
gonna break my case for me?

221
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,957
Deke's got his own style.

222
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,631
We're still
processing out that room.

223
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,509
What do you got, Flo?

224
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,387
She assumed room temperature
two or three days ago.

225
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,640
-We'll know more when we take her in.
-Lean her forward.

226
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,725
Check the closets.

227
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,394
Postmortem lividity.

228
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,065
She was moved.

229
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,397
All right, canvass the block, knock on
every door, quiz every hooker...

230
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,442
find out Julie's habits,
friends, suitors, enemies.

231
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,194
They get anything across the alley?

232
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,697
They lifted a print, tested stains
on the floor for semen, all negative.

233
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,908
Pull files on any known
sex offenders in the area.

234
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,578
Peeping Toms, neighborhood arrests,
transients included.

235
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,122
Lean on the lab for prints, all right?

236
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,916
-Mm-hmm.
-Jamie, lean on 'em.

237
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay.

238
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,044
Awfully quiet back there, Kojak.

239
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,629
-Am I missing something?

240
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,381
Any of the other girls have bites?

241
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,632
Carrie Holland.

242
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,300
One of 'em. Why?

243
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,094
Similar to a case up north, that's all.

244
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,691
Deacon.

245
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,984
Yeah?

246
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,778
Sal says you're here overnight.

247
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,238
How about you buy me breakfast?

248
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,489
Why would I wanna do that?

249
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,782
All right, I'll buy.

250
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,700
Nick's, 0800.

251
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:43,701
If I'm still here.

252
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,462
Go again on Wednesday?

253
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,589
Yeah, sure. I'll run you home.

254
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,757
Three blocks. I'll be fine.

255
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,259
-Okay.
-Night.

256
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,886
Bye.

257
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,645
Yeah,
surprised the DA, too.

258
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,438
She made a second-degree offer.

259
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,440
Kendricks copped a plea.

260
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,983
What about the unforgettable boots?

261
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,319
Forget 'em. Don't need ‘em.
Neither will Kendricks.

262
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,487
Not where he's going.

263
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,697
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

264
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,115
Morning.

265
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,159
-Morning.
-Look, I know it was you

266
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,579
spotted the observatory
across the street last night.

267
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,164
Might have missed that one without you.

268
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,208
You're welcome.

269
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,210
-When you leaving?
-Right now.

270
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,921
Oh, that's a shame. I got
something you might wanna sit in on.

271
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,757
He got picked up twice for peeping
in the victim's neighborhood.

272
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,342
Sheet says he's a KSO.

273
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,135
Stan Peters.

274
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,429
Picked up this morning
on a Ramey warrant.

275
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,889
Letting him stew a bit.

276
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,183
He wants a mouthpiece.

277
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,269
You might wanna stay.

278
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,814
Nice boots.

279
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,833
Hi, Stan. Jim.

280
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,046
-Where's my lawyer?
-In the building.

281
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,007
Takes a while.

282
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,701
A girl from your neighborhood...

283
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:13,745
dead.

284
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,997
And you, a known sex offender...

285
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,625
I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

286
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,792
You had your dick out.

287
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,045
-This girl...
-Teenage girl, Stan.

288
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,505
She was just walking by.

289
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,673
You gotta believe me.

290
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,966
I want to.

291
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,010
I got nothing to do with this.

292
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,238
What can you tell me about Mary Roberts?

293
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,159
What?

294
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,663
Mary Roberts.

295
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,199
Mary Roberts, Stan Peters?

296
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,493
Dead girl, suspect.

297
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,161
Was he your boy?

298
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,289
You never know.
Just saying hello to an old pal.

299
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,458
Well, your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

300
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,294
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

301
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,504
What are you still doing here?

302
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,880
Just leaving.

303
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,388
Order up the poor boy on a Mary Roberts.

304
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,223
I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

305
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,349
Nah, I'm good.

306
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,517
The Rathbuns are waiting.

307
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,436
Missing person.

308
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,062
Yeah, they think their daughter
Ronda's a stat.

309
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,063
We got a corpse?

310
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,442
Then it's still Missing Persons.

311
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,376
So crazy, girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

312
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,465
Don't you ever get tired
of looking at dead bodies?

313
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,052
I could ask you the same.

314
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,015
What's this all about, Joe?

315
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,726
Similar case up north.

316
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,896
Thanks for doing this for me, Flo.

317
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:27,897
No problem.

318
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,233
She won't see the knife till tomorrow.

319
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,110
Well, she won't see another knife.

320
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:40,952
General proximity, similar pattern
and depth to our other four.

321
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,288
The garbage bag was an adornment
placed on her head postmortem.

322
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,082
Maybe when the guy came back.

323
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,500
Came back?

324
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,003
Unless he was a babysitter,
he made a return trip,

325
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,090
moved the girl
and propped her up against the door.

326
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,341
Now, turn that up for me.

327
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,510
Okay.

328
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:05,852
Mm... KHRT.
Love songs of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

329
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,436
You get a dental on the bites?

330
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,064
Right. Uh...

331
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,984
Yeah, we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

332
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,069
It could be the same
as we found on the Holland girl.

333
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,654
More sucking, less biting.

334
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,241
Any saliva samples?

335
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,409
Funny you should ask.

336
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,703
I found traces of sodium benzoate
in the bites.

337
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,581
-What's that?
-Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

338
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,207
And check this out.

339
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,293
He gave her a postmortem shave.

340
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,213
Nicked her, no blood.

341
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,715
What about her D-tract?

342
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,925
She had one good meal before she died.

343
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,428
Speaking of which, you hungry?

344
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,638
I'll buy
if you pull up an old file for me.

345
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,181
Yeah.

346
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,438
Case up north, my ass.

347
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,815
The fuck is going on, Joe?

348
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,486
I'll pull your file.

349
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,115
But if something goes wrong,
I can't be there for you again, okay?

350
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,575
Okay.

351
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,054
You knew him, didn't you?

352
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,350
At least, he knew you.

353
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,520
That's why he did that to your face.

354
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,316
You let him in.

355
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,777
You thought...

356
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,321
"Eh...

357
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,200
Not my type," but...

358
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,912
maybe he could be a friend.
I mean...

359
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,623
you can't get enough of them.

360
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:59,215
But then you had
that one little feeling.

361
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,634
You thought, "What if?"

362
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,097
But you waved it away.

363
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,226
Thought, "Ah, what the hell?

364
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,939
Life's too short."

365
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,610
And you were right.

366
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,947
Life is too short, Julie.

367
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:25,658
And you should've listened.

368
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,828
You should've listened
to that one little feeling, but...

369
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,002
Just like I'm listening to you now.

370
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,462
You can talk to me.

371
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,132
I'm all the friend you got.

372
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,848
You know my take
on the world, Joe?

373
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,351
There's good and there's bad...

374
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,311
but you gotta fight.

375
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,774
Because, brother...

376
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,903
when I look in your eyes...

377
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,448
what I see...

378
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,534
it ain't good.

379
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,919
To remind me of what I did.

380
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,964
For what we did.

381
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,547
I thought you guys were finished.

382
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,634
How long has this, uh,
fridge been broken?

383
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,760
I don't know. A week maybe.

384
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,136
You're responsible for repairs?

385
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,305
Oh, are you thinking about moving in?

386
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:14,850
No, ma'am.

387
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:21,107
I called a guy to come fix it, but, uh,
then, you know, the girl got killed.

388
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,025
So, suddenly,
it didn't seem so important.

389
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,237
And, I mean, look. I gotta paint
the walls and get rid of the mattress.

390
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,988
-Who'd you call?

391
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,200
Uh... a place around the corner.

392
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,203
ABC Appliance. Something like that.
ABC Appliance.

393
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,830
And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

394
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,081
-Yeah, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

395
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,082
Except the milk?

396
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:39,708
-My kid drank it, so cuff me.
-Oh.

397
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,128
-Anything else?
-In the fridge?

398
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,046
There were a few beers. Why?

399
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,172
I'm gonna need it for evidence.

400
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,215
For evidence.

401
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,967
Yeah, okay.

402
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,802
-Coming right up.
-All righty.

403
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,932
How do you
ever get used to it?

404
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,644
What's that, ma'am?

405
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:41,979
The smell.

406
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:48,736
You know, if you're lucky,
you don't get used to it.

407
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,197
Here.

408
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,533
Close up when you're done, okay?

409
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,091
I don't want any trouble.

410
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,885
I have no connection
to the girls out front.

411
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,929
-Just need a room.
-Oh.

412
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,972
$20 a night, $100 a week.

413
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,183
There are some things in there
from the last guy.

414
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,267
Just toss 'em in the hallway.

415
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,770
And don't worry, the sheets are clean.

416
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,522
Hey!

417
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,358
Do you want some company?

418
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,163
-Good night. I love you.
-Love you.

419
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,958
-I love you.
-Love you.

420
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,546
-Did you say your prayers?
-Yep.

421
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,797
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Night.

422
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:32,840
Good night.

423
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,216
-Hey.
-Mm?

424
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,552
Did you set the alarm?

425
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,016
Yeah.

426
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,403
It's never over.

427
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,144
Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

428
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,938
Jimmy.

429
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,106
All of 'em.

430
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,486
Close it.

431
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,073
-Stan Peters.
-What about him?

432
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,282
Killed himself last night.

433
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:24,993
That's not good.

434
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,537
What the hell's this got to do
with Kern County?

435
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,830
Deacon watched through the glass.

436
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,790
He's got a similar case up north.

437
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,667
It's just
a little interagency cooperation.

438
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,878
Guy hasn't worked a murder
since we ran him off five years ago.

439
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,296
Do you know the book on him?

440
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,174
A great detective, has a heart attack,
leaves town for a post in the sticks.

441
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,509
The guy worked the case so hard,

442
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:44,346
he got a suspension, a divorce
and a triple bypass, all in six months.

443
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,639
Complete meltdown.

444
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,683
He's a rush-hour train wreck.

445
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,268
That's a tad dramatic.

446
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,145
Only good came out of it, we got you.

447
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,438
What are you saying?
I took his spot?

448
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,814
Manner of speaking, yeah.

449
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,901
Piece of personal advice, Jimmy,
you got a good thing going here.

450
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,362
Don't get mixed up with this guy.

451
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,615
What's the big deal? He's gone.

452
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,534
His CO says he's taken vacation days.

453
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,035
-Yeah, so what?
-Does he strike you

454
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,829
as the kind of guy that plays golf?

455
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,713
Employee list.

456
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,383
Repair appointment book.

457
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,386
Look for yourself.

458
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,545
So, I could even have it
delivered to you tomorrow.

459
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,381
All you gotta do is go out
and get some food, put it in there,

460
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,884
your kids are gonna be happy,
you're ready to go.

461
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,385
Excuse me a minute.

462
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,304
-What can I do for you?
-I'm Joe Deacon.

463
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,641
I need to see all repair orders
for the last two weeks,

464
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,309
and a list of all your employees.

465
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,019
Thank you.

466
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,356
It's okay. You're not under arrest.

467
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,774
Yet.

468
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,167
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much. Ah, this one.

469
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,252
This one's crossed out.

470
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,128
-It's a cancellation.
-Yeah?

471
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,922
That's before I can get a man out.

472
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,215
And it always takes that long?

473
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,716
Hey, we're busy.

474
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,011
Yeah.

475
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,346
Yeah, I see.

476
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,681
And this is the list?

477
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,558
Mm...

478
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,351
Mm.

479
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,812
-And your name is?
-Jack.

480
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:57,938
You all right, Jack?

481
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,400
What's your last name, Jack?

482
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,734
Aboud.

483
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:05,362
Thank you, Jack Aboud.

484
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,239
You don't mind if I take your list,
do you?

485
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,875
Thanks, Jack.

486
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,559
Did you look at my print
from the Brock apartment?

487
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,144
It's no good without one to compare to.

488
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,230
The center's missing and the computer
can't work without the center.

489
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,649
Look on the bright side,
the guy finally left a partial.

490
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,819
What exactly is it you guys do?

491
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,031
We make you look good in court.

492
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,503
-Dad!

493
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:12,012
Anything else? Jewelry maybe?

494
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,305
A red barrette.

495
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,143
When she ran, she always used to wear
a red barrette to hold her hair back.

496
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,938
I'm gonna find her.

497
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,205
Jesus.

498
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:16,595
It's not her.

499
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,891
Really?
This how you spend your time off?

500
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,726
When's the last time
you saw two hoop-dees

501
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,603
and a meat wagon going 20 miles an hour?

502
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,398
They didn't wanna come
any more than I did.

503
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:29,566
What have you got?

504
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,984
Deceased fits the MO.

505
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,153
Stab wound, ligature, killed elsewhere.

506
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,030
-She a floater?
-Yeah.

507
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,616
But they dumped overflow
in here a few days back.

508
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,993
Guessing there's mud in her cavities.

509
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,579
Shallow grave, most likely.

510
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,504
You ready to tell me about Mary Roberts?

511
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:59,554
Your boy, Stan Peters,
swallowed a 12-gauge late last night.

512
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,809
Hey, Jimmy, come give a look.

513
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,672
If you didn't know any better,
from up here...

514
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,259
you might say it's beautiful.

515
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:42,013
Sal told me you went to bat
for me with Farris.

516
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,685
It's not a wise career move.

517
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,854
You're not exactly
a department favorite.

518
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,981
Maybe I can make it up to you.

519
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,943
You might wanna run these names.
Couple of possibles.

520
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,739
They were working in appliance stores
in Julie Brock's neighborhood.

521
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:00,824
It's a long shot.

522
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,534
Aren't they all?

523
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:05,829
Thank you.

524
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,708
Something I gotta know.

525
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,545
How's a guy with the best clearance rate
in the department

526
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,256
work 15 years without a promotion?

527
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:20,176
Maybe I didn't go to the right church.

528
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,056
Hm.

529
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,399
Do you believe in God, Joe?

530
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,946
When I see a sunrise or thunderstorm

531
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,907
or dew on the ground,
yes, I think there's a God.

532
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,160
When I see all this,
I think he's long past giving a shit.

533
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,581
I still owe you breakfast.

534
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,957
Yes, you do.

535
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,631
This is great. Thank you.

536
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,090
You're welcome.

537
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,675
Joe's in Kern County now.

538
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,178
Mm. Your wife drag you away?

539
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:04,262
I'm divorced.

540
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:08,516
Oh. Well, I'd like to get
out of the city, but Jim won't leave.

541
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,935
-Hm.

542
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,228
You work homicide there, too?

543
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,441
Uh, no, ma'am. I'm just a...

544
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,319
a dep.

545
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:23,698
Hi.

546
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:26,826
-Hi.
-My precious.

547
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,036
That's Mr. Deacon, Chloe.

548
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,037
How do you do?

549
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,372
Very well.

550
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:31,998
Do you have any kids, Joe?

551
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:35,543
Uh, two girls.
They're... they're all grown now.

552
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,295
All grown up.

553
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:39,756
I'm gonna be late.

554
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:41,967
-We ready to take Jen to school, baby?
-Mwah.

555
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,885
Got a parent-teacher conference
until 5:00,

556
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,554
so the girls are gonna stay at Mom's
until dinner.

557
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,431
-That's fine.
-Okay. I love you.

558
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,350
Where are you going?

559
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,437
Nice to meet you, Joe.

560
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,982
Thank you.

561
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,818
-She's beautiful.

562
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:01,903
They all are.

563
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,196
-Yeah.

564
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,076
I'll run the names on the list.
Where can I reach you?

565
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,035
St. Agnes.

566
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,122
I've heard of living on the beat,
but that's above and beyond.

567
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,416
Wanna meet after shift, compare notes?

568
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,335
You may have to ask
the Reverend Captain about that.

569
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,796
It's my case.

570
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,236
You look good, Marsha.

571
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:45,780
-You too, Joe.
-Thank you.

572
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,324
I was just on my way to work.
If I'd known you were coming by...

573
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,451
Gotta get going anyway.

574
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,327
-Let me... let me grab my purse.
-Okay.

575
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,710
-House looks good.

576
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,046
Glad you kept it.

577
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,505
Lawn, too.

578
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,466
Yeah, well, Tom's a...

579
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:06,676
He's a wiz in the yard.

580
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,012
Better than me.

581
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,474
Well, you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

582
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,020
How are the girls?

583
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:18,730
-Good.
-Good.

584
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,982
You ought to give 'em a call.

585
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,109
Yeah. Yeah.

586
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,694
Yeah.

587
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,529
Yeah, I should.

588
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,203
You all right?

589
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,915
You know me.

590
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,417
Yeah.

591
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,419
I know you.

592
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,299
Well...

593
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,259
I gotta...

594
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,011
All right.

595
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:51,679
Bye, Joe.

596
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:53,473
Bye, Marsha.

597
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,901
Mary Roberts. Paige Callahan,
Tamara Ewing.

598
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,362
I only asked for Roberts.

599
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,947
Yeah, well,
all the victims were hookers,

600
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,282
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

601
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,450
on the same night in the same location.

602
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:13,576
You gotta be kidding me.

603
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,078
Yeah, I'm hilarious.

604
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,545
I never figured you to be so hip.

605
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,173
Yeah, they must have...

606
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,592
must have changed owners.

607
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,262
You want something to drink?

608
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,764
Don't worry, I won't tell.

609
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,727
Where are you from? Originally.

610
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,896
The Valley.

611
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:44,607
Where are you from?

612
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,860
-Originally.
-Mississippi Valley.

613
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,528
Alabama, Birmingham.

614
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:50,989
Well, here's to being from somewhere.

615
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,991
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

616
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,369
All right, last night's victims...

617
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,997
SO we got six now.
One, Julie Brock, never left home.

618
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:00,915
Three from the north county,
bodies dumped here.

619
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,042
Two from here,
bodies dumped in north county.

620
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,752
And who said busing doesn't work?

621
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,380
All knifed, all gagged, all bound,
all very organized killings.

622
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,340
Not a lot of wasted motion.

623
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,342
-So, I got a question. Why?
-Why what?

624
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,428
First, geography.

625
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:15,555
Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops, he dies.

626
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,307
He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

627
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,726
Maybe two. High mileage.

628
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,272
Can't find one
in the neighborhood, a victim,

629
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,733
then, uh, he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

630
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,194
All right, next "why." Why the
extreme torture, then the love bites?

631
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,528
Turns him on.

632
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,780
No rape, no sodomy,

633
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,491
-no genital mutilation. Hm.
-He kills for sexual pleasure.

634
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,369
Was Stan Peters our boy?

635
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,247
God, I hope not.

636
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:44,334
All right, back to the living. Our boy.

637
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,544
He's got balls.
I'll give him that.

638
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,922
He goes back to Julie's house,

639
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,550
a few days after he kills her,
moves her body, shaves her legs,

640
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,929
poses her, he brings beer,

641
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:59,015
milk, food.
Just threw himself a little party.

642
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,601
And they found partially digested meat
in her stomach.

643
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,686
But she was a vegan. Strict vegetarian.

644
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,813
She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

645
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,690
Not even with a knife to her throat?

646
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,150
Nobody wants to eat alone.

647
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:10,109
Mm.

648
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,153
One last "why."

649
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,280
Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

650
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:16,157
that everyone else has forgotten about?

651
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,474
Farris and I were...

652
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,397
a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

653
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,568
Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

654
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,156
No lights.

655
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:01,494
Switching problem. Guy from Edison
said it happens once every decade or so.

656
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:05,206
Now, you see the woman behind me

657
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:06,666
-over my left shoulder?
-Yeah.

658
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,626
Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

659
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,254
Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

660
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,507
A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

661
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,385
And what did
good old Gladys have to say?

662
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,596
Said she was out. She lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment,

663
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,640
but she came clean.

664
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,726
What was she embarrassed about?

665
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:28,021
She went on her first date in 15 years,
slept at the old guy's house.

666
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,401
So, the night of the hat trick,
we had no lights,

667
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,820
Gladys getting boned...

668
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:39,991
two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

669
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,367
in a dead heat.

670
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,786
Third strike.

671
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:46,789
Drought.

672
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:51,544
No water, no mud, no prints.

673
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,714
Ground was hard like cement.

674
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:58,134
Victims were placed on that rock
right there.

675
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,012
They were drugged elsewhere, but they
were brought here, stabbed to death.

676
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:04,015
Posed facing each other,

677
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:08,353
bags over their heads, laid down,
like the rock was a table, like a...

678
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,356
tea party.

679
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,191
Where the guests fell asleep.

680
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,073
Warm. This just went down.

681
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,659
And where was your third victim?

682
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,453
Close by.

683
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:29,916
You work the evidence,
you still come up with zeros.

684
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,043
It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

685
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,963
Then you draw the black bean.

686
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,885
Maybe the victim looks like a kid
you picked on in school

687
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,805
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

688
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,058
Or maybe it's something else,
but whatever it is,

689
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,435
they're your lifelong responsibility,
Jimmy.

690
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,270
You own them.

691
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,734
You own them.

692
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,955
They're wherever they are,
and you are their angel,

693
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:14,836
trying like hell to turn the ledger
from red to black.

694
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,548
Word to the wise, Jimmy,
stay out of the angel business.

695
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,049
Hey.

696
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,553
What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

697
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,432
To finish the job.

698
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,440
Just like you.

699
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,525
It's not the same boy.

700
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,569
Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

701
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,320
than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

702
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,822
Yeah, nobody's that good
out of the block.

703
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,866
This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

704
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,325
Well, it can't be the same guy.

705
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,245
He's a shark, remember?
He stops, he dies.

706
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:50,913
Who said he stopped?
Maybe he just took his show on the road.

707
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,206
I'm over here on the right.

708
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,379
Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

709
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,757
One's 55, the other one's in his
late thirties, lives in Hollywood.

710
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,468
Both simple assaults.

711
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,219
It looks like a wash to me,

712
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,221
but you got all the info there.

713
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,267
And for the record, your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

714
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,393
Then why all the interest?

715
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,438
You wanna clear your conscience,
that's your problem.

716
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:19,150
But you gotta solve my case
to solve yours, who am I to moan?

717
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:23,446
But you piss on my leg
and call it rain, we're through.

718
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:27,992
Hey, uh, what was Julie's last supper?

719
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,663
It was roast beef. Why?

720
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,708
It's the little things
that are important, Jimmy.

721
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,878
It's the little things
that get you caught.

722
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,259
Can I help you?

723
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,392
I saw the "for sale" sign.

724
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,686
That was for another car.

725
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,564
Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

726
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:41,983
No.

727
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,652
How's the trunk space?

728
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,617
It's standard.

729
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,452
Mind if I take a look?

730
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,247
I'm in the market.

731
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,375
It's not for sale.

732
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,460
All I need to do is take a look.

733
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:05,172
You must really like my car.

734
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:06,924
I do.

735
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,627
Hey, Sal, listen.

736
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,088
Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

737
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:48,174
Yeah, see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.

738
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,622
Inconclusive.

739
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,750
But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

740
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,503
Partial of an incisor on Ewing's cheek.

741
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,629
What about Brock?

742
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,340
Partial of a bicuspid.

743
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,676
-Something else.
-What's that?

744
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,678
He's from back east.

745
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,680
Folds his slice.

746
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,949
-We'll canvass over here.
-All right.

747
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,093
Here we are

748
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,222
Here we are alone

749
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:44,141
Moon is shining

750
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:47,311
Moon is shining bright...

751
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,862
You have a good night.

752
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:07,581
We got roast beef, we got strippers...

753
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,667
Baby, you got anything
for us tonight?

754
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,544
We got hookers.

755
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:15,130
Damn, homie.

756
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,717
You don't know how lucky y'all are.

757
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,533
Okay.

758
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,289
How's the trunk space?

759
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,353
-Baxter.
-The second girl, the ditch pitch,

760
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,938
Where did you find her?

761
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,899
Couple hundred yards after 126.

762
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,193
-And you didn't leak it to the press?
-No.

763
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,444
You sure about that?

764
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,197
It went out over dispatch, but it was
never given to the press. Why?

765
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,490
What's the nearest mile marker?

766
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,866
Hang on.

767
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,211
467.

768
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,131
4-6-7.

769
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:38,185
There's this guy Deke asked me
to run a vehicle check on. Sparma?

770
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,562
Seems that Topanga Tow
has a car registered to him.

771
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,189
Found it abandoned two weeks ago.

772
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:43,232
Reported stolen?

773
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,316
No.

774
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,111
Well, tow that sucker in.

775
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,328
-Wine.
-Damn it.

776
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:57,704
Sal, what do you got?

777
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,957
Clean. 22,000 miles.

778
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:01,542
-A rollback?
-Definitely.

779
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,585
All right, keep at it.
Let me know if you find anything.

780
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:05,712
Here we go.

781
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:09,216
I'll take the prints.
Call the lab, tell 'em I'm on my way.

782
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:13,137
Grab Deke and a patrol dep,
pick up Sparma.

783
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,389
What about Tina Salvatore,
the potential witness?

784
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:16,598
Get her a magazine.

785
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,402
What are the chances he'll let us in?

786
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:30,404
Yeah. Just keep him busy,
keep him talking.

787
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:32,990
Tell him to take his time,
change his clothes, whatever.

788
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,366
Match is inconclusive.

789
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,660
-Conclude it.
-Eleven identifiers.

790
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,788
County requires 18 for an ID,
LAPD requires 12.

791
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:42,374
So, we're one short
of somebody's legal requirements?

792
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,751
-That says something.
-It says you're seven short.

793
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:47,379
Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't my boy.

794
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:49,256
This other fella...

795
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:51,216
let's call him Mr. X...

796
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:54,678
he's got eight identifiers.
Only three less than Sparma.

797
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:55,929
Maybe he's the killer.

798
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,306
Who?

799
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,692
Thank you.

800
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,126
Are we ready to go?

801
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,213
It's like I told the police...

802
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,798
it was dark,
he was wearing glasses, a hat...

803
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,927
If I showed you some photos, do you
think you'd be able to identify him?

804
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,386
Maybe.

805
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,472
Probably not.

806
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,767
Nothing.
It was like he was expecting us.

807
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,687
Get her something to drink.
Keep an eye on her.

808
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,023
I have to use the restroom.

809
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,816
Yep.  Come on.

810
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:53,487
It's, uh, right over here,
to your right. I'll wait for you.

811
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:54,488
Hey, you got a second, Jamie?

812
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,242
It's okay.
I can find my way back to your desk.

813
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,534
All right,
do you want anything to drink?

814
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:02,037
Uh... Diet anything.

815
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,497
Just come straight back, okay?

816
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:06,541
-What's up?
-Thanks.

817
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,130
The Harvester was clean as a whistle.

818
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:13,799
Damn it.

819
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,051
Got this off your desk.

820
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:17,552
You don't mind if I move the table,
do you?

821
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:19,346
Do your thing.

822
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,598
Grab the other end.

823
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,073
All clear.

824
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,742
Bring him in.

825
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,619
Okay, Jerry.

826
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,838
Well, what did you have to do
to get a job like this?

827
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:54,881
Kind of a demotion, huh?

828
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:06,893
No, we're not gonna need those.

829
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,770
Where's big Dick Tracy?

830
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,355
Is he joining us for dinner?

831
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,733
Ow. Man...

832
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:13,817
Hello, Albert.

833
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,195
I'm Detective Sergeant Baxter.

834
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:18,488
I know who you are.

835
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,781
You're famous.

836
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,450
On television and in the papers
all the time.

837
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,617
Thank you so much.

838
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,286
I'm kind of a crime buff.

839
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,954
Hm.

840
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:31,752
Well, then you know if you're innocent,
you should talk to me, clear your name.

841
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,176
Is that it?

842
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,430
Not gonna work me over, Mr. Clean?

843
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,016
Okay.

844
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:49,728
I invoke my Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.

845
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,773
Just kidding.

846
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,904
You should see the look on your faces.

847
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:00,864
Come on, it's hilarious.

848
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,866
But I would like my rights waiver card.

849
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,369
I know I'm not
officially in custody, but...

850
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,538
better be safe than sorry, huh, guys?

851
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,834
Hot damn.

852
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:16,505
This is awesome.

853
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:22,260
Can I keep this?

854
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:23,428
No, I'm afraid not.

855
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:24,554
No fun.

856
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:29,559
Hey, you wanna know something?
Ernesto Miranda...

857
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:33,480
was actually guilty.

858
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:35,732
Why did you abandon your car, Albert?

859
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,529
The Harvester. Had a big back end,
was good for hauling things around.

860
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:41,780
Look, Jimmy.

861
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:42,864
-Detective Baxter.
-Whatever.

862
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,451
Like I said, the car was stolen.
Thank you for finding it.

863
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:47,536
I'll drive it home.

864
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:49,079
We'll be hanging on to it
for a few days.

865
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:51,665
-Well, that's not very nice of you.
-Why didn't you report the theft?

866
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:54,459
Well, you see, that's the funny thing.

867
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:56,795
I did.

868
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,215
Somebody's got some homework to do.

869
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:13,770
Mm. Cute little thing, wasn't she?

870
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,565
-Who said she's dead?
-I know the drill, Jimmy.

871
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,983
But the truth is...

872
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:19,860
I'm not the guy.

873
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,321
Besides, if you had anything...

874
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,740
anything at all...

875
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:27,367
I'd be under arrest...

876
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:28,702
wouldn't I?

877
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,579
Do you want to be?

878
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,582
I wouldn't mind getting a peek
at all that evidence you say you got.

879
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:38,545
Is that for me?

880
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:41,256
You get the feeling he's enjoying this?

881
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:45,552
Oh, yeah.

882
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,846
Pineapples and jalapenos, please.

883
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,352
Can I come in?

884
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,735
Eleven more, you can make a calendar.

885
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:03,820
Uh-oh.

886
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,614
Oh, hey, stranger.

887
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,825
Tired of steaming up that glass?

888
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,244
Pressies?

889
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,787
Oh, yeah.

890
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:22,506
This is the part
where I start feeling like it's a trap.

891
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,007
Open it up, find out.

892
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:30,514
It's not a pair of mittens.

893
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:39,105
Wow.

894
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:43,568
Go on, take a look.

895
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,111
You know you want to.

896
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,364
Open it, you fucking weirdo.

897
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:06,716
Holy guacamole.

898
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:11,763
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

899
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,516
catch a dead girl by her toe.

900
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,478
Oh...

901
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,943
The contrast is all off.

902
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,946
It's no Weegee.

903
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,701
My God.

904
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,817
Let me ask you a question.

905
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:09,029
Why is that?

906
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,281
Huh?

907
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:13,491
Why is that?

908
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,546
Hm? Come on, you're a smart man.

909
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,548
You know every exit on the highway.

910
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:32,969
Let me help you.

911
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:40,268
I mean it.

912
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,103
Why?

913
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,072
Why not?

914
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:56,993
Son of a bitch. Your dick is as hard
as Chinese arithmetic.

915
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,036
-Shit.
-Son of a...

916
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,537
-Deke! Hey, Deke!
-That's why.

917
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:01,956
-That's why.
-Back off!

918
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,501
-Why is that? Why is that?
-Deke! Hey! Whoal

919
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:05,627
-That's what I wanna know.
-Back off.

920
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:06,920
Hey. Hey.

921
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:08,630
It's all right.
It's all right, Sal.

922
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,465
We know, you know...

923
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,635
...we got you by the balls,
small as they are.

924
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:15,095
You son of a bitch.

925
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,639
You lost control.

926
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,319
-Rizoli.

927
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,114
-Huh. Jimmy, it's your wife.
-Take a message.

928
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:51,798
What do you think?

929
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:54,551
Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

930
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:57,178
What do you mean, a better look?

931
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:00,890
Well, at this guy.

932
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:05,687
I mean, you have him
here in the station, right?

933
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:14,738
Thank you, Tina.

934
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,872
Look, I'm sorry.
What about a lineup?

935
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,540
We've got no cause.

936
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:29,836
I mean, the ID is tainted beyond repair.
She saw him in cuffs, for God's sake.

937
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,546
I told you. I warned you.

938
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:32,547
I take the heat.

939
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:34,090
-I'm the primary.
-For now.

940
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,508
What the hell does that mean?

941
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:39,596
It means I got six bodies,
no witnesses, no evidence, no killer.

942
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,973
Two guys questioned,
and why are they suspects?

943
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,434
One, who later sucks on a 12-gauge,

944
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,518
for malicious unzipping.

945
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,353
The other,
for carrying a concealed hard-on.

946
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,190
-What do you want the DA to do?
-He was visualizing the crime.

947
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,775
His crime.

948
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,568
Well, sheriff's calling in the feds.

949
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:57,572
They got a guy coming in on Monday.
That point, we back off, we revamp.

950
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:01,451
-Revamp?
-They take charge.

951
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,163
Hey, uh, one more thing.

952
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:10,043
Were you aware Sparma
confessed to a murder eight years ago?

953
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,669
Guy walks in...

954
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,423
and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

955
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:18,676
He signs a confession.
Next morning, we had to cut him loose.

956
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:21,221
-Why?
-He was lying.

957
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:25,350
I mean, he knew all the details, but he
wasn't within ten miles of the killing.

958
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,939
Still got two days, right, Cap?

959
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,609
Hey, what is it with you and Deke?

960
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,237
You wanna be the one that finds him
after his next heart attack?

961
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,447
It's his destiny, don't make it yours.

962
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,210
Deacon.

963
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,579
Boo.

964
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,173
What is... what is all this?

965
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:47,849
The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

966
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:50,560
becomes the future, becomes the past,
becomes the--

967
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:52,770
-Hey. Look at me.
-Becomes the future.

968
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,105
This is sick.

969
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,441
-You need to get some help.
-Don't point fingers.

970
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,985
I know all the symptoms.

971
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,531
Congratulations. We got a suspect.

972
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:04,824
Oh, we do, do we?

973
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:05,950
Yeah.

974
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,994
Are you aware that Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

975
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,037
So what?

976
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:12,290
He walked in, jerked Rogers' chain
for an entire shift.

977
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:14,292
He's a crime buff,
he said so himself.

978
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:15,877
Walk-in confessors aren't killers.

979
01:19:16,044 --> 01:19:17,253
We don't have shit!

980
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,505
You got the same ache
in your gut as I do, don't you?

981
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,925
We got something,
we just don't know what it is.

982
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:26,012
If I can get in Sparma's apartment
for just five minutes, I know...

983
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,514
-We don't have enough for a warrant.
-...like I'm standing in front of you.

984
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:29,515
I know.

985
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:30,516
Know what?

986
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,395
I know that the answer
is inside Sparma's place. I know.

987
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,068
Let me ask you something, Jimmy.

988
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:44,656
What do you want?

989
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,032
I wanna nail the bastard.

990
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,200
For who?

991
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,786
For all of the girls he killed.

992
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:54,540
And for Ronda Rathbun, wherever she is.

993
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,876
Well, I wanna
nail the bastard, too.

994
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,128
Difference is...

995
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:02,674
I'm doing it for me.

996
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,428
Just five minutes, Jimmy.

997
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,264
Please.

998
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:12,642
I'm sorry
about what happened today,

999
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,769
and I'd like to
make it up to you in person.

1000
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:19,440
Meet me at Pike's, near your place,
on the bully.

1001
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,193
That the place
with potato skins?

1002
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,002
We'll see.

1003
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:02,275
He comes back,
I'll hit the horn twice.

1004
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:11,219
7-0, respond.

1005
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:12,637
Code seven, Fifth and Main.

1006
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,362
Hey, you got a phone?

1007
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:12,697
Yeah.

1008
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:14,448
It's local.

1009
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:19,078
And a Shirley Temple to go.

1010
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:50,628
Officer down.

1011
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:52,880
Repeat, officer down.

1012
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:56,050
10929 San Marina Street.

1013
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,261
Repeat, officer down.

1014
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:30,001
LAPD, open up!

1015
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:32,545
Going right.

1016
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:34,630
Hey!

1017
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,091
LA Sheriff. What's going on?

1018
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:38,676
There's an officer down.
Two guys inside now.

1019
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,177
Hey, hey, hey.
All respect, Detective,

1020
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:42,638
your jurisdiction doesn't start
for another 20 blocks. Move.

1021
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,948
-Sheriff's.
-Baxter. 362071.

1022
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,408
How can I help you?

1023
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:06,120
Detective Baxter.

1024
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:07,955
Detective--

1025
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,540
-Bathroom's clear.
-Clear.

1026
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:02,885
Sparma called in
an "officer down."

1027
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,387
Wily son of a bitch.

1028
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:05,930
Wily enough to keep his apartment clean?

1029
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:09,350
He's got a box full of knickknacks
and souvenirs.

1030
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:10,851
By any chance,
did you see a red barrette?

1031
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:11,894
-Red barrette?
-Yeah.

1032
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:13,646
Ronda Rathbun was wearing one
when she disappeared.

1033
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:15,815
You give me five more minutes,
I can find out for you.

1034
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,167
All right, bad news first.

1035
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:39,839
Sparma did file a stolen on the wagon.
Rogers neglected to file.

1036
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:41,715
The good...

1037
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:44,969
Sparma left town less than six weeks
after your murders.

1038
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:46,137
Where'd he go?

1039
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,763
Detroit.

1040
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:50,558
Any unsolved bodies up there?

1041
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,268
Detroit?

1042
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:55,938
Right.

1043
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:58,315
He knows we're here.
He knows we're watching him.

1044
01:27:58,482 --> 01:27:59,400
Good.

1045
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:02,069
I want him to know.

1046
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:10,202
Do you ever wonder...

1047
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:14,457
that maybe, just maybe,
it's a waste of time?

1048
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,626
All this sitting, waiting...

1049
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:22,923
watching, spending your life
in another man's shadow.

1050
01:28:24,717 --> 01:28:28,804
One, wherever he goes,
I mark it for search warrants.

1051
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:32,099
Two, he tries it again,
I catch him in the act.

1052
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,811
Three, when I'm with him...

1053
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,229
nobody dies.

1054
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:39,482
Nobody dies on my watch.

1055
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,649
How long is your watch?

1056
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,905
As long as it fucking takes.

1057
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,709
What's he doing?

1058
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:04,256
How can you listen
to these sappy love songs all day long?

1059
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:07,176
Reminds me of being 16
in the backseat of my car...

1060
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:09,762
with Marsha McConnell.

1061
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,641
Guy's got a car,
why's he taking the bus?

1062
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,338
This is fucking comical.

1063
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:46,966
We're running out of sand,
this guy's taking public transportation.

1064
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,133
You run this place?

1065
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,261
Yeah. No connection.

1066
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:05,044
-Whoa. Whoa.
-Ah, fuck!

1067
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,630
Hey, you all right?

1068
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:08,881
I'm all right.

1069
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,091
Okay.

1070
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:13,636
Mm-hmm.

1071
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:16,764
We work the case.
That's all we can do, is work the case.

1072
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,557
It's like fishing.

1073
01:31:18,724 --> 01:31:22,269
You can go days without a strike,
then all of a sudden, bang, you get one.

1074
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:23,812
I'm fucking dying here, Deke.

1075
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,314
Okay. Why don't you go home,

1076
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:26,482
I'll put him to bed.

1077
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:28,609
-Fuck you.
-There you go.

1078
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:31,320
That's what I expected.

1079
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,131
You think they got watch batteries
down there?

1080
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:53,592
Mm.

1081
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:56,679
All right, I'm gonna go down there.
So, you want anything?

1082
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:57,763
Black coffee.

1083
01:31:58,305 --> 01:31:59,139
All right.

1084
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:14,173
-Hello?
-Boo.

1085
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:17,885
Get your hands in the air!

1086
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:20,095
-Now!
-Okay, okay.

1087
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,638
Do it now! Up against the gate.

1088
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:22,848
8-6-7 5-3-0-9

1089
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:24,558
Move!

1090
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:26,435
-Move!
-Okay.

1091
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:28,687
Is this right? This...

1092
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,689
-Forward!
-Okay. Fine.

1093
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,483
Hands on your head!

1094
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:36,945
Interlace your fingers.

1095
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,030
Excuse me?

1096
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:40,157
Interlace your fingers.

1097
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,492
Oh. Um...

1098
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:44,453
That sounds complicated. Mm.

1099
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,497
Point your fingers to the sky.

1100
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,998
Now!

1101
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,417
-Spread your legs.
-Thought you'd never ask.

1102
01:33:58,008 --> 01:33:59,843
-Where is she?
-Oh.

1103
01:34:00,344 --> 01:34:04,014
The original. How did you wrangle that,
Mr. Fancy Pants?

1104
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,313
Where is she?

1105
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:17,945
You don't wanna know.

1106
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:20,531
Not really.

1107
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,700
Okay, okay.

1108
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:25,118
Okay.

1109
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,704
You win.

1110
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:31,375
I'll take you to her.

1111
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,710
Would you like that?

1112
01:34:33,836 --> 01:34:35,254
Jeez.

1113
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:40,175
Are you coming?

1114
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:45,639
You got some serious anger issues,
Jimmy. You know that?

1115
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,225
You almost cracked my rib.

1116
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,525
40, 50...

1117
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:59,236
60, 70...

1118
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:23,176
Come on.

1119
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,304
I won't bite.

1120
01:35:26,013 --> 01:35:28,849
Get in.
We've got a drive ahead of us.

1121
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:31,310
And I've gotta work tomorrow.

1122
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,147
You already felt me up.
You're armed, I'm not.

1123
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:37,566
What are you so scared of, little boy?

1124
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,330
Oh, PS, your buttbuddy's not invited.

1125
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,055
Buckle up.

1126
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:09,723
Safety first.

1127
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:07,155
You know, you're not very good company.

1128
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:25,716
Where exactly is it we're going?

1129
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:28,927
Ronda Rathbun?

1130
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:50,198
You know, you and I are a lot alike.

1131
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:54,953
In another lifetime...

1132
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,080
uh, we could be friends.

1133
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:58,707
Isn't that crazy?

1134
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:38,121
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

1135
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,254
You mind?

1136
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:57,219
I knew a guy
who had a hunting lease here.

1137
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:58,595
And we got the moon tonight.

1138
01:40:58,762 --> 01:41:00,764
Cut the bullshit. Where is she?

1139
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:01,723
All business.

1140
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:04,976
You start walking that way.

1141
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:06,686
Hm.

1142
01:41:07,145 --> 01:41:09,189
I'm a man of my word, Jimmy.

1143
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:15,737
Chilly.

1144
01:41:15,946 --> 01:41:17,572
Uh...

1145
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,199
Colder.

1146
01:41:19,366 --> 01:41:21,117
No, no. Cold.

1147
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:23,787
God, you're really terrible at this,
you know that?

1148
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:26,122
Let me give you a hint.

1149
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:29,042
That way.

1150
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:30,835
Okay.

1151
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,963
Uh-uh. Warm.

1152
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,673
Warmer.

1153
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:36,716
Hot. Hotter.

1154
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:37,801
Hottest.

1155
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:41,596
Bingo.

1156
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:46,268
Now look down at the ground and say...

1157
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:50,480
"Hello, Ronda."

1158
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:03,493
You're gonna need this.

1159
01:42:08,832 --> 01:42:09,749
You dig.

1160
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,793
The devil's
in the details, Jimmy.

1161
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,170
Witnesses, physical evidence.

1162
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:16,423
You'd have to get rid of my body,
get rid of my car.

1163
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,508
It's a lot to consider.

1164
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:22,721
Besides...

1165
01:42:26,266 --> 01:42:28,310
it's a peace offering.

1166
01:42:37,444 --> 01:42:38,653
Okay.

1167
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:12,979
Oh, you're gonna kill me.

1168
01:43:13,313 --> 01:43:14,147
Uh...

1169
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:18,777
Oh, poop.

1170
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:21,321
I think I made a boo-boo.

1171
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:25,742
Yeah. Come to think of it,
this doesn't look that familiar.

1172
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:28,161
But this one over here...

1173
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:32,707
this looks very promising.

1174
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:37,420
Yeah, that's it.

1175
01:43:37,587 --> 01:43:38,671
What did you say?

1176
01:43:38,755 --> 01:43:39,923
Um...

1177
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:41,925
"Poop."

1178
01:43:42,509 --> 01:43:46,054
Then,
"This one is more promising."

1179
01:43:50,433 --> 01:43:53,311
It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

1180
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,241
I keep digging, you keep talking.

1181
01:44:32,559 --> 01:44:34,811
X marks the spot.

1182
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,857
Third time's the charm.

1183
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:45,530
It's like the cereal aisle.

1184
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:55,165
You want the truth?

1185
01:44:59,961 --> 01:45:02,589
I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

1186
01:45:05,967 --> 01:45:08,261
If you believe me, we can get in the car
and we can drive straight home.

1187
01:45:08,428 --> 01:45:10,430
Maybe even stop for tacos.

1188
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,266
If not...

1189
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,593
-That's it.

1190
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,138
Not too much longer now.

1191
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:08,363
What are you, five, six deep,
and no end in sight?

1192
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:14,744
Oh...

1193
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:17,413
I forgot to tell you.

1194
01:46:17,914 --> 01:46:19,582
I've seen a picture of your family.

1195
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:25,213
You should've stayed out
of the public eye, Jimmy.

1196
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:30,176
You and your ego.

1197
01:46:32,345 --> 01:46:34,847
I mean, what kind of a father are you?

1198
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:38,560
How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

1199
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:41,938
when you can't even begin to help one...

1200
01:46:42,105 --> 01:46:44,774
of those poor girls or their families?

1201
01:46:48,278 --> 01:46:49,988
You're insignificant.

1202
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,574
You don't matter.

1203
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:57,579
And this will go on and on and on.

1204
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:01,291
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1205
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:22,937
Hey. Hey. Hey, get up.

1206
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:25,690
Get up, man.

1207
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,737
Get up!

1208
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:33,114
Get up!

1209
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,712
-Deke, what is it?
-Quiet.

1210
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:36,177
Oh.

1211
01:48:39,097 --> 01:48:40,098
Oh, shit.

1212
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:43,643
The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

1213
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:45,269
becomes the future...

1214
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:47,730
becomes the past,
becomes the future...

1215
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,732
becomes the future.

1216
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:15,341
It was him.

1217
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:19,512
We got him. He was our boy.

1218
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:24,726
He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

1219
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,394
Nothing you can do about it now.

1220
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:28,771
We gotta call somebody.

1221
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:33,860
What am I gonna say?

1222
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:37,613
What am I gonna do?

1223
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,908
Nothing. You're not gonna say anything,
you're not gonna do anything.

1224
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:42,785
You're gonna find a hole,
stick him in it.

1225
01:49:42,952 --> 01:49:46,289
Pick one at least four feet deep.
I'll be back in a few hours.

1226
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,418
What'd she say, man?

1227
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:33,836
What's up with homeboy there?

1228
01:50:39,634 --> 01:50:41,135
Hey.

1229
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:10,618
He was our boy, Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

1230
01:53:10,785 --> 01:53:12,703
Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

1231
01:53:13,204 --> 01:53:14,622
So, listen...

1232
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:17,083
you go back,

1233
01:53:17,792 --> 01:53:20,878
you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash,

1234
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,714
and that you need a break.

1235
01:53:23,881 --> 01:53:28,344
A couple of weeks.
You tell him I left town Saturday,

1236
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:29,762
and you went home.

1237
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:32,932
Are you listening to me?

1238
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:36,936
He's dead.

1239
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,105
He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

1240
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:41,857
and the only way he's gonna come back
is if you let him come back.

1241
01:53:43,985 --> 01:53:45,277
Don't you ever go back to his place,

1242
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:48,531
don't you ever let his name
cross your lips,

1243
01:53:48,614 --> 01:53:51,242
don't you ever pull his file,
‘cause if you do...

1244
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:54,829
he'll rise up out of that ground.
He'll do you in.

1245
01:53:57,915 --> 01:53:59,959
It's the little things, Jimmy.

1246
01:54:00,626 --> 01:54:02,545
It's the little things
that rip you apart,

1247
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:03,796
it's the little things that...

1248
01:54:04,964 --> 01:54:06,966
get you caught.

1249
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,858
That's my boy.

1250
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,959
He was...

1251
01:54:44,837 --> 01:54:45,838
Joe...

1252
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:00,102
Si.

1253
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:13,240
<i>And that brings
to an end the world as we know it.</i>

1254
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:15,993
<i>Thanks for listening
for all these many years.</i>

1255
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,579
<i>It's twelve o'clock.</i>

1256
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,332
<i>Straight-up noon, LA.
This is Bobby Saunders,</i>

1257
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:23,834
<i>and I'm saying welcome
to the new KHVY,</i>

1258
01:55:23,918 --> 01:55:26,045
<i>the king of talk radio,
where what you have to say--</i>

1259
01:55:37,473 --> 01:55:40,976
A white male,
between the ages of 25 and 40.

1260
01:55:41,393 --> 01:55:44,814
He's of above-average intelligence
and socially competent.

1261
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:46,941
Works as a skilled laborer.

1262
01:55:47,108 --> 01:55:49,944
Probably firstborn or an only child.

1263
01:55:50,111 --> 01:55:51,946
And he follows the crimes in the media.

1264
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:54,990
He has at least one car
in good condition, possibly two,

1265
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:57,618
and he has a propensity
for changing jobs.

1266
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:00,746
Picking up,
leaving at a moment's notice.

1267
01:56:00,913 --> 01:56:03,207
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is the guy we're looking for.

1268
01:56:03,374 --> 01:56:04,834
What about the leads we're following?

1269
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,670
I think it's safe to say
we're at square one on this operation.

1270
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:09,463
But I can promise you this.

1271
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:11,382
We'll get the bastard.

1272
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,858
-Ana.
-Hey, Sal.

1273
01:56:30,484 --> 01:56:31,318
Come in.

1274
01:56:31,569 --> 01:56:33,320
Thanks. I gotta get going.

1275
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:35,364
You okay?

1276
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:40,452
Yeah. Well...

1277
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:42,538
We miss him already. Uh...

1278
01:56:43,205 --> 01:56:44,373
Joe Deacon gave me this.

1279
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,333
Said it was for Jimmy.

1280
01:56:50,129 --> 01:56:50,963
Thanks.

1281
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:52,131
Take care.

1282
01:56:52,298 --> 01:56:53,674
You too.

1283
01:56:53,841 --> 01:56:55,259
Thanks, Sal.

1284
01:56:58,137 --> 01:57:01,765
You know I love you, Dad.
But go away?

1285
01:57:02,057 --> 01:57:04,602
You're always around
when I don't need you.

1286
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:31,128
Sal brought this by.

1287
01:57:31,837 --> 01:57:34,465
He said it was from Joe Deacon.

1288
02:00:06,408 --> 02:00:08,494
Cause of death, multiple stab wounds.

1289
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:11,830
That's what I'm putting down.
