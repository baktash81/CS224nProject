1
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,765
Get in there now!

2
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,723
Get in!

3
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,842
Get in there, Dude!

4
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,007
Get in now!

5
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,407
Got room for one more?

6
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,887
Who the hell are you?!

7
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,724
And what happened to them?

8
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,451
Name's Major Marquis Warren,

9
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,210
former U.S. Cavalry.

10
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,810
Currently a servant of the court.

11
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,605
Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.

12
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,762
Got the paperwork on 'em in my pocket.

13
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,008
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

14
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,963
Figure that's where you headed, right?

15
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
I am.

16
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,891
That damn blasted blizzard

17
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,968
has been on our ass
for the last three hours.

18
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,361
There ain't no way we gonna
make it all the way to Red Rock

19
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,847
'fore it catches us.
- So you hightailin' it halfway,

20
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,086
to Minnie's Haberdashery?

21
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,242
You know I am.

22
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
May I come aboard?

23
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,722
Well, smoke,

24
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,889
if it up to me, yes.

25
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,008
But it ain't up to me.

26
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,724
Who's it up to?

27
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,569
Fella in the wagon.

28
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,126
Fella in the wagon
ain't partial to company?

29
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,447
Fella in the wagon,
he paid for a private trip,

30
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,130
and I'm here to tell you,

31
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,083
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.

32
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,010
So if you want to go
to Minnie's with us,

33
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,327
you gonna have to talk to him.

34
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,327
That's what I'll do.

35
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,929
Hold it, black fella.

36
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,408
'Fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours

37
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,763
and you lay 'em on that rock
over yonder.

38
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,363
Then you raise both your hands
way above your hat.

39
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,642
Then you approach.

40
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,205
Molasses-like.

41
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,402
Real trustin' fella?

42
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,363
Not so much.

43
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,888
Put 'em down.

44
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,409
Come on ahead.

45
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,888
I said way above your hat, goddamn it!

46
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,931
Now come forward.

47
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,844
That's far enough.

48
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,729
Well, I'll be dogged.

49
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,644
You a black fella I know.

50
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,087
Colonel somethin'-or-other
Warren, right?

51
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,124
Major Marquis Warren.

52
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,004
I know you, too.

53
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,088
We, shared a steak dinner

54
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,168
once upon a time in Chattanooga.

55
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,089
You John Ruth The Hangman.

56
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,690
That'd be me.

57
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,006
How long's that been?

58
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,531
Since that steak?

59
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,769
Eight months.

60
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,360
So why don't you explain to me

61
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,562
what a African bounty hunter's doin'

62
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,843
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

63
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
Trying to get a couple
of bounties in to Red Rock.

64
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,201
So you still in business?

65
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,765
You know I am.

66
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,684
Happened to your horse?

67
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,088
Circumstances caused us to have
to take the long way round.

68
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,123
My horse couldn't make it.

69
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,641
You don't know nothin'
'bout this filly here.

70
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,211
Nope.

71
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,607
Don't even know her name?
- Nope.

72
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,406
Well, I guess that makes this
one fortuitous wagon.

73
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,483
I sure as hell hope so.

74
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,161
Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.

75
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,570
Domergue, to you this is Major Warren.

76
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,170
Howdy, nigger.

77
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,683
She's a pepper, ain't she?

78
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
Now, girl, don't you know
the darkies don't like

79
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,921
being called niggers no more?

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,286
They find it offensive.

81
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,925
I been called worse.

82
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,445
Now, that I can believe.

83
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,971
You never heard of her?

84
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,411
Should I?

85
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,090
Well, she ain't no John Wilkes Booth,

86
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,089
but maybe you might heard tell

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,043
about the price on her head.

88
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,924
HOW much?
- $10,000.

89
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,081
What'd she do, kill Lily Langtry?

90
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,804
Not quite.

91
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,810
That ten thousand's practically
in my pocket.

92
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,288
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,

93
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,841
especially to professionals
open for business.

94
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,485
I can certainly appreciate that.

95
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,444
But I ain't got no designs on her.

96
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,211
One of my fellas over there
is worth $4,000,

97
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,369
another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

98
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,925
That's damn sure good enough for me.

99
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,085
Let me see their paperwork.

100
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,443
Like I said, molasses-like.

101
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,281
Back off.

102
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,328
Look, I sure hate to interrupt you all,

103
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,081
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass

104
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,009
that we're tryin' to beat to shelter!

105
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,521
I realize that! Now, shut your mouth

106
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,246
and hold them damn horses
while I think!

107
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,366
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

108
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,729
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

109
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,041
You ain't really gonna let that nigger

110
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,571
ride in here, is ya?

111
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,045
I mean, maybe up there with O.B...

112
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,527
How ya like the sound
of them bells, bitch?

113
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,005
They real pretty, ain't they?

114
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,409
You open up your trashy mouth again,

115
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,284
I'll knock out them front teeth for ya.

116
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,402
You got it?

117
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,528
Let me hear ya say, "I got it."

118
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,091
I got it.

119
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,443
I'm gonna need a hand tyin'
these fellas up on the roof.

120
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,131
Give O.B. $50 when we get to Red Rock.

121
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,241
He'll help ya.

122
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,885
Well, I agree with O.B.

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,650
This storm got me concerned.

124
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,922
We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.

125
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,964
Goddamn it to hell,
I'm already regrettin' this.

126
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,970
Now, I can't likely help you
tie fellas to the roof

127
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,570
with my wrist cuffed to hers.

128
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,489
And my wrist is gonna stay
cuffed to hers,

129
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,602
and she ain't never gonna
leave my goddamn side

130
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,564
till I personally put her
in the Red Rock jail!

131
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,330
Now, do you got that?!

132
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,090
Yeah, I got it.

133
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,890
Get in, Dude!

134
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,441
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

135
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,287
Cimarron! Leche! Get in!

136
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,368
So, what happened to your horse?

137
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,884
He was kinda old.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,685
I done had him for a bit.

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,848
When the weather took a turn
for the worse,

140
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,964
well, he done what he could,
but he couldn't make it.

141
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,401
Get in!
- That's too bad.

142
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,727
Yeah, it is.

143
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,889
Me and ol' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,923
Could say he was my best friend,

145
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,165
if I considered stupid animals
friends, which I don't.

146
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,726
Nevertheless, I'm gonna miss him.

147
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,682
Who's this Daisy Domergue?

148
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,491
A no damn good murdering bitch,
that's who.

149
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,204
Come on, boys! Get up!

150
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,810
I see you ain't got mixed emotions

151
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,410
about bringing a woman to a rope.

152
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,370
By "woman", you mean her?

153
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,000
No, I do not have mixed emotions.

154
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,722
So you taking her
into Red Rock to hang.

155
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,046
You bet.

156
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,480
You gonna wait round to watch it?

157
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,005
You know I am.

158
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,282
I want to hear her neck snap

159
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,731
with my own two ears.

160
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,569
Get up, boys!

161
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,126
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
- Get up!

162
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,208
My bounties never hang,

163
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,561
'cause I never bring 'em in alive.

164
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,800
We talked about this in Chattanooga

165
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
Bringing desperate men in alive's

166
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,685
a good way to get yourself dead.

167
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,729
Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping

168
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,126
if I don't close my eyes.

169
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,651
I don't want to work that hard.

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,603
No one said the job is
supposed to be easy.

171
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,768
No one said it's supposed to be
that hard, neither.

172
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,770
Get up, boys!
- But that, little lady,

173
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,769
is why they call him "The Hangman."

174
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,451
When the handbill says "dead or alive,"

175
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,369
the rest of us shoot ya in the back

176
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,050
from up on top of a perch somewhere,

177
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,924
bring ya in dead over a saddle.
- Get in!

178
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,726
But when John Ruth The Hangman
catches ya,

179
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,842
you don't die from no bullet
in the back.

180
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,445
When The Hangman catches you, you hang.

181
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,728
You overrate him, nigger.

182
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,487
I give ya he got guts,
but in the brains department,

183
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,400
he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well.

184
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,089
Now, Daisy,

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,921
I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.

186
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,331
When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means "shut up."

187
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,851
You got it?

188
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,769
I got it.

189
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Get in there!

190
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,728
Come on now, boys, get in!

191
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,521
# Little apple blossom

192
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,447
# What seems to be the problem?

193
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,888
All the ones you tell your troubles to

194
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,050
# They don't really care for you

195
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,369
# Come and tell me what you're thinking

196
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,929
# 'Cause just when the boat is sinking

197
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,362
# A little light is blinking

198
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,485
# And I will come and rescue you

199
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,241
# Lots of girls walk around in tears

200
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,001
# But that's not for you

201
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,851
# You've been looking
all around for years

202
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,045
# For someone to tell your troubles to

203
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,051
# Come and sit with me and talk a while

204
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,006
# Let me see your pretty little smile

205
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,090
# Put your troubles in a little pile

206
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,841
And I will sort them out
for you, all right.

207
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,360
I know we only met each other
the once before,

208
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,962
and I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy...
- Get up!

209
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,922
You still got it?

210
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,246
Do I still got what?

211
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,811
Get in, now!

212
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,048
The Lincoln letter.

213
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,810
Course.

214
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,241
Get up, boys!

215
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,885
Got it on ya?

216
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Where?

217
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,804
Right here.

218
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,570
Come on, boys! Get up!

219
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,887
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all,

220
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,725
and I can imagine you probably
don't like taking it

221
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,689
in and out of the envelope
all that often,

222
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,731
If you wouldn't mind, I'd sure
appreciate seeing that again.

223
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,285
Get in, boys!

224
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
You're right.

225
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,168
I don't like taking it in and out

226
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,442
of the envelope that much.

227
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,930
Seeing's how you saved
my life and all...

228
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,122
I suppose I could let you
read it again.

229
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,125
"Ole Mary Todd's calling, so I
guess it must be time for bed."

230
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,049
Ole Mary Todd.

231
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,361
Get up, boys!

232
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
That gets me.

233
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,688
It gets me, too.

234
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,849
You know what this is, tramp?

235
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,201
It's a letter from Lincoln.

236
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,800
Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!

237
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,288
They shared a correspondence
during the war.

238
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,805
They was pen pals.

239
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,810
And this is just one of the letters.

240
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,767
All the stupid...

241
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,366
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

242
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,481
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain

243
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,921
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!

244
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,611
You the one handed her
my goddamn letter!

245
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,245
I didn't give it to her,

246
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,328
I give it to you!

247
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,688
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

248
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,165
You ruin that letter of his,

249
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,248
that nigger gonna
stomp your ass to death.

250
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,603
And when he do, I'm gonna
sit back on that wagon wheel,

251
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,881
watch and laugh!

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,764
How is it?

253
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,723
Well, she ain't help it none.

254
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,683
But it's all right.

255
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,521
Is that the way
niggers treat their ladies?

256
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
You ain't no goddamn lady!

257
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,685
Hey, Mr. Ruth!

258
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,807
There's another fella on foot
up here on the road.

259
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,201
I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.

260
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,085
Considering there's
a blizzard going on,

261
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,770
whole lot of fellas walking around,

262
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,410
wouldn't you say, Major?

263
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,409
Well, seeing as how
I'm half of them fellas,

264
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,727
yeah, seems to be a lot of us.

265
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,726
This changes things, son.

266
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,322
$8,000 a lot of money for a nigger.

267
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,602
With a partner,
18's a whole lot better.

268
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,167
You really think I'm in cahoots
with that fella, or her?!

269
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,611
Put them on.

270
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,051
I ain't wearing no handcuffs.

271
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,083
You put those on, or you can stop

272
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,521
worrying about
this whole thing right now!

273
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,800
Hand your weapons to the driver.

274
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,809
Little jumpy, ain't you?

275
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,810
Never mind the jokes. Just do it.

276
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,365
If you say so.

277
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,488
I do.

278
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,725
I done done it.

279
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,609
You got 'em?

280
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,721
<i>I got 'em.

281
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,609
Okay, fella.

282
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,127
You keep holding that lantern
in that one hand,

283
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,369
and you keep that other hand
where I can see it.

284
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,211
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at ya.

285
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,200
Well, I'll be
a goddamn dog in a manger.

286
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,085
Is that you, Chris Mannix?

287
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,089
I'm sorry, friend,
do we know each other?

288
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,201
Not quite.

289
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,606
You know this fella?

290
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,848
Only by reputation.

291
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,005
Like I said, friend, you got me
at a bit of a disadvantage.

292
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,531
Keeping you at a disadvantage

293
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,802
is an advantage I intend to keep.

294
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,924
Whoever you are, mister,
you sure sound tough

295
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,123
when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.

296
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
I don't want no trouble.

297
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,921
I just want a ride.

298
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,281
I'm freezing to death!

299
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,930
Who is this joker?

300
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,648
You heard of the rebel renegade
Erskine Mannix?

301
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,728
Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

302
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,889
Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.

303
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,321
It's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

304
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,681
Brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?

305
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,202
Well, Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock,

306
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,687
my horse stepped in
a gopher hole in the snow,

307
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,121
fucked up his leg, had to put 'er down.

308
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,685
You got business in Red Rock?

309
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,330
Yes, I do.
- What?

310
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,044
I'm the new sheriff.

311
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,685
Horseshit.

312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,689
'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?

313
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,404
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

314
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,329
Now, once I get there,
they swear me in.

315
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,090
But that ain't happened yet.

316
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,725
And that's when you get your star.

317
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,002
You got anything that can
back any of this up?

318
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,361
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

319
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,450
And-and from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,

320
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,086
I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

321
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,200
And I figure you taking
them three dead bodies

322
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,242
into Red Rock to get paid?

323
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,521
Three dead.

324
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
One alive.

325
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,567
Who's that?

326
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,364
Daisy Domergue.

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,528
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

328
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,167
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

329
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,566
The hangman?

330
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,408
Well, I'll be double-dog damned.

331
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,045
You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!

332
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,286
It's John.

333
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,641
And you!

334
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,410
You're the nigger with the head!

335
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,562
Major Marquis!

336
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,808
My Lord, is that really the real head

337
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,161
of Major Marquis looking at me now?

338
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,766
Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.

339
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,564
So what's going on?

340
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,409
Y'all having a bounty hunters' picnic?

341
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,965
Never mind.

342
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,809
You taking them three dead bodies

343
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,960
and-and hurrying to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't you?

344
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,645
Well, the man in Red Rock's

345
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,401
supposed to pay you is me,
the new sheriff.

346
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,284
So if y'all want to get paid,

347
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,402
y'all need to get me to Red Rock.

348
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,409
Well, excuse me
for finding it hard to believe

349
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,081
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

350
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,804
So I'm supposed to freeze to death

351
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,127
'cause you find something
hard to believe?

352
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,803
No, I suppose not.

353
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,608
Put them on and come inside.

354
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,525
Then you'll freeze.

355
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,290
Then you'll hang.

356
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,448
How so?

357
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,645
Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?

358
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,245
I got to hold these horses.

359
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,488
I can hear you just fine from up here.

360
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,483
Well, you just heard me tell this fella

361
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,849
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?

362
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,480
Red Rock is my town now.

363
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,001
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?

364
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,485
No, sir!

365
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,080
Sorry, bushwhackers*,
* Guerrilla fighters in the Civil War.

366
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,242
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.

367
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,089
Now, when you finally get to Red Rock,

368
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,130
you gonna realize every
goddamn thing I said was right.

369
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,527
And I expect you, O.B.,

370
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,041
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock

371
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,004
that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.

372
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,009
Ain't no bounty on my head, bushwhacker.

373
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,203
You let me die, that's murder.

374
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,288
Hold out your hands.

375
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,889
O.B.!

376
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,968
Give the major back his iron.

377
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,444
One thing I know for sure,

378
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,244
this nigger-hating son of a gun

379
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,528
ain't partnered up with you.

380
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,723
Now, I'll help you protect your 8,000,

381
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,888
you help me protect my ten.

382
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,684
Deal?

383
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,129
Well, ain't love grand?

384
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,720
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,525
Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.

386
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,920
The name's John.

387
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,565
When we get to Red Rock,

388
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,250
I'll buy you and Major Marquis there

389
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,725
dinner and booze.
- Get in!

390
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,126
My way of saying thanks.

391
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,607
I don't drink with rebel renegades,

392
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,166
and I damn sure
don't break bread with them.

393
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,368
Well, Mr. Ruth, - Get up, boys!

394
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,811
You sound like you got

395
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,570
a axe to grind against the Cause.

396
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,604
"The Cause" of a renegade army?
- Get in!

397
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,768
Bunch of losers gone loco.

398
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,609
You bet I do.
- Get up there! Hyah!

399
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,320
You wrapped yourselves up
in a rebel flag

400
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,885
as an excuse to kill and steal.

401
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,407
And this ought to interest you, Warren.

402
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,921
In particular, emancipated blacks.

403
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,610
Sounds like my kind of fella.

404
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,724
Sound to me you been reading

405
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,640
a lot of newspapers printed
in Washington, D.C.

406
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,730
Anywho, I'm just trying

407
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,922
to let y'all know how grateful I am.

408
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,610
I was a goner.

409
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,085
And y'all saved me.

410
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,521
You want to show me
how grateful you are?

411
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,404
Get in there!
- Shut up.

412
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,126
Goddamn it, Daisy.

413
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,204
It's coming.

414
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,651
Get in there, Cimarron!

415
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Last piece.

416
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,244
Does he know how famous you once was?

417
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,600
I don't think so.

418
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,285
Giddyup!

419
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,050
Black Eye.

420
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,170
Do you know who he is?
- Get in!

421
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,760
Do I know about the $30,000 reward

422
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,201
the Confederacy put on the head
of Major Marquis?

423
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,924
Come on now, boys!

424
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,443
Them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.

425
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,164
Get in!
- They just never did get 'em

426
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,536
the right nigger head, did they?

427
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,483
No, they didn't.

428
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,011
But it wasn't for lack of trying.

429
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,685
Get in, boys! Get on!

430
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,

431
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,524
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

432
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,164
Ain't none of 'em found fortune.

433
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,204
The ones you ain't
never heard of no more,

434
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,084
they found me.

435
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,407
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

436
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,885
Once passions cooled,

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
it dropped down to eight, then five.

438
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,686
Get up, boys!

439
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,928
But I bet even when it was 5,000,

440
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,691
you had your share
of country boys coming to call.

441
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,929
You know I did.

442
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,691
Why'd they have a reward on you?

443
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,201
Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.

444
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,725
Get up, now!

445
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,922
And after I broke out of Wellenbeck,

446
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,805
well, the South took
my continued existence

447
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,684
as a personal affront.
- Get up!

448
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,690
And the Cause put a reward on my head.

449
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,847
Get in there!

450
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,480
What's, Wellenbeck?

451
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,125
You ain't never heard

452
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,696
of Wellenbeck prisoner
of war camp, West Virginia?

453
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,563
No, reb, I ain't never heard of it.

454
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,523
Did you bust out?

455
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,443
Major Marquis did more than bust out.

456
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,289
Major Marquis had a bright idea.

457
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,481
Get in, now!

458
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,927
So bright, you got to wonder

459
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,361
why nobody never thought
about it before.

460
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,928
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

461
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,081
Well, the whole damn place

462
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,605
was just made out of kindling.

463
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,610
So I burnt it down.

464
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,647
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

465
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,843
47 men burnt to a crisp.

466
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,009
Southern youth, farmers' sons,

467
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,246
Cream of the crop.

468
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,964
And I say, "Let 'em burn."

469
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,527
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

470
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,365
You joined the war
to keep niggers in chains.

471
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,363
I joined the war to kill

472
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,090
white Southern crackers.

473
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,248
And that means killing 'em
any way I can.

474
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,528
Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

475
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,483
drown 'em, burn 'em,

476
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,921
drop a big ol' rock on their head.

477
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,736
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers

478
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,524
in the ground.

479
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,404
That's what I joined the war to do.

480
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,760
And that's What I did.

481
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,928
To answer your question, John Ruth,

482
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,971
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,

483
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,890
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,809
that's when the South put a reward

485
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,206
on the head of Major Marquis.

486
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,084
And I made them trees, Mannix.
- Get in!

487
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,929
You best believe I ain't looked back

488
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,804
till I crossed the Northern line.

489
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,649
But you had a surprise waiting for you

490
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,842
on the Northern side, didn't you?

491
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,724
See, once they started pulling out

492
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,320
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

493
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,801
seems not all them boys were rebs.

494
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,844
Why, you burn up some of your own boys,

495
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,325
didn't you, Major?

496
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,807
How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

497
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,729
Wasn't the final Yankee death count

498
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,320
something like 37?

499
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,805
Giddyup!

500
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,604
That's the thing about war, Mannix.

501
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,165
People die.

502
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,803
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell,"

503
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,361
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

504
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,369
But if memory serves,

505
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,848
your side didn't look at it that way.

506
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,361
I think they thought 37 white men

507
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,847
for one nigger

508
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,122
wasn't so hot a trade.

509
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,528
I do believe they accused you

510
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,926
of being a kill-crazy nigger

511
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,122
who only joined the war
to kill white folks,

512
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,890
and the whole blue and gray of it all

513
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,136
really didn't matter that much to you.

514
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,605
Ha! Get up!

515
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,722
And that's why they drummed
your black ass

516
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,241
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

517
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,523
Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

518
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,005
Horseshit!

519
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry

520
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,091
would've shot him.
- Get in!

521
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,760
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

522
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,165
Get up!
- But they sure did

523
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,203
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?

524
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,163
Get up, boys!

525
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,931
But Warren's war record was stellar,

526
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,407
and that's what saved his ass.

527
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,609
Now, you killed yourself your share

528
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,009
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

529
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,122
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

530
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,130
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

531
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,810
Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders,

532
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,570
that's what.
- Get in!

533
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,762
And the fact that
Erskine Mannix's little boy

534
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,769
would talk about anybody else's behavior

535
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,282
during war time makes me
want to horse-laugh.

536
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,889
Don't you say anything about my daddy.

537
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,408
What he fought for was dignity
in defeat,
- Get up there!

538
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,841
And against the unconditional surrender.

539
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,407
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

540
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,522
We were your brothers.

541
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,011
Get up, now!

542
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,929
We deserved dignity in defeat.

543
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,805
Just how many
nigger towns did y'all sack

544
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,321
in your fight for dignity in defeat?

545
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,767
My fair share, Black Major.

546
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,486
'Cause when niggers are scared, -O.B.:

547
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,489
That's when white folks are safe.

548
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,084
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,

549
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,449
you can ride up top with O.B.

550
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,040
You done got me talking politics.

551
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,288
I didn't want to.

552
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,449
Like I said, y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.

553
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,608
Get in, now!

554
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,843
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window,

555
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,443
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep.

556
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,365
And dream about how lucky I am.

557
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,048
Get up, now!

558
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,446
Get in there!

559
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,924
Get in there, Leche!

560
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,849
Get in there!

561
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,404
What the hell is going on?

562
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,444
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

563
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,610
Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.

564
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,371
Just got through
putting the horses away.

565
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,209
Well, this ain't the normal line,

566
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,210
but we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

567
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,561
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

568
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,688
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

569
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,290
They ain't here.

570
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,687
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

571
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,368
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

572
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,329
He says they ain't here.

573
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,687
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

574
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,167
Who are you?

575
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,486
I'm Bob.

576
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,964
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

577
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,244
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

578
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,840
Whoa. You all right?

579
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,376
<I>Esperate!

580
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,801
I just put those other horses away.

581
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,969
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

582
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,560
I got two of my best men on it.

583
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,127
You heard him, freeloaders.

584
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,368
Get to work!

585
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,000
All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

586
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,406
Come on, let's go.

587
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,124
Open up!

588
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,856
You have to kick it open!
- Ya got to kick it open!

589
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,370
Kick it open!

590
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,289
Shut that door.

591
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,656
There's a goddamn blizzard out there!

592
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,045
You have to stop, close the door!

593
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,440
You got to nail it shut.

594
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,325
You have to, you have to nail it shut!

595
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,805
Hold it shut!

596
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,649
There's a hammer and nails by the door!

597
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,171
You have to nail it shut!

598
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,363
There's a hammer and nails by the door.

599
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,369
Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

600
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,884
You need, you need two pieces of wood!

601
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,816
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

602
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,080
Two pieces of wood!

603
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,567
The fuckin' thing is busted!

604
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,411
Not just one piece of wood!

605
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,851
Give me another piece of wood.

606
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,004
I need a nail.
- Here.

607
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,570
<i>Jesus.

608
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,721
That door's a son of a gun.

609
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,649
Who's the idiot who broke that,

610
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,728
that Mexican fella?

611
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,205
Good heavens.

612
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,651
A woman?

613
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,091
Out in this white hell?

614
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,409
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

615
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,811
Looks like Minnie's
got her a full house.

616
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,248
When did you fellas arrive?

617
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,443
About 40 minutes ago.

618
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,324
That cowboy fella in the corner,

619
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,363
that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.

620
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,403
The driver lit out.

621
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,329
Said he was going to spend the blizzard

622
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,521
shacked up with a friend.

623
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,246
Lucky devil.

624
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,488
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

625
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,126
Christ Almighty,

626
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,244
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

627
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,966
I think we all felt the same way,

628
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,163
but were a little too polite
to say something.

629
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,567
He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

630
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,364
Where's the well water?

631
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,005
Over there.

632
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,407
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock

633
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,285
when the blizzard stopped you?

634
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,563
Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.

635
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,491
Coffee beans.

636
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,166
Over there.

637
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,447
Get your hand out of there.

638
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,171
New sheriff of Red Rock's
travelin' with us.

639
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,170
Sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.

640
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,124
He's a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

641
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,321
Good.

642
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,646
Then you can share bananas

643
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,330
with your nigger friend in the stable.

644
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,681
So,

645
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,047
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

646
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,491
He's lying.

647
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,523
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

648
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,563
He's a Southern renegade.

649
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,370
He's just talking hisself

650
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,244
out of freezing to death is all.

651
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,328
What the fuck I tell you about talking?

652
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,965
I'll bust you in the mouth

653
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,321
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!

654
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,005
You never gave your name, sir.

655
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,248
John Ruth.

656
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,481
Are you a lawman?

657
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,965
I'm taking her to the law.

658
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,445
So you're a bounty hunter?

659
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,801
That's right, buster.

660
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,609
Do you have a warrant?

661
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,051
Yeah, course I do.

662
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,446
May I see it?

663
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,370
Why?

664
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,563
You're supposed
to produce it upon request.

665
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,411
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,

666
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,921
kidnapping this woman,

667
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,008
without a warrant in your possession?

668
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,764
What's your name, buster?

669
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,805
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

670
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,402
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

671
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,925
Oswaldo?

672
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,008
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

673
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,656
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

674
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,284
That's her.
- Yeah.

675
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,524
I see.

676
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,607
It says here "dead or alive."

677
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,563
Yeah. It does.

678
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,728
Well, transporting a desperate,

679
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,241
hostile prisoner such as her

680
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,209
sounds like hard work.

681
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,284
Wouldn't transporting her be easier

682
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,845
if she were dead?

683
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,645
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

684
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,286
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

685
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,296
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

686
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,004
He got to make a living, too.

687
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,487
Well, I appreciate that.

688
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,490
Allow me to properly

689
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,489
introduce myself.

690
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,523
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

691
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,041
the hangman in these parts.

692
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,650
Looks like I brought you a customer.

693
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,886
Yeah, so it would appear.

694
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,764
You ever spent two days or more

695
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,963
locked up with one
of your customers before?

696
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,082
I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

697
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,645
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.

698
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,841
You got it?
- I got it.

699
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,166
Jolly good.

700
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,884
You got anything in here besides coffee

701
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,764
that can help warm us up?

702
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,087
Well, the bar is open.

703
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,851
Follow moi.

704
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,324
Line, O.B.!

705
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,923
You're all right, you're all right.

706
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,804
Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

707
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,368
I'll feed and water the horses.

708
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,450
You go inside and get some hot coffee.

709
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,050
Got some stew cooking.

710
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,247
Should be done soon.

711
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,600
Now, look.

712
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,122
No matter how bad this blizzard gets,

713
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,368
we still got to feed these horses

714
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,086
and take a squat from time to time.

715
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,283
So me and Chris better lay out a line

716
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,562
from the stable to the front door

717
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,564
and from the front door
to the shithouse.

718
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,244
Good idea.

719
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,010
Come on, Chris.

720
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,165
I'll give you a hand.

721
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,405
Go inside. Get warm.

722
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,363
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

723
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,209
I offer to help, you say no?

724
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,808
You're right, amigo.

725
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,809
Muchas gracias.

726
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,883
All right. Follow me.

727
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,486
We're gonna drop one every ten paces,

728
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,210
from here to the door.

729
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,361
Now, you're wanted for murder.

730
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,528
For the sake of my analogy,

731
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,688
let's just assume that you did it.

732
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,928
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

733
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,963
to stand trial for murder.

734
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,209
And if you're found guilty,

735
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,924
the people of Red Rock

736
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,963
will hang you in the town square.

737
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,889
And, as the hangman,

738
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,209
I will perform the execution.

739
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,926
And if all those things

740
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,883
end up taking place,

741
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,004
that's what civilized society

742
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,442
calls justice.

743
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,449
However,

744
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,723
if the relatives and the loved ones

745
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,604
of the person you murdered

746
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,290
were outside that door right now,

747
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,721
and after busting down that door,

748
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,286
they drug you out into the snow

749
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,448
and hung you up by the neck,

750
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,928
that would be frontier justice.

751
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,964
Now, the good part

752
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,809
about frontier justice

753
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,561
is it's very thirst-quenching.

754
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,129
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

755
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,571
Well, not in your case.

756
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,080
In your case, you'd have it coming.

757
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,283
But other people, maybe not so much.

758
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,801
But ultimately,
what's the real difference

759
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,410
between the two?

760
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,161
The real difference is me.

761
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,770
The hangman.

762
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,644
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

763
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,041
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

764
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,201
It's my job.

765
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,765
I hang you in Red Rock.

766
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,604
I move on to the next town.

767
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,566
I hang someone else there.

768
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,810
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

769
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,810
will be a dispassionate man.

770
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,209
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

771
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,120
For justice delivered
without dispassion

772
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,882
is always in danger
of not being justice.

773
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,411
Amen.

774
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,091
No offense, cowboy fella.

775
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,124
Just gettin' your attention.

776
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,683
You got it.

777
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,451
What you writin', friend?

778
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,847
Only thing I'm qualified
to write about.

779
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,122
What's that?

780
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,248
My life story.

781
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,044
You're writing your life story?

782
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,565
You bet I am.

783
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,045
Am I in it?

784
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,724
You just entered.

785
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,890
Well, you like writing stories so much,

786
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,207
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

787
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,050
Who's asking?

788
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,049
I am. John Ruth.

789
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,561
I'm bringing in this one
to Red Rock to hang.

790
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,882
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

791
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,287
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

792
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,925
and I don't know who you are.

793
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,008
So, who are you?

794
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,009
Joe Gage.

795
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,088
What?
- That's my name.

796
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,406
Joe Gage.

797
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,329
Okay, Joe Gage.

798
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,169
Why you going to Red Rock?

799
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,322
I ain't going to Red Rock.

800
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,885
Where you going?

801
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,923
About nine miles outside of Red Rock.

802
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,127
What's there?

803
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,571
My mother.

804
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,966
Your mother?

805
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,128
Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

806
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,290
I just, got back
from a long drive, and,

807
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,928
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.

808
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,407
I was a partner.

809
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,320
First time in my life
I made a pretty penny.

810
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,521
Figured I'd come home

811
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,324
and spend time with my mother

812
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,164
for Christmas.

813
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,805
Now, that's funny.

814
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,924
'Cause you don't look like

815
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,644
the coming-home-for-Christmas type.

816
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,523
You know, looks can be deceiving.

817
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,530
Because I definitely am a

818
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,531
coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

819
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,970
Christmas with Mother, I mean,

820
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,082
it's a wonderful thing.

821
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,007
Now, is that,

822
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,804
good enough for you,

823
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,207
John Ruth?

824
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,482
For now.

825
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,126
You steer clear of my prisoner.

826
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,648
Hello, old-timer.

827
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,204
General.

828
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,682
You, sir, are a hyena.

829
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,841
I have no wish to speak to you.

830
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,568
I've been called worse.

831
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,842
Fair enough, General.

832
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,770
Sorry to bother you.

833
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,320
You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!

834
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,044
Kick it open!

835
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,600
That latch, you gotta kick it open!
- You gotta kick it open!

836
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,526
Jesus Christ!

837
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,005
Close it!

838
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,446
Close the door!
- What?

839
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,005
Close it!
- The goddamn door!

840
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,456
It doesn't have a latch. Close it!

841
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,845
It's already cold enough in here!

842
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,604
Doesn't have a latch.

843
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,616
You gotta hammer up a board.
- You gotta nail it shut!

844
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,960
The hammer and nails by the door.

845
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,520
There's a hammer and nails right there!

846
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,241
Hold this here, Chris.

847
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,485
Watch your fingers.

848
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,364
Really nail it in!

849
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,689
You need two pieces of wood.

850
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,564
You got to hammer another one.

851
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,444
One ain't good enough!

852
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,483
It's gonna blow right open!

853
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,681
Now, goddamn it!

854
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,564
Gonna open if you don't ham...!

855
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,250
Shut up!
- Got it!

856
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,647
Son of a bitch!

857
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,805
Jesus Christ.

858
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,809
That's door's a whore.

859
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,650
I get it. "Haberdashery."

860
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,603
That was a joke.

861
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,007
How's the coffee?

862
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,681
Now? Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

863
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,641
Navajo!

864
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,529
Guess who he is.

865
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,727
Buffalo Bill?

866
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,444
Hardly.

867
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,284
No. I'm...

868
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,129
Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...

869
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,288
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

870
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,561
You are?

871
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,728
Yes, I am.
- Well!

872
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,411
Good to meet you,

873
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,965
Mr...?
- Mobray.

874
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,327
I'm Chris Mannix.

875
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,851
The new sheriff in Red Rock.

876
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,201
Really?
- Pfft, horseshit!

877
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,765
Pay no attention to him.

878
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,370
Horseshit!

879
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,200
Fella warmin' himself
by that potbelly stove

880
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,760
is a hell of a driver named O.B..

881
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,321
That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.

882
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,002
<i>You comm' 'mo Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson'?

883
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,240
Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?

884
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,884
In my bag.
- May I see 'em?

885
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,604
Of course.

886
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,927
Who's, who's Lance Lawson?

887
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,441
He's a fella been sittin'
in the Red Rock jail

888
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,050
about a month now.

889
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,242
He's the fella who shot the fella

890
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,886
who was sheriff 'fore me.

891
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,287
Precisely.

892
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,088
Thank you.

893
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,966
What did she mean when she said,

894
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,924
"The bounty hunter's
nigger friend in the stable"?

895
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,283
He's got a nigger bounty hunter
friend in the stable.

896
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,528
But all that just to guard her?

897
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,809
I don't think that was
the original idea, but

898
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,526
that's the idea now.

899
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,927
Want a little snake bite
in your coffee?

900
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,445
Five of you?

901
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,562
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery

902
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,081
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

903
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,730
Yes, it does.

904
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,083
Are you the chap
with the Lincoln letter?

905
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,009
The Lincoln what?

906
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,602
Yes. The letter from Abraham Lincoln.

907
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,762
President Abraham Lincoln?

908
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,645
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

909
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,967
With the president?

910
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,084
Well, I'm sorry, I heard
that somebody in your party

911
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,964
had a letter from Abraham Lincoln.

912
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,570
I assumed it was you.

913
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,966
Not him!

914
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,765
Black fella in the stable.

915
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,370
The nigger

916
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,768
in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

917
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,362
The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

918
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,687
What'd you say your name was again?

919
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,689
Bob.
- Warren.

920
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,041
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

921
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,288
Minnie and Sweet Dave went
to visit her mother

922
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,164
on the north side of the mountain.

923
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,171
Minnie ain't here?

924
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,806
Yes, they're visiting her mother.

925
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,002
Her mother?
- Yes.

926
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,447
Never knew Minnie had a mother.

927
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,530
Well, everybody's got a mother.

928
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,963
Yeah, I suppose.

929
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,002
And she left you in charge?

930
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,485
Si.

931
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,683
That sure don't sound like Minnie.

932
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,041
Are you calling me a liar?

933
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,480
Well, not yet I ain't.

934
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,841
Just sounds peculiar is all.

935
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,849
What sounds peculiar?

936
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,008
Well, first off, Minnie never struck me

937
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,929
as the sentimental type.

938
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,840
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

939
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,720
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water

940
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,087
unless Minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head,

941
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,202
let alone take a trip
to the north side.

942
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,561
Well, that sounds a whole lot

943
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,286
like you're calling me a liar,
mi negro amigo.

944
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,120
Yeah, it do sound a whole lot
like that, don't it?

945
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,285
But I still ain't done it yet.

946
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,364
Minnie still serve food?

947
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,211
Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.

948
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,970
Then we serve food.

949
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,687
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

950
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,445
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

951
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,642
She rolls her own.

952
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,331
Red Apple Tobacco.

953
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,445
But, mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.

954
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,722
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

955
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,411
Just seeing if you do.

956
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,286
Fill 'er up, O.B.

957
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,328
Goddamn it.

958
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,847
Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.

959
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,248
Is that General Sanford Smithers I see?

960
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,968
You got a good eye, son.

961
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,244
Ha-ha! Well, I'll be double-dog damned!

962
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,362
General Sandy
"Don't Give a Damn" Smithers?

963
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,841
Captain Chris Mannix,
Mannix's Marauders.

964
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,490
Erskine's boy?

965
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,483
May I sit down, sir?

966
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,331
Well, according to the Yankees,
it's a free country.

967
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,683
General Sandy Smithers.

968
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,048
Did my daddy talk about you!

969
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,846
I heard you gave
those Blue Bellies sweet hell.

970
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,722
Me and my boys did our part.

971
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,241
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.

972
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,124
Hell yeah, we did.

973
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,328
Yankee sons of bitches.

974
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,762
I never knew your father, son.

975
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,363
But I always respected his resolve.

976
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,528
Well, thank you
for saying that, General.

977
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,371
Your respect would have meant
the world to him.

978
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,805
Can I get you some coffee?

979
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,524
That'd be nice.

980
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,728
Well, how about a blanket?

981
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,163
That'd be even nicer.

982
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,011
Hell, you know what? You can have mine.

983
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,402
Here we go, General.

984
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,083
So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?

985
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,049
If you don't mind my askin'.

986
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,964
My boy.

987
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,681
You got a boy that lives in Red Rock?
- My son.

988
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,240
Chester Charles Smithers.

989
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,728
He died out here a few years back.

990
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,962
Forgive me, sir.

991
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,367
There's no forgiveness needed, son.

992
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,883
Like I said, it was a few years back.

993
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,685
It was after he'd served his service.

994
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,009
He came out here
to the hills of Wyoming

995
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,929
to make his fortune.

996
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,768
Never to be heard from again.

997
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,290
I bought him a symbolic plot

998
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,643
in the Red Rock cemetery.

999
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,129
And I'm here to advise
a stone maker on his headstone.

1000
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,641
Was he a goner for sure?

1001
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,848
No chance he could be livin'
the cold life

1002
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,325
out in the woods?

1003
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,250
It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.

1004
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,807
If he'd have done
what he came out here to do,

1005
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,207
he'd have come home.

1006
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,406
Hold it. Close it, close it!

1007
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,450
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.

1008
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,767
Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

1009
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,801
just fucking hold it closed!

1010
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,208
Orale, cabron!

1011
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,847
Hold it closed.

1012
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,244
One more.

1013
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,045
Keep holding, keep holding,

1014
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,049
my negro amigo.

1015
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,170
We need two pieces of wood.

1016
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,161
Orale, cabron! All right.

1017
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,760
There you go, motherfucker!

1018
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,687
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

1019
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,408
Considering Minnie's
"no hats indoors" policy,

1020
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,443
which, if I remember correctly,

1021
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,483
was one of them Bar of Iron rules.

1022
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,206
Kind of rule she'd want kept up
in her absence.

1023
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,209
You seem to have
a laissez-faire attitude

1024
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,209
when it come to the hats.

1025
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,685
I'm guilty.

1026
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,491
I have a laissez-faire attitude
about the hats.

1027
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,046
How about we forget
about the hats today

1028
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,970
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on?

1029
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,447
We'll make tomorrow "No Hat Day"!

1030
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,446
A large black dog.
# Now take my tip

1031
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,210
# Before you ship to join

1032
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,601
His name was Henry, I believe.
# The iron gang

1033
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,609
Labrador.
# Don't be too gay

1034
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,290
# In Botany Bay

1035
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,246
# Or else you'll surely hang

1036
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,522
# Or else you'll hang,
you'll hang, said he...

1037
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,290
You know, my daddy...

1038
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,050
I said that my daddy

1039
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,896
always said that Davis
A plum tree.

1040
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,445
Was a courageous man,

1041
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,244
but he should've put the capital

1042
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,887
in Montgomery and not Richmond.

1043
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,287
Yes, sir. I agree with that.

1044
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,976
The army in northern Virginia
would've been used

1045
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,764
in a very different way.
I said the army

1046
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,884
of north Virginia would've been
used in a very different way!

1047
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,970
# They'll flog the poaching out of you

1048
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,321
# Out there in Botany Bay.

1049
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,329
Shut up!

1050
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,285
Do you know that nigger, sir?

1051
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,210
I don't know that nigger.

1052
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,723
But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.

1053
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,282
That nigger just ain't any nigger.

1054
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,845
That nigger, he...

1055
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,291
General Sanford Smithers?

1056
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,807
Battle of Baton Rouge?

1057
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,804
Inform the nigger

1058
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,924
in the cavalry officer's uniform

1059
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,725
that I had a division of Confederates

1060
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,081
under my command

1061
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,123
in Baton Rouge.

1062
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,971
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...

1063
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,651
I heard him, hillbilly.

1064
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,322
Inform this old cracker
that I was in Baton Rouge also.

1065
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,885
On the other side.

1066
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,369
That's interesting.

1067
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,323
General Smithers,

1068
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,444
he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si...

1069
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,090
Captain Mannix,

1070
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,043
tell the nigger

1071
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,527
that I don't acknowledge niggers

1072
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,165
in Northern uniforms.

1073
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,163
You captured a whole colored command

1074
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,970
that day,

1075
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,368
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

1076
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,847
We didn't have the time or the food,

1077
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,043
nor the inclination

1078
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,527
to care for Northern horses

1079
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,847
and least of all...

1080
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,968
Northern niggers!

1081
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,684
So we shot 'em where they stood!

1082
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,207
Gentlemen.

1083
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,244
Gentlemen.

1084
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,966
I know Americans aren't apt

1085
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,924
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender

1086
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,691
get in the way of a good war.

1087
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,565
But I strongly suggest we don't restage

1088
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,001
the Battle of Baton Rouge

1089
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,691
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.

1090
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,248
My Nubian friend,

1091
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,125
while I realize passions are high,

1092
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,208
that was a while ago.

1093
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,642
And if you shoot this unarmed old man,

1094
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,730
I guarantee I will hang you by the neck

1095
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,566
until you are dead
once we arrive in Red Rock.

1096
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,727
I damn well guarantee that, too.

1097
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,205
Yeah, Warren,

1098
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,970
that's the problem with old men.

1099
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,923
You can kick 'em down the stairs

1100
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,442
and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.

1101
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,291
Gentlemen... since we may be

1102
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,442
trapped here,

1103
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,449
close together-like,

1104
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,767
for a few days,

1105
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,282
may I suggest a possible solution?

1106
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,484
We divide Minnie's in half.

1107
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,648
The Northern side

1108
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,286
and the Southern side.

1109
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,165
With the dinner table

1110
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,567
operating as a

1111
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,569
neutral territory.

1112
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,690
We could say that the fireplace

1113
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,167
side of the room acts as a

1114
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,080
a symbolic representative of...

1115
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,725
Georgia.

1116
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,887
While the bar

1117
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,650
represents

1118
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,602
Philadelphia!

1119
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,724
Long as the bar's Philadelphia...

1120
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,763
I agree.

1121
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,010
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?

1122
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,169
Thank you.
- I help you protect your $8,000,

1123
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,682
you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.

1124
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,569
One of them fellas

1125
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,162
is not what he says he is.

1126
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,805
What is he?

1127
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,924
In cahoots with this one,
that's what he is.

1128
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,646
One of them, maybe even two of them,

1129
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,889
is here to see Domergue goes free.

1130
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,562
To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

1131
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,523
They got 'em a couple of days,

1132
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,927
so all they got to do is sit tight

1133
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,448
and wait for a window of opportunity.

1134
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,131
And that's when they strike.

1135
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,446
Bitch?

1136
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,086
If you say so, John.

1137
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,241
Are you sure you
ain't just being paranoid?

1138
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,250
Our best bet is this duplicitous fella

1139
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,284
ain't as cool a customer as Daisy here.

1140
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,046
He won't have
the leather patience it takes

1141
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,891
to just sit here and... wait.

1142
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,207
Waiting for an opportunity

1143
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,569
and knowing it's the right one
isn't so easy.

1144
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,444
He can't handle it,

1145
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,483
he'll stop waitin'.

1146
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,568
Try and create his opportunity,

1147
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,889
and that's when Mr. Jumpy
reveals himself.

1148
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,930
Now, what you got
to say about all this?

1149
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,610
What do I got to say?

1150
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,610
About John Ruth's ravings?

1151
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,969
He's absolutely right.

1152
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,290
Me and one
of them fellas is in cahoots.

1153
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,609
We're just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep.

1154
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,246
That's when we're gonna kill y'all.

1155
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,325
Okay, everybody.

1156
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,445
Hear this.

1157
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,328
This here is Daisy Domergue.

1158
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,690
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

1159
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,371
$10,000.

1160
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,131
That money's mine, boys.

1161
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,891
Don't want to share it,

1162
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,287
and I ain't gonna lose it.

1163
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,249
When that sun comes out,

1164
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,251
I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

1165
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,891
Is there anybody here

1166
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,049
committed to stoppin' me

1167
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,929
from doing that?

1168
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,209
Really?

1169
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,891
Nobody got a problem with this?

1170
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,050
I guess that's very fortunate for me.

1171
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,850
However...

1172
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,248
I hope you all understand

1173
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,528
I can't just

1174
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,563
take your word.

1175
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,331
Circumstances force me to

1176
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,488
take

1177
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,762
precautions.

1178
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,690
When you say

1179
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,531
"precautions"

1180
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:03,201
why do I feel that you mean me?

1181
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,129
Because I'm gonna take your gun, son.

1182
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,810
You are?

1183
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,365
Yes, I am.

1184
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,723
Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

1185
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,491
Hangman's got himself a gun, too.

1186
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,281
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.

1187
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,523
I feel kind of

1188
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,529
naked without it.

1189
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,450
I still got mine.

1190
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,442
I'll protect you.

1191
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,121
A bastard's work is never done.

1192
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,322
John Ruth?

1193
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,444
That's right, Joe Gage.

1194
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,847
Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it

1195
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,408
you're gonna have to come and take...

1196
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,769
Calm down.

1197
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,530
Take your hand away from your gun.

1198
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,888
Blink if you're calm.

1199
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,365
He blink?

1200
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,811
He blinked.

1201
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,129
Blink if you're gonna remain calm.

1202
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,484
He blinked.

1203
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,409
Take his pistol.

1204
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,002
I'm real sorry about this, son.

1205
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,843
Like I said

1206
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,281
nothing personal, just

1207
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,607
a precaution.

1208
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,722
Pretty sneaky.

1209
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,051
Afraid the same applies to you, too,

1210
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,606
Mr... Mobray.

1211
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,688
Precautions must be taken

1212
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,088
because life is too sweet to lose.

1213
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,801
Hand me that little bucket.

1214
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,407
Go to the outhouse.

1215
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,161
Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.

1216
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,641
Why do I got to go outside?

1217
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,410
Well, your jacket's already on,

1218
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,524
and I sorta kinda trust you.

1219
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,044
Grab the other cup.
- Yeah, I got it.

1220
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,282
After you, Major.

1221
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,563
I'm gonna cut you loose while we eat.

1222
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,082
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

1223
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,010
Lift your ass
even one inch off that seat,

1224
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,761
and I'll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat.

1225
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,121
Come here.

1226
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,561
So, Domergue...

1227
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,809
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

1228
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,922
far as you're concerned.

1229
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,048
You don't hear me complainin', do ya?

1230
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,288
No, I sure don't.

1231
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,725
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

1232
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,049
How 'bout me what?

1233
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,762
Considering all the things
I done for money,

1234
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,769
I ain't one to judge, but

1235
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,121
don't you feel
just the least little bad

1236
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,641
about hangin' a woman?

1237
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,570
Well, until they invent
a trigger a woman can't pull,

1238
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,889
if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.

1239
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,490
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess

1240
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,762
I ain't never looked at it
like that before.

1241
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,326
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there,

1242
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,283
it's the only thing does the job.

1243
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,290
You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

1244
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,370
But mean bastards, you need to hang.

1245
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,611
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1246
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,922
I almost died out there!

1247
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,841
I ain't ever... going out in that shit

1248
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,089
ever, ever again!

1249
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,883
You okay, O.B.?

1250
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,411
I'm fine.

1251
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,329
I'll be fine.

1252
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,489
I just need to get warm.

1253
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,001
You want some stew, O.B.?

1254
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,645
Stew?

1255
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,240
Later.

1256
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,848
That's nice.

1257
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,488
How you doing, Black Major?

1258
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,568
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.

1259
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,921
Leave me be from your horseshit.

1260
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,482
John Ruth says
you got a Lincoln letter.

1261
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,524
I told you, jackass,
go hee-haw some place else.

1262
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,244
That's right, John.

1263
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,283
You did say that, didn't you?

1264
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,402
I did.

1265
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,046
You got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1266
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,525
The... Abraham Lincoln?

1267
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,365
Abraham Lincoln?

1268
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,289
The president of the United States?

1269
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,207
Of America?

1270
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,727
Wrote you a letter...

1271
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,126
Personally?

1272
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,768
Personally, as in "Dear Major Warren"?

1273
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,087
No, personally, as in "Dear Marquis."

1274
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,361
"Dear Marquis"?

1275
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,811
Abraham Lincoln,

1276
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,696
the president of
the United States of America?

1277
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,849
May I see it?

1278
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,610
No, you may not.

1279
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,603
But the way John tells it,

1280
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,449
you weren't
jUSt some random nigger soldier

1281
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,608
picked from a pile of letters.

1282
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,849
Way John tells it

1283
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,883
y'all had a correspondence.

1284
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,408
The way John tells it

1285
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,081
y'all was practically pen pals.

1286
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,564
And a pen pal's

1287
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,081
practically a friend.

1288
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,367
John Ruth,

1289
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,403
you really think a nigger,

1290
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,763
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back,

1291
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,445
was practically friends

1292
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,006
with the president of
the United States of America?

1293
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,611
John Ruth, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1294
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,491
but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded

1295
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,688
with Abraham Lincoln.

1296
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,450
Least of all,

1297
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,523
that nigger there!

1298
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,247
Was all that horseshit?

1299
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,121
Course it was.

1300
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,691
Good one, Warren!

1301
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,604
Talk that sass, nigger!

1302
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,127
Talk that sass!

1303
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,441
Well, I guess it's true
what they say about you people.

1304
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,688
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

1305
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,361
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1306
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,164
I hurt your feelings?

1307
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,601
As a matter of fact

1308
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,529
you did.

1309
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,285
I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with,

1310
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,368
so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

1311
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,245
But you got no idea what it's like

1312
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,204
being a black man facin' down America.

1313
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,687
Only time black folks is safe

1314
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,087
is when white folks is disarmed.

1315
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,205
And this letter had the desired effect

1316
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,244
of disarmin' white folks.

1317
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,565
Call it what you want.

1318
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,684
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

1319
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,440
You want to know why I lie

1320
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,006
about somethin' like that, white man?

1321
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,528
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it?

1322
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,927
Well, I'll tell you
like the good Lord told John.

1323
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,441
A letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have had

1324
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,483
that kind of effect on me.

1325
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,523
I might let a whore piss on it.

1326
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:23,008
I spit on it.
- Good for you, sister!

1327
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,325
Warren.

1328
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,966
Goddamn it,
you leave that old man alone.

1329
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,048
Stand down, you son of a bitch.

1330
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,766
I shared a battlefield with this man.

1331
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,123
Or would you deny me that, too?

1332
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,323
I suppose you were there.

1333
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,169
May I Join you?

1334
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,081
Yes, you may.

1335
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,924
Damn it.

1336
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,762
So, how's life since the war?

1337
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,849
Got both my legs.

1338
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,282
Both my arms.

1339
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,568
I can't complain.

1340
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,207
Got a woman?

1341
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,800
Fever took her
start of this last winter.

1342
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,169
What was her name?

1343
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,647
Betsy.

1344
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,161
Georgia gal?

1345
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,203
Augusta.

1346
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,281
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

1347
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,210
I used to raise Kentucky horses.

1348
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,891
And her pa was the owner
of the breedership

1349
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,082
where I bought most of my ponies.

1350
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,005
Goddamn it.

1351
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,009
I made a good deal on her.

1352
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,407
Took the stake he gave me

1353
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,921
and bought a bunch of peach orchards.

1354
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,122
Set myself up pretty well.

1355
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,123
Did a hell of a lot better

1356
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,409
than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.

1357
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,887
Yeah, your boy come up here
a few years back.

1358
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,722
He spoke highly of his mama, too.

1359
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,451
You knew my boy?

1360
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,245
Did I know him?

1361
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,249
Yeah, I knew him.

1362
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,840
You did not know my boy.

1363
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,924
Suit yourself.

1364
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,122
Did you know my son?

1365
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,642
I know the day he died.

1366
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,525
Do you?
- No.

1367
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,688
Do you want to know what day that was?

1368
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,403
The day

1369
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,522
he met me.

1370
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,249
He come up here

1371
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,567
to do a little nigger head-huntin'.

1372
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,286
By then, the reward was

1373
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,046
$5,000 and braggin' rights.

1374
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,049
But to battle-hard rebs,

1375
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,731
$5,000 just to cut off a nigger's head?

1376
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:36,086
That's good money.

1377
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,363
So them Johnnies climbed this mountain,

1378
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,960
lookin' for fortune.

1379
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,210
There wasn't no fortune to be found.

1380
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,402
All they found

1381
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,329
was me.

1382
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,010
All them crackers come up here
sang a different tune

1383
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,442
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger's gun.

1384
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,205
Let's just forget it.

1385
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,529
I'll go my way, you go your'n.

1386
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,642
That's your boy Chester talkin'.

1387
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,331
You're a goddamn lie!

1388
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,442
"If you just let me go home

1389
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,722
to my family, I swear,

1390
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,561
I'll never set foot in Wyoming again."

1391
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,608
That's what they all said.

1392
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,247
Beggin' for his life

1393
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,328
your boy told me

1394
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,206
his whole life story.

1395
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,291
And you

1396
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,846
was in that story, General.

1397
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,965
And when I knew me I had

1398
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,650
the son

1399
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,401
of the Bloody Nigger Killer
of Baton Rouge...

1400
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,967
I knew me I was gonna have some fun.

1401
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,970
You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!

1402
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,009
General Smithers,
don't you listen to him.

1403
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,162
He didn't know your boy.

1404
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,090
He just heard tell
why you're here, is all.

1405
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,443
It was cold the day I killed your boy.

1406
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,289
And I don't mean

1407
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,801
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold,

1408
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,446
It was colder than that.

1409
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,643
And on that cold day, with your boy

1410
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,401
at the business end of my gun barrel,

1411
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,086
I made him strip

1412
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,204
right down to his bare ass.

1413
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,888
Then I told him to start walkin'.

1414
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,645
I walked his naked ass for two hours

1415
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,240
'fore the cold collapsed him.

1416
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,130
You never even knew my boy?

1417
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,561
No, he didn't!

1418
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,920
He's just a sneaky nigger

1419
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,724
trying to get you to go for that gun.

1420
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,164
Then... he commenced to beggin' again.

1421
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,921
But this time,
he wasn't beggin' to go home.

1422
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,482
He knew he'd never see his home again.

1423
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,841
He wasn't beggin'
for his life, neither,

1424
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,561
'cause he knew that was long gone.

1425
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,889
All he wanted

1426
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,162
was a blanket.

1427
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,682
Now, don't judge your boy too
harshly, General.

1428
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,122
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

1429
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,601
You'd be surprised

1430
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,883
what a man that cold

1431
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,685
would do for a blanket.

1432
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,770
You want to know what your boy did?

1433
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:05,523
I pulled my big black pecker

1434
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,007
out of my pants,

1435
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,600
and I made him crawl through the snow

1436
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,564
on all fours over to it.

1437
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,648
<i>F.

1438
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,846
Then I grabbed me a handful

1439
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,325
of that black hair

1440
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,922
at the back of his head,

1441
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,443
and I stuck my big black johnson

1442
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:37,724
right down his goddamn throat.

1443
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,447
And it was full of blood,
so it was warm.

1444
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:45,565
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.

1445
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,765
And Chester Charles Smithers

1446
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:53,566
sucked on that warm black dingus

1447
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,001
for long as he could!

1448
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,561
You're startin'
to see pictures, ain't ya?

1449
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,569
Your boy

1450
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,967
black dude's dingus in his mouth

1451
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,482
him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin',

1452
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,170
me laughin',

1453
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,483
and him not understandin'.

1454
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,610
But you understand, don't you, Sandy?

1455
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,520
I never did give your boy that blanket

1456
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,246
even after all he did,

1457
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,968
and he did everything I asked.

1458
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,722
No blanket.

1459
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,287
That blanket was just a
heart-breakin' liar's promise.

1460
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,010
Kind of like those uniforms

1461
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,168
the Union issued those colored troops

1462
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,080
that you chose not to acknowledge.

1463
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,690
So what you gonna do, old man?

1464
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,327
You gonna spend
the next two, three days

1465
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,649
ignorin' the nigger
that killed your boy?

1466
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,401
Ign0rin' how I made him suffer?

1467
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,241
Ignoring how I made him

1468
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,443
lick... all over my johnson?

1469
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,165
The dumbest thing your boy ever did

1470
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,204
was to let me know

1471
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,766
he was your boy.

1472
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,848
About 15 minutes has past

1473
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,850
since we last left our characters.

1474
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:27,885
Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smithers' dead body outside.

1475
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,129
Straws were drawn
to see who'd help him.

1476
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,641
O.B. lost.

1477
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,331
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate

1478
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,408
about the legality
of the self-defense murder

1479
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,124
that just transpired.

1480
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,686
Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident

1481
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,127
about the legality
of what just transpired,

1482
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,891
ignored them,
sat at the table by himself

1483
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,128
and drank brandy.

1484
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,566
Captain Chris Mannix donned
the dead general's coat

1485
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,365
and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

1486
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,363
Hey, Ozzie!

1487
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,568
Now, you got the right idea.

1488
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,648
Let's light this place up.

1489
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,888
John Ruth held the door closed,

1490
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,367
waiting for Joe Gage
and O.B. to return.

1491
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,090
Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.

1492
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,564
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot

1493
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,411
at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1494
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,807
John Ruth.

1495
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,841
Can I play that guitar over there?

1496
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:38,361
Let's go back a bit.

1497
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,922
Your boy, black dude's dingus
in his mouth.

1498
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,202
15 minutes ago, Major Warren

1499
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,761
shot General Smithers
in front of everybody.

1500
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,406
<i>But about 40 seconds before that,

1501
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,488
something equally
as important happened,

1502
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,728
but not everybody saw it.

1503
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,207
While Major Warren
was captivating the crowd

1504
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,688
with tales of black dicks
in white mouths,

1505
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,609
somebody

1506
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,324
poisoned the coffee.

1507
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:07,331
He did everything I asked.

1508
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,283
No blanket.

1509
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,483
And the only one to see him do it

1510
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,847
was Domergue.

1511
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,044
That's why this chapter is called

1512
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,128
"Domergue's Got a Secret."

1513
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,171
John Ruth.

1514
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,970
Can I play that guitar over there?

1515
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,563
You come back with
anything else but a guitar,

1516
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:59,041
my pistol plays a tune.

1517
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,811
"Domergue's Death March."

1518
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,251
You got it?

1519
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,722
# Listen for a moment, lads

1520
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,447
# And hear me tell my tale

1521
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,087
# O'er the sea from England shore

1522
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,000
# I was condemned to sail

1523
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,408
# Jury found me guilty, sir

1524
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,808
And said the judge, said he

1525
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,769
# For life, Jim Jones

1526
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,205
# I sentence you across the stormy sea

1527
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,451
# Have no chance of mischief there

1528
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,928
# Remember what I say

1529
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,123
# They'll flog the poaching out of you

1530
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,648
# Out there in Botany Bay

1531
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,684
# Waves were high upon the sea

1532
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,327
# The winds approaching gales

1533
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,129
# I'd rather drowned in misery

1534
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:57,040
# Than come to New South Wales

1535
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,365
# The waves were high upon the sea

1536
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:04,290
# When the pirates came along

1537
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,927
# But the soldiers on our convict ship

1538
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,601
# Were full 500 strong

1539
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:15,008
# They opened fire and somehow drove

1540
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,887
# That pirate ship away

1541
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,924
# I'd rather join that pirate ship

1542
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,681
# Than gone to Botany Bay

1543
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,329
And one dark night

1544
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:34,764
# When everything is quiet in the town

1545
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,171
# I'll kill you bastards one and all

1546
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,250
# I'll gun the floggers down

1547
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,807
# Give them all a little shock

1548
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,244
# Remember what I say

1549
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,489
# Yet regret they sent Jim Jones

1550
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,444
# In chains to Botany Bay.

1551
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:07,088
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach?

1552
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,368
It's kinda pretty.

1553
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,289
Got another verse to it?

1554
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,323
Yeah, lots.

1555
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,851
Well, go ahead, sing it.

1556
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,722
Whatever you say, John.

1557
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,963
# Now day and night the irons clang

1558
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:35,801
# And like poor galley slaves

1559
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,969
# We toil and toil and when we die

1560
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,687
# Must fill dishonored graves

1561
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,565
# By and by I'll break my chains

1562
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:50,607
And to the bush I'll go

1563
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:55,681
And you'll be dead behind me, John

1564
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,486
# When I get to Mexico.

1565
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,880
Give me that guitar.

1566
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,686
Music time's over!

1567
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,968
Turn around!

1568
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,810
John, no!

1569
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,847
When you get to hell, John,

1570
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,928
tell 'em Daisy sent ya.

1571
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,727
Mannix, the coffee!

1572
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,365
Give me that fucking gun.

1573
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,802
Don't test me, bitch.

1574
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,525
Everybody!

1575
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,210
Get your backsides up

1576
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,203
against that back wall over yonder.

1577
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,840
Well, goddamn it!

1578
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,849
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.

1579
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,371
It's up to you.

1580
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,642
I'm gettin'.
- Then get!

1581
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,968
You, too, Señor Bob.

1582
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,445
Everybody turn around

1583
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,568
and put your hands on that wall.

1584
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,722
Move them damn snowshoes!

1585
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,763
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1586
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,490
Do like I say.

1587
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,364
You open your mouth,

1588
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,482
you gonna get a bullet.

1589
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,840
Move a little sudden,

1590
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,325
a little strange,

1591
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,681
you gonna get a bullet.

1592
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,041
Not a warnin', not a question.

1593
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,889
A bullet.

1594
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,321
You got that?

1595
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,891
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"

1596
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,324
We have it.

1597
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,802
Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.

1598
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,048
Take this gun out my holster.

1599
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,843
Point it at them.

1600
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,163
Now, like I said,

1601
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,045
anybody does anything,

1602
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,481
and I mean anything,

1603
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,284
you kill 'em.

1604
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,849
You finally decided
I'm tellin' the truth

1605
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,008
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock?

1606
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,842
I don't know about all that.

1607
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,440
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1608
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,086
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1609
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,770
One of them is.

1610
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,210
Give me the key. Give me the key!

1611
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,960
You motherfucking black bastard!

1612
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,242
You're gonna die on this mountain,

1613
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,761
and I'm gonna fucking laugh
when you do!

1614
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,210
What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1615
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,401
Bastard.

1616
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,887
Meant it, didn't I?

1617
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,525
And you need to understand

1618
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:55,927
you just killed the only man here

1619
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:59,169
committed to gettin' you
to Red Rock alive.

1620
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,008
Now, one of y'all

1621
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,090
is workin' with her.

1622
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,248
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1623
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,011
Or all y'all is.

1624
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,529
But only one of you

1625
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:21,005
poisoned the coffee.

1626
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,525
Now, what charms this bitch got

1627
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:30,325
make a man brave a blizzard,

1628
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,283
kill in cold blood?

1629
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:36,122
I'm sure I don't know.

1630
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,322
But John Ruth's tryin'
to hang your woman.

1631
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,249
So you kill him.

1632
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,282
Maybe.

1633
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:52,563
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1634
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,045
He damn sure wasn't.

1635
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,736
But he sure enough
layin' over there dead

1636
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,886
now, though, ain't he?

1637
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,082
He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.

1638
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,965
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1639
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,208
Like me, goddamn it.

1640
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,290
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall

1641
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,606
don't practice in poison

1642
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,449
need to think about that.

1643
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,645
Think about how it could've been you

1644
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,525
rollin' around here on this floor.

1645
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,086
And how the man standin' next to you

1646
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,690
would be responsible.

1647
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:23,286
And I know who I got my money on.

1648
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,767
That's right, Joe Gage.

1649
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,245
I'm lookin' at you.

1650
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,641
Not so fast, Chris.

1651
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,922
We'll get there.

1652
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:37,044
Let's slow it down.

1653
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,606
Let's slow it way down.

1654
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:46,884
Who made the coffee?

1655
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,604
He did.

1656
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,130
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1657
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:55,289
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1658
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,609
But it's the stew
that's got me thinkin'.

1659
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:02,964
Now, how long you said
Minnie been gone?

1660
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,650
A week?

1661
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:07,245
Si.

1662
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,970
See

1663
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,050
my mama used to make stew,

1664
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,083
and it always tasted the same,

1665
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,725
no matter the meat.

1666
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,763
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

1667
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,405
Uncle Charly.

1668
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,045
He made stew, too.

1669
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,844
And like my mama,

1670
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,851
I ate his stew from the time
I was a whipper

1671
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,361
till I was a full-grown man.

1672
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,483
No matter the meat,

1673
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:36,444
it always tasted
like Uncle Charly's stew.

1674
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,404
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew

1675
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,363
in six months, so I ain't no expert.

1676
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,565
But that damn sure is...

1677
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,365
Minnie's stew.

1678
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,847
So if Minnie is on the north side

1679
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,440
visitin' her mama for a week,

1680
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,410
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

1681
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,610
And this

1682
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:07,520
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

1683
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:09,688
When I sat in it earlier,

1684
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,609
I couldn't believe it.

1685
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,246
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

1686
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,601
This may be Minnie's place,

1687
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,008
but this is damn sure

1688
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,202
Sweet Dave's chair.

1689
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:27,683
And if he went to the north side

1690
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,681
I'm pretty goddamn sure

1691
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,485
this chair be goin' with him.

1692
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,963
What's in the chair?

1693
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:43,242
Just what I thought.

1694
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:46,370
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1695
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,130
<i>HON.!

1696
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,964
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1697
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,404
So, are you actually
accusing me of murder?

1698
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,570
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

1699
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,843
is whoever is workin' with her

1700
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,804
ain't who they say they is.

1701
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,763
And if it's you,

1702
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,008
that means Minnie and her man

1703
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,963
ain't at her mama's.

1704
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,562
They layin' out back there
dead somewhere.

1705
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:20,728
Or if it's you, little British man,

1706
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,049
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

1707
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,686
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

1708
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,565
Or we go by my theory,

1709
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:32,604
which is the ugliest guy did it.

1710
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:35,291
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1711
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:39,689
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

1712
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,768
while you were murdering the old man?

1713
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,246
Well, mi negro amigo,

1714
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,522
during that whole incident,

1715
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:52,246
I was sitting on that side of the room

1716
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:54,567
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.

1717
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:57,724
I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

1718
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,810
I said you didn't make the stew.

1719
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,802
My theory is

1720
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,924
you workin' with the man

1721
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,724
who poisoned the coffee,

1722
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,241
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,

1723
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,284
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

1724
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,244
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery
this mornin'.

1725
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,126
And at some point, y'all intended

1726
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,720
to bushwhack John Ruth

1727
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,605
and free Daisy.

1728
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,166
But you didn't count on the blizzard,

1729
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,329
and you didn't count on the two of us.

1730
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,968
That's far as I got. How am I doing?

1731
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,326
You're a real imaginative nigger,

1732
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,687
ain't you?

1733
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,644
So, do you intend to murder me

1734
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,081
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,

1735
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,607
or can you prove it, cabron?

1736
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:04,291
It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.

1737
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,165
And it's a little bit more
than a theory.

1738
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,091
How long you say
you been workin' for Minnie?

1739
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,964
Four months.

1740
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,605
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

1741
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,566
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

1742
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,126
Minnie mention that to you?

1743
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:33,205
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

1744
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,649
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

1745
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,605
Now, Minnie hung that sign up

1746
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,722
the day she opened this haberdashery.

1747
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:49,810
And it hung over that bar every day

1748
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:52,930
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

1749
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,284
You know why she took it down?

1750
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,686
She started lettin' in dogs.

1751
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,331
Now, Minnie liked just about everybody,

1752
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,608
but she sure don't

1753
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,563
like Mexicans.

1754
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:14,603
So when you tell me

1755
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:18,281
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

1756
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:20,971
well, I find that highly unlikely.

1757
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,368
But okay, maybe.

1758
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,086
But when you tell me

1759
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,841
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,

1760
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,925
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

1761
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,011
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

1762
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,130
Well, that's what I meant in the barn

1763
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,971
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

1764
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,044
Now I am calling you a liar,

1765
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,128
Senor Bob.

1766
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,402
And if you lyin',

1767
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,010
which you are

1768
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,680
then you killed Minnie.

1769
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,643
And Sweet Dave.

1770
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,481
Four measly bullets,

1771
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:25,729
and there goes Senor Bob.

1772
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,682
But that still don't get us no closer

1773
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,168
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

1774
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,327
Do it, Chris?

1775
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,448
No, it sure don't.

1776
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,801
Now, one of y'all poisoned this coffee

1777
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,331
to free Daisy.

1778
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,124
If I don't hear a confession

1779
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:52,369
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,

1780
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:55,051
I'm gonna pour this whole pot of coffee

1781
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,766
down that bitch's goddamn throat.

1782
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:02,243
Okay. Time's up.

1783
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:03,646
Stop!

1784
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,689
All right, I did it.

1785
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,723
It was me. I poisoned the coffee.

1786
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,810
I fuckin' knew it!

1787
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,887
You gonna die now,
you murderin' bastard!

1788
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,049
Major Warren,
please let me send this ugly

1789
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,049
son of a bitch to hell.

1790
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,969
You killed O.B.

1791
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:24,684
He was worth ten of you.

1792
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,484
Warren, can I kill him?

1793
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,806
Say adios to your huevos.

1794
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:38,085
Major Warren!

1795
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:58,443
I ain't got no gun,

1796
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,006
Sheriff.

1797
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,965
Roy!

1798
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,684
Good boy.

1799
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,085
Get up!

1800
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,331
Packer, Roy, get up!

1801
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,049
Charly, my boy.

1802
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,247
How the hell are you?

1803
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,771
Hiya, Ed. Hiya, Judy.

1804
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,761
How many you got?

1805
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:04,927
Full house today, friend.

1806
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,530
Got one in there waitin'.

1807
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,096
Well, he's gonna have
to keep on waitin'.

1808
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:09,121
We ain't got no room.

1809
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,571
Well, you need to tell Minnie.

1810
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,966
'Cause he been here two days,

1811
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,605
and Minnie wants him out of here.

1812
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,603
Well, I can't give him
a seat I don't have.

1813
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:18,240
Listen, why don't you take
the passengers inside

1814
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,725
and introduce 'em to Minnie,

1815
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,400
warm yourself up and drink some coffee.

1816
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:29,409
Here we are, everybody.

1817
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,851
Minnie's Haberdashery.

1818
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,256
Step outside, you and your friends

1819
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:33,486
can stretch your legs.

1820
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,960
When you're ready, step on inside,

1821
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,247
get warm by the fire,
get some coffee in you.

1822
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,169
I'll introduce you to Minnie.

1823
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:45,045
Hiya, Minnie!

1824
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,524
Now, Minnie, I'm not tryin' to tell you

1825
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:06,600
how to run your business,
but I would think coffee

1826
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,921
would be the first thing you'd make.

1827
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,480
Come on in, everybody. Don't be shy.

1828
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,965
Hats!

1829
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,447
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.

1830
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,769
Behind me, pluckin'
that chicken, is Gemma.

1831
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,407
Lovely smile, that Gemma.

1832
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,284
Now, the fella in the uniform
I don't know,

1833
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,402
but the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.

1834
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,681
Hiya, Dave.

1835
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,768
Hey, Judy.

1836
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,445
And, Minnie,

1837
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,005
these are the passengers.

1838
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,009
Well, that's not good enough.

1839
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,963
Go on, take away them rags,

1840
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,321
let's see some faces,
let's hear some names.

1841
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:41,046
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.

1842
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,446
Joe Gage.

1843
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,404
And I'm Jody.

1844
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,166
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm sanctuary

1845
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,487
in the middle of such a cold hell.

1846
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,125
Well, make yourself comfortable.

1847
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,526
Get warm by the fire.

1848
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,688
We're just gonna go warm ourselves

1849
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,450
by the stove, if that's all right.

1850
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,324
Stove, fireplace, whatever.

1851
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,441
Just get warm.

1852
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,800
And Judy said somethin'

1853
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,684
about the best coffee in the world.

1854
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,802
Yes. I do believe Judy
did say something

1855
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:09,241
about the best coffee in the world.

1856
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,720
Well, I don't know about all that,

1857
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,370
but I tell you what it is.

1858
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,005
It's hot, it's strong, and it's good.

1859
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:15,326
And in this here snow,

1860
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,090
it sure enough warms your ass up.

1861
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,521
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need to make it.

1862
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,205
And you need to get your ass out there

1863
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,402
and help Charly with them bags
and get Ed in here.

1864
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,362
But fix that coffee.
- I'll fix you!

1865
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,490
I don't know, some old man.

1866
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,728
Well, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about it.

1867
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,763
I'm just telling you what she said.

1868
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,689
Anyway, she sent me out here
to help Charly.

1869
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,280
She wants to talk to you.

1870
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,050
Charly, you got a hold of these fellas?

1871
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,725
Got 'em, Ed.

1872
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:03,363
Miss Minnie,
would you roll me a cigarette?

1873
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,891
Sure, honey.

1874
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,365
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.

1875
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,480
That all right?

1876
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,528
That's my favorite.

1877
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:15,285
Don't mind me, gentlemen.

1878
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,886
I'm just watching.

1879
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,685
You play?

1880
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,930
You know, I must have had
at least 12 people

1881
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,407
teach me that goddamn game.

1882
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,888
Just never could keep
the moves in my head.

1883
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:33,970
But if I'm not disturbing,

1884
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,241
I'd like to watch.

1885
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,771
Hell no. I like whippin'

1886
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,649
this old man's ass
in front of a audience.

1887
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,167
You ain't whippin' shit!

1888
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,406
Merci beaucoup, Mademoiselle Minnie.

1889
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:46,965
That's real nice.

1890
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,491
What is that?

1891
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:49,801
That's French.

1892
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:51,604
You speak French?

1893
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,085
Oui.

1894
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,441
"Oui"? What does that mean?

1895
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,289
It means "yes."

1896
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,681
Oui, yes.

1897
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:03,282
Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.

1898
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,164
Ask me if my ass is fat.

1899
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,566
It is.

1900
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:09,330
I said ask me.

1901
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:10,646
Why?

1902
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,524
Just do it!

1903
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,483
Is your ass fat?

1904
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,045
Oui.

1905
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,288
Look at that, y'all,
I can speak French.

1906
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,531
Jelly bean salesman around here?

1907
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,487
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?

1908
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:05,602
Five.

1909
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,728
All right.

1910
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,327
Here you go.
- Thank you, sugar.

1911
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:24,809
Allow me to assist you, madam.

1912
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,810
I'm bringing in your bags

1913
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,320
in case anybody wants to change
your clothes before Red Rock.

1914
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:02,210
Peppermint stick?

1915
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,365
So why do they call you
"Six-Horse Judy" anyway?

1916
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,730
'Cause I'm the only Judy
you've ever seen

1917
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:20,286
that can drive a six-horse team.

1918
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:25,407
Kind of a stupid question.

1919
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,084
Do you mind holding this for me?

1920
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,771
Rock steady, madam.

1921
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,531
Rock steady.

1922
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:40,725
You got a very sweet little accent.

1923
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,763
Where's that from, England?

1924
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,450
I take exception to that.

1925
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:48,600
New Zealand.
- Careful, madam. Precarious.

1926
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,290
Is that anywhere near, Old Zealand?

1927
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,651
Auckland?

1928
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:16,569
What the fuck's an Auckland?

1929
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,250
It's where I'm from.

1930
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,930
It's our biggest city.

1931
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:24,125
Coffee's ready.

1932
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,049
Well, it's about damn time!

1933
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,923
Best coffee on the mountain.

1934
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,247
I don't know about all that.

1935
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,648
Stagecoach drivers like it,
passengers not so much.

1936
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:38,081
Most find it a mite too strong.

1937
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,089
Can't be too strong on this mountain.

1938
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:49,770
What do you think?

1939
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:53,248
He adds something.

1940
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:54,805
Not much, but something.

1941
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,285
What you think, Pete?

1942
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,125
Well, I must admit,

1943
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:07,050
he does make the setup more convincing.

1944
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,530
I'll talk to the old man.

1945
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,926
You three collect the bodies

1946
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,849
and chuck 'em in that well out there.

1947
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:19,169
And then start unhitchin' the horses

1948
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,160
and gettin' 'em in the barn
and gettin' 'em fed.

1949
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,168
Well, hang on. I mean,
puttin' the horses away,

1950
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:24,964
that's easy enough,

1951
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,096
but draggin' these fat bastards
up and down the mountain,

1952
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,400
that's fuckin' impossible, mate.

1953
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:32,327
Well, this is a store,
so there's gotta be

1954
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:33,965
a wheelbarrow around here somewhere.

1955
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,844
Start with the horses,

1956
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:39,851
and as soon as I get through
with this old hickory tree,

1957
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,167
I'll come out and help you, okay?

1958
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,361
Grab my coat, will ya?

1959
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,603
# You're all

1960
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,564
<i>? >A' None a'

1961
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:19,889
# Feelin'

1962
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,891
# That nobody wants you

1963
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,486
And you're looking

1964
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:32,126
# For someone

1965
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:36,848
# To hold your hand

1966
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:39,725
# Someone

1967
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:44,528
# Who understands

1968
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:53,360
# You're by yourself

1969
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:59,161
# And you're feelin'

1970
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:02,164
# The world close

1971
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:04,806
In on your

1972
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:08,361
And you're askin'...

1973
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,482
Look.

1974
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:12,284
I just started workin' here.

1975
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,368
Whatever Minnie did
to make y'all mad...

1976
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,483
I had nothin' to do with it.

1977
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,170
# Someone...

1978
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:32,291
Well, old man.

1979
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,684
If you

1980
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:37,404
was a cat,

1981
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,330
what just happened here

1982
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,681
would count as one of your nine lives.

1983
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,971
Do you realize how close you came

1984
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:50,009
to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

1985
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,649
And when it comes
to that pile of niggers

1986
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,569
that we buildin' out back,

1987
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,569
won't take nothin'
to make you general of it.

1988
02:13:57,680 --> 02:13:59,842
You believe that?

1989
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,201
I expect no less.

1990
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:05,563
Not so fast, old man.

1991
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,722
You might have a way out of this yet.

1992
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:14,129
Later today,

1993
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,011
son of a gun

1994
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:21,327
is gonna come in here,

1995
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,850
and he's gonna have my sister with him.

1996
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:31,521
And he is gonna have her in chains.

1997
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,689
He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.

1998
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,081
Do you know why?

1999
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:57,728
$10,000.

2000
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:02,963
That's why.

2001
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:05,003
Now, when he gets here,

2002
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:09,489
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

2003
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:13,491
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

2004
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:16,570
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

2005
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,001
You don't?

2006
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:20,281
No, I don't.

2007
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,890
You sure you don't?

2008
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,083
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

2009
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,611
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked

2010
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,000
mighty chummy over here.

2011
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,281
I just met these people!

2012
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,004
I don't give a damn about them!

2013
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:34,361
Or you. Or your sister.

2014
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:37,763
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.

2015
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:41,282
That is a good answer,

2016
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:43,886
old man.

2017
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,162
Now, when they get here,

2018
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:49,324
you just sit your ass in this chair,

2019
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,602
and you don't do nothin'.

2020
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,926
You don't say nothin'.

2021
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:54,161
"Hello."

2022
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,280
"Thank you."

2023
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,321
"Good night."

2024
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:57,646
That's about it.

2025
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,684
Maybe your name.

2026
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,926
But that's it.

2027
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,530
"Hello."

2028
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:04,641
"Thank you."

2029
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,609
"Good night."

2030
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:09,127
And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.

2031
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:12,289
Be a old man.

2032
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:13,811
Be dotty.

2033
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,082
Go to sleep.

2034
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,851
And don't you say nothin',

2035
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,042
and I mean nothin',

2036
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,049
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.

2037
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,810
Do you understand?

2038
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:31,369
When it's Safe, I'll kill him,

2039
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:32,925
free my sister

2040
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,441
and leave you be.

2041
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,808
Deal?

2042
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:45,444
Deal.

2043
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,164
Thank you.

2044
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,164
During the next four hours,

2045
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,408
Jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well

2046
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,842
put away the horses

2047
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:01,929
tidied up around Minnie's

2048
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,248
stashed weapons for further use,

2049
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:14,201
and waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.

2050
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:18,210
All right, boys.

2051
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:19,845
This is it.

2052
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,684
Let's get ready.

2053
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,243
Now, remember,

2054
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:31,931
it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,

2055
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:33,804
we are still gonna be facing John Ruth

2056
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,126
chained to my sister

2057
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,810
with a pistol pointed at her belly.

2058
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,570
Now, killin' that fella

2059
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:40,808
'fore he kills my sister
ain't gonna be easy,

2060
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,685
but you better believe that's
exactly what we gonna do.

2061
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:47,009
So the name of the game here
is patience.

2062
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,521
Trapped here for two or three days,

2063
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:52,371
at some point he will close his eyes.

2064
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,165
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.

2065
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,089
Remember, old man.

2066
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,851
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive,

2067
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,161
neither do you.

2068
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:02,805
I'll do my best.

2069
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:21,011
Good luck, mate.

2070
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:35,608
What the hell is going on?

2071
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:37,848
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

2072
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,610
Yeah, I can see you.

2073
02:18:39,720 --> 02:18:41,120
Already got another one up in here.

2074
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:45,041
Just got through
puttin' the horses away!

2075
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,561
Well, this ain't the normal line.

2076
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,762
But we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

2077
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,416
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

2078
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,601
Now you gotta do another one.

2079
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,127
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?

2080
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,765
They ain't here!

2081
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:59,884
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

2082
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,207
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

2083
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,891
He says they ain't here.

2084
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,287
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

2085
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:09,169
Who are you?

2086
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,322
I'm Bob.

2087
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:18,923
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

2088
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,890
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

2089
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:26,281
Whoa. You all right?

2090
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,811
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2091
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,564
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

2092
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:32,524
I just put those other horses away.

2093
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:35,166
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

2094
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,681
I got two of my best men on it.

2095
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,964
You heard him, freeloaders.

2096
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,764
Get to work.

2097
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:46,123
All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

2098
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:52,376
You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!

2099
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:54,084
What?
- Kick it open!

2100
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:28,523
How you doin', old boy?

2101
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,922
They shot my nuts off.

2102
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:34,964
I'm freezin', burnin' up the same time.

2103
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,845
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

2104
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:40,566
I think I'm gonna die.

2105
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:42,648
And these motherfuckers did it.

2106
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:46,929
That's how I'm doin'.

2107
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:48,650
How you doin'?

2108
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:53,043
Well, my leg hurts really bad.

2109
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:56,369
But I think, if I put all
my weight on my right foot...

2110
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:57,925
I was just bein' sarcastic.

2111
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:59,929
I don't give a fuck about your leg.

2112
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,761
Now, you just

2113
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,962
make yourself comfortable.

2114
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,208
Don't worry about my comfort.

2115
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:11,927
Shit, I can't feel my ass no more.

2116
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:14,850
Worry about these owl hoots

2117
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:20,490
and that bushwhackin'
nut shooter in the basement.

2118
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,762
All right!

2119
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:27,841
You... fella in the basement!

2120
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:33,490
You either give up
by the time I count to three,

2121
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,763
or I shoot Domergue in the head.

2122
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,442
Don't shoot her in the head!

2123
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,005
I'm coming up.

2124
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:49,761
Hold on now,
you bushwhackin' sack shooter!

2125
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,405
You just open the door.

2126
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,483
We tell you when to come up.

2127
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,890
Now throw out your pistol.

2128
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,968
Toward the bed.

2129
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:08,563
Bet he got another.

2130
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:11,331
Now throw out your other pistol.

2131
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:12,965
I ain't got another pistol!

2132
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,162
Well, you better shit
another pistol out your ass,

2133
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:16,930
'cause if you don't throw one up here

2134
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:20,123
in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.

2135
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,848
Told you.

2136
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:31,568
Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em,

2137
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,129
slowly come on up.

2138
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:10,241
How you doing, dummy?

2139
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:15,048
Better, now I see your ugly face.

2140
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,125
How you like that?!

2141
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,044
You bushwhackin' castrator!

2142
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:27,401
What are you doing?! He was giving up!

2143
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:29,887
It took him too long,
so I done it for him.

2144
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:37,329
Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.

2145
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,282
I'm sorry, honey.

2146
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:09,329
May I sit in a chair?

2147
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:12,125
Yes, you may.

2148
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:23,800
Keep your hands flat on that table.

2149
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,888
And don't move 'em.

2150
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,207
Mannix!

2151
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:31,881
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.

2152
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,560
Don't you see,
that nigger and John Ruth

2153
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:35,569
put you smack dab
in the middle of danger?

2154
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,966
You're about to be murdered

2155
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,376
in some nigger named Minnie's house,

2156
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,289
and you don't even know why!

2157
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,447
I'll bite.

2158
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,651
I'm working with
all three of them fellas.

2159
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,728
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

2160
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:55,605
about me, but because
we're all gang members.

2161
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:58,007
The Jody Domingre Gang.

2162
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:01,647
That fella y'all just killed
in the basement

2163
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,250
was Jody Domingre!

2164
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:05,442
My brother!

2165
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:09,929
Well, who the hell is Jody Domingre?

2166
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:12,168
You want to tell him, bounty man?

2167
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,451
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.

2168
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:21,605
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2169
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:24,644
Which finally explains
why you worth ten.

2170
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:27,081
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

2171
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,931
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2172
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,929
Tell him, Grouch!

2173
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,361
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.

2174
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,322
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

2175
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:43,968
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

2176
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,651
and free Daisy there.

2177
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:50,287
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

2178
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:51,840
Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

2179
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,729
And, Chris, I am telling you,

2180
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:59,164
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2181
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,123
So, let's make a deal.

2182
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:02,730
No deals, bitch.

2183
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:05,286
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

2184
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:09,126
Hold it, Warren.

2185
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:12,250
Seeing as how she ain't got
nothing to sell,

2186
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:16,365
I'm kinda curious
about her sales pitch.

2187
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:17,686
Humor me.

2188
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:22,646
All right... bitch.

2189
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,967
What's... your... deal?

2190
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:38,082
Easy.

2191
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:42,808
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.

2192
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:46,766
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2193
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:50,043
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

2194
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:52,162
get that star pinned on your chest.

2195
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:55,324
Hey, Pete. How much can we pay him?

2196
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:59,650
Well, we could give him Marco.

2197
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:04,847
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.

2198
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,446
He's Worth $12,000.

2199
02:27:07,560 --> 02:27:09,767
That's Marco the Mexican?

2200
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,729
Precisely, yeah.

2201
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:17,645
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

2202
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:24,970
Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,

2203
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:27,606
which is more than likely,
you can have me.

2204
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:30,564
Under the name of English Pete Hicox,

2205
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:34,924
I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

2206
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:39,010
It's all yours, Chris.

2207
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:42,130
You keep talking, Pete,

2208
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:46,006
you gonna talk yourself to death.

2209
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:49,010
Joe Gage, who you be?

2210
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,610
Grouch Douglass.

2211
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:53,890
You heard of him?

2212
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,321
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.

2213
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:59,887
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2214
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,082
Well, remind me

2215
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:07,366
why we wouldn't just
kill all y'all, cash in.

2216
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:10,763
You can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

2217
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,166
of that bounty money,

2218
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,687
and you'll never
leave this mountain alive.

2219
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:17,121
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

2220
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:21,330
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

2221
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:24,171
Now, let's say you shoot us all.

2222
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:27,887
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

2223
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:31,044
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

2224
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:33,322
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2225
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:35,681
'Cause I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2226
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:38,650
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2227
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,689
So that means you're gonna have to lead

2228
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:43,451
a string of horses into Red Rock.

2229
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:45,887
And with that deep snow
after a blizzard,

2230
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,287
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

2231
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,482
say, one body per horse.

2232
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:56,403
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

2233
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:00,002
And with all them horses in that snow

2234
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:03,124
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2235
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:05,561
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

2236
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:07,603
And again, Grouch, how many is that?

2237
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:09,085
15 killers strong.

2238
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:13,967
And when those 15 killers
come across you

2239
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,923
in possession of all our dead bodies,

2240
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:18,407
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

2241
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:20,443
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2242
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:24,042
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town!

2243
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:26,049
You really the sheriff of Red Rock?

2244
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:28,242
You want to save the town?

2245
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:29,930
Then shoot that nigger dead!

2246
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,009
Jesus Christ!

2247
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:36,841
You believe in Jesus now, bitch?

2248
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:39,486
Well, good,
'cause you about to meet him.

2249
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:42,883
Anybody else want to make a deal?

2250
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,650
The deal still stands, Chris.

2251
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:49,688
You ain't done nothing
we can't forgive.

2252
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:53,202
It's all still on that nigger.

2253
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:56,449
You shoot him dead, take my body,

2254
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:57,891
sit out in the snow

2255
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,081
with Daisy and Grou...

2256
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,611
You cunt!

2257
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:46,446
Mannix,

2258
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:50,087
give me my pistol.

2259
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,606
Give it here!

2260
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:18,050
So, you were saying

2261
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:22,324
we sit here,
all nice and friendly like,

2262
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,169
for the next two days.

2263
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:27,250
Then the snow melts, you leave here,

2264
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:31,490
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

2265
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,722
That's the deal, right?

2266
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:41,003
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

2267
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:45,287
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

2268
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:50,008
You gonna make a deal

2269
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:56,247
with this diabolical bitch?

2270
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,160
I ain't saying
I'm gonna make a deal with her.

2271
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,200
We just talking.

2272
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,489
Calm down!

2273
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:05,365
So what about Jody's body
and the $50,000?

2274
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:07,005
You're getting greedy, reb.

2275
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,485
No deal.

2276
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:10,125
We're taking Jody's body back with us.

2277
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,321
He got children.

2278
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:19,930
So I kill Warren, and we all friends?

2279
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:36,128
No deal, tramp.

2280
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:41,365
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!

2281
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,448
When our boys get here
in a couple of days,

2282
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:45,164
they're gonna cut your nuts off!

2283
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:48,807
And there won't be a stick left
in that town unburnt!

2284
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:53,084
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now?

2285
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:57,564
If you had any brains, you would be!

2286
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:04,603
Here's the problem, Daisy.

2287
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:08,566
In order for me to be scared
of your threats,

2288
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:11,570
I got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members

2289
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,284
waiting it out in Red Rock.

2290
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:17,849
And boy, boy, I sure don't.

2291
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:23,203
What I believe is,

2292
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:29,168
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,

2293
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:32,568
poisoned the coffee.

2294
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:37,089
And you watched him do it.

2295
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:41,683
And you watched me pour a cup,
and you didn't say shit!

2296
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:49,606
I believe you are
what you've always been,

2297
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:54,009
a lying bitch who will do anything

2298
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,162
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in Red Rock,

2299
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:59,921
including shitting out
15 extra gang members

2300
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,686
whenever you need be.

2301
02:34:10,840 --> 02:34:15,209
I believe, when it comes to what's left

2302
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:20,645
of the Jody Domingre Gang,
I'm looking at 'em.

2303
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,366
Right here, right now,

2304
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:26,524
dead on this motherfucking floor!

2305
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,404
Goddamn right.

2306
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:32,650
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

2307
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:36,003
'Cause my brother leads an army of men.

2308
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:39,004
Horseshit!

2309
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:42,004
My daddy led an army.

2310
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:45,647
He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!

2311
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,287
My daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war

2312
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:53,769
with nothing but their respect
in his command!

2313
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:56,804
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!

2314
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,525
I don't feel so good.

2315
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:17,448
You still alive, white boy?

2316
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,045
Chris Mannix!

2317
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,403
If your ass ain't nailed
to the floor, wake the fuck up!

2318
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,608
Wake up, white boy!

2319
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:25,244
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.

2320
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:41,161
Chris Mannix, I may have misjudged you.

2321
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,250
Now we've come to the part of the story

2322
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:50,084
where I blow your goddamn head off.

2323
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,441
No! No, no, don't shoot her!

2324
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:54,961
Why the hell not?

2325
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,969
John Ruth.

2326
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:08,567
Now, John Ruth was
one mighty, mighty bastard.

2327
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:19,648
But the last thing
that bastard did 'fore he died

2328
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,569
was save your life.

2329
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:24,889
We gonna die, white boy.

2330
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,729
We ain't got no say in that.

2331
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:33,206
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.

2332
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:37,166
And that's how we kill this bitch.

2333
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:41,490
And I say shooting's too good for her.

2334
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:47,562
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

2335
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:52,607
But John Ruth was The Hangman.

2336
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:54,688
And when The Hangman catches you,

2337
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:58,361
you don't die by no bullet.

2338
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:02,690
When The Hangman catches you, you hang.

2339
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:05,929
"You only need to hang mean bastards,"

2340
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:11,161
"but mean bastards, you need to hang."

2341
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:37,886
As my first and final act

2342
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,129
as the sheriff of Red Rock,

2343
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:44,011
I sentence you, Domergue,

2344
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:47,408
to hang by the neck until death!

2345
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:04,043
Hang on, Daisy.

2346
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,242
I want to watch.

2347
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:43,769
Now, that was a nice dance.

2348
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,729
That sure was pretty.

2349
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:47,167
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

2350
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:33,442
"Dear Marquis,

2351
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:36,723
"I hope this letter finds you

2352
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:41,164
"in good health and stead.

2353
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:43,760
"I'm doing fine,

2354
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:48,847
"although I wish there were
more hours in a day.

2355
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,362
"There's just so much to do.

2356
02:41:52,480 --> 02:41:56,963
"Times are changing slowly but surely,

2357
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:02,086
"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.

2358
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:08,481
"Your military success
is a credit not only to you,

2359
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:11,604
"but your race as well.

2360
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:17,250
"I'm very proud
every time I hear news of you.

2361
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:21,490
"We still have a long way to go,

2362
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:28,131
"but hand in hand,
I know we will get there.

2363
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:33,531
"I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.

2364
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:39,005
"Hopefully, our paths
will cross in the future.

2365
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:46,129
"Until then, I remain your friend.

2366
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,210
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,

2367
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:54,969
"so I guess it must be time for bed.

2368
02:42:55,080 --> 02:43:00,086
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln."

2369
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,241
"Ole Mary Todd."

2370
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,681
That's a nice touch.
