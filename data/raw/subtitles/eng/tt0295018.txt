THEME SONG: Let's follow the
path of Dusty's trail, oh

2
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:15,900
Dusty's trail, Dusty's trail.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,733
A stage and a wagon a-heading
west, part of a wagon train

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,133
lost from the rest.

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:28,267
Dusty's the reason
for their plight.

6
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:32,033
Thanks to Dusty,
nothing's right.

7
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:36,700
Only the wagon master's
hand keeps 'em a-rolling

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,700
through the promised land.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, the going gets mighty rough,
but they don't seem to mind.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,067
It's California, that's
the place they must find.

11
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:55,033
Deserts and rocks
are in their way,

12
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,933
but they won't
stop, come what may.

13
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,200
Mountains and hills
that they must scale,

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,433
but they know they'll
make it 'cause they

15
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:08,133
just can't fail
on Dusty's trail.

16
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,633
[music playing]

17
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,800
Well, we're ready
to move out, Dusty.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,833
You got everything straight?

19
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,133
Yes, sir, Mr. Callahan.

20
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,300
You're gonna ride ahead
to scout the trail,

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,767
and we'll remain
about a mile behind.

22
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:20,733
-Right.
-All right.

23
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,767
Don't worry about a thing.

24
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:22,767
I got everything under control.

25
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:23,467
WAGONMASTER CALLAHAN: Good.

26
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,167
Wagon ho!

27
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,467
[music playing]
-Whoa!

28
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,100
Whoa!

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,667
Whoa, whoa!

30
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:30,633
Jeez, whoa!

31
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,067
Whoa!

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,633
Please, whoa, whoa!

33
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,533
Please, whoa!

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,933
We'll be getting started soon
as Dusty gets the team hitched

35
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,067
up to the stage.

36
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,067
Thought he had them hitched.

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,333
Yeah, so did he.

38
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,067
Oh, Andy?

39
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah, Mr. Callahan?

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,300
You be sure and keep that wagon
close to the stage on the trail

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,300
today.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,467
We're apt to run
into some Hackamaws.

43
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,800
Hackamaws?

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,467
Yeah, Indians.

45
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,200
The Hackamaws are the
most hostile and fierce

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,300
of all the Indians.

47
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,867
Doesn't that make you nervous?

48
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,433
Not Lulu.

49
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:03,167
I'll match my war paint against
their war paint anytime.

50
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,267
Well, now, that's how
it should have been

51
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:10,667
done the first time, Dusty.

52
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,900
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,867
Well, now, if you people
get in, we'll get started.

54
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,300
I thought I made
it perfectly clear

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,067
that you ought to
handle the stagecoach,

56
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,867
and Dusty can do the scouting.

57
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,267
Oh, boy!

58
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,233
I'm the wagon master, so
I will make the decisions.

59
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,700
May I remind you they
have just discovered gold

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
in the California territory?

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,833
I must get there as
quickly as possible to open

62
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,267
a Western branch of my bank.

63
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,767
How many banks you own
doesn't mean a thing to me.

64
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:39,900
I also own the company
which owns this wagon train.

65
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:41,400
Now, that means
something to me.

66
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,567
Well, if that's the
way you want it,

67
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,967
Dusty, you are
going to ride scout.

68
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, wow!

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
I always wanted to ride scout.

70
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,900
[music playing]

71
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,733
Wait a minute, Dusty!

72
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,767
Fix the stirrup for you.

73
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:57,767
There.

74
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,133
[music playing]

75
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,167
I'll show him.

76
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,300
[music playing]

77
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,400
Well, thanks, Dusty.

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,967
For what, Mr. Callahan?

79
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,067
For not wearing spurs.

80
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah.

81
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,967
[music playing]

82
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,567
[growling]

83
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,967
[woman shouting]

84
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,933
[music playing]

85
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:43,900
It's all right.

86
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:44,733
It's OK.

87
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,133
I won't hurt you.

88
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49,700
[music playing]

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,067
Oh, my gosh.

90
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,633
[music playing]

91
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,667
Oh, you kid.

92
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,067
[music playing]

93
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,067
Whoa, there!

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,067
Whoa, boys!

95
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,133
What happened, Dusty?

96
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,267
Well, I got there just in time.

97
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,700
He was being mauled by a bear.

98
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,300
What's happened now?

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,300
He's just a boy.

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,367
Yeah, a Hackamaw Indian.

101
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:30,333
Well I couldn't
leave him there.

102
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:31,667
He might have died.

103
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,467
His tribe would've
found him, buzzard brain.

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,067
Now they'll find us.

105
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,267
Yeah, the Hackamaws are noted
for their tracking ability.

106
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:38,967
They are?

107
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,933
Lulu and I better take
care of his wounds.

108
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,633
Here, Andy.

109
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,800
Good idea.

110
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,233
Then we can drop him off
where Dusty found him.

111
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,767
Should I water your
horse, Mr. Callahan?

112
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:48,633
Oh, boy.

113
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,067
That was a smart thing to do.

114
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,333
Don't you know that those
Hackamaws might could

115
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,867
be looking for him right now?

116
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,067
You-- well, at least you
covered your trail, huh?

117
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,333
[music playing]

118
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,433
[non-english speech].

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,067
[music playing]

120
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:30,767
Shh.

121
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,067
Lucky thing we had
these spare wheels.

122
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,333
We can leave some phony
tracks, throw the Hackamaws off

123
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,600
our trail.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,900
Are you sure the
Hackamaws are trailing us?

125
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,467
Positive, but we can't
tell the passengers.

126
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,433
They might panic.

127
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,400
I wish they would.

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,633
I'd like a little company.

129
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,133
Hey, just quiet down, will you?

130
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,533
Put the wheel on the axle.

131
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,833
Besides, I mean,
how do you know

132
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,067
they're gonna follow this trail
instead of the other trail?

133
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,067
There won't be any other trail.

134
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
We're gonna wipe 'em out
with some brush, huh?

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Ah, that's a bright idea.

136
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,300
Wonder why I didn't think of it.

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,067
Because it was a bright idea.

138
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:07,467
What happened to your end?

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,067
I'll show you.

140
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:20,267
That's what happened to my end.

141
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,600
Shh!

142
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,900
Now come on, let's get
the wheels on that axle

143
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,567
before those Hackamaws
catch up with us.

144
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,900
Hey, Dusty, you
tighten up that bolt,

145
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,800
and I'll go clear the
brush out of the way.

146
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:43,167
[music playing]

147
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,133
Mr. Callahan?

148
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,533
Mr. Callahan!

149
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,100
Mr. Callahan?

150
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,100
Mr. Callahan!

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,100
Can't you see I'm busy?

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,100
Run!

153
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,767
[music playing]

154
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,833
Get away!
-Hey!

155
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:05,533
Hey!

156
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:09,133
[music playing]

157
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,500
Move it, Dusty!

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,100
Mr. Callahan!

159
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,100
Look out!

160
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,100
[crashing]

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,867
[music playing]

162
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,467
They should be able to follow
that trail, huh, Mr. Callahan?

163
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,067
Yes, Dusty.

164
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,067
Oh, they certainly should.

165
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,867
[music playing]

166
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:43,067
LULU: These wounds
don't look too serious.

167
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,233
No, but he's starting
to get a fever.

168
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,800
What are you looking at?

169
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,200
The design on this headband.

170
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,200
Very unusual.

171
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,233
I wonder if it means anything.

172
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,800
Andy might know.

173
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,933
Before we left, he studied about
all the Indians, the rivers,

174
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,767
the mountains-- everything
we'd encounter on the trip.

175
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,400
He really came prepared.

176
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,067
I should have known.

177
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:13,300
Any man who wears suspenders
and a belt is always prepared.

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,100
Huh?

179
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,867
Never mind.

180
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,867
Andy?

181
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,167
Bringing that Indian boy
back here-- when are you gonna

182
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,333
do something right, Dusty?

183
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,867
Mr. Callahan!

184
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,133
Hey, whoa!

185
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,100
Whoa.

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,067
Come on, boy.

187
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:30,967
Whoa, whoa.

188
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,167
What's delaying us now?

189
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:40,800
I got to talk to Andy.

190
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,767
What's the problem?

191
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,700
It's about the Indian boy.

192
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,567
If we get in any
more trouble over him,

193
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,167
I'm gonna use you
for target practice.

194
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,667
ANDY: You didn't get a chance
to look at his headband before.

195
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:50,933
Now, unless I'm wrong--

196
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:51,567
Huh.

197
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:52,800
Chief's son?

198
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,467
Exactly.

199
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,333
Oh, that's great.

200
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,800
Just great.

201
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,100
You've done it this time.

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,067
Every brave in that
tribe will be after us.

203
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,400
On the contrary.

204
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,433
Now, a chief's son could be
a valuable asset in a trade.

205
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,767
Oh?

206
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,167
For safe passage through
the Hackamaw territory.

207
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,467
Safe passage?

208
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,067
Ah, you're right.

209
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,533
By delivering the
chief's son to us,

210
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,967
Dusty's all but
guaranteed our safety.

211
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,500
You know, if
anything, he's a hero.

212
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,067
[music playing]

213
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,133
How is he?

214
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,333
Still burning with fever.

215
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:56,700
I'll make another wet compress.

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,100
It might let him
sleep a little better.

217
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,167
WAGONMASTER CALLAHAN: Yeah, we
got to keep him in good shape.

218
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:02,900
Poor thing.

219
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,933
He's still unconcious.

220
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,967
Yeah, speaking of unconscious,
better wake Dusty up.

221
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,467
It's his turn to take
over the guard duty.

222
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,967
Anything I can get for you?

223
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:12,933
No.

224
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,433
I'll just sit with
the boy a while.

225
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah.

226
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,467
Good.

227
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:22,067
[music playing]

228
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:34,933
Oh, it's you, Mr. Callahan.

229
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,167
Well, who did you expect?

230
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,067
Daniel Boone?

231
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,667
Come on, now.

232
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,967
Wake up, Dusty.

233
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,333
It's time for you to
take over guard duty.

234
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,767
We're by that big rock.

235
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,467
Dusty, this is the
last watch before dawn.

236
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,533
Yes, sir, Mister--

237
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,467
Dusty.

238
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,100
-Callahan.
-Wake up!

239
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm awake.

240
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,633
Well, stay that way.

241
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,967
Yes, sir.

242
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,467
Wake me at dawn so we
can get an early start.

243
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,433
Right.

244
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,667
[snoring]

245
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:15,567
Dusty.

246
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,867
What are your orders?

247
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,367
Wake you at start so
you can get early dawn.

248
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:23,733
Yeah-- close enough.

249
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,200
[music playing]

250
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,200

[music playing]

252
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,333
Betsy's gone, too!

253
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,333
She's not in the wagon.

254
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:26,333
Yeah, I know.

255
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,733
Look at those
tracks-- moccasins!

256
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,067
Looks like a couple
Indians came in here

257
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,067
and took the boy and Betsy.

258
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,067
Hey, where's Dusty?

259
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:31,900
Maybe they took him, too.

260
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,067
No, no such luck.

261
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,533
Dusty, wake up!
Wake up!

262
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:35,800
Sorry, Mr. Callahan.

263
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,133
I must have dozed off
For a few minutes.

264
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,333
Yeah, while you dozed
off for a few minutes,

265
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,500
two braves came in
here and captured

266
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,700
the Indian boy and Betsy!

267
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,067
Two Indian boys
captured Indian Betsy?

268
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,167
No, no.

269
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,667
Two Betsies captured
the brave-- oh, Dusty.

270
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,567
Come on, we'd better pick up
the trail while it's fresh.

271
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,400
Wait for me.

272
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,300
[music playing]

273
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,833
Mr. Brookhaven.

274
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,333
Mr. Brookhaven!

275
00:13:56,433 --> 00:14:00,267
Hey, I was right in the
middle of my [inaudible].

276
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,067
I'm afraid we've
got some bad news.

277
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,900
The Hackamaws have
Betsy tied to a post.

278
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,633
Yeah, and those braves
keep walking past her

279
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,167
and poking her with a stick.

280
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,667
That means that one of 'em's
gonna take her as his wife.

281
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,900
Those scoundrels!

282
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,933
I say we should
get on our horses

283
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,333
and ride as far away as we can!

284
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:19,433
Mr. Brookhaven, you should be
ashamed, suggesting we ride off

285
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:20,900
without attempting a rescue.

286
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,867
Yeah, one of us could slip
in there and get her out.

287
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,167
I'll be back as soon as I can.

288
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,067
One moment, wagon master.

289
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,633
What will happen to us if
anything happens to you?

290
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,067
I'd be in charge.

291
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,533
That's a foreboding thought.

292
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:33,833
Yeah, your point is well taken.

293
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,333
It'll have to be somebody else.

294
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,633
I'll go.

295
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,500
He volunteered.

296
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,367
Why didn't you?

297
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:40,367
He beat me to it.

298
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,200
Now, volunteer!

299
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,833
That's an order.

300
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,200
I volunteer.

301
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,067
Mr. Callahan, I must
insist I be allowed to go.

302
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,600
In preparing for
this trip, I studied

303
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,867
several Indian languages,
including the Hackamaw dialect.

304
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,967
I believe that gives me
a distinct advantage.

305
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,500
We'll be ready to
move as soon as you

306
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
get back here with Betsy.

307
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,133
I should be back with
her within an hour,

308
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,433
unless I run into a problem.

309
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,800
Yeah.

310
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,367
[music playing]

311
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,933
He ran into a problem.

312
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,767
Listen up, I got a
great plan how somebody

313
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,167
can walk right into
that Hackamaw camp

314
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:20,600
without even being noticed.
-Fantastic.

315
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,167
Yeah.

316
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,867
Well, anyway, somebody wearing
these clothes, a little skin

317
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:27,567
dye, and some braids, feathers,
they could walk right in there

318
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,833
and cut Betsy and Andy loose.

319
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,367
That's a great plan.
It can't fail.

320
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,367
Yeah.

321
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,767
The only trouble
is, somebody wearing

322
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,800
these clothes got
to be kind of small,

323
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,667
slight, built about like you.

324
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,467
It'll never work.

325
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,833
Yeah, looks too red.

326
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,133
Better put in some
more blueberries,

327
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,800
tone you down a bit.

328
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,633
Mmm.

329
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,067
I taste delicious.

330
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,333
Oh, be serious, will you?

331
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,067
Two people's lives
depend on you.

332
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,467
Three, including me.

333
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,167
Oh, now listen, little pal,
you don't think for a minute I'd

334
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,100
let you go over there if there
wasn't a good chance of you

335
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,533
coming back all right, do you?

336
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:59,367
I guess not.

337
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:00,733
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,200
All right.

339
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,067
Now you dab that on yourself,
and I'll go see Lulu,

340
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,800
see how the braids are coming.

341
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,367
[music playing]

342
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,567
Hey, that looks great.

343
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,433
Where'd you get the hair?

344
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,467
Yeah, that looks like a
Hackamaw braid, all right.

345
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,433
Just don't tell
Dusty where I got it.

346
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,767
Yeah, well, seems the two of
them go very well together.

347
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,567
Yeah.

348
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,133
All right, Dusty.

349
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,633
Now, I'd better teach you a
few words of Hackamaw in case

350
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,667
you've got to speak to somebody.
-Good idea.

351
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,667
How do you say, I surrender?

352
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,233
Oh, now, stop that.

353
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,567
Now listen, let's say
you get into camp,

354
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,267
and you cut Andy and
Betsy free, you see?

355
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:53,433
And a brave says to
you, [non-english].

356
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:54,900
Then you say to
him, [non-english].

357
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,433
You see?

358
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,233
He has said to you, where
are you taking the prisoners?

359
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,433
And you say to
him, to the chief.

360
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,600
You got that?

361
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,667
Yeah, yeah. if he says
to me, [non-english]--

362
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,900
No, no, no.

363
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,800
You just said, did
you catch any worms?

364
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,267
Did I say that?

365
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,100
Listen up, will you?

366
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,067
Now pay attention.

367
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,400
We haven't got much time.

368
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,133
Repeat after me.

00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,133
[non-english speech].

370
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,267
Now put it all together.

[non-english speech].

372
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,467
-Hey, that's great!
-Hey, that's great!

373
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,300
No, no.

374
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,233
Just using the Indian word.

375
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,733
Oh. [non-english speech].

376
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,633
Ah, that's fine.

377
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:28,933
Then you say to him--

378
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,867
[whooping]

[music playing]

380
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Put the wagons in a circle!

381
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,933
Put the wagons in a circle!

382
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,533
We've only got two wagons!

383
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,733
You get everybody hid,
and I'll keep 'em busy!

Behind the rock!

387
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,700
Behind the rock!

388
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,100

Dusty, you?

395
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,867
What did you tackle me for?

396
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm sorry.

397
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,400
I guess I just got carried away.

398
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,600
Oh.

399
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,467
All right!

00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,300
All right!

[non-english speech].

402
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,133
Unhand her, you villain!

403
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,900
And be careful with that hat!

404
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,433
How long does this go on
before they select a wife?

405
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,133
I don't know, but
I sure hope they

406
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,400
believe in long engagements.

407
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,967
I haven't been
able to spot Dusty.

408
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,967
Are you sure he's here?

409
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,333
Yeah, he's a hero.

410
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,800
All them braves
keep slapping him

411
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,933
on the back for capturing me.

412
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,067
He may have saved our lives.

413
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,400
Huh?

414
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,933
Well, the odds are you
would have been caught.

415
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,733
By capturing you himself,
Dusty's proved he's a Hackamaw.

416
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,733
Now he's free to help us.

417
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,167
I don't know what to do!

418
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,267
I can't attack them all!

419
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,267
Cut me loose.
Cut me loose.

[non-english speech].

421
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,900
He just chose Betsy
to be his wife.

Oh, somebody help me!

423
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,600
Please help me!

424
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,067
Dusty's challenged him
to a fight with spears.

425
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:58,933
I did?

He just told him that
Dusty saved his life

433
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,367
and that we made him well!

It's all right.

437
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,533
It's all right, darling.

438
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,067
Everything's all right.
We won!

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,967

OK, little doggie.

00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,400
Just hold still, 'cause
I'm gonna rope and tie you.

452
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,300
Mr. Callahan, look
what I caught.

453
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Looks more like he caught you.

454
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,633
She's really a
beauty, isn't she?

455
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:49,233
A genuine Appalachian.

456
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,100
It's not an Appalachian.

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
It's Appaloosa.

458
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,200
And it's not a she, it's a he.

459
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't care if
it's a boy Appaloosa

460
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,433
or a girl Appalachian.

461
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,467
It's a beauty.

462
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:57,433
He sure is.

463
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:58,467
Can I keep him?

464
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,467
Well, looks like a wild horse.

465
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:02,500
No shoes.

466
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,767
Don't see any sign of a brand.

467
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:08,900
Yeah?

468
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,167
Look like you found
yourself a horse, Dusty.

469
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,400
Really?

470
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,133
He's my own horse,
and I can keep him?

471
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,633
My own horse!

472
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,400
Uh, don't-- don't fight.

473
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,533
I'll see if I can
get you out of this.

474
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,567
You get in some of the wildest--

475
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,533
I won't let go.

476
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:23,900
Let-- let go of this one.

477
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:24,800
Huh?

478
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,167
Let go!

Looks like you're Appaloosa

00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:41,733
other tracks.

482
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,667
I told you it was a
horse thief, Marshal.

483
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,267
Keep your rope handy, Roy.

484
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,467
As soon as we catch up with him,
we're gonna hang that varmint

485
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,467
to the nearest tree!

487
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
And it's not exactly
the governor's mansion.

488
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,067
Oh, no.

489
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,500
But it'll sure be nice to
sleep inside for one night.

490
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,067
The corral's in
pretty good shape.

491
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,733
I'd be happier with that
information if I were a horse.

492
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,667
This place looks like it's
a rest home for termites.

493
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:18,933
Oh, Carter, why is everything
out west so western?

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,433
Whoa.

496
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,600
All right.

497
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,433
That a boy.

498
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, look, everybody!

499
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,100
I caught myself a wild horse!

500
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,333
Dusty, he's beautiful!

501
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,933
Well, I'll be.

502
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,067
He's a beauty!

503
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,133
I'm gonna call him
Freckles on account

504
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:45,800
he's got all those freckles.

505
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,733
No, those are called blotches.

506
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,300
I'm still gonna
call him Freckles.

507
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,500
I don't like the name Blotch.

508
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,800
He is an elegant-looking
beast, isn't he?

509
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah.

510
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,167
It'd cost you a pretty piece
of change to buy one like that.

511
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:01,467
Please, I never invest
in anything that eats!

512
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:02,467
I'm not gonna sell him.

513
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:05,167
I'm gonna keep him forever.

514
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:06,900
Well, may take you
that long to break him.

515
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,567
He looks a little ornery to me.

516
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,333
I can be just as
ornery as he is.

517
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,533
I just need a little practice.

518
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:13,500
Well, afraid we
haven't got time, Dusty.

519
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,467
We're gonna pull out of
here at sunup tomorrow.

520
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,767
Good!

521
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,067
The accommodations here
are simply dreadful.

522
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,800
Hey!

523
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,200
Mr. Callahan, guess what?

524
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,500
I found a telegraph in there.

525
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Oh, boy a telegraph!

526
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,100
I mean, a real telegraph!

527
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I-- what's a telegraph?

528
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,467
Well, it's a new
invention by Samuel Morse.

529
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,433
You see that wire?

530
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,167
You can send messages over it.

531
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:35,767
You've got to be joshing me.

532
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:38,067
You can't send messages over a
little skinny wire like that.

533
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:40,067
You can-- where's
the word even fit?

534
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,367
Yes, you can.

535
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,733
You send it by clicking a
series of dots and dashes.

536
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,967
That invention is
gonna make millions.

537
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,500
What's the matter with him?

538
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Nothing.

539
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,900
He always cries when he hears
of someone else making millions.

540
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,433
WAGONMASTER CALLAHAN: Oh.

541
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,600
Anyway, I figure if I can
repair the break in the wire,

542
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,533
I can make contact all
the way back to St. Louis.

543
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:02,867
Oh, good!

544
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,300
We can find out where
we are and where to go.

545
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,067
How long you think it'll take
you to fix that contraption?

546
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,700
A couple of days, maybe three.

547
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,067
Oh, great!

548
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,333
Then I can break Freckles
while we're waiting!

549
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:13,933
Yeah.

550
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,133
And then you'd have your
very own horse, Dusty.

551
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,967
Yeah, my very own horse.

552
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:21,433
Me and Freckles,
together forever.

553
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,567
Looks like your horse thief
joined a wagon train, Uriah.

554
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,667
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

555
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,200
Let's move, Marshal.

556
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,433
I don't want him crossing any
borders 'fore we hang him.

557
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,300
OK.

559
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,533
Wow, that makes 17 times
he's hit the ground,

560
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,667
according to my count.

561
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:46,700
I counted 18.

562
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,933
You're both wrong.
It's 20.

563
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:49,533
You forgot the time
he bounced twice.

564
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:50,867
Come on, Dusty!

565
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,333
Get up on him again, boy!

Ride him!

00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:00,700
Come on, Dusty!

571
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,300

Hey, Dusty, why don't
you quit for a while?

575
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:21,367
I think he's tired.

576
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,833
You think he's tired, huh?

577
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,167
Yeah, he's not throwing
me as far as he was before.

578
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,433
All right, Dusty.

579
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm gonna show you something
about breaking a horse.

580
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,133
Yeah?

581
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:31,533
The first thing you've got
to do is show him who's boss.

582
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,633
He knows that.

583
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,067
He knows that.

584
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:34,700
Come on.

585
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,833
Come on.

and Stringfellow.

Uh, buy one million
shares of Erie Barge.

Stop.

Mr. Brookhaven, even if I
repair this telegraph key,

591
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,567
I must use it for more
important messages than that.

592
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,767
More important than money?

593
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,667

young man, you're sick.

Oh, feels just like I slipped
and fell in the bathtub.

Look, it is a bathtub!

600
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,633
Well, I'll be--

601
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,267
I wonder why anyone
would leave it here.

602
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:44,400
Well, too heavy to
carry on a stagecoach.

603
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,833
They probably busted an
axle getting it this far.

604
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,133
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

605
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,733
A hot bath!

606
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,467
A hot bath.

00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,267
Hey, how 'bout that Dusty?

608
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,300
A nice, hot bath.

609
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
It's not big enough
for all of us.

610

No, no, separately, little pal.

611
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,433
Separately.

612
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,600
Girls, go heat up some water.

613
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,467
Right away!

There's a telegram
pole, Marshal!

Yeah, it leads to the old
relay station up ahead.

Aha!

623
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,067
And so does our
horse thief's tracks.

bigger than the soap bubbles.

Now, don't be
frightened, Freckles.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

gonna do the same?

him over there?

You're right.

He's innocent.

Well, that's easy.

668
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,600
This horse is Circle O stock.

669
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,767
He's only got one mark
on him, and it's mine.

670
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:19,967
And there it is.

671

Circle O.

Well, I've looked
at a lot of brands,

673
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,067
but I never saw
that circle before.

674
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,900
Well, that horse has always
been covered with spots.

First time I saw him, I
thought he had measles.

He's a lowdown horse thief,
and we're gonna hang him!

Now hold on!

678
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,400
There are extenuating
circumstances.

Constable, you must not
allow this to happen!

government will not receive

supposed to be a law man.

they have in this territory?

Since we left the East.

In your personal opinion,
would he ever steal anything?

Oh, no.
Never.

about you stealing horses yet.

Do you believe that Dusty
would go around stealing horses?

Your honor, Dusty wouldn't
steal honey from a beehive.

There's two things I wouldn't
steal-- horses and honey.

he saying got to do

with him stealing my Appaloosa?

She's a character witness!

What we need here
is a miracle witness.

00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,900
Order in the court!

00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:40,067
Your honor, may I,
uh, approach the bench?

00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:48,133
That's what I call a good
approach to the bench.

have to say, ma'am.

on with hanging this fella,

She's my friend!

by my friend, the painted lady,

I had a talk with you

in the privacy of your chambers.

I ain't got no chambers.

00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,067
Well, it's, uh, it's
terribly personal.

728
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,767
It concerns, um--

729
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,800
Are you offering me a bribe?

730
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,867
A bribe?

731
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,167
How dare you, sir?

732
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,067
Well, if you are, you're
wasting your money.

733
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,200
I was merely willing to offer
a very great deal of money

734
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,967
to have you release this
young man on bail permanently.

735
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,200
Carter would never
dream of bribing anyone.

736
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,333
It still sounded
like a bribe to me.

737
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:57,500
Let me approach it
in a different way.

738
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,767
I am willing to pay a
large amount of money

739
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,333
to this young man here for
the misappropriated horse,

740
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,567
providing it spares
Dusty's life.

741
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,133
Thanks a lot, Mr. Brookhaven.

742
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,233
The horse ain't
for sale, mister,

743
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,833
no matter how much
money you got.

744
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:11,767
Nonsense!

745
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,867
Every man has his price!

746
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,733
Women, too, your honor.

747
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,933
Order in the court!

748
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:18,300
Sit down, mister.

749
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
You had your piece.

750
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,600
Has anybody else got anything
to say before I pass judgement?

751
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,900
I do.

752
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,133
That man is guilty.

753
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,567
Right.

754
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:30,267
Oh, I mean he is guilty
of making a simple mistake.

755
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,067
Why, if Dusty here
thought for a minute

756
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,467
that horse belonged
to somebody else,

757
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,833
he'd have never
claimed it for his own.

758
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:39,067
Well, you and I both know
we all make stupid mistakes

759
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,667
from time to time.

760
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:41,867
I sure do.

761
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,667
Just like he's doing now.

762
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:44,833
Right.

763
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,500
I should have been the
one to find that brand,

764
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,167
but I didn't, so it's
my fault. And I'm

765
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,300
asking you to hang me instead.

766
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,067
You don't have
to take my blame.

767
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:58,667
Marshal, we found the accused
sitting on my horse, not him.

768
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:00,467
And that's a hard fact.

769
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:04,200
Under the circumstances,
I ain't got but one choice,

770
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,800
and that's to find you,
the defendant, guilty!

771
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,133
Oh, no.

772
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,100
Silence!

773
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,633
Order in the court!

774
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,500
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to hang you, son.

775
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,533
What are you afraid about?

776
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,433
I'm the one who's gonna be hung.

777
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,900
We'll hang him at sunup.

778
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:21,600
That only gives me about 12
hours to fix that telegraph.

779
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,433
What good's that
gonna do us now?

780
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,433
There's a territorial court
of appeals in Johnson City.

781
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,567
If I can get the judge
there to declare a mistrial,

782
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,067
the marshal will
have to free Dusty.

783
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,067
Come on, let's shackle him up.

784
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,900
Take him over there.

785
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,067
Court's adjourned.

786
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,700
[music playing]

787
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:39,933
Now, you can sleep
in this tonight.

788
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,133
Well, considering the
hanging and everything,

789
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:43,667
I don't like the
shape of my bed.

790
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,967
Well, this way nobody will
have to keep guard and everybody

791
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,067
will get a good night's rest.

792
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,333
Now get in there.

793
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,833
There's no way he's
gonna run away chained

794
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,067
to this fancy wash barrel!

795
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:58,600
[music playing]

796
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,500
Andy, you go see if you can
get that telegraph fixed.

797
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,633
I got an idea that might
give us the time we need.

798
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:06,833
Right.

799
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:10,400
[music playing]

800
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,833
Hey, Dusty boy.

801
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:46,200
Dusty, wake up.

802
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,600
I got the key!

803
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,067
Hey, here.

804
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,067
You unlock-- you
unlock that one.

805
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,833
I got to get my guns.

806
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:57,400
[music playing]

807
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:24,600
You OK, Dusty?

808
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,600
Yeah, I guess so.

809
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,867
That handcuff was really tight.

810
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:28,267
Shh, shh, shh.

811
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,867
But that handcuff really hurts
when you've got it on your--

812
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,067
-You'll wake up the marshal!
-You don't believe me,

813
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:31,933
I'll show you.

814
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:32,867
Look, just like that.

815
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:33,500
See?

816
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,100
It hurts, huh?

817
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,967
Shh.

818
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,833
I think the marshal's waking up.

819
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,200
Oh, no.

820
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,233
If he catches me out of my
handcuff, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna

821
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,700
be killed before I get hung!

822
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,167
-No, it's all right.
-Hmm?

823
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,167
He went back to sleep again.

824
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:57,467
Hey, hey-- OK, take these off.

825
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,500
I did give you the
keys, didn't I?

826
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,467
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,300
Yeah, good.

828
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,167
But, uh, but, uh--

829
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,567
But-- but what?

830
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,600
But I threw 'em
away over there.

831
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:13,800
You-- if we get out of
this, I may hang you myself.

832
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,667
I know.

833
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:15,500
Huh?

834
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:22,000
[music playing]

835
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:32,033
Wait, wait.

836
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:35,567
[music playing]

837
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,233
Do you folks know the penalty
for aiding and abetting

838
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,067
the escape of a horse thief?

839
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,233
We didn't aid and abet anyone.

840
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,867
Well, I would have
if I could have.

841
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:59,633
We would have if we could
have, and we should have.

842
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,733
That wagon master
sprung him loose.

843
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,533
Looks like when
we catch up to him,

844
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:06,067
we'll have a double
necktie party!

845
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,533
[music playing]

846
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,500
Will you warn me when
you're gonna stop?

847
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,967
I'm sorry.

848
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:20,633
Stop!

849
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:21,667
Was that fast enough?

850
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,333
Hey, Dusty, do you
know where we are?

851
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:27,700
Yeah, I sure do-- up the creek.

852
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,867
No, no.

853
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,167
This is the place you
found that Appaloosa.

854
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,300
Oh, no.
Let's get out of here.

855
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,433
I don't want to
find another one!

856
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,733
I'll get hung twice!
-No, no no!

857
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,067
If we can find another
set of hoof prints,

858
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,967
it might lead us to
the real horse thief.

859
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,100
Yeah.

860
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
We'll split up so we
can cover more ground.

861
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,233
That way.

862
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,100
Right.

863
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,700
Wait, no.

864
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,400
We have got to find something
to get these things off of us.

865
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,667
Not a chance.

866
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:50,367
These handcuffs are
as solid as a rock.

867
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,933
Well, keep looking, anyway.

868
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:52,767
OK.

869
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Can't see anything.

870
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,733
Neither can I.

871
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,233
Well, I guess we're
really stuck together

872
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,533
for the rest of our lives.

873
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:01,533
I guess so.

874
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:07,333
Uh-- hey, how'd you do that?

875
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,167
How did I-- how did I do that?

876
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,067
Never mind.

877
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,167
Never mind.

878
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,067
When we're old and
sitting in rocking chairs,

879
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
we'll figure it out.

880
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,733
But we will never
live to get old if we

881
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,433
don't find that horse thief.

882
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:20,467
I tell you what--
you take that trail.

883
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:21,900
I'll go down that way.

884
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:23,533
If either one of us spot
anything, we meet back here.

885
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:24,367
All right?

886
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:25,933
Yeah.

887
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:29,300
[music playing]

888
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:32,500
Don't take 'em
off, young fella.

889
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,167
Some folks like to die
with their boots on.

890
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:36,767
Not me.

891
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:39,800
Please reconsider
what you're doing!

DUSTY: Hey, hold the hanging!

893
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,967
Hold the hanging!

894
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,067
Here.

895
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,933
Here's your horse
thief right here.

896
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,400
It's Crazy Blue!

897
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,800
Crazy Blue?

898
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,500
That's the wild stallion
that's been chasing horses

899
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,067
off all over the territory.

900
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,200
I thought he was dead.

901
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,067
He ain't been around
these parts for years!

902
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,167
Yeah, well, he's driven
some of your prized stock

903
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:58,267
into a box canyon about
four miles from here.

904
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,067
He could've driven off that
Appaloosa of yours, too.

905
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,133
Well, yeah.

906
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:04,100
Yeah, suppose he could've.

907
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,333
Well, now, I reckon we
almost made a dumb mistake.

908
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:08,700
You are free to go, sonny.

909
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,833
I know, I know.

910
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,567
Mr. Callahan, I
don't know how to say

911
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,500
thank you except-- thank you.

912
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,067
Oh, that's all
right, little pal.

913
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,633
You'd have done anything in
the world to save my neck,

914
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:21,600
wouldn't you?

915
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,067
I'd save your whole body.

916
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,100
[music playing]

917
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:45,900
Hold it.

918
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:49,533
Hey, what's on your mind?

919
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,267
Man we passed
yesterday, he said

920
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:55,500
there's a wagon train over here
with some real purty girls.

921
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,467
We'd like to get
friendly with 'em.

922
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,767
Well, you can see
there's no women at all

923
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,300
on this wagon train here.

924
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,300
You can--

925
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,600
We know you got girls here.

926
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,233
We want to meet 'em, or else.

927
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,367
Or else what?

928
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:08,300
Or else this.

929
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,800
Understand?

930
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,333
Yeah, now that
you've explained it.

931
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:16,667
Gets their guns McGirk.

932
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,467
Right, Jake.

933
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:20,467
All right.

934
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,067
I'll just take these.

935
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,967
Now, we'll get some
branding to do,

936
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,333
but we'll be back
before sundown.

937
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,633
Branding?

938
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:28,967
Uh, how many head of
cattle you got, McGirk?

939
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,633
Well, that depends on
how many we can steal.

940
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:33,933
I'll just take this
shotgun here, too.

941
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:36,800
Oh, there's another one
hid under the seat, Jake.

942
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,100
Now, you just be
worrying about sundown.

943
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,300
Make sure those women
are friendly, hear?

944
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,167
[music playing]

945
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,800
He shattered it.

946
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,700
Yeah, without even aiming.

947
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,067
See you before sundown--

948
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,133
Bam!
Bam!

949
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,233
Bam!
-Dusty!

950
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,167
Bam!

951
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,767
Now stop that.

952
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:56,467
Betsy and Lulu are
in real trouble!

953
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,100
Got to be some way out of this.

954
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,067
I got a way!

955
00:44:59,167 --> 00:44:59,900
Let's run, huh?

956
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,100
Dusty.

957
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,633
Now, now, Dusty may
be right, Mr. Callahan.

958
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,067
We've got that spare
wheel in the wagon,

959
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,167
and they said they won't
be back before sundown.

960
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:07,233
Now, you're right.

961
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,100
All right.

962
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,300
Let's get it on and get rolling.

963
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,700
You go round up the
others and get 'em

964
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,067
back here as fast as you can.
-Right.

965
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:13,367
As soon as I tell 'em
about Jake and McGirk,

966
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:14,233
they'll come running!

967
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,067
Now, listen.

968
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,333
You go get 'em and get 'em back
here, but don't say a word!

969
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,733
You'll only scare 'em!

970
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:22,633
Yeah, and what they don't
know won't hurt them.

971
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:23,667
Understand?
-Sure.

972
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,067
Right now, I'm scared to death.

973
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:26,333
Don't worry, Mr. Callahan.

974
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:30,067
I won't breathe a word to 'em!

975
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:34,067
[music playing]

976
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,067
Betsy, Lulu!

977
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,367
We got to get back to camp!
Hurry!

978
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,200
What's the hurry?

979
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,367
I can't tell you.

980
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:39,533
Why can't you tell us?

981
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:40,700
I can't tell you
why I can't tell you

982
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,267
because that would be telling.

983
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,367
But we got to get started real
quick before it's too late.

984
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,567
Too late for what?

985
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,900
Too late for us.

986
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,467
Look, don't ask
me anything more.

987
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:49,933
I can't tell you about McGirk
and then Jake and the danger

988
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:50,967
and the cattle thieves.

989
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,733
Well, who are McGirk and Jake?

990
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,633
What danger?

991
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,467
And what cattle thieves?

992
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:56,600
Dusty, you're not making sense!

993
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,567
I know.

994
00:45:57,667 --> 00:45:59,067
I'll see you back at camp.

995
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,433
CARTER: Ready for the
pheasant hunt, my dear?

996
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,700
Ready, when you are, Carter.

997
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,533
Then tallyho!

998
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,400
Here, pheasant,
pheasant, pheasant!

999
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:24,100
One more time, dear.

1000
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,967
I think you interest him.

1001
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,667
Oh, Mr. and Mrs.
Brookhaven, come on!

1002
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:32,633
Hurry!
-Hurry?

1003
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:34,067
Where?

1004
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Mr. Callahan wants
everybody back at the wagons

1005
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,300
and packed up right away!

1006
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,633
It's important.

1007
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,600
What could be more important
than pheasant under grass.

1008
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,800
Us under ground.

1009
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,467
Under ground?

1010
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,267
Oh, what are you talking about?

1011
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:45,633
I can't tell you
because if I tell

1012
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:46,967
you what I'm not
supposed to tell you,

1013
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,367
you'll only get scared.
-Scared?

1014
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:49,233
Scared?

1015
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,200
Scared of what?

1016
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,433
I can't tell you
about the danger.

1017
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,733
What danger?

1018
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:53,933
Well, there's Jake and
McGirk and the women

1019
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:55,067
and bam, bam, bam, bam!

1020
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,400
I'll see you back at camp.

1021
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,233
And hurry!

1022
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,367
Let's hope that axle holds up
till we get to the next town.

1023
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:06,200
Yeah, hope so.

1024
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,300
Let's get this wagon loaded.

1025
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,633
I want to get out
of here, pronto.

1026
00:47:08,733 --> 00:47:09,467
I did it, Mr. Callahan.

1027
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,600
They're all coming.

1028
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,533
And you didn't
tell anybody why?

1029
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:12,433
Not a hint.

1030
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:13,500
I promised, didn't I?

1031
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,967
Mr. Callahan?

1032
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:17,067
Mr. Callahan, why
are we leaving?

1033
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,433
And-- and who are
Jake and McGirk?

1034
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:20,433
And what's this about
cattle thieves and danger?

1035
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,467
And what's with this
bam, bam, bam, bam?

1036
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:24,800
Not even a hint, huh?

1037
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,333
Well, maybe a
little, teeny one.

1038
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,300
I demand to know
what is going on.

1039
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
All right.
Hold it.

1040
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,633
Hold it, everybody.

1041
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:32,600
There's two cattle thieves
named Jake and McGirk.

1042
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,867
And they came riding in
here demanding our women.

1043
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:37,500
We tried to put 'em off,
but they've got our guns.

1044
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,500
They're gonna be back by
sundown looking for these women,

1045
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,933
and I want this wagon train
packed and rolling before then.

1046
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:44,467
I'll be packed in one second.

1047
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:45,700
Oh, me, too!

1048
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,867
What about the pheasants?

1049
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:47,900
Blast the pheasants!

1050
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:49,067
They can pack for themselves!

1051
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,700
Dusty, get the horses.

1052
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,567
Right away, sir.

1053
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,600
All right.

1054
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,833
Let's get this thing going here.

1055
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:55,833
Come on, you guys!

1056
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:56,733
You got to get out of here!

1057
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,867
There's a lot of danger!

1058
00:47:57,967 --> 00:47:59,067
We've got to get
back to the wagon!

1059
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,367
I got to take you
guys down there.

1060
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:01,700
Jake and McGirk's coming
back before sundown!

1061
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,633
Come on.

1062
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:03,567
OK.

1063
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:04,967
Everybody get ready.

1064
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:07,100
We gotta get going!

1065
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,867
Oh!

1066
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,267
Hey, wait for me!

1067
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:10,067
No, you guys!

1068
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,067
Come on, you guys!

1069
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,900
[music playing]

1070
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:14,933
Ready to roll, Mr. Callahan.

1071
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:16,267
So are we!

1072
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:18,800
Dusty will be right
here with the horses.

1073
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,167
Hey, Dusty, where
are the horses?

1074
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,367
That's a good question.

1075
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:22,400
Only problem is,
there's four answers.

1076
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,400
Four answers?

1077
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,900
Yeah-- north, south,
east, and west.

1078
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:27,500
Oh, take us all day to
round those horses up.

1079
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,067
Looks like we're stuck here.

1080
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,800
What do you mean,
we're stuck here?

1081
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,533
With those men
due before sundown?

1082
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:35,900
Mr. Callahan, you
are paid to defend us!

1083
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:38,500
You must simply
protect our women!

1084
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,433
Poor Betsy and Lulu!

1085
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:41,900
What about me, Carter?

1086
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:43,800
I'm a woman, too.

1087
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Ah, of course you are, my pet.

1088
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:48,467
But Betsy and Lulu are
single, whereas you

1089
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:53,067
are married to me, your
valiant knight, your protector.

1090
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,600
Oh, beautifully put, Carter.

1091
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,933
I thought so, too, dear.

1092
00:48:58,067 --> 00:48:59,200
What are we gonna do?

1093
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,833
Well, without our
guns, the only chance

1094
00:49:00,933 --> 00:49:02,433
is the element of surprise.

1095
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:04,667
We got to take 'em
unawares and overpower 'em.

1096
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,833
But how?

1097
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:06,833
Well, they're coming
here for girls.

1098
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,233
Yeah we'll give 'em girls.

1099
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:12,533
Nice, friendly girls.

1100
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:13,267
OK, turn around.

1101
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,800
I want to see the back.

1102
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,633
BETSY: You, too, Dusty.

1103
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:22,267
I went to my first dance
in this dress, Dusty.

1104
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:23,800
Yeah, I bet you looked
better than I do.

1105
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,067
I feel silly.

1106
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:26,533
What kind of scout
wears girl's clothes?

1107
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,733
A Girl Scout.

1108
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,067
Shut up and paint your lips.

1109
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,433
There.

1110
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:35,633
You're beautiful!

1111
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:36,733
Are we really?

1112
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:40,900
Oh, your bloomers are slipping.

1113
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,500
I'll do it!

1114
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,933
I don't see how you keep these
things up without suspenders,

1115
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:45,367
anyway.
-Hey, listen.

1116
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:47,067
I want you girls to stay
in that wagon out of sight.

1117
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,067
You got that?

1118
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:50,833
You ready, Dolly?

1119
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:51,667
Ready, Kitty.

1120
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,067
Good luck.

1121
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,100
We know you're risking
your lives for us.

1122
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,467
And our reputations.

1123
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:58,100
All right.

1124
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,233
Come on, Dolly.

1125
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,433
Let's don't keep
our dates waiting.

1126
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:03,633
[music playing]

1127
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:06,000
Dusty, watch your dress.

1128
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,200
I can't help it.

1129
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,400
I'm always nervous
on the first date.

1130
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,833
Relax.

1131
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,867
All you got to do is be sweet,
get their guns away from 'em.

1132
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:16,667
Then you just, you know, sit
there and-- and smile pretty.

1133
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:19,700
Like this?

1134
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,767
Lucky thing for
us, they haven't

1135
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:22,533
seen a woman in a long time.

1136
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:23,500
You call that lucky?

1137
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,700
[music playing]

1138
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,600
Well, what do we have here?

1139
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,300
Looks like we get us a
couple of real cuties.

1140
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,900
Hey, baby.

1141
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,567
You can call me McGirk.

1142
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,900
No, I'm Dolly.

1143
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,533
Oh, your beard tickles!

1144
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:43,267
I'm Kitty.

1145
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:44,900
Who are you, big boy?

1146
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,100
Jake, and I'm here
to get friendly.

1147
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,067
Say, you're a-- a
big girl, aren't you?

1148
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:56,867
Well, just that much
more to get friendly with.

1149
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,467
I think you're
mighty pretty, Dolly.

1150
00:50:58,567 --> 00:50:59,300
Now come here!

1151
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,067
No!

1152
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,267
Not so tight!

1153
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:03,567
Don't be so shy, Dolly!

1154
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,967
Remember, we're here
to get friendly, huh?

1155
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,133
Yes, I know!

1156
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:10,400
But how's a girl
supposed to breathe?

1157
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,167
Let's show 'em how, huh, Kitty?

1158
00:51:13,267 --> 00:51:15,567
You're wearing a gun!

1159
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,067
I always wear a gun!

1160
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:18,500
But they frighten me so.

1161
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,333
I-- couldn't you just
make an exception?

1162
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,067
For me?

1163
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:28,500
Well, considering
it's for you, I--

1164
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,333
Nasty.

1165
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:33,133
Yeah.

1166
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:34,067
Come here.
-All right.

1167
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,233
Come on, Dolly!

1168
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:35,967
Look how good they're
getting along!

1169
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:36,800
Now come on!

1170
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,067
Let's talk first!

1171
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,733
Um, what do you
think of the weather?

1172
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:40,833
Oh, I think it's fine!

1173
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:41,833
Yeah.

1174
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:42,933
Read any good books lately?

1175
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:43,833
Will you quit stalling?

1176
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,800
I'm getting mad!

1177
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,133
Now don't do that!

1178
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,933
She's just shy!

1179
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:51,367
I'll talk to her.

1180
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:52,933
Don't be too long now, Kitty.

1181
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:53,767
I'm waiting!

1182
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,700
What's the matter?

1183
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,733
You crazy or something?

1184
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:58,800
You're supposed to be friendly!

1185
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,800
He's not my type.

1186
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,167
You don't have to marry him.

1187
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:02,633
You just got to get
him away from his gun.

1188
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,533
Now get back in there,
and be friendly.

1189
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:05,267
OK.

1190
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:06,533
But I wish he'd shaved.

1191
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:12,633
Now-- well, it's all
straightened out now.

1192
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:13,333
Good.

1193
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,067
Now come on, Dolly.

1194
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:18,333
Oh you're gun is poking
a hole in my corset!

1195
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:22,067
That's all that's bother
you, I-- now come here.

1196
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,300
Oh, listen.

1197
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,633
Why don't we-- why
don't we sit over here?

1198
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:25,467
Just--

1199
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,733
No, over there.

1200
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:28,567
Don't move.

1201
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,500
This is more like it.

1202
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,767
Yeah, well, let's just move
over for a little bit, huh?

1203
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,067
Don't worry, sweetheart.

1204
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:41,800
I just-- I just want
to stroke your hair.

1205
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,700
Hey!

1206
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,533
Now, Dusty!

1207
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,433
Dusty!

1208
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,800
Hey!

1209
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,933
Hold it right there!

1210
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,533
Get 'em up!
Get 'em up!

1211
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:54,167
Come on!

1212
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:55,100
Get 'em up!

1213
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,933
Get 'em up!

1214
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,900
All right, you two.

1215
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,233
Nobody does this to us.

1216
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:04,333
Now you're gonna get it.

1217
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:08,633
You know there, for a while,
I really started to like you.

1218
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,767
No, don't shoot!

1219
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:16,067
Here we are.

1220
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:16,967
Girls!

1221
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,800
Real ones!

1222
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,700
Oh.

1223
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,733
Get 'em on the horses!

1224
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:22,300
Let's get out of here!

1225
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,800
And you two just stick
right where you are.

1226
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,367
What happened?

1227
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:35,867
Yeah, everything
was going great.

1228
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:38,333
But those cutthroats, they
outsmarted us, and then

1229
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:39,600
kidnapped Lulu and Betsy.

1230
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,267
Mr. Callahan, you
promised us you

1231
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:42,833
were going to overpower them.

1232
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:44,300
We tried, Mr. Brookhaven.

1233
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,300
Yeah, we would have succeeded
except for one thing.

1234
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
What was that?

1235
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,567
Me.

1236
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:51,167
Lulu and Betsy, kidnapped
by those ruffians!

1237
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,467
Absolutely barbaric.

1238
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,633
You know, Mr. Callahan,
the way Jake and McGirk keep

1239
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,500
coming back here,
I figure they must

1240
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,233
be camped somewhere nearby.

1241
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,167
Good thinking, Andy.

1242
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:01,700
Good thinking.

1243
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,267
Let's see if we can pick up
their trail, track 'em down.

1244
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,100
Wipe off your mouth.

1245
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,667
[music playing]

1246
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,167
Now sit down and relax!

1247
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:44,100
Well, please, leave us alone.

1248
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
You'll never get
away with this.

1249
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,500
Who's gonna stop us?

1250
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,867
Friends in the dresses?

1251
00:54:48,967 --> 00:54:51,467
You know, you're purtier
than them other guys.

1252
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:57,100
I'm gonna like you.

1253
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,867
Please don't touch me!

1254
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:01,733
I'm a schoolteacher!

1255
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,500
Schoolteacher?

1256
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,633
Well, I'd like to
get some learning!

1257
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:12,767
We're glad you ladies
happened to pay us a visit.

1258
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,367
I'm sure you are.

1259
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:16,300
This place is a mess.

1260
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,200
There's dust all
over everything.

1261
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,600
So what?

1262
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,267
Well, we would never get
friendly in a dirty place

1263
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,200
like this, now would we, Betsy?

1264
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,667
Oh, no!

1265
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,633
There's dust all over the table!

1266
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,533
Wait a minute!

1267
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:36,267
We asked you here to get
friendly, not to clean!

1268
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,800
First things first.

1269
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,533
Here.

1270
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,333
Now you dust the table.

1271
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:41,600
You sweep.

1272
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,933
Well, I ain't gonna sweep!

1273
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:47,100
Do you want us to get
friendly or don't you?

1274
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,167
Well, uh--

1275
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:52,700
[music playing]

1276
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,067
That's more like it.

1277
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,500
Now, you get all
the corners, OK?

1278
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,400
Betsy, come over here.

1279
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,900
This window's filthy.

1280
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:02,500
[music playing]

1281
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:10,467
Lulu, how long do you
think we can stall 'em?

1282
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,533
Till our friends
come and save us.

1283
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:15,100
Just keep dusting
until they get here.

1284
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,400
Oh, yeah.

1285
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,567
Keep a sharp lookout
for any sign of a trail.

1286
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,767
Footprints, broken
branches, anything.

1287
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:22,767
Yeah.

1288
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:24,200
I haven't seen
anything like that.

1289
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,233
All I keep finding are pieces
of petticoat like this.

1290
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,500
Hey, what?

1291
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,367
Hey, that's a woman's petticoat.

1292
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:30,333
Yeah, look.

1293
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:32,067
There's another one.

1294
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,133
Hey, Lulu.

1295
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:33,967
Yeah.

1296
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:35,433
She'd think of that.

1297
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:37,067
She must have torn these
strips off to leave us a trail.

1298
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,167
All we got to do is follow,
lead us right to 'em.

1299
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,700
We better hope it's a short
trail or a long petticoat.

1300
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,600
When we find 'em, we'd
better have a plan.

1301
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,067
You're right, Andy.

1302
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,233
Yeah, without any guns, we
got-- ah, wait a minute.

1303
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,367
Maybe, just maybe-- yeah.

1304
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:52,867
Yeah, You and I'll
follow the trail.

1305
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:55,200
Dusty, you go get
the Brookhavens.

1306
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,600
Hey, wait!

1307
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,300
Now, get the bugle, pots,
pans, dishes, anything

1308
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,567
that'll make a lot of noise.

1309
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,133
Oh, and those, uh,
firecrackers we're

1310
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:04,433
saving for the Fourth
of July, coils of rope,

1311
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,233
and all the sacks of
flour that you can carry.

1312
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,533
All right?

1313
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:08,633
Hurry, and catch up
with us on the trail.

1314
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:10,100
What's all that stuff for?

1315
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,500
I'm gonna call out the cavalry.

1316
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,067
-The cavalry?
-Our cavalry.

1317
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:13,967
What cavalry?

1318
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:14,933
-Out cavalry!
-Oh that cavalry.

1319
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:15,767
Yes!

1320
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:17,200
Oh.

1321
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,233
Our cavalry?

1322
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,233
I'll explain it to you later.

1323
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,133
Come on.

1324
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:23,467
[music playing]

1325
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,900
Enough cleaning!

1326
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:33,967
Let's get to know each
other a little better, huh?

1327
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:35,733
Well, you certainly
got to admit,

1328
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:37,367
the place looks a lot nicer.

1329
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:38,400
Yeah, all spic-and-span.

1330
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,300
All ready to get acquainted in.

1331
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,633
Now, come on over and sit down.

1332
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:42,800
Uh, just a moment.

1333
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,067
Uh, the place looks
night and clean.

1334
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,300
But you fellas don't.

1335
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,100
You mean, now we have to wash?

1336
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,133
You mean just to
get acquainted?

1337
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,367
Well, of course!

1338
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:56,200
After all, you are
entertaining ladies.

1339
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,633
Uh, here we are!

1340
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:07,567
Um, you first.

1341
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,067
I don't believe this!

1342
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,233
Uh, don't forget your ears!

1343
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,067
Good.

1344
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,267
Now here's the soap.

1345
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,467
Soap?

1346
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:26,800
That does it.

1347
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,533
Now, quit stalling, or
we'll have to get tough!

1348
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:30,567
What do you mean?

1349
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:32,400
He means we want to get chummy!

1350
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,433
That's what he means!

1351
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:35,233
Well, you don't have to shout.

1352
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,400
I mean, all you
have to do is so.

1353
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,300
We were too busy cleaning!

1354
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,267
Now, you two sit down over here
and start getting friendly!

1355
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:47,200
[music playing]

1356
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:49,533
That's the place.

1357
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:50,367
I see their horses.

1358
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:52,200
Yeah.

1359
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,100
All right.

1360
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,467
Bring those supplies up.

1361
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,533
When do we rush 'em?

1362
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:56,733
We can't.

1363
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,733
They got Lulu and
Betsy down there.

1364
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:58,667
It's too dangerous.

1365
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:00,067
We got to scare 'em out.

1366
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,567
Mr. Callahan, where
is your cavalry?

1367
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,533
We dragged these
supplies for miles.

1368
00:59:04,633 --> 00:59:06,700
And how many will
there be for dinner?

1369
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,467
That is our cavalry!

1370
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:09,867
I beg your pardon?

1371
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,533
Follow me.

1373
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,733
I know a lovely sewing game.

1374
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,333
We prefer kissing games.

1375
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:29,533
Uh, oh!

1376
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,333
I know a great kissing game.

1377
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:34,067
Uh, the two of you sit down.

1378
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:34,900
Yeah!

1379
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,133
And then, uh, close your eyes.

1380
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:40,333
And one of us will kiss you,
and you try and guess who it is.

1381
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:41,767
Won't that be fun?

1382
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:43,433
Well, it's a start.

1383
00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:44,333
OK.

1384
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:45,867
Now close your eyes.

1385
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:46,700
Tight.

1386
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:58,200
Now, no peeking.

No.

1392
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:15,300
Guess again.

1393
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,167
Uh, uh, Lulu!

1394
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:18,533
Uh, Betsy!

1395
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:19,400
Nope!

got to move fast.

what they're supposed

1406
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:27,567
to do when I give the signal?

-Aye aye, captain.
-All right.

1408
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:29,733
I sure hope this plan works.

1409
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,067
It's a splendid plan.

1410
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,533

1411

use in struggling here.

Hey, you want to put
that right on here.

Yeah.

1430

You got firecrackers ready?

-All right.

I don't know.
I can't see a thing.

01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,533
They must be hiding!

We're going out that front door.

You know something,
Mr. Callahan?

You really look tall and
straight in that saddle today.

Yeah.

like you lost a lot of weight,

close, not that close.

know, this place is in pretty

1525

I don't think we're as
alone here as we think.

somebody's watching us.

side of the street.

mysterious going on.

will tell us something.

No.

It does seem odd.

Yet there's no one in
town to do the staring.

There's some clothes up
there on the clothesline.

left in a hurry.

there waiting for us.

It's the wind.
I'm sure it's the wind.

anything in my whole life

that it's the wind.
-Why?

1587
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:50,600
Because I don't want to
go in there and find out

1588
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,200
it's not the wind.

Let's go talk to her.
-No!

I mean, she's the
ugliest woman I've

1605
01:10:11,433 --> 01:10:12,933
ever seen in my whole life.

1606
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:13,867
She's got a big nose, and her
hair's growing out of her head

1607
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:15,233
like horns.

1608
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:16,233
And her eyes are all
glassy and beady and red.

1609
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:16,667
And her skin is all kinds--

1610
01:10:20,233 --> 01:10:21,200
That's not a dancehall hostess.

1611
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,233
Look again.

1612
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:26,767
It's a moose head!

01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:30,567
Yeah!

going when he hit that wall.

01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:51,767
I found a pair of boots, a pair
of pants, and a pair of socks.

1621
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:52,933
Do you know what that means?

1622
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:54,133
Certainly.

1623
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:55,900
Some cowhand was
having his legs shaved.

1624
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,567
It means that somebody left
the shop in too much of a hurry

1625
01:10:58,667 --> 01:10:59,600
to even dress.

1626
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,467
Judging by the quality
of his trousers,

1627
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:03,067
I guess he rushed off
to shoot his tailor.

1628
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,200
I've got a feeling it's all
part of the same mystery.

1629
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,733
Let's go over to the
newspaper office.

1630
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:09,733
Maybe the last edition of the
paper will give us a clue.

1631
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:10,833
Good!

1632
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,600
Maybe they'll have a
stock market report.

1633
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,933
Come along!

1634
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:15,133
It's so dark in here.

1635
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:16,633
I wish we had a
lantern or something.

1636
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:18,100
Maybe there's something
behind the bar.

1637
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:18,967
Oh?

1638
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,767
Oh, look.

1639
01:11:22,867 --> 01:11:23,933
Hey, I found a candle.

1640
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:25,467
WAGONMASTER CALLAHAN:
Hey, good, little pal.

1641
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:27,067
Here, let me light it for you.

1642
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,733
Well, now we can
see what's what.

1643
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:36,467
I can see the saloon and
the tables and the gunpowder.

1644
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:37,100
What?

1645
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:37,933
Gunpowder?

1646
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:42,633
What-- this whole bar is
stacked with gunpowder!

1647
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:44,300
Why would a saloon
be full of gunpowder?

1648
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,700
I don't know.

1649
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,700
Hold that candle down
here so I can-- uh, Dusty?

1650
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,167
That's not a candle.
-Sure it is.

1651
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:51,233
You just said it was.
Why would you lie?

1652
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,567
No, no.

1653
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:55,300
That's not a-- that is
a, stick of gunpowder.

1654
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,567
That's why you wouldn't lie?

1655
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,567
Because of the stick
of gun-- gunpowder?

1656
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:00,600
What, what, what-- what
are we gonna do with it?

1657
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,067
Throw it!
Throw it out the window!

1658
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,533
Huh?

1659
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:04,267
No, if I throw it out the
window, I'll break the window.

1660
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,667
No, please!

1661
01:12:05,767 --> 01:12:06,267
For Pete's sake, throw
it out the window, Dusty!

1662
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:07,067
Oh!

1663
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:13,833
Dusty, get down!

1664
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,567
All right.

1665
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,533
You can get up now, little pal.

1666
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:26,067
I said-- I said you
can get up now, Dusty.

1667
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:27,067
What's the matter?

1668
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:28,133
Didn't you hear me?
Oh.

1669
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:29,167
Didn't you hear me?
-Huh?

1670
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:30,500
Oh.

1671
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,833
You know how they say
when you're gonna die,

1672
01:12:31,933 --> 01:12:33,167
your whole life passes
right in front of you?

1673
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:34,333
-Yeah.
-Mine was only half done.

1674
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:35,133
You know, it's
really interesting.

1675
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:36,067
[gunshot]

1676
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:38,333
Hey, that sounds like
the trouble signal.

1677
01:12:38,433 --> 01:12:39,167
Let's go.

1678
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:42,567
[music playing]

1679
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:48,333
Hey!

1680
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:49,267
What is it?

1681
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:50,200
Everybody here all right?

1682
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,367
Yeah, so far.

1683
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,667
But I wouldn't
count on out future.

1684
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:54,800
We found the reason
the townpeople deserted.

1685
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,167
It's right here
in this newspaper.

1686
01:12:56,267 --> 01:12:58,067
Oh, I'll take one.

1687
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:58,900
here.

1688
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:00,133
Keep the change.

1689
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:01,967
Why, Skullner brothers.

1690
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:03,333
Outlaws.

1691
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:04,833
I never heard of them.

1692
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:07,600
It says here they're armed
bank robbers and murderers!

1693
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,500
Perhaps they had an
unpleasant childhood.

1694
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,400
Daphne sees good in everyone.

1695
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,067
Well, the Skullners
threatened to come back to town

1696
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:16,167
and kill everyone if they
didn't give 'em all their money

1697
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,467
and their valuables.

1698
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,433
Yeah, it's plain as
the nose on your face.

1699
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:19,967
Just a case of blackmail.

1700
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,667
So the whole lily-livered
town took a powder.

1701
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:25,300
I think the townspeople
were wise to run,

1702
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,967
especially the wealthy ones.

1703
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:29,133
And I happen to be a
member of that club.

1704
01:13:29,233 --> 01:13:30,333
Come alone, Daphne.

1705
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:31,333
Now, wait a minute!

1706
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:32,933
Everybody just simmer down.

1707
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:34,833
What-- way I see it, they've
already come and gone.

1708
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:36,633
They saw the town was empty,
and they just took off.

1709
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:38,467
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

1710
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:39,733
I'm positive.

1711
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:40,600
[gunfire]

1712
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,733
Well, all-- it's not absolute.

1713
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,833
[gunfire]

1714
01:13:49,433 --> 01:13:51,067
The Skullners are coming!

1715
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,933
The Skullners are coming!

1716
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:53,767
Hey, darn it to heck!

1717
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:54,933
The horses are running away!

1718
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:55,800
No, no.

1719
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,200
Dusty's chasing 'em.
-No, no.

1720
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,067
Dusty's not chasing them.

1721
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,133
He's passing them!

1722
01:13:59,233 --> 01:14:00,067
[gunfire]

1723
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:00,767
All right!

1724
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:01,767
You girls in the wagon!

1725
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:02,433
Come on.

1726
01:14:02,533 --> 01:14:03,567
You men follow me.

1727
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:07,133
[music playing]

1728
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:16,733
Thought you'd be halfway
to California by now.

1729
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,133
I suddenly realized
it was my job

1730
01:14:18,233 --> 01:14:19,167
to help you protect everybody.

1731
01:14:19,267 --> 01:14:20,067
Yeah.

1732
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,067
Especially me.

1733
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,367
Mr. Callahan?

1734
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:24,633
The Skullners obviously
believe that we

1735
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:25,900
are citizens of this town.

1736
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:27,600
Now, I think we
should let them know

1737
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,367
that we're perfect strangers.

1738
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:31,067
I think they'd let us go.

1739
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,567
Yeah, with their records, I
don't think they'd buy that.

1740
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:36,667
Nevertheless, I would like
to inform them who we are.

1741
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:40,500
Oh, please, be my guest, yes.

1742
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:46,233
I say out there, we
are perfect strangers!

1743
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:50,233
We are perfect strangers!

1744
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,233
[gunshot]

1745
01:14:53,733 --> 01:14:57,100
Well, I guess they figure
nobody can be perfect, huh?

1746
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,933
Hey, wait!

1747
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,200
Come here!

1748
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,067
Didn't you see what just
happened to Mr. Brookhaven?

1749
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,067
Well, yes, sir.

1750
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:03,600
But the Skullners
aren't animals.

1751
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,233
I'm sure they'd recognize
the white flag of truce.

1752
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,567
What makes you think so?

1753
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,067
Well, it happens to be
the code of the West.

1754
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,433
-Yeah, the code of the West.
-What?

1755
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:10,267
Oh.

1756
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:17,667
[gunfire]

1757
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:22,367
Maybe the code of the East.

1758

[music playing]

1759
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,133
The Skullners haven't fired
at us for quite a while.

1760
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,133
Maybe they're out of bullets.

1761
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:33,267
[gunfire]

1762
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,533
Somehow, I don't think so.

1763
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:37,833
Mr. Callahan!

1764
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,067
One of the Skullners
is riding right for us!

[music playing]

1766
01:15:46,733 --> 01:15:50,067
We got a visitor, but that
ain't one of the Skullners.

1767
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,300
Come on.

1768
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,367
Hey.
-What?

1769
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,200
It's a scarecrow!

1770
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,067
Whoa.

1771
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,133
Hey, baby.
Hold on.

1772
01:15:57,233 --> 01:15:58,167
Hold on there now a minute.

1773
01:15:58,267 --> 01:15:59,500
Yeah, a dead scarecrow.

1774
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,067
Look at that knife.

1775
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,167
WAGONMASTER CALLAHAN: Yeah,
it's holding a message.

1776
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,733
Ooh, I hate the sight of
blood, even if it's straw.

1777
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,533
We have the town surrounded.

1778
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:09,667
Fork over all your gold
and stuff by sunup,

1779
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:10,833
or we'll burn you out.

1780
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,400
They're bluffing, of course.

1781
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,800
And if you think
we're bluffing,

1782
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,367
you're a bigger dummy than
the one on the jackass.

1783
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,400
Well, we've still got a problem.

1784
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,500
But at least we're safer in here
than we are out on that street.

1785
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
Where do we go from
here, Mr. Callahan?

1786
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,600
We don't go anyplace.

1787
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,067
Too dangerous out there.

1788
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:30,967
Impossible!

1789
01:16:31,067 --> 01:16:32,867
How can three men
surround a town?

1790
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,400
Because they got a lot of guns!

1791
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,933
Besides, they've got the only
road out of here blocked.

1792
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:41,267
I do not believe those ruffians
realize they are jeopardizing

1793
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:42,633
the lives of women!

1794
01:16:42,733 --> 01:16:44,200
Mrs. Brookhaven,
the Skullner brothers

1795
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,333
do not care about women, men,
children, pets, or anything

1796
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:49,200
else.

1797
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,700
Lulu, Betsy, I think
it's time we stepped in.

1798
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,500
That a girl, Mrs. D!

1799
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,967
I'm with you.

1800
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,067
Uh, me, too, Mrs. Brookhaven.

1801
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:02,700
Daphne, dear!

1802
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,733
Not now, Carter!

1803
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,633
Good heavens!

1804
01:17:05,733 --> 01:17:07,467
Just like her mother!

1805
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:10,667
Mrs. Brookhaven, as your
wagon master, I cannot permit--

1806
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,767
Stand aside, Mr. Callahan.

1807
01:17:12,867 --> 01:17:14,300
Take my hand, girls.

1808
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,233
I think it's time we showed
these men what women can do.

1809
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,633
Mrs. B, you've got more
sand in your little craw

1810
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,067
than a gila monster
with a long neck!

1811
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:22,267
Thank you!

1812
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:24,267
Uh, wait a minute!

1813
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:25,700
Have you all lost your minds?

1814
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,067
I mean, those Skullner
brothers will show no mercy.

1815
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:30,433
They would never
dare shoot a woman.

1816
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:34,600
Only a bounder or a cad would
entertain such a notion.

1817
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,567
Well, I cannot per-- hey!

1818
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:38,533
Stop 'em, Andy!

1819
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:39,500
Whoa!

1820
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,933
[music playing]

1821
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:45,233
[gunfire]

1822
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:50,400
There were two bounders
and a cad out there!

1823
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,767
I guess we'd better change.

1824
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:56,500
Daphne, cover up
your pantaloons.

1825
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,833
If anyone should
see you like that,

1826
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,633
we'd be drummed right
out of the country club!

1827
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:02,367
You know, it's no use.

1828
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:04,500
They've got us covered so
tight, it'd take an army

1829
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,433
to penetrate their position.

1830
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:07,533
Army?
Andy!

1831
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:08,667
Huh?

1832
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:09,667
-That's the answer!
-Yeah, army!

1833
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:10,633
That's the answer!

1834
01:18:10,733 --> 01:18:11,433
But what is the question?

1835
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:12,600
Fort Hodgekiss.

1836
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,600
It's-- it's just
over the hill there.

1837
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,300
If one of us could get
up over those rocks,

1838
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,433
we could get some help.

1839
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:18,600
We can draw straws
to see who goes.

1840
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,700
No, no.
I'm the wagon master.

1841
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,867
I should be the one to do this.

1842
01:18:20,967 --> 01:18:22,633
I still think we
should draw straws.

1843
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:25,533
Straw-- oh, yeah, Andy.

1844
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:26,767
Straws.
That's the answer.

1845
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:27,933
Yeah, straws.
That's the answer.

1846
01:18:28,067 --> 01:18:29,267
But I still don't
know the question.

1847
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,667
Uh, no.
I'll explain it.

1848
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:34,067
[music playing]

1849
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:35,700
You look great, Mr. Callahan.

1850
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,067
Thank you, Dusty.

1851
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,333
By the time the Skullner
brothers figure out

1852
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:40,167
you're not a scarecrow,
you'll be on your way

1853
01:18:40,267 --> 01:18:41,200
to Fort Hodgekiss.

1854
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,300
They'll never give
me a second look.

1855
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,233
Neither will a crow.

1856
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,367
Only trouble is this stuff
makes you want to sneeze.

1857
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:51,833
Whatever you do, don't sneeze.

1858
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:54,233
No, if you sneeze,
you're a dead man.

1859
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:55,167
All right.

1860
01:18:55,267 --> 01:18:55,800
Wish me luck.

1861
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,133
Luck, luck.

1862
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:57,967
Good thinking.

1863
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:58,600
Yeah.

1864
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,167
[music playing]

1865
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:12,967
Our wagon master
is a very brave man.

1866
01:19:13,067 --> 01:19:14,133
Oh, I'd say he's
braver than that.

1867
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:15,633
I'd say he's a very,
very brave man.

1868
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:19,633
To show my appreciation, in
case Mr. Callahan is killed

1869
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:21,933
in this attempt
to save our lives,

1870
01:19:22,067 --> 01:19:23,467
I intend to raise his salary.

1871
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,167
Whooey!

1872
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:28,967
Ain't we gonna have us some fun?

1873
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:31,567
Them townfolks is
pinned down as cold

1874
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,567
as a dead carp in February.

1875
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:37,733
We'll get all their gold
and burn 'em all down, too!

1876
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,300
Yeah, we is!

1877
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,967
Oh!

1878
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:43,067
Something's headed this way.

1879
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,300
Hey, save your bullets, Luke.

1880
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,133
It's only that old
jackass we sent 'em.

1881
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:49,833
Them folks is so scared, they
can't even hang on to a straw

1882
01:19:49,933 --> 01:19:51,867
man on a sway-back mule.

1883
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:55,433
[music playing]

1884
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:02,333
What's the matter, little lady?

1885
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:03,467
Let's move on.

1886
01:20:03,567 --> 01:20:06,900
Put one foot in front
of the other there.

1887
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,400
That scarecrow looks
a little different.

1888
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:12,967
If you ask me, it looks like
his nose has growed a mite.

1889
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:16,600
Well, let's just see which one
of us can shoot it flat again.

1890
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:22,800
Come on, let's,
let's-- [sneeze].

1891
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,433
Hey, that ain't no scarecrow.

1892
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:25,467
That's a real dummy.

1893
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:26,533
Let him have it, boys!

1894
01:20:26,633 --> 01:20:30,067
[music playing]

1895
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:33,933
Blarney and good old Freckles.

1896
01:20:34,033 --> 01:20:38,467
They came back, and the rest
of the horses followed 'em.

1897
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,233
Yeah, that ought to do it.

1898
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,033
It's a great
idea, Mr. Callahan.

1899
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:43,467
Yeah, I've used
that trick before.

1900
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:45,267
All that stuff on the wheels
keep 'em nice and quiet.

1901
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:50,200
We'll be able to sneak
out of town real easy.

1902
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,400
Something wrong?

1903
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,400
Yeah, it sure feels
funny looking at my bustle

1904
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,300
on a different caboose.

1905
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,600
Yeah.

1906
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,167
Now we got those wagon wheels
all silenced, all of you

1907
01:20:59,267 --> 01:21:01,533
can get out of here
without any trouble.

1908
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:02,767
All of us?

1909
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:04,667
Mr. Callahan, aren't
you going with us?

1910
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:05,633
Uh, no, no, no.

1911
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:07,067
I got a plan.

1912
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:07,900
I'm gonna stay here and
keep those Skullner boys--

1913
01:21:08,067 --> 01:21:08,767
Oh, no, you're not!

1914
01:21:08,867 --> 01:21:10,333
[arguing]

1915
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,167
Shh.

1916
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,333
Now, I'm your wagon master.

1917
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:14,067
I made up my mind.

1918
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,067
I can't let you do it.

1919
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,067
I can't let you face 'em alone.

1920
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,733
I heartily agree with Dusty.

1921
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,467
Perhaps the lad
should stay with you.

1922
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,067
No, no.

1923
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,167
Dusty's got to scout the trail,
take care of the animals.

1924
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:23,967
Hey, you know that
big tall mountain

1925
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:25,067
over there north, northwest?

1926
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,067
You head 'em right toward that.

1927
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,200
Uh, north by northwest.

1928
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,067
Uh, north.

1929
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:28,767
Yea.

1930
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:30,167
You're quite a guy, Cal.

1931
01:21:30,267 --> 01:21:32,767
And when I open up Lulu's
Saloon, I'm-- I'm gonna

1932
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:33,900
name a drink after you.

1933
01:21:34,067 --> 01:21:35,133
You just make sure
it's a tall one,

1934
01:21:35,233 --> 01:21:36,767
and don't put in
too much water, huh?

1935
01:21:36,867 --> 01:21:38,133
Hey, that's all right.

1936
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:39,600
I've learned a lot
from you, Callahan.

1937
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,967
OK, Andy.
OK.

1938
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:41,900
-You're a real wagon master.
-Yeah, all right.

1939
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:43,167
All right.

1940
01:21:43,267 --> 01:21:44,133
Mr. Callahan, I know
we'll see you soon.

1941
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,800
Yeah, of course you will.

1942
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,100
Run along, baby.

1943
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,800
Mr. Callahan, all of
Mr. Brookhaven's money

1944
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,933
couldn't pay you for
what you're about to do.

1945
01:21:52,067 --> 01:21:53,467
Oh, what you said!

1946
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:56,767
But you know, Mr.
Callahan, she's quite right.

1947
01:21:56,867 --> 01:21:57,733
Thank you, sir.

1948
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:58,600
Mr. Brookhaven.

1949
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,167
Mrs. Brookhaven.

1950
01:22:00,267 --> 01:22:02,267
Is there anything I can do
to help you before I leave?

1951
01:22:02,367 --> 01:22:03,533
Uh, yeah.

1952
01:22:03,633 --> 01:22:05,733
Why don't we see if all the
weapons are loaded, huh?

1953
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,567
Yeah.

1954
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:08,567
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1955
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,400
Yes, sir.

1956
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,333
Winchester .44.

1957
01:22:10,433 --> 01:22:12,767
Yeah, check.

1958
01:22:12,867 --> 01:22:14,300
Single barrel.

1959
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,600
Check.

1960
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,833
-Double barrel.
-Check.

1961
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:17,667
Ah!

1962
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:18,500
Oh!

1963
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,733
Oh.

1964
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:21,967
Listen, I'll get a bandage
behind the bar for you.

1965
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:24,767
All right, Dusty.

1966
01:22:24,867 --> 01:22:27,267
Oh, oh.

1967
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:29,100
Oh, no, Dusty.

1968
01:22:33,267 --> 01:22:35,900
Well, it's all up
to you now, Andy.

1969
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:38,167
I'm sorry, but, you
know, there's nothing I--

1970
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:39,967
Well, you've done all you can.

1971
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:41,700
How did the accident happened?

1972
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,300
Well, uh--

1973
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,067
Oh, it was all my dumb fault.

1974
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:47,233
No, we got this one caught
in the breach of that shotgun

1975
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,067
there.

1976
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,333
That wasn't the dumb thing.

1977
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:50,933
The real dumb thing was
he-- he had his hand

1978
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,467
on the bar like this, you know?

1979
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:53,667
And I went in to get a bandage,
and I took the countertop

1980
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:54,600
like that and went--

1981
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,967
Ow!

1982
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:57,933
[music playing]

1983
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,167
Well, I'll tell
you one thing-- that

1984
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,233
just about settles our hash.

1985
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:04,500
We've got to have
faith, Mr. Callahan.

1986
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,367
There's got to be a way to
stop the Skullner brothers.

1987
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:10,967
Yeah, maybe if Bat
Masterson rode into town.

1988
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:12,267
Yeah, Bat Masterson
could do it.

1989
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:13,567
He was a little guy like me.

1990
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:14,733
When those bad guys
saw him with that cane,

1991
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:17,833
they ran for their lives.

1992
01:23:17,933 --> 01:23:19,133
Lulu?

1993
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:20,933
I'm way ahead of you, Cal.

1994
01:23:21,067 --> 01:23:23,833
I'm gonna go get my makeup kit.

1995
01:23:23,933 --> 01:23:26,700
Folks, meet Bat Masterson.

1996
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,967
You're a spitting image.

1997
01:23:30,067 --> 01:23:31,700
There you go-- one of Mr.
Brookhaven's very best.

1998
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,200
Yeah.

1999
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:38,233
Listen, are you sure I look
enough like Bat Masterson

2000
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:39,800
to fool the Skullner brothers?

2001
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,100
Yeah, why don't you just look
a little tougher, you know?

2002
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,067
Like you mean business.

2003
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:46,933
Yeah, now.

2004
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:48,567
Now you're getting it.

2005
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:49,400
Come on.

2006
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,367
Ah, that's it!

2007
01:23:50,467 --> 01:23:51,567
That's it!
-That's perfect, Dusty!

2008
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:52,400
Take a look!

2009
01:23:55,267 --> 01:23:56,633
It's sunup, Mr. Callahan.

2010
01:23:56,733 --> 01:23:58,767
Skullners will be heading
this way any minute.

2011
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,100
All right.

2012
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,267
Now you just go out
there and face 'em.

2013
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:02,367
If I got this
figured right, there

2014
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:04,067
won't even be any gunplay.

2015
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:06,267
We'll have you covered
from here as best we can.

2016
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,100
I guess this is it.

2017
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,233
Poor Dusty.

2018
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:18,933
We may never see him again.

2019
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:21,167
Yes, you will, honey.

2020
01:24:21,267 --> 01:24:22,833
That's a closet.

2025
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,967
Bat Masterson?

2026
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:10,100
What's Bat Masterson doing here?

2027
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:10,933
Let's go see.

2028
01:25:11,067 --> 01:25:14,533
[music playing]

2029
01:25:20,967 --> 01:25:22,133
The Skullners have dismounted.

2030
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:23,467
They're coming after him!

2031
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:26,100
Yeah, we'd better get
ready to protect him.

2032
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,833
[music playing]

2033
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,300
That ain't Bat Masterson.

2034
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,200
He ain't twirled his cane yet.

2035
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,767
[music playing]

2036
01:26:30,267 --> 01:26:32,200
That's Bat Masterson, all right.

2037
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,633
We give up, Bat!

2038
01:26:33,733 --> 01:26:34,667
Hey, Andy!

2039
01:26:34,767 --> 01:26:36,533
You hog-tie them
critters good and tight!

2040
01:26:36,633 --> 01:26:38,567
Say, Dusty, that was
a pretty good thing

2041
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:40,267
you done there with that cane!

2042
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:41,200
How'd you do that?

2043
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,400
Easy, Mr. Callahan.

2044
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,600
All I did was just
take it like this,

2045
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,233
and I threw it in
the air, and then

2046
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:48,800
I waited for it to come down.

2047
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,900
[music playing]

2048
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,567
Goodnight, Mr. Callahan.
