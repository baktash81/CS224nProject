00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE DILEMMA (2011)

2
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,830
You've got to picture this.

3
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,749
It was freshman year, there he is,

4
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,420
completely naked, right outside the office!

5
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,839
And he says, "Ronny told me to show up."

6
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,799
Hey, I have a question for the table.

7
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,428
How long does it take to really know someone?

8
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,055
I think you're continually
getting to know someone.

9
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,266
'Cause I think people change when they grow.

10
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,144
But I do think if you go through hell with someone,

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,772
then you get a pretty good sense
of how they handle stuff,

12
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,315
which is important.

13
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,359
Come on, we're on the other side of that one.

14
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,945
I don't know.

15
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,699
I think you can know someone within
the first 10 seconds of seeing them.

16
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,035
I mean, I fell in love with Geneva the second I saw her.

17
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,495
Aw...

18
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,996
It's true. I did.

19
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,374
Well, I don't know if you ever
really know someone entirely.

20
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,959
And what is that supposed to mean? Yeah.

21
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,296
Well, I mean, you know someone,
you think pretty good,

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,007
and then you find out stuff that's shocking
that you didn't know existed.

23
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,217
I think that happens every day.

24
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,969
Look at that show 20/20, it's always
the same thing, right?

25
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,180
They're a couple, they're happy,
no one could believe it.

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,389
There are a lot of these cases.

27
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,557
What about the guy with the crossbow?

28
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,643
He buys a crossbow, he's practicing in the garage.

29
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,144
"By the way, bring me some lemonade.

30
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,064
"Oh, my goodness, I had no idea you walked
through at that moment. Oops!"

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,483
- Continue, please. Continue.
- That is gross!

32
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,402
But she forgives him. It was an
accident, and guess what?

33
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,364
Six months later, same accident. Yes, and it kills her.

34
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,865
No! Yes!

35
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,991
No!

36
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,370
And, look it, you hear all the time about these families

37
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,747
that have entirely other families.

38
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,165
The dad, who knows what he does for a living,

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,667
he leaves to go to Connecticut.

40
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,002
But he was never going to Connecticut on business.

41
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,213
He's really going to Harlem. He's
got a Puerto Rican family

42
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,506
that no one ever heard about. Yeah.

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,634
You think when he's watching the game, instead
of pretzels, he's eating Goya beans.

44
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,052
Red flags, but they don't catch it.

45
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,805
So my point is, you can really
think you know somebody,

46
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,599
and then it turns out that you don't
know everything about somebody.

47
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,560
All right, Ronny. You still haven't
answered the question.

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,436
No, I just did. You didn't.

49
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,063
No, you didn't answer it. You're skirting it.

50
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,606
You're not answering straight up. Come on.

51
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,317
You're bouncing around, you're doing
this, "Hey!" When you're doing this...

52
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,527
You do that a lot, by the way.

53
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,862
I think you're all special peoples.

54
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,196
You're out of your mind!

55
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,115
And you're nothing of the sort.

56
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,053
This is our shot. I need you to hug him.

57
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,347
I don't want to hug him.

58
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,558
Look it, ever since he had a near-death experience,

59
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,728
he's become a very touchy-feely
guy, and he likes to be held.

60
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,606
Look, you know I don't like touching
people I don't know very well, okay?

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,566
Or even people I do. So just...

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,319
Nick, do you want this thing or not?

63
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,362
Of course I do.

64
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,655
Then feed the beast here!

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,743
This guy has a hot button, a point
of interest. His hot button is hugs.

66
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,245
You hug him, you're gonna crack him wide open!

67
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,080
He's going to start feeling all bubbly inside.

68
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,332
Then he starts writing checks!

69
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,750
All right.

70
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,085
I'm not asking you to go to an airport motel

71
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,212
and perform a trick on a Japanese businessman.

72
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,091
I'm asking you to hug a senior executive
from General Motors, that's all!

73
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,468
Now get your arms around him,

74
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,637
and make him feel bubbly and warm!

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,101
I'll tell you what.

76
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,940
Why don't you let Charles take you guys
over here and show you the entire line.

77
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,149
And it's great to have you here.

78
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,234
Thank you.

79
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,611
Man!

80
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,947
This puppy here reminds me of my first Dodge.

81
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,031
Uh-huh?

82
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,449
Remember that?

83
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,786
Remember when cars were meant just
to be fun things to have, right?

84
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,958
They made a cool noise, they harnessed real power

85
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,626
and they made you feel like a badass

86
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,712
because you got to be the one right
there behind the wheel of it, right?

87
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm sorry, I'm Ronny Valentine
from B & V Engine Design.

88
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,301
Thomas Fern. Yeah, Thomas, good to see you again.

89
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,514
We actually helped you out with a few
ECU modules a few years back.

90
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,224
Of course. Yeah.

91
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,644
Hey, that's... There, my partner, Nick Brannen.

92
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,813
Congrats.

93
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,691
It's gonna be a great year. It really is.

94
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,734
Of course.

95
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,029
Your soul was too important to take.

96
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,365
You've got great days ahead of you, my friend.

97
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,493
You know, we actually have one idea
we're not committed to anyone on.

98
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
We could run it by your team,

99
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,955
and see if it's something that made sense for you.

100
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,581
I'd love that.

101
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,208
Maybe we could get something on the books.

102
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,794
We'll come up there to Rock City,
to Detroit, and come see you.

103
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,798
Okay. Yeah.

104
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,803
You lying bastard!

105
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,055
You are unbelievable. Did we get the meeting or not?

106
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,932
I'm hugging this man like I'm some kind of asshole...

107
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,350
Now, why were you hugging the man?

108
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,977
Because he's our guy's direct competitor.

109
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,187
Why would you hug the direct competitor?

110
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,564
Because he had a near-death experience.

111
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,648
Actually, no, he didn't.

112
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,109
That never happened. I made that up.

113
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,028
Shame, shame, shame.

114
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,863
What are you doing? What do
you mean, what am I doing?

115
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,281
Did we get the meeting or what?

116
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,365
Come on, Nick.

117
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,367
I'm never hugging again. I'm not listening to you.

118
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,493
He sets me up!

119
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,079
What do you expect me to do? Geneva, listen to me.

120
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,622
You know him, he's way too honest.

121
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,249
If I fill him in on it, what happens?

122
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,878
The sweating, he starts hyperventilating,
he passes out!

123
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,379
It was completely necessary.

124
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,965
Nick, my man,

125
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,677
we got the meeting.

126
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes, I love your boyfriend.

127
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,850
You, I will hug. This is free. I'll hug you right back!

128
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,018
This is no charge! Come in here! My man!

129
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,644
Don't ever let me go.

130
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,987
They've had a couple of lessons. Yeah!

131
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,489
Okay, let's dance.

132
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,908
Less is more. I'm dancing on the inside.

133
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,284
Are you dancing right now? Yes.

134
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,494
Oh, okay.

135
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,246
Honey, listen, you can never trust a man who dances.

136
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,539
Look at the great men throughout history,

137
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,957
none of them were dancers.

138
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,335
Abraham Lincoln? Not a big dancer.

139
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,754
Winston Churchill, he never tore up the dance floor.

140
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,256
Martin Luther King, he might've had
a dream, but he never danced to it.

141
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,674
Okay, come on. I'm serious.

142
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,676
Come on, tiny dancer, let's go.

143
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,804
You plant it here right now.

144
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,348
Look, you think they're great, and they're dancing.

145
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,519
I think they're better than
great. I think they're the best.

146
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,021
When it comes to being a couple, they're my heroes.

147
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,525
Hey! Come on, why you sitting? Get up, let's do this!

148
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,568
Oh, Nick, you know, Ronny here,

149
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,278
he just called you his hero couple,

150
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,447
and yet he still refuses to dance with me.

151
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,366
Will you stop? Do not give him ammo.

152
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,662
Ronny just told Beth I'm his hero. I'm your hero!

153
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,163
You're the worst.

154
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,874
Oh, come on. Every kid wants to dance with his hero!

155
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,376
Bring it up here!

156
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,961
Let's do it.

157
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,767
Yo!

158
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,019
Blue! Set! Hut! Hut!

159
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,064
Go long, baby! Go long!

160
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,776
Yes!

161
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,861
Whoo-hoo!

162
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,623
My man.

163
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,419
That just happened. Oh, yeah.

164
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,421
I don't think I'll ever forget that!

165
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,631
Oh, great. Is that burned in the hard drive now?

166
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,091
Mmm-hmm. I think so.

167
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,890
Excuse me.

168
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,601
Hey, I need to do this.

169
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,936
Let me show you how this is done.

170
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,271
Be my guest.

171
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,360
Come on, pal.

172
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,988
I think you're stuck with me.

173
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,618
So when are you gonna ask her?

174
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,536
What?

175
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,330
Come on, Ronny!

176
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,332
You can see it all over her face!

177
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,045
You're never gonna find a girl as great as her.

178
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,296
Let's be realistic.

179
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,049
Nick and I aren't making any new friends.

180
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,219
You've dated all my girlfriends.

181
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,262
You've batted through the whole lineup,

182
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,474
and there's nothing left, you know?

183
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,517
Plus, we like her.

184
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,978
Those other ones, we didn't even
like, and they're my friends!

185
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,148
Trust me.

186
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,485
Pop the question or you're gonna lose her.

187
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,822
There you go! Hey, hey!

188
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,159
Special delivery! How's that for an entrance?

189
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,370
You were missed.

190
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,829
I missed you, too.

191
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
What? Nothing.

192
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,800
Now I'm gonna turn up the heat.

193
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,803
What happens when the kitchen gets hot,
because I'm cooking something up, chef.

194
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,097
Don't play into my strength.

195
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,894
Whoo!

196
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,562
Fifteen to four!

197
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,731
Really? You're gonna start... Now you're dancing?

198
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,359
It's like I'm playing Floyd May weather
at Ping-Pong. That's ridiculous.

199
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,820
You're only supposed to do that if the game's over.

200
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,321
If the game's over. I'm just being happy, you know?

201
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,699
No, no, you're not being happy. This is a taunting.

202
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,242
This is, like, taunting that's going on. I'm sorry.

203
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,743
You're not sorry, that's the problem.

204
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,828
I know. You're right.

205
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,954
Okay, here's what we need to do now.

206
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,539
'Cause I think you're very spirited, and I like that.

207
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,625
I think we should turn it into
full-body-contact Ping-Pong.

208
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,793
Yes, we do!

209
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,254
Come on, you can't taunt people bigger than you

210
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,172
and expect it just to be all fine.

211
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,382
Help!

212
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,219
You're attacked. Yes! That's it.

213
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,388
Are you gonna try and steal a kiss now?

214
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,140
Go on, I dare you.

215
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,734
I want to let you know, by the way,

216
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,820
that I'm completely committed to this relationship.

217
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,363
I'm just re-upping. I'm already committed,

218
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,615
but I'm just re-upping my commitment
to this relationship

219
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,783
because I feel great.

220
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,577
How do you feel? Do you feel great?

221
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,661
Uh-huh.

222
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,955
Yeah? Mmm-hmm. I feel great.

223
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,965
But is there a window?

224
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,842
Are you anxious for this to go somewhere?

225
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,094
Ronny, Ronny, I know you.

226
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,262
I know where you're headed with this.

227
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,724
Look, I don't need this to be something that it's not.

228
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,643
I don't want it to be something if
it's not, just to make me okay.

229
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,691
But is there a clock that's ticking?

230
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,319
Are you in a hurry to be heading somewhere?

231
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,739
There's always a clock. And I'm worrying, is it ticking,

232
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,491
getting to a point where the clock's gonna go off?

233
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,659
Let's just talk through this, okay? Yeah.

234
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,330
I have fun with you. I love being with you.

235
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,667
I think we've done a great job of getting
back to a really good place.

236
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,212
I'm happy.

237
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:57,549
Now, if all of that rolls into something else,

238
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,802
that can make me happy, too.

239
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,016
I love you.

240
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,360
Okay, Ronny. You can do this.

241
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,903
This is your time to do it.

242
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,738
You the man, Valentine. You're the man.

243
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,299
Folks, this is our
final approach to Detroit's Metro Airport.

244
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,895
Hope this goes well.

245
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,071
Great moments are born from great opportunity.

246
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,366
And that's what you have here today, Nick.

247
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,578
That's what you've earned here today!

248
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,997
One meeting. Okay, what are you doing?

249
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,290
You're giving me the... Really?

250
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,417
The Kurt Russell speech from the movie Miracle?

251
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,711
I just saw that five-year-old kid do
it on YouTube the other night,

252
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,129
and I thought it was really inspirational.

253
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,630
It's applicable to what we're doing.

254
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,175
Any time you go into a pressure situation,
a competition, it makes sense.

255
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,551
And I'm not gonna write something better than that.

256
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,761
Look at you, you're nervous.

257
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,056
You're never nervous. Now, you're nervous.

258
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,852
Okay, here's the thing. I can't be
broke if I'm gonna get married.

259
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,604
Yeah?

260
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,648
Yes! See, I knew you would get here!

261
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,150
Okay, so here's my plan.

262
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,569
I'm gonna ask her next month, on her birthday.

263
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,654
Now, I worked out this great
deal from this Hasidic guy,

264
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,156
who I met during Gamblers Anonymous.

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,493
He's literally gonna give me a $20,000 ring
for $10,000. Can you believe that?

266
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,619
How are you doing that?

267
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,661
Well, I'm gonna give him cash.

268
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,498
And then I also said that you would help fix his car.

269
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,501
So those two little things are gonna
get me the deal with the Hasidic.

270
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,336
Oh, I'm helping? I'm helping fix the car?

271
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,004
Well, you're the one who kept telling me to dive into it.

272
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,339
I thought you'd be excited to help. I'm sorry.

273
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,341
Okay, fine, but that is my gift to you.

274
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,468
Honestly, there'll be no fruit bowl from the registry.

275
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,594
That's it. That's what you're looking at.

276
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,720
You don't have to make a decision now.

277
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,013
On the day, see what's right...

278
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,474
No, I'm making... I can make the
decision now. I'm making it now.

279
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,017
I'm telling you right now, that is my gift.

280
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,645
That's it. I'm fixing the car with the Hasidic guy.

281
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,771
And make sure you tell Beth that, too.

282
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,731
Seriously, I don't want it to be
uncomfortable. Let her know.

283
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,066
Whatever you wanna do on that day is your choice.

284
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,901
Okay. I'm doing it.

285
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,614
You take this meeting 10 times,
you might not get it nine.

286
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,533
All right, you got to stop that now.

287
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,743
But not this meeting, Nick.

288
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,079
Not today.

289
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,580
You're really making me nervous.

290
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,625
Today, we are the greatest small business in the world.

291
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm sick and tired of hearing about how
innovative these other boutiques are.

292
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,674
This is our time. Their time is done!

293
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,384
We're showing up in a cab.

294
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,271
Thanks for not mentioning that my
last three prototype bids got rejected.

295
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,606
That's just a bad streak, pal.

296
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,067
You're gonna be great, I promise you.

297
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,288
Here you go.

298
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,749
Ladies and gentlemen, electric cars,

299
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,168
they're totally gay.

300
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,962
It's true.

301
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
I don't mean that they're "homosexual" gay,

302
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,510
but I do mean "your parents were the
chaperone at the dance" gay. Right?

303
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,345
"You tuck it in and wear it real high" gay.

304
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,681
I don't wanna disrespect anybody,
'cause I'm not about that.

305
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,099
But I think we're understanding

306
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,684
what we're trying to talk about here, right?

307
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,814
I mean, honestly, the Nissan Spit? Really?

308
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,691
It screams this.

309
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,529
Oh, here we go.

310
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,699
The Hyundai Pomegranate. Right?

311
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,329
The Chevy Fingerprint.

312
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,665
Now,

313
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,501
ah, look at this.

314
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:08,383
The 1966 Ford GT350.

315
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,054
You wanna roll up in that one, hoss?

316
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,392
The 1965 Pontiac GTO.

317
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,645
Completely awesome.

318
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,358
The 1970 Hemi Cuda

319
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,445
took more virginities than Francis Albert Sinatra.

320
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
What are we suggesting here?

321
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,159
We're talking about taking the benefits
of electric transportation,

322
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,496
but combine them with the rock and roll-ness

323
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,125
and the sexiness that the Dodge
current muscle-car models have.

324
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,795
Nicholas?

325
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,924
We believe we could produce the technology

326
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,511
to incorporate an electronic motor
in your current models.

327
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,723
But with the aggressive sound character,

328
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,768
the exhilarating vibration character,

329
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
the complete visceral experience

330
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,984
that we've all grown to know and love in
the Dodge Challenger and Charger lines.

331
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,113
Guys, we love our current electric models.

332
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,282
That said, we also agree there's a
market for what you're pitching.

333
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,787
But, if you're asking Dodge to invest
in your pursuit of this concept,

334
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,456
what do you have that we don't?

335
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,502
Nick Brannen.

336
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,425
So let's forget the up-front money.

337
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,136
Let's deal with it in success because that's
exactly what we're gonna have.

338
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,556
I want 900,000, you want 400,000.

339
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,892
We don't need to get a Chinese auction where
I go, "850." You go, "450," right?

340
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,060
"Eight." "Five."

341
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,605
Let's just cut it right down the middle
at 775, and close this thing.

342
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,445
I appreciate your spirit, Mr. Valentine.

343
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,613
But we're taking all the risk,

344
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,699
so we'll stick with the 400,000.

345
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,493
And I think you need to focus
on the bigger picture, here.

346
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,621
With success and a good working relationship,

347
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,584
we're prepared to offer you an overall
deal, which means up-front money

348
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,629
and an option for an exclusive long-term
contract with your company.

349
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,216
And with that deal, you gentlemen
won't be disappointed.

350
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,720
You made a great decision today, Tom.

351
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:18,972
Thank you. Thank you.

352
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,725
You'll be under the supervision of Susan Warner, here.

353
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,229
She's from the outside, but we've
had great experience with her.

354
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,859
You know, I was at Ford
until about five months ago.

355
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,195
They're still talking about you guys over there.

356
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,614
They said you could whittle down a supplier

357
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,408
to less than 15 cents on the dollar just by talking.

358
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,829
And you were like a mad scientist that
wouldn't leave the lab for days.

359
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,706
Well, boys,

360
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,542
it takes one to know one.

361
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,211
I'm one of you.

362
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,087
I'm a visionary, I'm a maverick,

363
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm a gun-slinger, just like you.

364
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,592
And this idea of yours, this vision...

365
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,846
I'm inspired by what y'all throwing down.

366
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,015
I got some serious lady wood here.

367
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,518
I want to have sex with your words.

368
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,228
I want to bang your brain!

369
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,401
Oh. I got to go. I'm late for Mommy
and Me. I'll call you.

370
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,945
Bye. Okay.

371
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,406
At least she's enthusiastic.

372
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,367
Ronny, I got to tell you,

373
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,786
I think I'm starting
to have a panic attack.

374
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,456
What if I can't deliver? I mean, we
sank every cent we have into this.

375
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,167
We're mortgaged to the hilt, we're
borrowing against borrowing.

376
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,460
Okay, listen, just relax.

377
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,421
I think you're taking this all in a little
too fast, just a little too soon.

378
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,589
Now, you said it yourself.

379
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,925
We're on the five-yard line, we just got to punch it in.

380
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,051
Twenty-five. What?

381
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,511
I said we were on the 25-yard line.

382
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,138
Nick, are you suggesting that we're
not even in the red zone?

383
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,432
Oh, man, what if I can't do it?

384
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,602
Everybody... Just think, Dodge is gonna
know, they're gonna laugh at us.

385
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,354
That guy, that security guard, he's just laughing.

386
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,522
Look at him, he's just staring... Hold on.

387
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,815
Look at the security guard, he's looking at me.

388
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,525
Okay, stop. Get it together. Stop looking at me.

389
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,193
Just take a breath for a second.

390
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,486
Don't lose perspective here.

391
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,446
You're only five yards from the red zone.

392
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,448
Now once we get in the red zone, we're a mortal lock.

393
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,533
You're a red-zone guy!

394
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,994
Still 25 yards out, do you understand that?

395
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,872
By the way, I don't care how you spin
it, how you want to ice the cake,

396
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,456
we're only 75% of the way there,

397
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,166
and I'm having trouble breathing now.

398
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,918
You need to relax!

399
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,381
Everything is going to be fine.

400
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,304
I never said we were in the red zone.

401
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,982
So, it's been 10 days since the meeting,

402
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,400
and he still hasn't calmed down.

403
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,235
I'm doing my best to keep his head in the game,

404
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,070
but he's still a little shaky.

405
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,323
All right, we are going with the opakapaka tonight.

406
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,033
Okay, but we need to educate the servers,

407
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,159
please. They know, chef.

408
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,577
They know. No, they don't know!

409
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,662
They're fish-illiterate.

410
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:48,997
What about you, Ronny?

411
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,458
Also fish-illiterate. I don't know fish.

412
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,752
I'm saying, how are you doing?

413
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,295
How are you coping with all of this?

414
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,796
I'm great, honey.

415
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,216
It's been 16 months and nine days since
I made a bet, I'm easy-breezy.

416
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,801
I'm not talking about gambling.

417
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,638
I'm just saying, if you're feeling stressed,

418
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,973
or if things start to feel heavy...

419
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,308
Yes, heavy.

420
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,102
...then you can come talk to me.

421
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,855
Honey, if I'm lucky enough to get
you alone for five minutes,

422
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,774
the last thing I'm going to do is talk.

423
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,233
Is that so? Mmm.

424
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,550
When did you say her birthday was?

425
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,677
Two weeks.

426
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,304
Oh, good, we'll have the new Pacific Calendulas in.

427
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,597
Oh, great. She'll love that.

428
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,683
Yes, we had a hybridizing program this winter.

429
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,393
This is awesome!

430
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,229
Wow. This is what I'm talking about.

431
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,648
See this, right here, this place here is beautiful.

432
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,900
And the music that you're playing,
that's really beautiful, too.

433
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,777
People say that music is the highest art form.

434
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,238
It can go the farthest, the fastest, emotionally.

435
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,657
And the smells here are really nice
as well. I love all the smells.

436
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,619
What I'm trying to do is get all five senses
really coming alive here, really cooking.

437
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,538
Mmm-hmm. Do you have a plug
in the garden somewhere?

438
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,999
Somewhere I can plug my iPod dock into.

439
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,875
Anywhere in here? Back here? Oh, see, wait, wait, no.

440
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,003
We don't like the guest touching the plants.

441
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,879
Why? I mean, if you talk to them, they grow.

442
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,923
They like a little affection. I wouldn't pull it out.

443
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,759
I just wanna make sure that you're taking
care of all the things on your end.

444
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,429
Because I'm going today. I'm going to have the ring.

445
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
So that'll be taken care of.

446
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,098
I trust you'll have a ring.

447
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,976
And I just want to make sure that
this is the greatest proposal

448
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,520
in the history of the world of all proposals.

449
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,604
All right? That's it.

450
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,899
Let me see if I can track down where that outlet is.

451
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,359
Okay. Get me in here for a team.

452
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,610
Let's go, "Proposal," on three.

453
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,446
Let's have fun with it. Ready? Okay.

454
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,781
One, two, three... Proposal! Proposal!

455
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,075
My man! Get out of here, baby!

456
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,119
Make it good.

457
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,954
I'm counting on you.

458
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,791
Beth, come here.

459
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,587
Beth...

460
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,635
Come on.

461
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,217
Can we go already? I'm tired of looking at plants.

462
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,321
Damn it!

463
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,494
Mr. Valentine?

464
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,094
Son of a bitch.

465
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,766
Don't do it, Geneva. Jesus.

466
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,566
Oh, God.

467
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,000
What are you doing?

468
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,092
Ah! Those plants are poisonous!

469
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,928
Awesome.

470
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,848
You can expect diarrhea,

471
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,643
challenging urination with possible bloody discharge,

472
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,189
fever, dry-heaving,

473
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,483
painful swelling of the gums and
a loss of feeling in the tongue,

474
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,279
which will affect speech and give you very bad dreams.

475
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,742
You are banned from these gardens indefinitely.

476
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,037
So you can forget about
popping the question here!

477
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,331
"Proposal on three."

478
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,583
We are not teammates.

479
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,376
As far as damages,

480
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,046
it's going to run into the thousands.

481
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,549
I just saw my best friend's wife with another man.

482
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,968
I'll send you a check.

483
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,846
It's very red.

484
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,101
Looks really angry.

485
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,482
I didn't think you were allergic
to anything. Neither did I.

486
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,151
Huh. What kind of plants were they?

487
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,946
Street plants.

488
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,031
Street plants?

489
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,076
Yeah. It must've happened when
I was walking on Clark,

490
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,120
because I had to go... These kids lost their ball,

491
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,289
and I had to go in the bushes and get their ball.

492
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,583
Why couldn't they get their own ball?

493
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,169
Well, you know how these kids are
today, they're so damn lazy.

494
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:32,048
I mean, with all the gaming, and
texting, and Happy Meals.

495
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,550
I mean, childhood obesity is completely out of control.

496
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,052
You know that, Beth.

497
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,348
And these kids were just overly huffing
and puffing, and they were sweating.

498
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,601
All right. Well, I don't see why that means
they can't go get their own ball.

499
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,853
Well, to their credit, these little porkers were trying,

500
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,981
but they couldn't reach the ball.

501
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,691
This little alligator-armed kid was in there doing it,

502
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,317
but the little kid, he can't get the ball.

503
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,528
So then I come walking up,

504
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,155
and they say, "Hey, can you
help me with the ball here?"

505
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,782
So I say, "Okay, I'm running late,"

506
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,910
but these kids want to play ball, and
frankly, I'm a supporter of it.

507
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,829
Now that we're all gonna be on the
same damn healthcare, too.

508
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,163
I'm paying for these fat kids.

509
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,581
Boom! I drop to the ground.

510
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,083
So now, I'm reaching in here like this

511
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,376
trying to get the ball, see?

512
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,420
But I don't want this branch to hit me here.

513
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,463
Right. I'm doing it. You see what I mean, honey?

514
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,675
And I got to dig in more, under the
branch, but hold the branch.

515
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,260
But then my right hand's going here.

516
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,178
See, that's why I got this bitch right here.

517
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,264
Oh. That's a direct contact.

518
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,682
And I get the ball. Now I get it.

519
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,600
I got the ball out, "Okay, here."

520
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,394
Gave the ball back to the kids,

521
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,354
then I started to head home. Right?

522
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,857
And then that's when I noticed
that my arm was really itching

523
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:34,444
and I thought that it was because
I rubbed up against the brush.

524
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,573
Why are you carrying so much cash, Ronny?

525
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,117
Well, I was on my way to the suppliers,

526
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,578
before I helped the fat kids with the ball.

527
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,123
But, boy, thank goodness
it fell out here. That's great.

528
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,001
Because, could you imagine if it
would've fallen out there? Wow.

529
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,628
Yeah, that's a lot of cash.

530
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,505
Well, you know my suppliers deal in cash.

531
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,632
But do you mind if I don't dial
into all the details right now?

532
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:57,717
I'm just starting to really itch,

533
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,262
so I'd rather just go and take care of this real quick.

534
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,184
How was your day?

535
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,643
It was okay.

536
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,068
God! Damn it!

537
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,694
Are you all right?

538
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,447
No, honey, to be honest, I'm feeling
a little challenged here.

539
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,157
Oh!

540
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,450
Oh, God!

541
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,078
Ow!

542
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,245
God!

543
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,312
Heat it up. Is the sub-amp active?

544
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,564
Bring it up.

545
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,983
Yeah!

546
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,486
All right, you guys will process the data?

547
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,196
You got it. All right, let's do this!

548
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,831
Nick, I need to talk to you for a second.

549
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,834
Hey. Did you go to Burnham Bank
and sign the loan forms yet?

550
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,544
Not yet, but I wanted to... You need to go.

551
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,422
I signed them two days ago. You need to sign them.

552
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,259
And that woman, Susan from
Chrysler, she keeps calling.

553
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,927
She keeps calling me "bro."

554
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,138
How am I going to concentrate
with her calling all the time?

555
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,639
I thought you were going to run interference on that.

556
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,932
I will.

557
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,518
Ulcer acting up again?

558
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,565
No, no, no, you know what? This prescribed
medical shit right here,

559
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,109
chalky shit, it's actually very thirst-quenching.

560
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,153
I can't get enough of it, I really can't. Thank you.

561
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,655
Just give me a second here, would
you? All right, boys, let's do it.

562
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,615
Come on, let's awaken the beast here. Come on!

563
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,743
We've got a solid reference measurement
this time. Looks good.

564
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,162
The last one was pathetic, you know?

565
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,289
If I can talk to you for one second...
Hey, am I working here?

566
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,874
Am I not working here? Do I look like I'm working?

567
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,334
David, jump in there. Fire it up, come on!

568
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,794
All right.

569
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,009
All right, bring it. Bring it up.

570
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,595
Come on!

571
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:07,889
Stay on it.

572
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,557
There you go.

573
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,935
Finally! Okay, finally, I'm seeing fractional orders here.

574
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,562
This might be it.

575
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,732
All right!

576
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,693
Fourth order, pulling ahead...

577
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,570
Come on, pump that sub right.

578
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,238
Yes!

579
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:25,656
It's happening!

580
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,618
Yes! Yes! Yes!

581
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,162
Whoo-hoo!

582
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,372
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

583
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,416
The fractional orders are deviating.

584
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,376
No, no. No, they're not. Come on,
now.

585
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,128
What have we got? What have we got?

586
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,755
Where we at?

587
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,633
No, no!

588
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,926
Damn it!

589
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,887
We lost the fourth completely.

590
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,182
Maybe a heavier amp, bigger subs.

591
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,475
The second and third were solid until...

592
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,101
Hey, I get it. I suck, okay?

593
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,103
I suck.

594
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,947
Nick... What is it, Ron? What do you want?

595
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,285
I want to talk to you about something
that's kind of personal.

596
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,204
Something that doesn't have to do with any of this.

597
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,249
Do you mind just stepping up with
me in the office real quick?

598
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,417
You want to go to the office, talk
about something personal

599
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,461
that doesn't have to do with this?

600
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,587
Yeah.

601
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,381
You know, I'm bleeding inside.

602
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,842
There's blood where it shouldn't be in
my body, out of things.

603
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,554
I've thrown up four times in the last two days,

604
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,806
which doesn't make any sense, because
I haven't eaten in three.

605
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,391
So I don't even know where it's coming from!

606
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,600
Hey, listen, I understand what you're saying...

607
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,436
You're not in the pressure cooker, man! You're not!

608
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,730
When I said I was on the 25-yard line, I'm not.

609
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,108
I'm much further back than that.

610
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,069
We are deep in our own end zone.
Right back there, yeah.

611
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,487
And I'm flushed out of the pocket,

612
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,738
and the defense is coming for me,

613
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,408
and they're big, man! They're fast!

614
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,995
Ah! They're coming! And I turn
to you, my lead blocker.

615
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,454
You turn to me, "Hey.

616
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:00,126
"You want to go upstairs and talk in the
office about something personal?"

617
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,335
Just block!

618
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,505
That's what I need you to do, is just block!

619
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,217
And do me a favor, would you
sign the damn loan forms?

620
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,469
So I have somebody to fund my failure?

621
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,640
Unless you just want to kiss that
long-term contract goodbye.

622
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,986
Unbelievable, huh?

623
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,071
The Bulls? I know, it's ridiculous.

624
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,740
I mean, Rose should've passed to Noah.

625
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,783
He was wide open, completely unguarded.

626
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,036
I know, man, they just can't get it together at all.

627
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,997
Yeah. I mean, if you ask me, Rose doesn't trust Noah.

628
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,666
They're teammates. He doesn't trust
he can hit the winning shot.

629
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,126
Sucks, man.

630
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,047
Yeah, because trust really runs deep on a team.

631
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,257
You got to be able to trust your teammate.

632
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,469
Do you think that you have to be able to trust
your teammate off the court as well?

633
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,721
Uh... Sure. Let's just say,

634
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,681
and I'm talking completely hypothetically here,

635
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,143
let's say that Noah finds out that
Derek Rose's girl is cheating.

636
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,269
Does he tell him or not?

637
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,937
Because he doesn't want to affect his performance.

638
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,649
Yeah. I mean, he's... No, no.

639
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,733
Yeah, you tell him. No.

640
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,152
It's toxic to keep all that in. You have to tell him.

641
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,363
That's Guy Code. You're talking about your best friend.

642
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,990
You ever hear the expression, "Kill
the messenger"? 'Cause, I mean...

643
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,659
Yeah, but I don't think it applies here at all.

644
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,328
I mean, if you don't tell your friend, your best friend,

645
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,996
then you're basically banging her, too.

646
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,375
Okay, come on, now. It depends. Is it the playoffs?

647
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,752
Game seven, the championship.

648
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,337
Championship.

649
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,505
No, then I wouldn't tell him.

650
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,798
Yeah, no way. No.

651
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,884
Don't tell him. Nope. You wait. You wait.

652
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,261
Hey, sis. Just checking in.

653
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,597
Ronny, you never call to just "check in."

654
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,433
You know what happened? I saw
this episode of Springer,

655
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,395
and I just can't shake what happened on the episode.

656
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,815
This woman found out that her best friend's
husband was cheating on her,

657
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,483
and she did not tell her friend.

658
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,110
Ronny, why are you telling me this?

659
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,528
Bowling.

660
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,238
I just want to get your take on it. What do you think?

661
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,156
Do you think she should have told her best friend

662
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,324
that her husband was cheating?

663
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,034
Of course she should.

664
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,744
But what about the whole "kill the messenger" thing?

665
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,038
You know what I mean? Ronny,
she is doing her friend a favor.

666
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,916
It doesn't matter how painful the moment...

667
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,669
Mom, come on! Okay, Ronny, I got to go, I'm sorry.

668
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,962
Okay. Bye-bye.

669
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,638
Hello?

670
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,348
Nice disguise, Ronny.

671
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,226
Making it a woman on Jerry Springer? Bullshit!

672
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,853
I am not an idiot.

673
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:24,979
What?

674
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,481
You want to tell me Saul's cheating on me? Just say it!

675
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,733
Diane, listen. I don't think you understand

676
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,151
what I'm saying. I'm not saying anything about Saul.

677
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,153
I'm gonna kill him! You don't need to kill anybody.

678
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,407
I really thought I was done with choosing
men who were basically Dad.

679
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:40,077
I mean, who would even sleep
with that out-of-work slob?

680
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,663
Okay, Diane, listen to me, you're way overreacting.

681
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,624
How dare you tell me something
like this over the phone?

682
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,668
How dare you tell me this at all?

683
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,880
And screw you, Ronny!

684
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,632
You have always been a selfish little asshole.

685
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,551
What? Why am I an asshole?

686
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,094
F- you, Ronny!

687
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,556
Ah, geez.

688
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,272
All right, now, that's a little
better. Where's the cross-over?

689
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,525
Yeah, this is nice. This is nice.

690
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,402
Hey, Ronny. What's up?

691
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,987
Ronny.

692
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,072
Can I talk to you for a second?

693
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,035
I was actually gonna run up here
for about the rest of the day.

694
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,871
Just one second, please. It's important.

695
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,502
One second.

696
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,213
Come on.

697
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,222
Look.

698
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,183
I am so sorry.

699
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,393
I've been thinking too much about myself lately,

700
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,772
and I'm throwing tantrums because
a car is not loud enough.

701
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,819
So I have eight minutes.

702
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,155
Eight minutes? Yeah.

703
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,449
Yeah, I have a call at 5:00, with
Helmut Farber in Berlin.

704
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,326
He's going to give me some pointers
on throttle response.

705
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,996
So I have eight uninterrupted minutes

706
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,835
to talk about whatever it is you wanted to talk about.

707
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,089
Right.

708
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,177
Ronny, you have

709
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,223
seven minutes and 48 seconds to just chat.

710
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,725
Open up.

711
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,694
What I wanted to talk to you about...

712
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,238
Yes, Ronny?

713
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,910
...was proposing to Beth.

714
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,998
You didn't propose yet?

715
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,708
Why not?

716
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,919
Well, I wasn't sure that I found the
right exact place to do that.

717
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,462
Oh, come on. Ronny, come on, man.

718
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,631
You're just sabotaging yourself,
that's what you're doing here.

719
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,675
Don't you understand, once you
get into it, it's gonna be fine?

720
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,427
I'm telling you, you found the right...

721
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,928
What the hell is that on your arm?

722
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,555
What is going on?

723
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,058
I had an outbreak.

724
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,560
I broke out in hives everywhere.

725
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,480
And when I piss, it kind of burns, too.

726
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,608
Ronny, Nick, your better halves are here.

727
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,360
Wow, now that is a sexy car.

728
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,242
Whoo! If only it were fuel-efficient.

729
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,327
Hey, sweetheart.

730
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,786
- Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
- Hey, sweetie.

731
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,079
Nice surprise.

732
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,539
I have a special night planned for you guys.

733
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:31,749
Hi, Nick. Hi, sweetie.

734
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,833
Yeah,

735
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,670
but I don't have time for a night,
honey. We're way behind.

736
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,757
Well, you're behind because you
guys are burning yourselves out.

737
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,135
You got to recharge the engine, get some perspective.

738
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,138
I don't think we have the time for perspective.

739
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,515
I don't know that tonight's a good
night for us to go do anything.

740
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,059
I know you don't want to celebrate,

741
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,435
because you guys haven't gotten a line yet.

742
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,770
So it's not a celebration.

743
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,521
We're just thinking maybe we could take a breather

744
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:58,609
to set the table for a possible potential celebration

745
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,818
sometime in the future. Yeah.

746
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,738
And, listen, I called here to talk to
you earlier, and I talked to Felix,

747
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,532
and he said things were getting pretty heated today.

748
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,868
I think you guys need a break, you know?

749
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,121
This is not a discussion. We are doing this.

750
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,000
And you, my friend, are going
to thank me for this later.

751
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,753
What happened to your face?

752
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,297
That was his second attempt.

753
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,925
Now, here is his third and final attempt

754
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,927
to win the round-trip airline tickets

755
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,136
anywhere in the United States.

756
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,304
You don't give yourself a nickname.

757
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,103
Good
try by our second contestant.

758
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,270
Come on.

759
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,606
I've been trying to take that shot
for 10 years, they don't pick me.

760
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,899
They never pick me. I don't know what I got to do.

761
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,317
Our third and final contestant,

762
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,653
Jessica Hill from Park Ridge, Illinois.

763
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,280
Tell you one thing, if they did pick
me, I'm sticking it in the net.

764
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,324
That's a no-brainer, right there.

765
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:54,289
You know I was third in scoring at Ball State? Third.

766
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,166
They didn't cut anybody. It was a club team.

767
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,002
Good first attempt for Jessica.

768
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,294
Why you got to take away my accomplishments?

769
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,838
I'm not. No, you are, okay?

770
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,173
I'm a shooter, it's what I am.
Just deal with it, all right?

771
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,509
"Sniper." They called me "The Sniper."

772
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,303
I'm just saying, it's not that easy
to put in from center ice

773
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,180
into that big of a hole. It's not easy.

774
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,224
That's why a few of us can do it. I'm saying I can do it.

775
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,600
You know what... Have you ever done it?

776
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,187
No. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, though.

777
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,856
I'd put it in, believe me.

778
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,108
That was a wide to the right...

779
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,276
It's not a net.

780
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,445
It's a hole that's this big. It doesn't... Yeah, it's a big...

781
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,529
They know what they're doing.

782
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,198
They do statistics to make sure that
a certain amount of people miss it.

783
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,159
I mean, I don't know how
much you've dealt with athletes.

784
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,702
I can see things differently.

785
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,203
Everything just comes to a blur.

786
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,748
It's like you're locked in maple
syrup, and you're moving slow

787
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,667
and you see things happening before they do happen.

788
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,049
You guys, I'm gonna go get some
beer. Do you want anything?

789
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,468
No, no, babe. I'm good, thanks.

790
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,180
Blackhawks
penalty caller number 81...

791
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,559
I'm gonna go help her with the
beers. I'm gonna get one.

792
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,227
You guys want anything? I'm good, thanks.

793
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,979
Pretzels, all right? All right. Yeah, pretzels.

794
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,990
Boy, you've been on that all night.

795
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,075
Hey.

796
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,244
I saw you yesterday.

797
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,038
You saw me where?

798
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,831
At the Botanical Gardens.

799
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,667
So?

800
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,254
I saw it all, Geneva.

801
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,840
The loser with the Dead Milkmen T-shirt.

802
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,592
Kissing him in broad daylight.

803
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,260
Okay, Ronny, I got it.

804
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,013
You got a great guy who's considerate to people,

805
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,225
and who cares about you, and
you're out running on him.

806
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,935
Don't put this all on me.

807
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,063
How dare you ambush me with
what you think you know?

808
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,607
What I think I know? I saw you
mauling the guy, Geneva.

809
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,235
Ronny, you don't know shit. You don't know shit.

810
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,404
You do not know what goes on behind
the curtains of a marriage.

811
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,533
Like the fact that he hasn't slept
with me for over six months.

812
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,326
Don't stand there and start talking nonsense to me.

813
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,786
No, you know what? Are you serious?

814
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,831
How about the fact that every
Thursday night after work,

815
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,958
Nick goes to Pilsen, to a massage parlor,

816
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,503
where he gets wanked by a
19-year-old Vietnamese girl

817
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,756
who speaks four words of English! How about that?

818
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,800
I don't believe a word you're
saying right now.

819
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,218
Yeah, you're just covering your ass.

820
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,141
Listen to me.

821
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,600
Nick is my very best friend

822
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,977
in the entire world. I know.

823
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,855
And I am never, ever, ever going
to keep this from him.

824
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,274
Do you understand? So I'm coming to you now,

825
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,025
and I'm giving you an opportunity,

826
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,277
but you need to deal with this.

827
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,070
But it only happened because my husband

828
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,156
wasn't intimate with me! I'm not a marriage counselor.

829
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,241
I don't want to be a marriage counselor!

830
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,994
Let's make it really, really simple then.

831
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,454
Either you tell him, or I will.

832
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,750
I can't.

833
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,421
I will.

834
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,173
No, no. Ronny, no! Yes.

835
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,009
No, Ronny. No. Don't do this now.

836
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,927
Not while this Chrysler thing is going on.

837
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,847
Listen, Nick is not sleeping at night.

838
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,932
His stomach is literally bleeding.

839
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,851
This would destroy him.

840
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,311
You're not going to see this guy anymore?

841
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,773
No! God, no! That was stupid. I know that was stupid.

842
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,109
And it's over. It's over because it never was.

843
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,736
Then why have you been texting him all night?

844
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,739
Have I? Yeah, you have.

845
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,657
Sitting on the BlackBerry,

846
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,492
banging people.

847
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,666
Your sister just bought a new dress.

848
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,254
Just like I was saying, Ronny, you don't know shit.

849
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,505
Are you promising me

850
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:31,924
that as soon as this bit is over... Yes!

851
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,383
...you're gonna tell him, and you're gonna tell him

852
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,468
about this guy that you kissed?

853
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,594
Are you promising me that?

854
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,971
I absolutely swear to God, yes.

855
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,882
I'm so disappointed in you, Ronny.

856
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,302
Okay.

857
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,274
Just pick a date

858
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,651
and ask Beth to marry you.

859
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,028
You're making this thing out to be
much more than it needs to be.

860
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,407
And now your stress is causing me stress.

861
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,034
That's right, I'm stressing out like crazy. Yeah.

862
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,953
You're right. You're totally right.

863
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,206
Now that you verbalize it, and I hear
it, you're completely right, man.

864
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,666
Thank you.

865
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,919
Now I'm a guy causing extra damn stress.

866
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,010
You ever get a massage?

867
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,053
Hmm?

868
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:04,016
In times like this, when it gets very
stressful, do you get a massage?

869
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,811
Have I had a massage? I mean,
no, not really. Really, no.

870
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,980
You can only do so much yourself.

871
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,398
You can do things yourself,

872
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,819
but when you get a professional
to get that, take it out of you

873
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,531
and get that stress right out
of you, throw it out of you.

874
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,867
Hey, Nick, you know what could be tremendous?

875
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,745
Maybe me and you could go and
get a massage together.

876
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,998
I don't mean in the same room or something.
I mean at the same place.

877
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,291
Do you know a place we could do that?

878
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,751
Where we could get a massage?

879
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,378
A place that could take us to relax, relax, relax.

880
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,881
Here's what I'm trying to say to you, okay?

881
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,592
Don't let fear sabotage letting yourself be happy.

882
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,094
You guys are great together. You're in love.

883
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:45,265
And love can be very rewarding
and it can be very filling.

884
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,892
Very filling.

885
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,811
Like a warm stew. It honestly is.

886
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,856
Look, if you want ice cream,

887
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,234
go in the car and get ice cream.

888
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,527
You don't worry that, "While I'm driving,

889
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,112
"hey, I might have some chest pains,"

890
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,156
and then, "Turns out, heart attack.
I'm having a heart attack!"

891
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,034
You veer off, you kill a bunch of seniors and toddlers.

892
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,161
You get your ice cream.

893
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,414
And you know what? 99% of the time, you're
gonna end up at the ice cream shop

894
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,125
with a big hot fudge sundae. Nuts!

895
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,799
Only one percent of the time do you kill the innocent.

896
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,760
It's pretty good odds.

897
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm not understanding what you're trying to say to me.

898
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,765
All right, Ronny.

899
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,770
Tomorrow night is Beth's parents' anniversary party.

900
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,896
Forty years.

901
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,108
I really think you can learn something from it.

902
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,442
I want you to soak it in.

903
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,867
Oh, and, by the way, we did
just move into the red zone.

904
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,010
Hey, Felix, the algorithm is solid,

905
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,637
so it's got to be the hardware, right?

906
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,180
Yeah, looks like it.

907
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,473
Yeah, well, keep at it.

908
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,600
Okay. I got it, I'm on it.

909
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,190
Do you want to kiss Felix? Come in.

910
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,776
Come here. Don't be shy, baby.

911
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,863
You can join us. Yeah.

912
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,574
Good night, guys.

913
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,141
I'm sorry, I don't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

914
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,185
I'm not a pervert or anything, I'm sorry.

915
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,228
That's too bad.

916
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,855
I'm sorry?

917
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,982
I said, that's too bad.

918
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,695
Right.

919
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,802
Hey, I just wanted to call

920
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:31,181
and say thanks for your support
today. I really appreciate it.

921
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,599
No problem.

922
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,686
So, what are you doing?

923
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,272
I'm just at home.

924
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,524
Home?

925
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,025
Yes, I'm at home.

926
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,237
Yeah? You want to get a beer?

927
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,616
You know what? I can't. Mad Men
marathon with Geneva tonight.

928
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,036
You're right, I really... I got to shut
down the engine sometimes.

929
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
Why you looking in?

930
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,957
No peep Tom. Yes.

931
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,251
You come in or you go! I'm going to go.

932
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,211
Go. No, I have things.

933
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,004
You go. And you go, too.

934
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,839
Who was that? It's a traffic cop.

935
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,675
They've shut down North Avenue.

936
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,301
They're shutting stuff down, there's too many people.

937
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,387
Hold on, this guy is a prick. I'm not even driving!

938
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,430
I'm walking around here, I'm a citizen!

939
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,807
Mr. Mountain High!

940
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,100
Hold on. Hey.

941
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,810
We make you so happy!

942
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,854
When you leave here, you will smile like boy

943
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,941
who just got off braces, big and proud!

944
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:27,070
Boon-me is back in country, and looks
very forward to seeing you.

945
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,613
Yeah, look, I got to go.

946
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,073
What was that?

947
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,200
Nothing, there's a war film on before Mad Men.

948
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:33,702
Listen, I'm going to go. I'll call you.

949
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,953
Buddy, just so you know,

950
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,205
if you ever want to talk about anything, just like...

951
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,415
There's nothing we can't talk about.

952
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,499
Yeah, we can always talk.

953
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,751
I thought tonight could be good, 'cause
maybe we could get a drink.

954
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,670
All right, I got to run. Boon-me is waiting.

955
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,225
I just... I wanted to call and let you know

956
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,228
that I've been thinking about what you were saying

957
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,105
with the curtain and all that stuff.

958
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,066
And I just want to make sure that
I'm being fair to you during this,

959
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,653
and that I do realize that there's probably
two sides to every story.

960
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,572
Oh, Jesus Christ!

961
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,033
Ronny, you followed him to the massage parlor?

962
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,036
Well, no, I just wanted
to call and let you know

963
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,163
that I'm sure that not everything
that you're saying is bullshit.

964
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,165
And that if there is complicated things

965
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,376
that are going on, I really hope you guys work on it.

966
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,672
And just so you know, I really don't
want to be in this, Geneva.

967
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:28,798
I know.

968
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,967
It's your shot, come on!

969
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,136
Wait, who was that? Where are you?

970
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,804
I'm at home.

971
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,307
Except it's your shot, Geneva,

972
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,559
and you don't own a fucking pool table!

973
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:40,935
Ronny, I got to go.

974
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,064
What happened to, "I'm not gonna see this
guy anymore until after I talk to Nick"?

975
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,315
Good night, Ronny.

976
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,567
Yeah, good night, princess. Just
make sure you're ready

977
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,778
to talk to your husband when
you go home tonight, honey.

978
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,738
Because I'm definitely going to talk to him!

979
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,823
Okay, just take a breath.

980
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:58,370
Besides, I have something you might want
to hear before you go and do that.

981
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,016
What is it?

982
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,476
I ordered you some coffee.

983
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,019
I don't need your goddamn coffee, Geneva,

984
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,729
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

985
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,023
I'm gonna go see Nick tonight,

986
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,860
and I'm going to tell him that
his wife is sick and twisted,

987
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,530
and that she's a liar.

988
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,950
And I'm going to tell him that he's
married to goddamn Helen Keller.

989
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,453
Helen Keller? Yeah.

990
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:41,913
The girl with all the personalities.

991
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,081
Sybil.

992
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,708
Yeah, Sybil.

993
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,419
Who are you today, Blanche?
How deep do the waters run?

994
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,588
You're a five-year-old on a playground, Ronald.

995
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,133
It's not like I want to go and see Zip.

996
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:57,303
But when my husband calls me to explain
he has another late meeting,

997
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,139
it kind of just flies out the window.

998
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,808
"Zip"? That's the guy's name, Zip?

999
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,562
The point is, Ronny, I don't want any of this.

1000
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,855
I love my husband.

1001
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,356
You got a real funny way of showing that.

1002
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,733
Stay out of my life.

1003
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,401
You're not a therapist.

1004
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,653
In fact, you need one, desperately.

1005
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,574
Look in the mirror. You're 40 years
old, you've never been married.

1006
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,534
Go fix yourself and then you can call me.

1007
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,618
I don't need to call you, I don't need

1008
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,745
to say anything to you anymore.

1009
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,831
All I need to do is get out of here and
go tell Nick that his wife is cheating.

1010
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,417
And I guess, because you weren't able to do

1011
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,086
the things that you really said you needed to do

1012
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,922
that that's just the way it's going
to have to go down, honey.

1013
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,092
You know what? I see it going down
just a little bit differently.

1014
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,677
Really? Yeah.

1015
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,388
Because I'm going to deny it.

1016
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,599
And then I'm going to say you made a pass at me.

1017
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,517
I made a pass at you? Yep.

1018
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,521
And considering our little secret,

1019
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,356
I'm pretty sure he'll believe me.

1020
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,859
Geneva, okay...

1021
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,697
We both decided not to say anything

1022
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,075
because you liked him, and we didn't
want to ruin something good

1023
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,577
over a drunken college night

1024
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,872
that happened three months before
you two ever started dating.

1025
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,333
But, Ronny, he doesn't know that.

1026
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,835
It didn't mean anything, Geneva.

1027
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,172
Yeah? Well, it means something now, doesn't it?

1028
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,802
See, you need to understand how
this is going to play out, Ronny.

1029
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,222
I'm going tell him how we slept
together all those years ago,

1030
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,517
and then I'm going to say that you
started making passes at me.

1031
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,561
And that they never stopped.

1032
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,481
You do that.

1033
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,568
You sell him that I've been hitting
on you for 20 years straight.

1034
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,743
I should've told you, Nick, I should've told you sooner.

1035
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,998
But Ronny insisted that we not say anything.

1036
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,418
But as the years went on, it got harder and harder

1037
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,422
and I just lied to myself and said it didn't matter.

1038
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:03,179
But I'm telling you this now because
Ronny has gone crazy!

1039
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,141
He's been throwing me up against restaurant walls

1040
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,018
right when you're right around the corner.

1041
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,021
It's like he wants you to see, he wants to get caught

1042
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,108
because he feels so guilty.

1043
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,861
But I don't feel safe anymore, Nick!

1044
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,279
Okay.

1045
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,948
And this had to come out.

1046
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,790
Then what are you going to do, Ronny?

1047
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,792
Mr. Moral Guy.

1048
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,880
Are you going to look your best friend
in the eyes, and lie to him

1049
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:41,009
and say, "No, that never happened.
I never slept with her"?

1050
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,261
I don't think so.

1051
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:49,934
Stay out of my marriage.

1052
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,146
Now if you'll excuse me.

1053
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,149
Good night, Sybil.

1054
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,966
I don't even know if you're there, God.

1055
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,594
I haven't really tried to ring you up

1056
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,680
ever since I asked for those parlays
when things were tough.

1057
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,475
And I know you didn't help me
with those for my own good

1058
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,853
because I had stuff I had to learn, but...

1059
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,780
I don't want to learn any lessons on this one.

1060
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,285
I really don't want to lose my best friend.

1061
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,663
I know I'm supposed to give you things,

1062
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:54,624
but I'm scared to give you this.

1063
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,048
If you are listening,

1064
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,551
and if you want to help us with
the whole Chrysler thing,

1065
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,804
that would be really great, too.

1066
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,598
If that could go our way, that would be really great.

1067
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,393
If you're listening, that's it.

1068
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,542
Hello.

1069
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
Can I speak to Beth Dalton?

1070
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,629
She's not here right now. May I take a message?

1071
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,756
Thanks, but no.

1072
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,217
Hello?

1073
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,770
Good morning.

1074
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,231
You've reached the Kearny Group.
How may I help you?

1075
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,192
The Nikon D5000.

1076
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,735
Ten-million effective pixels,

1077
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,737
2.7 pixel density.

1078
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,740
Does it work from far away?

1079
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,451
Definitely. Are you gonna be shooting birds?

1080
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,828
Yes. What kind?

1081
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,664
Unfaithful ones.

1082
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,044
Hello?

1083
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,088
Hey, it's me. I need to see you, it's important.

1084
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,714
Who is this?

1085
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,258
Susan Warner. The consultant for Dodge.

1086
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,260
Oh, yes, of course, Susan.

1087
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,847
I'm sorry, I thought we were in "it's
me" territory in our relationship.

1088
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,433
No, we are, we absolutely are. What's up?

1089
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:20,269
Get your ass to Marino Chrysler right now.

1090
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,105
I don't want to do this over the phone.

1091
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,773
There are powers at work here.

1092
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,942
But this is it, this is the end game.

1093
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:29,445
This is what it's about. It's about
your engine in that car.

1094
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,156
The sound of your engine in that car,

1095
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,951
the vibration of your engine in this car.

1096
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:39,122
Susan, I get it. Just tell me what exactly the hiccup is.

1097
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,748
Thomas loved your idea,

1098
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,751
but he doesn't want to only depend
on B & V to execute it.

1099
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:46,129
So he threw the bid to United Design.

1100
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,464
That's bullshit! He can't throw
our bid to United Design!

1101
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:49,841
That's our idea!

1102
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,134
Exactly.

1103
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,928
They're worried about Nick. "Can
he finish? Can he handle this?"

1104
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,472
That's nuts. That's crazy, 'cause Nick
Brannen will bring the thing home.

1105
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,765
He's next-level genius.

1106
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,809
Yeah! You preaching to the choir, here.

1107
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,435
That's why I'm telling you this.

1108
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,814
I'm on your side. I'm your Deep Throat.

1109
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,315
Well, I appreciate it.

1110
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,569
Did you ever see that movie?

1111
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,903
All the President's Men?

1112
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,155
No, Deep Throat.

1113
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,531
Uh-uh. Oh.

1114
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,741
It's pretty amazing.

1115
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,326
Okay, Susan, I'm sorry,

1116
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:21,330
but can you just tell me, when is United
Design supposed to present?

1117
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,832
In three days.

1118
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,835
Unbelievable.

1119
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,671
I didn't make the deadline,
but we have to hit it.

1120
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,631
Listen, Felix, just get Nick for me?

1121
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,009
Nick is sleeping in the '68 Charger.

1122
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,302
Do you want me to wake him?

1123
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:35,678
No, just tell him when he wakes up.

1124
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,971
Okay.

1125
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,557
I got that information that you wanted right here.

1126
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,477
The Kearny Group is a Las Vegas-based
private equity group

1127
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,189
that brings well-known restaurants to Vegas. Uh-huh.

1128
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:50,109
They did Rao's, II Mulino, and Le Cirque.

1129
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,778
All right, thanks, Felix. I got to run.

1130
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:49,580
Hello.

1131
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,624
Hey, Ronny, where are you?

1132
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,169
I'm doing all different kinds of things now,

1133
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,004
with all the nice people, thank you.

1134
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,009
All right, listen, I just got your message.

1135
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:04,595
Three days? I don't think I can do it.

1136
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,305
I thought we were on the 10-yard line,

1137
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,808
but I think the refs might be reviewing the call.

1138
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,018
You're going to have to make the plays now, Nick.

1139
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,939
Why do you sound like you're on medication?

1140
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,776
You're great at what you do. You're
a very sweet man. Okay.

1141
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,088
All right, man, you're up. Let's do it!

1142
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,881
All right, you better stick it, dude!

1143
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,344
Watch this, man!

1144
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,018
There they are. Happy anniversary, guys.

1145
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,353
Happy anniversary!

1146
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,856
Hey! There they are!

1147
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,190
Hiya, Dad! Hi, baby!

1148
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,651
It's so great to see you.

1149
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,820
How was the trip, okay? Wonderful, terrific.

1150
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,904
Hey, Mom!

1151
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,489
You look ravishing!

1152
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:07,158
Where's Ronny?

1153
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,284
Um...

1154
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,619
He'll be here in a minute. Just a little tied up at work.

1155
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:11,745
Okay, good.

1156
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,714
Hey, what did I say? Come on, get out of here.

1157
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,466
Nah, I'm not gonna be nice anymore.

1158
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,218
You're bringing down my property
value. You need to go.

1159
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,095
I told you twice already.

1160
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,681
I don't want to see you in front of my place.

1161
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,224
Whatever, man.

1162
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,893
Get out of here.

1163
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,780
Hi, Sepia, on Jefferson.

1164
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,681
Did you get a good show? Where are you going?

1165
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,141
Where are you going?

1166
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,435
You're not going anywhere!

1167
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,357
You broke into the wrong house, boy.

1168
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,610
You came to party? You're going
to get something now!

1169
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,445
Get away from me, you son of a bitch!

1170
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,532
You want to party? Come on, I got
all the party you want, baby!

1171
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:31,867
I just took an OxyContin 20 minutes ago.

1172
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,536
I won't feel a thing. Come on.

1173
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,828
Let's get jacked up!

1174
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,080
Come on!

1175
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,207
Yeah, let's get jacked up, daddy!

1176
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,125
Do you know how much that guitar cost?

1177
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,468
My fish!

1178
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,136
You son of a bitch!

1179
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,017
You think you're safe in there? Huh?

1180
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,645
We'll see how safe you are in there, boy!

1181
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,857
Oh, yeah!

1182
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,735
Yeah, that's right! You hear me?

1183
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,238
I'm going to chew my way right up your ass, boy!

1184
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,366
Yeah! You got nowhere to go!

1185
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,911
Oh, yeah!

1186
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,914
Hey!

1187
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:20,457
I'm going to burn that face!

1188
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:21,584
What are you doing?

1189
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:22,960
I'm going to burn your face, boy!

1190
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,420
What, are you crazy? Stop!

1191
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,256
Give me that stupid-looking face! What's wrong?

1192
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,675
I thought you were on Oxy? I'm going to burn it!

1193
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,219
You better run, you son of a bitch!

1194
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,024
Where are you at?

1195
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,735
Where are you at, crazy? Where are you at?

1196
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,570
Come on, show me!

1197
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,115
Oh, you better run, punk!

1198
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,492
You better goddamn run tonight!

1199
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:58,162
I know where you live, man!

1200
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,623
I want that to register.

1201
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,334
Put that in your tattooed mind!

1202
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,294
I know where you live!

1203
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,633
Because I'm going to come back here

1204
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,719
and I will burn that face, daddy!

1205
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,639
Oh, I can't wait for my chance.

1206
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:20,142
I can't wait till I get you, just lined up perfect

1207
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,311
and I get to burn that little face!

1208
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,896
Because I'm a problem!

1209
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:26,732
Now you deal with that!

1210
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,221
Whoa! Crazy's here, baby!

1211
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,556
This is a collector's item!

1212
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,559
What do you want to do? You're going to burn my face?

1213
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,229
You're going to burn my face? Yeah?

1214
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:06,397
No! No!

1215
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,190
Who are you?

1216
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,441
Oh, you're not going to tell me?

1217
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:12,361
Who are you?

1218
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,488
I'm her husband's best friend!

1219
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,906
You son of a bitch!

1220
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,077
Oh, shit. Yeah.

1221
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,538
All right, man. Why didn't you just say that?

1222
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:23,997
That's right, you son of a bitch,

1223
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,541
I'm her husband's best friend!

1224
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,543
Hold on a second, calm down. Okay, okay.

1225
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,002
You're going to use a little bat on me?

1226
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,879
You think that bat's going to help you with me?

1227
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,798
You could've just said... No, no, no!

1228
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,552
You're being childish. Just stop.

1229
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,512
Turn over! Just turn over.

1230
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,639
Hey! Hey! Stop.

1231
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,438
Stop, stop.

1232
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,605
Do it!

1233
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,566
Do it, you scumbag. Hit me in the head!

1234
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,776
You better end this today, because
I'm going to come back for you.

1235
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,445
You understand me? There's no coming back.

1236
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,196
No, I'm going to end this right now!

1237
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,782
My friend Nick is 10 times the man you'll ever be.

1238
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,827
You're not anything.

1239
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,704
You're garbage.

1240
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,250
Come on, I'm not... I didn't
even... That's...

1241
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,419
It takes two, and you know that!

1242
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,254
Yeah, it takes two.

1243
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,589
Not three, prick.

1244
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,928
What, are you sniveling? What?

1245
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,305
Are you crying?

1246
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,182
No.

1247
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,560
No, it's the Oxy, and it's making me...

1248
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,187
Come here! Get up! Come here!

1249
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,273
Get up. You get up right now. You get out of here!

1250
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,858
Get out of here!

1251
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,278
I'm not playing with you!

1252
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,366
I'm not playing.

1253
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,738
I can just take the sweater.

1254
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:20,906
Okay.

1255
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,262
Ronny, jeez! You look like hell!

1256
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,681
The sweater's good, though, right? Hey! Hi.

1257
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,975
Hey, I know I'm late. I'm hoping
I'm still fashionable.

1258
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,518
What happened to your face?

1259
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,395
Just a bar fight.

1260
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:55,107
Just a bar fight. Some bikers...

1261
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,151
Bar fight, Ronny? Really?

1262
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,653
Yeah.

1263
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,198
I was at the Zip Bar and Grill, actually.

1264
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,700
Real dirt bag joint.

1265
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,827
Do not go there. Take it off the GPS.

1266
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,370
Let's do this. Where's the fam?

1267
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,039
You know what? I got to talk to
you for a second. Come here.

1268
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,291
Should I see the family?

1269
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,877
Okay.

1270
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,044
What is all this?

1271
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,965
Come over here. Look, obviously,
something's going on with you.

1272
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,469
And I want you to know that if you
need me, for anything at all...

1273
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,180
Screw the project, screw the deadline.

1274
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,017
I'm there for you, all right?

1275
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:31,143
Ronny...

1276
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,062
Whoa! You look like shit. Thank you.

1277
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,189
Anyway, thank you.

1278
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:42,446
I pressed Saul and he totally caved,
admitted he was cheating.

1279
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:47,284
Now we're going to work on it, for the kids.

1280
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,536
It might be futile, but you got to at least try, right?

1281
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,914
And all those times he was saying,
"I'm going bowling."

1282
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,248
Yeah, he wasn't bowling.

1283
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,751
He wasn't even bowling at all.

1284
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,252
Ronny? What the...

1285
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:58,629
Ron?

1286
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,508
Get a good feel, buddy?

1287
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:04,635
Ronny!

1288
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,472
You remember my cousin James,

1289
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,974
and his boyfriend Juan?

1290
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,937
Let me finish.

1291
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:19,066
Because families like to touch and hang
out, and that's what we're doing.

1292
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,609
I'm just roughing it up with my guy!

1293
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,736
Come on, I had him! I had him, Juan!

1294
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,906
Nice to meet you, buddy! My
guy, good to see you, babe!

1295
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,824
And my parents.

1296
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,701
Ronald.

1297
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,913
Yeah, Burt and Sue.

1298
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,958
It's impressive, 40 years, it's quite an accomplishment.

1299
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,210
Is the flame still burning after 40?

1300
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,962
Still there.

1301
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,004
Of course it is, of course it is.

1302
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,506
With you, there's no question. My man.

1303
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,966
Let's go celebrate. Let's do this.

1304
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,134
I'm just playing the fun part, doing the things I do.

1305
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,095
Great to see you!

1306
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,430
Breath against breath,

1307
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,516
breathe me life.

1308
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:58,480
Thousand and thousand kisses, give me, I beg you.

1309
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:02,985
Love wants everything without condition.

1310
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,321
Love has no law.

1311
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,366
Mom and Dad,

1312
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,577
your love has no law.

1313
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,504
So beautiful.

1314
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,969
I'd like to make the toast.

1315
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,975
Forty years.

1316
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,813
That is a long time to be with
someone. Forty years, wow!

1317
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,608
It's impressive.

1318
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,446
I personally don't know a lot about marriage,

1319
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:51,700
but I would imagine it can't be easy,

1320
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,744
all those 40 years being with someone.

1321
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,872
Because people are not perfect.

1322
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,374
People make mistakes in life.

1323
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,376
But I would assume

1324
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:06,339
what would get you through those 40 years would be...

1325
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,508
...honesty.

1326
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,847
Honesty and honesty alone.

1327
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,141
And love.

1328
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,853
But even more than that, Burt, is the honesty.

1329
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,647
Don't forget about patience.

1330
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,734
Oh, no one's going to forget about patience, Sue.

1331
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,736
You can relax, patience is on the table.

1332
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,489
What I'm talking about,
though, is honesty here.

1333
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,533
Talking about two people

1334
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,245
who have probably had an eye
wander every now and then.

1335
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,748
Everyone knows Burt was in the garment business.

1336
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,792
If you don't think you meet a
lot of girls in that business,

1337
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,460
then you don't get out of the house much.

1338
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,128
A lot of girls.

1339
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:46,505
A lot.

1340
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,840
Good-looking guy, well-spoken.

1341
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,760
It's "pinch me, I'm dreaming time," am I right, ladies?

1342
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,764
And look at Sue. Gorgeous lady, easy to be around.

1343
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,933
Always into the aerobics.

1344
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,102
Kept it tight, in a great way.

1345
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,106
And Burt did well, they have
a pool. Pool guy come over.

1346
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,316
Lot of guys would come over to
the house. Young guys, too.

1347
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,943
Now let's say something did happen.

1348
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,486
We don't know that it did, maybe it didn't.

1349
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,279
But it's not up to us to know, it's up to them to know.

1350
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,656
I bet they were honest with each other.

1351
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,783
I bet she came to him and said, "Hey, Burt,

1352
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:15,951
"you know you're my number one.

1353
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,496
"But maybe Mama got thirsty last night."

1354
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:25,085
What I'm going to focus on, though,
here is the ingredient

1355
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,256
that I think really makes the whole stew
stick together, and that is honesty.

1356
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,050
And similar interests!

1357
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,802
Who are you?

1358
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,054
I'm Cousin Betty.

1359
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:37,556
First?

1360
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,349
Second.

1361
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,228
Okay, Cousin Betty, this is not a group toast

1362
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,688
nor is it an open forum.

1363
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,022
I'm the one who's standing up here.

1364
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,108
I'm the one with the glass, I'm the one that is talking.

1365
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,609
Now, Burt and Sue chime in

1366
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,946
and that's fine because it's their night,
you know, 40 years and all of that.

1367
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,072
But not you.

1368
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,325
Nobody gave you a speaking part, nobody cares.

1369
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,997
You're a second cousin, which isn't even a real relative

1370
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,082
because someone could have sex with a second cousin

1371
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,458
and the kid could still be normal.

1372
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,299
Honesty.

1373
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:16,094
You cannot run from it.

1374
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,555
And believe me,

1375
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,475
it'll find you.

1376
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,856
The truth will always find you.

1377
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,945
Burt and Sue.

1378
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,947
Forty years, being honest.

1379
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,908
Burt and Sue.

1380
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,451
Congratulations.

1381
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,038
Can I speak to you in the kitchen?

1382
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,873
I was just going to finish my... Please?

1383
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,042
Sure. Okay.

1384
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,058
I need to know what's going on.

1385
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,309
Nothing.

1386
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,311
I'm just toasting, and I'm passionate about honesty.

1387
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,147
I'm not talking about the inappropriate toast

1388
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,107
that you just gave at my parents' anniversary,

1389
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,317
or the bar fight,

1390
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,363
or the allergies that you caught from
street plants while chasing fat kids.

1391
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,697
I'm talking about

1392
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,575
what's going on in your head
that's causing these things.

1393
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,289
It's just some stuff that I have to fix.

1394
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,667
That's it, honey. And I can't bring you in on it

1395
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:32,295
because that would directly affect my ability to do that.

1396
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,047
To do what? To fix it!

1397
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,715
Fix it, fix it!

1398
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,592
I have to fix it on my own, honey.

1399
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:41,304
Okay, Ronny, you're not fixing anything

1400
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:42,931
and you're breaking more stuff.

1401
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,059
And it's enough!

1402
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,812
You just gave a whole speech about honesty,

1403
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,064
it's time for you to be honest with me!

1404
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,983
Is it? Yeah.

1405
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,526
Is it honest time now, between us?

1406
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,112
Then why don't you start, Beth?

1407
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,322
Why don't you tell me about the Kearny Group?

1408
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,743
How do you know about the Kearny Group?

1409
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,328
Are you going to Las Vegas?

1410
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,372
Are you planning on leaving me?

1411
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,667
God, Ronny, no! No!

1412
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:17,924
They asked me to open up a restaurant
in City Center, and I said no.

1413
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,551
Why?

1414
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,263
Because that would mean I'd have to go live

1415
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,265
in Las Vegas for a couple of years.

1416
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,600
And...

1417
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,813
And what, Beth?

1418
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,737
And I don't trust you in Las Vegas.

1419
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,197
Okay.

1420
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,035
Ronny...

1421
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,287
Look at you.

1422
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:49,748
Your sponsor called me.

1423
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,750
You haven't been going to your meetings,

1424
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,794
you're walking around with large amounts of cash,

1425
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:58,381
and it just really feels like two years ago.

1426
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,008
You know, I...

1427
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,803
I can't get into this with you right now.

1428
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:07,599
If you don't let me in, how do I know what to do?

1429
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,975
How can I help you?

1430
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,603
I think it's best if I go.

1431
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,105
I don't want you to go.

1432
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,198
I'm going to go sleep at the office tonight.

1433
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,825
You want to do this?

1434
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,897
What are you doing?

1435
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,857
Watching you sleep.

1436
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,901
It's creepy, right?

1437
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,029
Felix, go play with the hot tub and
the ladies on the line, honestly.

1438
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:05,573
I'm just getting up, it's too much. You're too much.

1439
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,284
Please, give me a minute, I don't know where I'm at.

1440
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,882
Oh, God. Hey, man. What's going on?

1441
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,217
Come on in the house.

1442
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,343
What, are you going to shoot me right here

1443
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,469
on your porch in broad daylight?

1444
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:27,679
Are you out of your mind?

1445
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,222
No, not if you're in the house.

1446
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:30,932
I've googled this.

1447
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,977
Do you want to know how it works? Yeah?

1448
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,104
You come inside and I defend myself.

1449
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,064
Now, I'm not going to pump six bullets into you.

1450
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:41,151
No, that would make me look crazy and out of control.

1451
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:44,779
No, I'm going to pump three into you
like a calm gun-owner would.

1452
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:48,074
Zip, I came here with the intent, and only the intent,

1453
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,659
of getting my camera back.

1454
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:53,246
Oh, yeah. Your camera?

1455
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,082
Come on inside.

1456
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:58,126
If you just want your camera, it's right here.

1457
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,294
Listen to me.

1458
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,962
I can really appreciate the fact that things got

1459
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,797
completely nuts the other night.

1460
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:05,467
And I can also appreciate that a lot of your property...

1461
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,428
I appreciate the fact that a lot of your
property got damaged as well.

1462
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,598
You killed my fish.

1463
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,808
You killed my fish, man. I know.

1464
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,143
Why would you do that?

1465
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,978
Maybe you should be compensated for that.

1466
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,605
You should be compensated for that.

1467
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:21,149
I can't put a price on that, because that's a friend.

1468
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,359
Although you can't pet it, but what would the fish do?

1469
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:25,028
The fish doesn't want this, man.

1470
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,490
I think what the fish is saying is maybe
I should get my camera back.

1471
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,784
And maybe, just maybe, and I'm
just hoping against hope here,

1472
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,078
maybe we can put this whole thing behind us.

1473
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,039
$10,000.

1474
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,875
$500.

1475
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,502
$5,000.

1476
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,421
I have a thousand. I'll give you the thousand.

1477
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,882
And an apology.

1478
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:50,303
Zip, if I apologize to you when you
have a gun pointed at my throat,

1479
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,764
then I don't think it really counts.

1480
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,308
That's a good point.

1481
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,521
I'm sorry for what happened.

1482
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:00,897
I need to feel it.

1483
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:06,361
I just need it to really come from right there.

1484
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,696
Look, man, I'm sorry, all right?

1485
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,032
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1486
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:15,828
I'm really, really sorry that we're
standing here in this situation.

1487
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:18,456
I'm sorry.

1488
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:27,549
Okay.

1489
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,401
...seven, eight, nine, 10.

1490
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:50,363
And the $400 I owe for the old person's home. Perfect.

1491
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,704
You did this to me.

1492
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,997
You know that.

1493
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,458
I don't mess with firearms. I don't do that.

1494
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,169
I don't do that. Look, I'm a sensitive guy.

1495
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:07,338
You know what I'm saying to you?

1496
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,340
Okay.

1497
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,345
Thank you.

1498
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,643
Drive safe.

1499
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,828
Who the hell are you?

1500
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,502
You got no choice now.

1501
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,005
You got to go right up to him and just say it to him.

1502
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,341
It's not that complicated of a thing to do. It's easy.

1503
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:54,802
You got the pictures, she can't bullshit
you, and that's the end of it.

1504
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,181
Come here. Get in here, I love you.

1505
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,475
Stop it, you will find somebody else.

1506
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,435
You're a great guy, and I love you.

1507
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,354
Just keep walking.

1508
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:29,420
Ronny.

1509
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,382
Hey.

1510
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,683
We were just about to call you, actually.

1511
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,352
We were hoping to be a little
better prepared, but I guess

1512
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,687
we can start?

1513
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,689
Ronny, why don't you come join us?

1514
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:48,773
Who are you?

1515
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,400
My name is Dr. Rosenstone.

1516
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,903
Your family and friends are here
because they love you, Ronald.

1517
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,989
And they can't stand to see you
destroy yourself anymore.

1518
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,533
What is this, an intervention?

1519
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,784
Yes!

1520
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,245
We don't see the need for labels.

1521
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:05,206
This is just a bunch of friends talking to one friend

1522
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,708
and letting them know they love them.

1523
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:07,834
An intervention.

1524
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,253
Your sister and her husband would like to start.

1525
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,548
I tormented you, I know.

1526
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,007
Diane, please don't do this.

1527
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,718
I dressed you up like a little girl,

1528
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,469
but I'm here to support you.

1529
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,221
Ronny, I am!

1530
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,640
Okay, okay. It's not what you think.

1531
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,061
I don't know
how the hell you found out,

1532
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,313
but I'll kill you if you ever do that to me again.

1533
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,398
Okay.

1534
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:33,735
Why don't we all come in and sit down?

1535
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,861
Come on.

1536
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,070
Let Ronny sit down.

1537
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,700
We got a big blue chair waiting for Ronny.

1538
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,244
Come on, sweetheart, sit down. It'll be okay.

1539
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:46,330
Well, it's no coincidence

1540
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:50,042
that we find ourselves here in
a gentle circle of support.

1541
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,252
Hey.

1542
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,255
Oh, shit, am I late?

1543
01:24:56,133 --> 01:25:00,094
I'm sorry. I know it's probably really bad
form to be late to an intervention.

1544
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:01,137
Hi, I'm Beth.

1545
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,764
Hi, Beth. What's going on?

1546
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,931
Hey, big guy.

1547
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,349
Who the hell invited him?

1548
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,059
You know what? I invited him.

1549
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:08,561
You did? You invited him?

1550
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,939
Yeah. You know what? I followed
you to his place earlier today.

1551
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:15,943
I saw you pay him.

1552
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,863
And after you left, I went up and talked
to him.

1553
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,031
It says right here,

1554
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:25,453
"If possible, it's best to have all enablers present,

1555
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,246
"even bookies."

1556
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:31,250
So I agreed to pay your debt if he agreed
to come here tonight, and he did.

1557
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,460
Thanks, man. I appreciate this.

1558
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,045
It was really nice of you. No problem.

1559
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,546
You got to be kidding me.

1560
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,048
He's not my bookie, Nick.

1561
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,716
Oh, come on, Ronny.

1562
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,011
Admit it, man. You bet on everything.

1563
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:45,765
How dare you show up here! You
have no right being here!

1564
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:48,434
He's a scumbag, an enabler, a mistake!

1565
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:50,478
Stop it! I asked him to come here!

1566
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,938
Come on, don't kill the messenger.

1567
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:53,272
I'm just here to help. I'm helping.

1568
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:55,107
Okay? That's what I'm doing.

1569
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:58,277
Look, he bets on the Bulls, and the Sox,

1570
01:25:58,362 --> 01:25:59,445
the Cubs.

1571
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,322
He bet on the Hawaii game.

1572
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,157
Only degenerates bet on the Hawaii game.

1573
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,617
I don't want that for you, man.

1574
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,204
I should have done this a long time ago.

1575
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,418
I think you need to take a look at this.

1576
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,055
What is... You got to look, there's more pictures.

1577
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,849
You got to flip through that one,
get to the other pictures.

1578
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,016
I did. I'm flipping right now.

1579
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,643
I keep flipping, and it keeps going back to the same pic

1580
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,687
because there's only one picture in the catalogue.

1581
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,988
You can't take a picture of something
that didn't happen, Ronald.

1582
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,073
Ronny!

1583
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,199
Not again.

1584
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,617
Ronny, calm down!

1585
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,035
Stop it! You're going to kill him!

1586
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,161
You're going to kill your bookie!

1587
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,580
He's not my damn bookie!

1588
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,081
There's something wrong with you!

1589
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:53,207
You son of a bitch!

1590
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,584
What is wrong with you?

1591
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:57,044
You're completely out of control!

1592
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,546
You're crazy!

1593
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,631
You're completely out of your mind!

1594
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:04,510
Don't get me wrong, I'd like to party
with you and get high with you,

1595
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:05,928
but you're insane!

1596
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:13,519
I think we're missing the point of this gathering.

1597
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,938
It's about talking and sharing our concerns.

1598
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,273
This is ridiculous.

1599
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:19,400
Then let me go, okay? Because
I have something to say.

1600
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,360
Take a seat. Please, everybody, sit.

1601
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:22,820
Beth, please. Just sit down.

1602
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,614
Look, here's the thing...

1603
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,032
Please, just let me... Please, okay?

1604
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,117
All right.

1605
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,619
Ah, man, that was...

1606
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,372
All right, I got something to say.

1607
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:37,793
This is important to me, so...

1608
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:39,086
Okay, Nick...

1609
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,839
All right, please. Please?

1610
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:47,637
I didn't have many friends when I got to Ball State.

1611
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:50,473
I was shy and...

1612
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,852
You already know this.

1613
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:01,025
But, Ronny, what you don't know is

1614
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:05,780
when you moved in across the
hall, in second semester,

1615
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,074
I made it a goal of mine

1616
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,160
to become friends with you.

1617
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,330
I mean, you were funny and charming,

1618
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,540
and everybody liked him, everybody.

1619
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,502
Okay, Nick, enough.

1620
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,963
You got to let me talk here for a second.

1621
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,257
I want you to listen to me.

1622
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:27,969
Nick, you're my best friend.

1623
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,763
You always make me do better.

1624
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:34,517
You always make sure I don't screw up.

1625
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:39,438
And you make it that I never forget
what really matters in life.

1626
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,858
When I had my relapse two years ago,

1627
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:47,279
it wasn't all the money and stuff that
I lost that made me feel bad.

1628
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,824
It was the fact that I let you down.

1629
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,283
This is good.

1630
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,660
This is catharsis.

1631
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,953
I know.

1632
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:57,164
You know I never had a brother growing up, right?

1633
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,548
And my dad wasn't around very much.

1634
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:10,386
And all my friends growing up were, really, criminals.

1635
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,974
So when I met you in school, I was...

1636
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:20,896
Let's just say that I looked up
to you as well, in college.

1637
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:27,111
And I really have looked up to you ever since.

1638
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,697
So, there's something that you should know.

1639
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,158
There's something that I already
should have told you, Nick.

1640
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,326
What is it?

1641
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,412
Geneva's been running on you

1642
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,539
with the guy that you thought was my bookie.

1643
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,167
Jesus Christ, Ronny!

1644
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,252
You thought that you saw an exchange, right?

1645
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,712
That it was a gambling exchange,

1646
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:45,880
but it wasn't a gambling exchange.

1647
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,798
Really, I was just going to get my camera,

1648
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,341
because there were pictures and stuff on it.

1649
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,927
The truth is, I'm not gambling.

1650
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,846
I haven't been doing any gambling at all.

1651
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,556
What's been going on with me is

1652
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,351
I've really been trying to figure out
what's the best way to tell you

1653
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,312
and how to handle this thing.

1654
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,397
Is this true?

1655
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:05,775
No! It's not true.

1656
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:06,942
He's lying!

1657
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,861
He's compulsive, he's a gambler.

1658
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,155
He'll say anything, he's desperate!

1659
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,615
Go ahead, Geneva, tell him the truth.

1660
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,075
Everyone is sitting here, listening.

1661
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,951
Okay, fine, fine!

1662
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:17,661
Uh...

1663
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,830
The thing is, that...

1664
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,048
Okay, fine.

1665
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:34,929
What did you expect?

1666
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,389
You were getting happy endings in Pilsen.

1667
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:38,474
Jeez!

1668
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,311
No! No, Nick, listen.

1669
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,147
You left me alone. I wanted to be with you, but...

1670
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:46,440
Can we not get into this right now?

1671
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:47,775
No, but that's the problem!

1672
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,277
You never want to talk about anything, ever!

1673
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:54,573
I know that it's been tough with us for a while now,

1674
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,784
and I take my part in that.

1675
01:30:56,868 --> 01:31:00,913
But isn't there something about us you still believe in?

1676
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,502
How long did you know?

1677
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:09,922
I've known for a few days, a week. For way too long.

1678
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,842
I don't know what to say. I don't even
know what I'm feeling right now.

1679
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,469
Honestly, I don't know!

1680
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:17,930
I do know this, you should have
told me sooner, Ronny.

1681
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,473
Before right now.

1682
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:22,935
Before standing here in front of your friends
and your family, and Doctor...

1683
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:26,147
Rose... I know it starts
with "Rose." Rosenstone.

1684
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:27,940
...stone. Buddy, I know.

1685
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,109
I'm really sorry. I tried to tell you in the office.

1686
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,986
What do you mean trying? Trying is not telling, Ronny!

1687
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:35,739
Come on. Look, I can appreciate

1688
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:39,160
how hard this must have been on you, I know.

1689
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,871
I'm just really glad that you say that
you can appreciate how hard it was

1690
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,247
because you don't even know.

1691
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,583
I've been fighting with these people,

1692
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,585
trying to keep everything straight in my head.

1693
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:48,669
I get it.

1694
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:50,921
But in the nature of what's going on here,

1695
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:54,592
there's one more small thing that I
just want to bring closure to now

1696
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,178
in the circle of gentleness.

1697
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,846
Ronny, you don't have to.

1698
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:01,640
Yes, I do, Geneva.

1699
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,726
Because Nick is my best friend.

1700
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:06,312
And this is what best friends do.

1701
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,148
They tell the truth to each other.

1702
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:14,695
Okay. When we were in college,

1703
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,364
and this is way before you guys ever met,

1704
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,034
there was a night that didn't mean anything.
It was a meaningless night.

1705
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:21,452
It was a booze night.

1706
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,704
It was big, big bar night.

1707
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,206
Ronny, get to the point.

1708
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,499
The point is, way before you guys ever met,

1709
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,418
before you ever even knew each other,

1710
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:30,794
I kind of slept with Geneva.

1711
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:31,921
You what?

1712
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,756
This is what friends do, they tell the truth.

1713
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,592
I'm a friend and I'm telling the
truth, buddy. Here I am.

1714
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,344
He wanted to tell you, Nick.

1715
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:40,012
But I was falling in love with you.

1716
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:41,513
We didn't want to hurt you.

1717
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,474
You asshole! Hold on, hold on.

1718
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,100
I'm telling the truth, I'm in a circle.

1719
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,228
No, you know what? You're the worst.

1720
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,980
Buddy, I'm sorry, okay? Listen...

1721
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,732
Get your hands off me. Don't touch me!

1722
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,651
Let me tell you something.

1723
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,694
That's probably the most honest
thing you've ever said to me.

1724
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,112
Nick... You're sorry.

1725
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:58,572
You're so sorry.

1726
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:02,868
Nick.

1727
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,581
I'm sorry, Ronny.

1728
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,875
I'm sorry.

1729
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,337
I should never have put you in that position.

1730
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,425
Beth, I am so sorry that I caused
tension between you two.

1731
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,470
I'm sorry.

1732
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,436
This has been a marvelous first step.

1733
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:30,813
I'm sorry?

1734
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:34,233
This has been a revelation for you, I can tell.

1735
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:39,280
I'm okay, buddy. Thank you.
You've done a lot here today.

1736
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:25,534
I didn't gamble.

1737
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:31,540
I walked by the casino once or
twice, but I didn't gamble.

1738
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,797
Are you okay?

1739
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,218
It's been a long day.

1740
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,933
I didn't know if you had eaten or not, so,

1741
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,936
if you're hungry...

1742
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:14,291
I don't know how to start this.

1743
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,129
I got scared.

1744
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:22,508
And I'm sorry,

1745
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:25,969
because I didn't feel safe.

1746
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:29,556
So then, I didn't tell you about Las
Vegas and the Kearny Group.

1747
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:32,726
And then, here I am, being someone
that I don't want to be.

1748
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:37,564
I mean, I staged this whole
ridiculous intervention thing

1749
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,651
and you weren't even gambling!

1750
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,029
And that's great, by the way.

1751
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:47,533
I'm so happy that you weren't gambling.

1752
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:50,869
But this is no good.

1753
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:53,247
It's not healthy.

1754
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,875
The problem is, if you don't share stuff with me,

1755
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,587
like the fact that you were with Geneva,
it keeps me in the dark.

1756
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,923
And that belittles us.

1757
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:06,343
I want us to be more than that.

1758
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,387
I understand.

1759
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:14,268
I just didn't feel right in saying something to you

1760
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:15,769
if I wasn't saying it to Nick.

1761
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:18,689
And then, when I found out

1762
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,941
about the Vegas deal

1763
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,152
and that you didn't trust me enough
to share that with me,

1764
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:25,487
then that really hurt.

1765
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:29,199
But I guess I've earned that.

1766
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,204
And it's up to me to un-earn that.

1767
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:38,542
I don't ever want to put you through
anything like this ever again.

1768
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:42,713
Because honestly, honey, I do love you.

1769
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,174
I love you, too.

1770
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:51,930
And...

1771
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,933
I understand.

1772
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:04,359
You've got a Chrysler meeting tomorrow, don't you?

1773
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,987
I don't even know if Nick is going to show up.

1774
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:10,073
You weren't a terrible friend, Ronny.

1775
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,576
I mean, you sucked at the way you handled things,

1776
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,166
but you cared.

1777
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:47,361
Yes.

1778
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,230
Ronny Valentine,

1779
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:25,649
the other half of the team.

1780
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,652
I'll let the gang know, tell them you're both here.

1781
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,445
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1782
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,359
How are you doing?

1783
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,157
Well, I moved out.

1784
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,119
How are you feeling?

1785
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,664
Shaky

1786
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:25,500
on how everything went down.

1787
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,670
The truth is, I was just

1788
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,965
hanging on to something that wasn't there.

1789
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:36,345
It wasn't fair to her.

1790
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:38,221
I'm sorry, buddy.

1791
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,558
I'm sorry you're going through this, Nick.

1792
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:46,396
Listen, I feel terrible about the whole situation.

1793
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:51,652
And I've been sick to my stomach
for the last 24 hours, man.

1794
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:59,743
I've been doing a lot of soul-searching
and thinking about

1795
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,496
what friendship really means.

1796
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,081
And the thing of it is...

1797
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,547
There it is.

1798
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,634
Okay, good. That's good.

1799
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,929
Nick, I feel terrible about this whole thing, all right?

1800
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:20,430
And if that makes you feel better,

1801
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:23,058
for me, honestly, I just want
to get past this thing, okay?

1802
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:24,601
So, if you want to hit me again...

1803
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:26,061
Ow!

1804
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:30,691
Oh, my God.

1805
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:35,445
Is everything all right?

1806
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:37,489
Great.

1807
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:39,908
We're ready for you.

1808
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:43,412
We'll be just one sec. We're ready, we'll come right in.

1809
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,664
Well, we'll be in the presentation area.

1810
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:47,290
I know where it is, I'll be right there.

1811
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,500
Good grief.

1812
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,128
We're really looking forward to this opportunity.

1813
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,135
You handled this whole thing like shit.

1814
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,804
I'm sorry, Nick.

1815
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:02,973
I really am.

1816
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:05,225
I know I didn't date a lot,

1817
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,769
so when Geneva and I were serious,

1818
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,688
you didn't want to hurt me,

1819
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,232
and it was before we ever got together.

1820
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,900
Now I'm not saying it was easy,

1821
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,694
the spot you were in, because it wasn't.

1822
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,697
But in the future,

1823
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:22,951
no matter how uncomfortable things are,

1824
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:25,245
if it affects us,

1825
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,456
you got to tell me.

1826
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,790
Do you got it?

1827
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,460
I promise you, Nick.

1828
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:33,712
I got it.

1829
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,179
Okay.

1830
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,433
All right, there you go.

1831
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,560
I'm good.

1832
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,616
Excuse me, Mr. Valentine,

1833
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,285
given what we just saw in the waiting
room, I think we need to...

1834
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,371
Oh, that? We're like kids in a
car too long on a road trip.

1835
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,166
We're fine, we're just working.

1836
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:23,136
The moment of truth

1837
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:24,888
has finally arrived.

1838
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:30,769
Now I know that the journey getting
here has had some turbulence

1839
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:33,688
and some confusion.

1840
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,607
But I ask you for one second,

1841
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:40,612
when folks were reaching for greatness,
was that not the case?

1842
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:43,490
I remember a group of people
who wanted to head west

1843
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:48,036
with dreams of gold and opportunity.

1844
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,204
The Donner Party.

1845
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,122
The Donner Pass.

1846
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:55,418
Things got a little weird out on the trail, didn't it?

1847
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:59,798
Some cannibalism, folks got hungry.

1848
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,551
Some feelings hurt, some families destroyed,

1849
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:03,969
but some people made it out west.

1850
01:43:04,053 --> 01:43:05,303
Not all of them.

1851
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:07,931
And it's not that they necessarily got rich.

1852
01:43:09,976 --> 01:43:11,726
But the point is,

1853
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:14,479
we've headed out west, and this is our destination.

1854
01:43:14,981 --> 01:43:16,022
Nick,

1855
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,441
start your engine.

1856
01:43:46,262 --> 01:43:47,762
You son of a bitch.

1857
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,200
I told you the difference was Nick Brannen,

1858
01:44:09,285 --> 01:44:11,745
and we have Nick Brannen.

1859
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:13,413
Simply the best.

1860
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:14,748
You can feel it.

1861
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:17,167
Better than all the rest.

1862
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:21,463
You were right about these lunatics, Susan.

1863
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:24,132
Commit to the long-term deal and cut them a check.

1864
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,217
And that's why I love you guys!

1865
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,636
That's why I love you!

1866
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,263
That's why my lady wood is still strong!

1867
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:32,098
See, I get it. They don't get it.

1868
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,558
They don't get it, but I do.

1869
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:36,436
See, all that fighting and shit, that's just passion!

1870
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,396
When you work that close, you just want to choke

1871
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:39,981
the hell out of somebody, right?

1872
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:41,399
Yeah. See, I understand that.

1873
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:42,984
I relate. But, listen.

1874
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,653
That motor...

1875
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:46,613
That motor in that car...

1876
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:49,699
I mean, when it started vibrating... I'm sorry?

1877
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,910
If I was sitting on the hood of that car... Okay.

1878
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:53,745
...and the way it was just vibrating...

1879
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:56,581
I understand, and I got to be really honest with you.

1880
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,084
When I first met you, your phraseology
with "lady wood,"

1881
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:01,670
I didn't know whether you were coming or going.

1882
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,714
But I've really grown to love you.

1883
01:45:13,015 --> 01:45:14,724
Yes! Yes! Come on! Come on!

1884
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,102
Damn it!

1885
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,480
He can do this, he just has to stay calm.

1886
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:23,483
Nick Brannen, that was your second shot.

1887
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,444
But if you score on your third and final attempt,

1888
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,446
you can still win a trip for two

1889
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:30,991
to the NHL All-Star Game in Carolina.

1890
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,034
Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

1891
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,202
Okay, good luck.

1892
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,121
Dude, seats are taken.

1893
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:37,247
It's between periods.

1894
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,373
I've got food here!

1895
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:39,791
What are you, a hall monitor?

1896
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:41,793
I'm not touching your food! I know the guy!

1897
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:47,924
Nick!

1898
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:53,763
Great moments are born from great opportunities.

1899
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:58,268
That's what you have here tonight, Nick.

1900
01:45:58,436 --> 01:46:01,771
That's what you've earned here tonight!

1901
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:04,983
One shot.

1902
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:08,236
You take it 10 times, you might miss nine.

1903
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,197
But not this shot, Nick.

1904
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:13,616
Not tonight.

1905
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,754
Come on, big guy. Come on, baby.

1906
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:43,897
Yes!

1907
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:46,024
Whoo-hoo!

1908
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:48,568
Congratulations to Nick Brannen

1909
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:51,571
who's won a trip for two to the NHL All-Star Game

1910
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,323
in Carolina.

1911
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,785
Yes, you did! Yes, you did!

1912
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:58,328
Yeah!

1913
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:01,289
They can never take it away from you!

1914
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:09,589
Ronny!

1915
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:32,529
Yes, buddy! Yeah, Ronny!

1916
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,699
I knew you'd do it! I told you I would do it!
